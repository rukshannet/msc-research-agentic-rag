        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized during an interview organized by Harvard University on the 24th, through Zoom technology, that Sri Lankas access to the growing Indian and African markets should not be disrupted by any big power rivalry or conflict, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The President also highlighted the rising competition between China and the Quad, which has been further aggravated by the newly formed Aukus pact between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, he stated that Sri Lanka supports ASEANs vision of the Indo-Pacific region and is committed to ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and the security of undersea cables, as it is essential for the future of the country. He said that Sri Lanka aims to achieve a significant development goal in the next 25 years by working alongside other countries in the Indian Ocean and South Asia. The governments 25-year new reformist program will drive the country towards this objective, and the President has invited the entire Sri Lankan youth community, including those living in the diaspora, to actively participate in building a developed Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe also stated that Sri Lanka plans to become an upper-middle-income country by 2048, which marks the 100th anniversary of independence from colonial rule, and achieving this goal depends on the countrys commitment to economic reforms. The President said that as a small country with a strong democratic tradition and an open economy, Sri Lanka has always maintained its political independence and viewed India, its closest neighbor with the longest relations, as the protector of the region. The President also highlighted Sri Lankas role in building a new economy by collaborating with the development of the Asian region and India, moving away from the old economy. He suggested that the free trade agreement with India should be elevated to an economic cooperation and technical agreement and expressed his willingness to enter into an agreement with the largest trade group in Asia, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which would allow Sri Lanka to continue trading with the largest trade group in the world. In his discussion on proposed social, economic, and political reforms to create a prosperous and productive Sri Lanka in the next 25 years, the President emphasized the need for equal opportunities and resources to be provided to all ethnic groups, leading to inter-ethnic discussions and mutual understanding to find solutions to the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka. He also stressed that national unity can be strengthened by embracing and celebrating diversity among people. Following is the full interview of President Ranil Wickremesinghe; Interviewer Good morning. My name is Fatima Sumar, and Im the Executive Director of the Center for International Development (CID) here at Harvard University. On behalf of CID and the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute at Harvard University, I want to welcome you to todays conversation with President Ranil Wickremesinghe live from Sri Lanka. Mr. President, thank you for being here with us. The Mittal Institute engages in interdisciplinary research to advance and deepen the understanding of critical issues in South Asia and its relationship with the world. The Center for International Development works across Harvard University and a global network of researchers and practitioners to build, convene and deploy talent to address the worlds pressing challenges. Todays event originated from a discussion with Harvard students and alumni. As research centers at Harvard who work on complex and difficult issues, we believe robust dialog is critical to understanding all nuances of the current situation in Sri Lanka. We want to acknowledge that people have strong views, emotions and feelings about what is happening in Sri Lanka and of todays event itself. And what has happened in the country during and after the Civil War is deeply personal to many Sri Lankans, including those who are part of our Harvard community. Harvard University is committed to open debate and discussion, which are essential to improving public policy and public policy leadership. Harvard acknowledges the rights of our community members to nondisruptive protests and to express dissent as well as the right to access and participate in discussions and events without impediment. We also acknowledge that speakers should have the chance to present their views and to be heard by those who wish to hear them. We expect speakers to take questions from the audience. And thank you for helping us follow decorum to have the most constructive dialog today. Sri Lanka is at a pivotal moment in its history. The island nation is facing its worst ever economic crisis since it gained independence in 1948. Since 2019, Sri Lankans have faced significant shortages of food, medicine and fuel, as well as skyrocketing inflation. The economic crisis is estimated to double the poverty rate between 2021 and 2022, increasing the number of poor people by 2.7 million. The news this week of the International Monetary Fund deal raises both hope and questions on the economic trajectory of the country and the reforms ahead. Tough issues remain to be resolved on democratic governance, reconciliation, the postponement of local elections, and the right to peaceful protest among several civil liberties and human rights. Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the president of Sri Lanka on the 21st of July 2022. He has been the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka on six occasions. He is the leader of the United National Party, Sri Lankas oldest political party founded in 1946, and he has served in all parliaments since 1977. President Wickremesinghe was elected president by parliamentary vote after the Peoples Movement Aragalaya or struggle toppled the serving president. Since taking office last year, he has voiced his commitment to restoring economic and political stability to his country. The future of Sri Lanka has important implications, not only for the region but globally as well. In the United States, we are commemorating the 75th anniversary of bilateral relations this year. Todays run of show will include a 15 minute address from the president, followed by a discussion with our moderators. Professors Tarun Khanna and Azam Khwaja are both distinguished economists and the respected heads of our centers. They will come to the stage at the 15 minute mark to lead a moderated discussion. Following this dialog and in keeping with Harvard tradition, the President will then welcome questions from the audience. Mr. President, thank you for joining us here at Harvard today for this important dialog. Let me also acknowledge in our audience the presence of Mahinda Samarasinghe, Sri Lankas Ambassador to the United States. Mr. President, the floor is yours. Thank you. Presidents opening speech Thank you. Distinguished guests and friends. First, I must thank Professor Tarun Khanna and Professor Azam Khwaja for inviting me to join this conversation with you researchers, on Sri Lanka and whats happening. As you pointed out, the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute has certainly brought South Asia into focus, ably assisted by your Center for International Development. To save time, lets start at what happened at the time I took over as president. I became the president of the country amidst the worst economic and political crisis in the 200 years of its modernity. As you said, poverty had doubled to 25 of the population, while 500,000, lost their jobs, the nations revenue as a percentage of the GDP fell from 12.5 in 2018 to 8.2 in 2022. It was insufficient to meet the vital needs of debt servicing, salaries and social protection. The public debt increased to 11 of the GDP. As Sri Lanka moved towards the abyss of economic obliteration, chaos erupted. My predecessor was forced to leave the country and resign. The Presidents House the Presidents Office, the official residence of the Prime Minister, the Prime Ministers office, were all occupied by protesters. My private residence and library was set on fire. Attempt to occupy Parliament and force the Members of Parliament out were prevented by the timely arrival of the army. When I took over, our foreign reserves were down. There was no money in the Treasury. I used to get up every morning going to office and meet with the officials to see where we could find an extra Rs. 100 million, an extra Rs. 200 million. The foreign reserves were such, where there were few days in which we had no foreign reserves. I had 2,000 at home. For once in my life, I was richer than the State. So my first task therefore, was to arrive at a Staff Level Agreement with the IMF. It required price adjustments, a difficult decision to make, but there were no options. Then came the IMF Extended Fund Facility arrangement approved by the IMF board on 20th March. Its broadly a four year program of fiscal consolidation from 2023 to 2026. It will also address the twin imbalances of Sri Lankas economy, the fiscal deficit and the balance of payments deficit. We agreed on an ambitious program to restore macroeconomic stability and debt restructuring, to achieve economic sustainability. The program will raise Sri Lankas revenue to 15 of the GDP by 2026, improve debt management and control public expenditure. This will make available much needed financial resources for education and healthcare, as well as allowing the expansion of the social safety net and the restoration of price stability. More than the 3 billion that we received from the facility, the value of IMF support is far greater. The credibility that is attached to the IMF program helps unlock the sources of financing from development partners and the global market in general. Such financing is essential to build Sri Lankas foreign reserve. Restoring external financing of our budget will also reduce the need for monetary financing by the Central Bank. Alongside negotiating for the IMF facility, Sri Lanka has embarked on an effort to restructure its debt. Precise negotiations with creditors on the modalities of restructuring debt will commence now. In reorganizing debt, Sri Lanka will ensure that the stability and integrity of its financial system remain robust and unhindered. All these measures will stabilize the economy by 2026 at the latest. However, this alone is not sufficient. High growth has eluded Sri Lanka in the last few decades. Unlike the Southeastern nations, we have not been able to seize the opportunity and possibilities arising from the fast changing global economic situation. This program, then, is the defining moment. The current structural reform will release Sri Lankas growth potential by enhancing competition, promoting trade liberalization, remove impediments to private investment and implementing climate change programs to put us on a high growth trajectory. It is my belief that the success and the sustainability of this reform will depend on a new political framework which addresses the requirement of the commitment to reconciliation among the major ethnic groups in the country, leading to a truly collective Sri Lankan identity. Politically settling the bristling issues pertaining to the ethnic groups in the country, is a sine qua non for sustainable and lasting development. I have been talking with the Tamil Members of Parliament, both in the government and the opposition, to tackle the unresolved issues regarding national reconciliation. The expedition of tracing Tamils missing in action. This is an urgent measure. The issue of Tamil prisoners who were involved in terrorist activities, the release regarding them, operationalizing the National Land Commission under the Constitution, return of the land in the North and East, settling the related issue of the devolution of political power and the implementation of the Presidential Commission report on the violation of human rights, to name a few. In addition, legislation is being prepared for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission alongside a new law to replace the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act. I will be continuing discussions, this time not only with the Tamil Members of Parliament, but also with other Tamil groups, including the diaspora, and we are setting up a separate Diaspora Office to liaise with the Tamil Diaspora community. We want everyone to be involved in this effort to the commitment to equity, equality, inclusivity, diversity and the genuine empowerment of women. Sri Lanka is in the process fulfilling its long overdue commitment to the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women by drafting pieces of legislation, the Gender Equality Act, the Womens Empowerment Act and the National Commission on Women Act. The Cabinet had already approved the National Policy on Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment, as well as the Womens Peace and Security Action Plan. Third, the youth representation and the Youth Parliament. The youth have been calling for a genuine, system change. I will be appointing a presidential commission on political parties. We have already made provision for youth representation on the oversight committees of Parliament. Fourthly, responding to the challenge of climate change and bringing in the climate change legislation and Living Entities Act two take in five areas of Sri Lanka. The protection of the famous Muthurajawela swamp land, and of course, the establishment of a climate change university, the first of its kind to serve the whole Indian Ocean region. And finally, addressing social issues, we are calling for a social contract among all different economic partners, workers, farmers, businessmen, so that we all benefit from the growth agenda. Its not a question of few benefiting and others losing out. Therell also be a social justice commission to inquire into areas which are called remedies by the state. Looking beyond the short- term debt restructuring strategy and imbalances, we need to take this crunch as an opportunity to transform the economy, to face the complex and multifaceted demands of the mid 21st century forged by mass globalization, massive digitalization, high tech, multicity of information, automation, impending artificial intelligence, climate change and ecological response unit. Fresh understanding of plurality, diversity, and inclusivity as well as the instabilities of the postmodern condition. This requires a new economic model founded on a highly competitive, export oriented economy and environment friendly green and blue economy and a digital economy. Professor Ricardo Hausmann, who is from Harvard, has already been doing work on the competitiveness of the Sri Lankan economy and will be carrying forward that work and I hope that he will be in Sri Lanka very soon. The restructuring and the regional Sri Lanka economy over the next 25 years is expected to bring about a high growth trajectory in the medium term and to meet the following long term goals economic growth of 7 to 8. This is possible. We had it once for a short period. Increase international trade by more than 100 of the GDP. Annual growth of USD 3 billion from new exports going up to the next ten years, and also for the next ten years, annually attracting 3 billion of investment. An internationally competitive workforce with market responsive skills, coming about in the next ten years, which will also require changes in our vocational and university education. And we will build on our natural advantages. Firstly, the modernization of agriculture and fisheries sector. Then to make Sri Lanka a regional logistics center, we will build up diversity in tourism. Not merely the traditional tourists who come in to Sri Lanka. We will explore Sri Lankas potential for green hydrogen and by digitalizing the economy and introducing automation; we aim to leapfrog into industry four for our manufacturing and services. Thats a ten year span, not a two year span. As I said before, the is an ambitious program for 25 years that will make Sri Lanka a high middle income country when it reaches its century of independence from colonial rule in 2048. This is not impossible. From 1977 in ten years, we carried out a massive land development and reservoir program, which originally was to take 30 years. Weve opened up in that period a number of free trade zones. We established a large number of factories for exports. It is a question of the will to repeat this by going in to further economic reforms. Then, if we are to do so, we also have to make use of our location in the region, our strategic location being an advantage; we also have to face two immediate problems. Firstly, the lack of economic integration in South Asia. Apart from a few lukewarm efforts, there has been no sincere political will to amalgamate the regions economies into a powerful trading bloc. And it is further complicated by the flagging India-Pakistan relations. To move forward then, Sri Lanka needs trade integration with many of its neighboring countries. Firstly, we will upgrade the free trade agreement with India to an economic cooperation and technical agreement. This is essential. India is going to be the next growth center and it will trigger off growth in South Asia. We are just 22 miles away and we have to work especially to ensure that the synergies of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu are brought together. Secondly, wed like to come to an agreement with the right to see the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Asias largest trade bloc. But that will bring us to make the largest trade bloc in the world. And finally, as we go along, we would also like to join the comprehensive progressive Trade Agreement. With this, Sri Lanka will be integrated with the three largest trade blocs, India, RCEP and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This exercise will also determine the level of competitiveness and thereby provide the vital push for growth. The other sticky issue that we need to make into account is the smoldering big power rivalry in the Indian Ocean. While our island has always maintained its political independence, India is regarded as the net security provider in the region and is Sri Lankas closest neighbour and the country which we have the longest ties with. Sri Lanka is also a member of the Belt and Road Initiative. However, the presence of the Chinese Sea Fleet ships and the formation of the Quad, the security dialog between Australia, India, Japan and US have complicated peace and security in the Indian Ocean. We have close ties with all the members of the Quad as well as China. The rising level of competition between China and the Quad has further been aggravated by the newly formed Aukus, the pact between Australia United States and United Kingdom. Sri Lanka, accepts the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific territories. We regard the Indo-Pacific as consisting of two distinct oceans. Our country is committed to the freedom of navigation and the security of undersea cables in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is essential for Sri Lankas future to ensure that the issues of the Asia Pacific, especially that of Taiwan, does not spill over into the Indian Ocean. Sri Lankas access to the growing Indian market as well as the opening of African markets cannot be disrupted and should not be disrupted by big power, rivalry or conflict. So this is a story of a country, a small country, but a country with a strong democratic tradition, with an open economy which has been nonaligned, of arising out of the ashes of its old economy, to build a new economy going hand-in-hand with the developments in the Asian region and India. So thats our future. It may be a difficult task, but it is not an impossible task. We have to apply ourselves and we are confident that with the rest of the Indian Ocean countries and South Asia, we will grow in the next 25 years. So I must thank you for having invited me and I hope that I kept the time limit and I was able to complete this before my 15 minutes was up. Interviewer Actually, its pretty impressive, you are as impressive as the last time I met you. Mr. President, thank you for commenting on your presidency and taking over the presidency and reminding the audience of the circumstances and the difficult time that Sri Lanka found itself in and finds itself in. And for also starting to paint a vision not just for the next few years, but also for all the way up to 2048, which would be the 100th anniversary of the modern Sri Lankan state. Mr. President, you were part of the past recent administration that some would say borrowed at relatively high rates for projects that sometimes the economists look at it and they wonder about the wisdom of some of the projects. The past administration also rushed through agricultural policy changes in ways that backfired. So all compromising your beautiful countrys ability to respond to the shocks that, of course, none of us could have foreseen caused by the tragedy in Ukraine having to do with food and fuel prices. Congratulations on the recent IMF deal. But Ill remind the audience that its your seventeenth deal with the IMF. And as you observed or hinted, it stabilizes things for now, but it doesnt buy enough in itself and position you for growth in the future. That requires many more very difficult changes. As the audience will recall, GDP last year contracted by 9. Most observers say that it will contract again by 6. Inflation has not budged in the last few months. Its still in excess of 50. I salute you for taking on this task. But why should your countrymen and countrywomen trust your stewardship in the years to come? President I was the only person who said that we still need the help of the IMF. I said that in 2020, told them to go to the IMF in 2021 and again, I pleaded with the then president, dont delay, Go to the IMF. That didnt happen. In 2002 when we had negative growth, as prime minister I ensured that I turned the economy around the next year. In 2015, when we came into power again, we had economic problems. But from 2016 to 2018, we were able to achieve the main goal of a surplus in the primary budget. Now, these are the achievements, and if we had kept on with that program, we certainly wouldnt have faced this problem at this time. So I think that people looked at me as being the only person who could resolve the issue. And I felt I had a duty to the country to come out at that time and take over this job. After all, the president offered it to the opposition. The opposition refused to take the job. There were no takers when I went in, and thats how I went ahead. And now that I have delivered the results, I think the people will come along with me. Interviewer Well, I hope the people support you in this. As you know, there are many tough decisions ahead. And Im just reflecting on several difficult circumstances that countries that are in the middle of IMF-supported recovery processes, and procedures often find themselves in. I assume youd have to do something about, for instance, your state-owned enterprises to make sure that they are operating at efficient levels. Usually, it goes hand in glove with more unemployment potentially, or having to redo something about the workforce. In your comments, you spoke about a need to develop human capital in the future. But the immediacy of change strikes me as being a very difficult pill for Sri Lankans already suffering, to swallow. How will you handle that in the immediate term? President The state enterprises are a problem. They are not efficient. And the money we spent in subsidizing some of them, like the Petroleum Corporation, the Electricity Board and our airlines, is more than the total sum we have spent on education and health in the corresponding period. So there are two issues we have. We are tackling one which is that the state will not subsidize state enterprises anymore. It will be left for the enterprises to ensure efficiency. Secondly, we are of the view that the state must get out of business. So, in many of them, we would like to call for bids to hand them over to the private sector. But the state will stay on in the financial sector. Outside that we are open. Interviewer I heard lots of things in your statement which were very encouraging about growth, about green growth, about getting the participation of other sectors, about inclusive growth, and all that. I didnt hear as much about social protection programs. Can you just walk us through how you were thinking, because behind a lot of the current crises and a lot of the resistance, a lot of the protests is this notion that the poor are being taken care of. What are the big social protection programs youre including? How do you think they will reach the poor? Do you have a sense of how they will be received by those who are expressing some of the concerns right now? President Well, firstly, we stepped into the rice market last year. There wasnt sufficient rice. And this year we said we will buy paddy at Rs100 a kg. Rice was selling at about Rs 80 to 85 below the cost of production. Today, Rice has been produced at about Rs 100 to 204 a kg. In addition, the government will supply 20 kilograms of rice free to 2.8 million families that are at the lowest end of the income groups. The social protection net is being restructured. We find that about 30 to 40 of the people on the social protection net system are not entitled to the awards. They are not entitled to receive these benefits, and there is a larger number who should be in it. So there is a reform of the society and the beneficiaries of the social protection net. Next one needs to ensure that we receive better results on the money we spend for education and for health. So this is what we are working on. We should ensure as far as we are concerned, we have the maximum benefit of every rupee we spend on health and we spend on education. Our focus at this moment is on these issues. We are talking with the banks of how we can help some of the small and medium industries that have got into financial difficulties and how we can revive employment for a large number of people who lost their jobs. It is not easy and we are living in a difficult time. I admit that. There are families which skip one meal. At least now they can have two meals. As the people who find it very difficult overnight when the dollar, the exchange rate for the dollar had gone up from 185 to 385. Everyone, all of us found life very difficult. And we have to ensure that the people who are the lowest income earners are protected. The rural areas seem to be picking up. But what concern me is the urban and the semi-urban areas, especially in the Western Province, where they have no chance of resorting to agriculture. Interviewer Mr. President, it was really nice to hear you reference our colleague Ricardo at the Kennedy School. And it suggests that you are open to receiving ideas from outside, and I made the comment about the targeting of the social programs which makes me think about my own country of India, where the targeting of social programs is improved dramatically in the last ten years because of the tech stack and the biometric identity. Just a note for the audience. I want to switch gears a little bit to our other big neighbor, China. My colleague Assam, who is from Pakistan originally, reminds us that Pakistan is engaged in a number of belt and road deals also that are very similar to the port deal that Sri Lanka signed sometime back when I was last in Colombo, I think it was in January of right before COVID hit. All my Sri Lankan classmates from this university who were in Colombo and former students were asking, why do the Chinese own the Port? What would you say to that? There are not that many container ships going through it right now either. President So whats the question you want me to answer? Interviewer Why do the Chinese own the port? President The Chinese dont own the port. We own the port, but we have given all the operations of the port to China Merchants. This is because we found that the Colombo Port Authority was unable to manage the port, and we were making big losses. There were no takers for the port, except China Merchant. Our other option was to close it. But the security of the port is controlled by the Government of Sri Lanka, the Southern Command of Sri Lankas Navy will be in Hambantota. A number of US and Japanese warships have visited the port. The port has no basic military value. The Chinese will not use it for military purposes. They cant. We have had regular consultations with the US in regard to this port as well as dealings with the Chinese. But looking at the arrangement at the ports that the Chinese are building in Africa and somewhere in the Bay of Bengal, this will be certainly a crucial port as far as commercial activities are concerned. I think this will be one of the ports where the goods are assembled and reshipped to other destinations. I cant see a military use for it and the Chinese havent the ability to have a large number of warships in the Indian Ocean any way, to counter India and the US. Interviewer Mr. President, moving on to sort of social issues, yet as we think of the crisis Sri Lanka is going through, the past is very much part of the present. There were accusations of massive human rights violations and large-scale violence that the government also took part in during the Civil War, including longtime suppression of Tamil, and Muslim minority rights, and restricting the free press. There are concerns that this trend is continuing. The day after your inauguration in July, military and police forces were used against protesters in Colombo with more than 50 people, including lawyers and journalists, beaten and injured. The Human Rights Watch has reported that the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been used to detain individuals without charges or due process. Even here today at Harvard, students are peacefully protesting and raising their concerns. Governments often suppress and discredit protesters by labeling them as anti-nationalist and problematic. Alternatively, one can instead view protesters as deeply patriotic and helpful. People who care so much about their country that they are willing to risk so much. Mr. President, can you let us know which of these two contrasting views of protesters does your government have and how do you plan to listen to and act upon their concerns? President Firstly, after the war was over, the then president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the then Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, came to an agreement that we have yet to fulfill. And I have committed myself to fulfil those demands. I have already been advocating reconciliation with the Tamils. I have lost elections because I have advocated reconciliation with the Tamils and now I am going through the steps which I have discussed with the Tamil parties and I am willing to discuss with the diaspora. So I cannot be accused at any stage of dealing with any of these instances. Now, the Human Rights Watch talks up, protesters being beaten up the day after I became president. Not so, that there were protesters, as I mentioned, who are trying to take over parliament. And it was at that stage that the police intervened. My house was burned. I lost 3000 books that were burnt by some of the protesters, some of whom were very educated people. I am repairing the presidents house, which is costing us about Rs 2 to 3 billion. And some of the historic paintings and others are missing. So amidst the protesters who went in, were also rogues and others. As far as we are concerned, I would not have allowed anyone to come into the house just as much as you are having inquiries in regard to the January 6th riots. So if you can prevent the capital from being taken over, why is it that you cant prevent the Sri Lankan parliament from being taken over? Why is it that you are using these double standards? I believe in peaceful protests and thats one thing that cant be said against me. As Prime Minister, I brought in legislation that did away with criminal defamation. We are the only country in South Asia without criminal defamation. I brought in the right to information Act. Three times I brought in the Constitutional Amendment which established independent commissions, including the Human Rights Commissions. Now, why should I go and stop all this? I am the one who has done it. Why should I suppress their rights? But we had a time when the Parliament and the whole system was under threat and that was the time that the army stepped in. At that time, yes, two people were taken in under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Isnt taking over the government offices, taking over the prime ministers offices, and marching on to parliament, what do you call that? To say that we are going to overthrow the government. But I sorted it out. Once the period was over and things had cooled off, we let them go. I could have kept them on for months and months. No, I didnt do that because we want democracy to function. But at the same time, the protests have to be peaceful. Now, the teachers went on strike. The parents also went on strike against the teachers. So thats the type of protest that goes on. So what the Human Rights Watch put down here is without inquiry and I am meeting with Amnesty International in the next few days, if I had anything to hide, I will not meet with Amnesty International. Interviewer Mr President, I appreciate that. Just one follow-up on that. We talked about the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Its been used. Im just curious about your thoughts on the future use of that act, but also what concrete steps are you taking to restore the rights for peaceful protest and release those who were detained without due process? President Firstly, the right to peaceful protest is there, and a lot of people are protesting. It happens when there is violence. There are two groups that say that we want to clash with the government. We are going to overthrow the government. That is what you called the Progressive Socialist Front. So What can you do if they come in, clash with the government, and police and if they are not at all peaceful? Thats all that I could tell you. As far as people who were detained, there were three people whom we detained and they have all been released. Before the three-month period was up to extend the detention, they were released as things in the country were peaceful. And I was hoping that they will not go on the rampage again. Unfortunately, they are on a rampage. So what can I do then? The police will appear. Im certainly not using the detention powers of the president. The rest of the detentions will be by the courts. Interviewer Thank you, Mr. President. Just for the record, we are not giving the U.S. a free pass either. There are plenty of contests that can restrict society, as you know. Its good to hear of your future and continued commitment to human rights. Questions by the audience Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Given that you spoke about the importance of the social contract and Sri Lankas democratic tradition, and given that the public has so far not tended to see the formation of your current administration what is the importance you place on the conducting of local government elections and what is your commitment to ensuring that they will take place now that they have rescheduled it? Presidents response My government has been confirmed by Parliament as required by the Constitution, and the constitution is valid. I dont think anyone can question it. In our parliament, if the presidency becomes vacant, you have to elect the President. In your system, if the Vice President who becomes the president. In parliament, I have asked all parties to support me. The government can get legislation through. As far as the local elections are concerned, there was also a call and I also mentioned it, to appoint a delimitation commission to reduce the number of members from 8000 to 4000. They think there are too many politicians at the local level and that also legislation which had been brought to ensure 25 of youth representation in the local authorities. So when the elections are called before that and also when they asked me, I said the economy wont be really functioning till about June. In any case, when the elections were called, there were two sets of cases. Elections are called as a result of two parties going to the Supreme Court and asking for elections. We had the election commission agree. Then two other parties went to Supreme Court and said to stop the elections. Now that case is going on. Thats all that has happened. But once the Supreme Court decides what the cases are, then we will go ahead accordingly. Remember, this is not the first time that the holding of local authority elections has been dragged, to the last moment. When I was prime minister the opposition and the government and the parliament couldnt agree on the delimitation. And again, the elections dragged on and were not held for a year and a half. At that stage, the Supreme Court stepped in and said the elections must be held. It has gone on for long enough. If the parties cant agree now, the same parties who were in that government with me and who had no problem when the elections were postponed by one year are now complaining that elections should be held immediately. In both instances, the courts had to decide. In earlier instances also the court had to decide. unlike the presidential elections and the parliamentary elections, which dates are fixed by the constitution. So these are issues that have been going to court not once, not twice, even earlier, the holding of local authority elections. And once the court decides, we will go ahead. If they say yes, you have to hold it. If they say no, then they have to think of another date. Thats all. Question 1 Thank you, Mr. President. you mentioned its a turning point for the country and in building the nation of Sri Lanka. Could you talk specifically about queer rights and protection? Question 2 My parents are originally from Sri Lanka. We left Jaffna during the Civil War. And so my question is related to that. And I recently sanctioned both Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa for gross violations of human rights, coupled with credible allegations of economic crimes that forced them from power. How does Sri Lanka intend to hold the Rajapaksas accountable for violations of domestic and international law? Question 3 So Sri Lanka has the worlds second-highest number of UN-registered enforced disappearances. The Office of Missing Persons, which was established in 2017 under a government youre a part of, has been touted as a sign of progress, despite the fact it has yet to resolve a single case. How does your government plan to tangibly meet Sri Lankas international commitments to provide answers on the missing? Presidents response Okay. On the first question on queer rights, as our law now stands, homosexuality is an offense under the Penal Code, but it has not been enforced for the last five decades to my knowledge. Certainly, the government will or will not enforce that law. But now a group of parliamentarians are discussing, and most probably will take action to bring legislation to repeal this provision of the penal code. I know the discussions are going on and maybe at some stage they will bring the resolution, the law, to Parliament. Then comes the next question. You asked me about the missing persons. Weve had the missing persons office and the missing persons Office started in 217, but some of the work was slow at that time, I admit it. And now they have really appointed a large number of committees to go into the missing persons and they are hoping to clear a few thousand cases this year. In addition to it, where they feel a person is missing, We are setting up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. At the moment, two of our ministers are in South Africa holding discussions with the South African government. So, the cases could be referred there. When we were in government in 2015 to 2019, many allegations of corruption were actually investigated and action was filed against many members, including some in the Rajapaksa family. There was no evidence against the others. So thats what we have done and the courts are still hearing the cases. Some, I think, have been concluded. Others are being heard so we are trying them under our own system. We do not accept the Canadian jurisdiction on this matter. We feel it is a matter for the Sri Lankan courts. And we are not members of the international Criminal Court. So we will go ahead and whenever there is evidence, we will investigate and take action. I know the sufferings that you all have gone through in Jaffna. I know how much the war affected you all. I know how much how many people had to leave Jaffna and to leave Sri Lanka. Finally, not only Tamils, but Sinhalese, Muslims have also had to leave the country. I realize the pain that the Tamils have of having to leave their property, of losing their loved ones. I certainly understand that. And thats why we have set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to go into those cases. But while we find out the truth and decide what to do in those cases, we must also go in for reconciliation. So I would like everyone to join and lets all work together to ensure that these problems of Sri Lanka are resolved. Its a terrible experience. Ive been through it all. Ive seen so many people killed, both Tamils, Singhalese and Muslims. I would not like to live through it. And people were killed when the fighting was going on, when they were outside. I know that. I know the pain that you have. Questions Im a Chinese are working India and Im visiting fellow here. So based on my observation, I find that there is increasing distrust and a vicious, even polarization either in domestic politics or international politics. As a very spirited kind of politician, I think you might have your only observation and thinking. So whats the deep cause for this kind of increasing distrust and divisions among people, among nations? And what might be the implication for the weaker group or the country and what might be the possible ways for us to get out of this? Question 2 Im a fellow at the Kennedy School. My question is about your experience as a legislator for over 40 years and your commitment to re-empowering Parliament and whether before the end of your term as president, you will finally be the President who abolishes the Executive Presidency as many before you have promised. Question 3 I had a question about Sri Lankas relations with its neighbors. And you gave us a rundown about Sri Lankas longstanding relationship with India and its projects with China. And now that weve seen India and China face off on the border and we see the world dividing. If Sri Lanka was at a crossroads and had to choose between India and China, where do you think that relationship would evolve towards? Question 4 My question is about the point you were making around reconciliation across all the different ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. And you referenced the presidential commission report and the LLRC. This was drafted in 2011. It hasnt been implemented and its been also considered wholly inadequate. And there have been a lot of challenges that the country has faced since. What is your new plan to take into account the inadequacies of the LLRC and ensure that there is real national reconciliation overdue? President Firstly, one on the nature of politics. Certainly it is becoming more and more confrontational throughout the world and that is unfortunate. The use of television and more of social media has led to this situation in many countries. So politics is now really based on how you divide the numbers so that you can get a majority and cast the minority on your opponent. So thats one of the issues that we have here in Sri Lanka. And add to that the ethnic issue that it really is bad that we have we need reconciliation to go ahead. Secondly, is the question that Asoka asked. Well, at the moment I have only one member of my party in Parliament, so well be first pursuing the issue of electoral reform. But Id also like to take and resolve the issue of the Executive Presidency that is not responsible to parliament. A President or a prime minister has to be directly and indirectly responsible to parliament. Yes, but I will have to work toward it. There are two reports that we can work on now. One is the report of the parliamentary committee in the 2015 Parliament, which has gone through many of the items. And secondly, Romesh de Silva, a constitutional committee report. So we could work on those two reports. Then comes the third question about Sri Lanka and India and China. So far, I think India and China wants the issue to be bilateral and they have held it. There has been intervention maybe by Russia and others indirectly. We would like to see that no confrontation breaks out between India and China, India and Pakistan. So far, the situation has held. Though its the tensest place in the world with three nuclear powers. None of us want to come to a situation that we had to choose between India and China if theres a confrontation. Our job is to ensure that there is no confrontation and the easing of relations. Now, this is going to be a difficult task at the moment when the Quad is operating on one side and China on the other hand, and Ukraine has really raised the level of confrontation between the West, Russia and China though in our part of the world we are not involved in the Ukraine issue and has kept away from taking sides. But this is why I was worried that the presence of UK in the Indian Ocean and Pacific where they shouldnt be and there is military power, can make things worse. I think between us in the region we will somehow manage it. So we dont want the things to become worse and we all like to ensure that we all work with India, China, US, Japan and everyone else. Thats our aim, not to have big power rivalry in the area. And Priyanka, yes, there were shortcomings in the LLRC report and other reports. So president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, appointed a commission headed by Justice Nawaz to look into all these reports and come back with a comprehensive report. They have just handed the report to me and that will cover the what has been said in the earlier reports. I think that that would resolve most of the issues. But Priyanka, do you come to Sri Lanka anytime? Answer by Priyanka (from the audience) Yes, yes. President Come next time, let me know. Tell the ambassador, all of you there who wants to know what is happening on the Tamil issue. You can come, you can ask Tarun also, we can invite you to come with the professor. If all of you come down there, we will be more than happy to have the people who are working on it to meet you. You can meet with the opposition parliamentarians, any other group. We want you to join us because we want young people like Priyanka to tell us what we should do and how we can make Sri Lanka tick again. Are you willing? Priyanka Yes, sure. President Ambassador, You should get hold of Priyanka and find out when shes coming and who else wants to come to Sri Lanka. Priyanka Mr. President, this is me Priyanka. I am Sri Lankan, and I want to feel at home in my own country and I would be very willing to come back and work as long as the country is also accepting of someone like me who is Tamil and has grown up my whole life there and wants to give back. But I think that is on you, Mr. President, and your government to make sure that its an enabling environment for educated people to come back and join and serve. Because theres nothing I would love more. President I certainly will build an enabling environment. Priyanka But you and your friends must tell me what more has to be done whether its in Colombo or in Jaffna, whether its in Nuwara Eliya or Batticaloa? Come and tell me what exactly you think should be done. We will look at what we are going to do and then tell us what else do you feel we should do. So next time before you come to Sri Lanka, tell the ambassador and I will get all those who are in charge to speak with you and any of your friends. Tamils are a part of Sri Lanka. We are all together, as our national anthem says, we are the children of one mother and our culture is basically intervened. You cant remove one. Some of us trace it back to Tamil Nadu, the rest of us Sinhalese trace it back to Kerala. So that thats the way we are and we have to ensure that the injustices done to the Tamils are remedied. Interviewer Mr. President, thank you again for being willing to take and respond to these questions, especially the tougher ones. We fundamentally believe democracy works best when leaders are held accountable to the public. This is true as much in the US as it is in all parts of the world. Im just going to end with one sort of which I hope will be a slightly lighter question, perhaps a more contemplative one in cricket parlance. Mr. President, you have completed a half century in politics. During this time, you have held incredibly important positions. You are now leading your country, as we discussed, in one of its worst crises. There are many challenges ahead, but there are also incredible opportunities. I also understand its your birthday today. Ones birthday can often offer a moment of reflection as you reflect, if there is one thing, one thing thats going to be hard, you would want to be seen as your legacy, to be remembered for by the Sri Lankan people. Both those here and the diaspora. What would that one thing be? President Give Sri Lanka a better future. That has been my aim. That is what I have worked for. That is what I have stood for and lost the election because I spoke out openly and thats what I will do, that the young people here will have a better future than us. And that is why we brought in the 25 year long term vision. --PMD--",

        "date": "March 26, 2023 07:52 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) has investigated numerous cases of procedural impropriety and financial misappropriation at the University of Peradeniya. This comes in the wake of an evaluation of current performance and status of issues raised in the Auditor Generals report from 2020 and 2021. The COPE Chairman, Professor Ranjith Bandara attributed the lack of financial accountability and the execution of past directives due to the non -participation of members of the Audit and Management Committee. Salient questions were asked of the University hierarchy who were present as to what would motivate these individuals to abscond proceedings with massive amounts of monies that are not properly accounted for. 1.Scrutiny into payment of salaries by staff in violation of attendance frequency The Committee further queried the violation of a University Grants Commission circular in University Academic support staff presenting their attendance record. The committee requested that procedure be immediately implemented to address this violation. Concurrently, an issue was also raised about lecturers who go overseas for study through scholarships received through the government and have dues owed to the universities. The Committee directed that these dues need to be effectively collected and advised the University Grants Commission to give them direction to come back to Sri Lanka and serve within the universities domestically for at least a period of 5 years following their overseas training. 2.Inquiry into unsubstantiated expenses incurred by the University Board Numerous financial misappropriation issues were addressed. Some of which included the rationale behind the purchase of table tennis tables which cost less than what was actually disbursed. On a similar note, the Chairman of the Committee also requested the physical presence of the director who authorized the renovations of the Arunachalam and Wijewardena Campus hostels for clarification as to the large sums of money that had been allocated accordingly. The Chair further addressed the compulsory leave and subsequent dismissal of the former Registrar without so much as an inquiry into the mismanagement of funds. 3.Inquiry into funds allocated and rents not collected by the University for various buildings under its purview, with a timeline by the Committee on restitutive measures. With regards to building projects around the campus, the Chairman directed the Vice Chancellor to appoint a committee to look into the foundation of the central building of the engineering faculty due to subsequent costs incurred as a result of improper due diligence and utilise a deposit the University already has to begin putting up a structure on the existing foundation. Concurrently a purported art gallery which is in dilapidated condition was directed by the committee to be renovated per the Universitys plans expeditiously with an update to be furnished within 30 days. The Chairman also requested the Survey Generals support in ensuring that lands conferred to the University of Peradeniya would not be encroached on. Discrepancy regarding uncollected rent from buildings owned by the University leased to the Samurdhi ministry was addressed. The Chairman of the Committee directed the university to either revise the owed rent from the Valuation Department or request the Samurdhi Director General to hand the property back to the University. The timeline for this was 06 months to review and collect all outstanding dues. 4.Attention to a purported software system that is yet to come online. The Committee queried the continual payment of a license fee for a software system which purportedly was built for use. The Chairman pointed out that software systems that collect a subscription are ones that are already existing with the option to modify it. With the project originally set to be completed by almost 04 years ago, the Chairman directed the Board to resolve this expeditiously and provide an update of proceedings within the next 30 days. The meeting was adjourned with the revelation that the 0.01 of revenue generated through self-funding activity has not been disbursed to any university from January 2018 to date. Follow up to all matters to ensure real-time accountability will take place in 03 months from now per the direction of the Chairman of the Committee.",

Speaking at a public meeting held in Bandaragama today (March 26), he said that many people are trying to halt the supporters of the SLPP by scaring them. It was just one incident that occurred on May 09. I dont believe that our innocent supporters of the party went to attack the activists of Aragalaya, who were at the Galle Face Green. They came only to meet Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa. Even at that time, we said that we have no problem with the Aragalaya protest movement, but of course, we have a problem with its activists, he said. Commenting further, MP Namal Rajapaksa emphasized that an honest system change is required at this time, and that he will definitely advocate that change. Honestly, there needs to be a change in this system. We accept it. I am someone who advocates for that system. But if the activists dont know what their final goal is, if someone tries to build a political force under the guise of the Aragalaya, if our struggling people will become a pawn of a force, we have a problem with that. The ceremonial opening of the SLPPs party head office in the Bandaragama constituency was held today (March 26). Several senior MPs of the party were also present at the event.",

        "content": "Friends of a killed Wellington PhD student are fundraising to help rural students in Sri Lanka get an education, as plans to establish a scholarship in her memory come to fruition. Apsara Wimalasiri, who was studying at Victoria University of Wellington, was killed by her ex-husband while on a trip home in Sri Lanka in April last year. With the anniversary of her death approaching, Wimalasiris former PhD supervisor and friend, Dr Corrine Seals, said she and others had started a Givealittle page to raise funds to pay for school supplies for Sri Lankan children in rural areas. Victoria University would be also establishing a memorial scholarship in Wimalasiris name for Sri Lankan students whose studies focused on social justice and human rights, she said. The university has already donated to the scholarship fund, with some members of staff putting money in as well. Fundraising would soon begin. Wimalasiri, who was from a small village, had shown a strong passion for children in rural areas being educated, Seals said. Her PhD thesis focused on multilingual education for Sri Lankan children and children in New Zealand. Apsara was an activist. She cared a lot about the Sri Lankan people and she also cared a lot about peoples access to education in Sri Lanka. A teacher in Sri Lanka told Seals that, for about NZ30, one student could be sponsored and given a backpack, shoes, calculator, pencils and school books. The aim is to raise 3150 through Givealittle, which could provide 100 students with school supplies, Seals said. The fundraiser was a positive way to uplift and honour Wimalasiris memory, she said. However, it was important to remember that Wimalasiris friends and family were still struggling to get justice in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan system is really failing her family. Wimalasiris ex-husband has not appeared at the two court dates assigned to him. He is remanded in a mental health unit. As he has not yet been tried through the legal system, Wimalasiris death certificate cannot be issued, meaning she cant graduate posthumously. Source - Stuff.co.nz -Agencies",

Earlier in a special gazette notification, dated January 30, 2023, issued by the respective District Returning Officers for the LG bodies of each district, it was announced that the LG election would be held on March 09. However, the LG election was later deferred as the government insisted that polls cannot be funded amidst the prevailing economic crisis. After being repeatedly postponed, the LG election was eventually rescheduled for April 25, however, it is reported that the polling will be delayed this time too, since only less than a month away for the scheduled date.

        "title": "Mass protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires defense chief",
        "date": "March 27, 2023 10:19 am",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets of cities across the country Sunday night in a spontaneous outburst of anger after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly fired his defense minister for challenging the Israeli leaders judicial overhaul plan. Protesters in Tel Aviv blocked a main highway and lit large bonfires, while police scuffled with protesters who gathered outside Netanyahus private home in Jerusalem. The unrest deepened a monthslong crisis over Netanyahus plan to overhaul the judiciary, which has sparked mass protests, alarmed business leaders and former security chiefs and drawn concern from the United States and other close allies. Netanyahus dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant signaled that the prime minister and his allies will barrel ahead this week with the overhaul plan. Gallant had been the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against it, saying the deep divisions were threatening to weaken the military. But as droves of protesters flooded the streets late into the night, Likud ministers began indicating willingness to hit the brakes. Culture Minister Micky Zohar, a Netanyahu confidant, said the party would support him if he decided to pause the judicial overhaul. Israeli media said leaders in Netanyahus coalition were to meet on Monday morning. Later in the day, the grassroots protest movement said it would hold another mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, in Jerusalem. In a brief statement, Netanyahus office said late Sunday the prime minister had dismissed Gallant. Netanyahu later tweeted, We must all stand strong against refusal. Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets in protest after Netanyahus announcement, blocking Tel Avivs main artery, transforming the Ayalon highway into a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags and lighting a large bonfire in the middle of the road. Demonstrations took place in Beersheba, Haifa and Jerusalem, where thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahus private residence. Police scuffled with protesters and sprayed the crowd with a water cannon. Thousands then marched from the residence to the Knesset. Inon Aizik, 27, said he came to demonstrate outside Netanyahus private residence in central Jerusalem because bad things are happening in this country. He called the judicial overhaul a quick legislative blitz. Netanyahus decision came less than a day after Gallant, a former senior general, called for a pause in the controversial legislation until after next months Independence Day holidays, citing the turmoil in the ranks of the military. Gallant had voiced concerns that the divisions in society were hurting morale in the military and emboldening Israels enemies. I see how the source of our strength is being eroded, Gallant said. While several other Likud members had indicated they might follow Gallant, the party quickly closed ranks Sunday, clearing the way for his dismissal. Galit Distal Atbaryan, Netanyahus public diplomacy minister, said Netanyahu summoned Gallant to his office and told him that he doesnt have any faith in him anymore and therefore he is fired. Gallant tweeted shortly after the announcement that the security of the state of Israel always was and will always remain my life mission. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Gallants dismissal harms national security and ignores warnings of all defense officials. Israels consul general in New York City, Assaf Zamir, resigned in protest. Avi Dichter, a former chief of the Shin Bet security agency, is expected to replace Gallant. Dichter had reportedly flirted with joining Gallant but instead announced Sunday he was backing the prime minister. Netanyahus government is pushing ahead for a parliamentary vote this week on a centerpiece of the overhaul  a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. It also seeks to pass laws that would would grant parliament the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit judicial review of laws. Netanyahu and his allies say the plan will restore a balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies. But critics say the laws will remove Israels system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the governing coalition. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a conflict of interest. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past three months to demonstrate against the plan in the largest demonstrations in the countrys 75-year history. The State Department dismissed as completely false claims repeated by Yair Netanyahu, the prime ministers son, that the U.S. government was financing these protests. Leaders of Israels vibrant high-tech industry have said the changes will scare away investors, former top security officials have spoken out against the plan and key allies, including the United States and Germany, have voiced concerns. In recent weeks, discontent has surged from within Israels army  the most popular and respected institution among Israels Jewish majority. A growing number of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots, have threatened to withdraw from voluntary duty if the laws are passed. Israels military is facing an increase in fighting in the occupied West Bank, threats from Lebanons Hezbollah militant group and concerns that archenemy Iran is close to developing a nuclear-weapons capability. Manuel Trajtenberg, head of an influential Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies, said that Netanyahu can dismiss his defense minister, he cannot dismiss the warnings he heard from Gallant. Meanwhile, an Israeli good governance group asked the countrys Supreme Court on Sunday to punish Netanyahu for allegedly violating a conflict of interest agreement meant to prevent him from dealing with the countrys judiciary while he is on trial for corruption. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a fierce opponent of the overhaul, asked the court to force Netanyahu to obey the law and sanction him either with a fine or prison time for not doing so. It said he was not above the law. The prime minister said the appeal should be dismissed and said that the Supreme Court didnt have grounds to intervene. Netanyahu is barred by the countrys attorney general from directly dealing with his governments plan to overhaul the judiciary, based on a conflict of interest agreement that the Supreme Court acknowledged in a ruling over Netanyahus fitness to serve while on trial for corruption. Instead, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, is spearheading the overhaul. But on Thursday, after Parliament passed a law making it harder to remove a sitting prime minister, Netanyahu said he was unshackled from the attorney generals decision and vowed to wade into the crisis and mend the rift in the nation. That declaration prompted the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, to warn that Netanyahu was breaking his conflict of interest agreement. The fast-paced legal and political developments have catapulted Israel into uncharted territory, said Guy Lurie, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank. We are at the start of a constitutional crisis in the sense that there is a disagreement over the source of authority and legitimacy of different governing bodies, he said.

        "title": "Three children, 3 adults shot dead by ex-student at Tennessee Christian school",
        "date": "March 28, 2023 07:46 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A heavily armed 28-year-old fatally shot three children and three adult staffers on Monday at a private Christian school the suspect once attended in Tennessees capital city before police killed the assailant, authorities said. The motive was not immediately known, but the suspect had drawn detailed maps of the school, including entry points for the building, and left behind a manifesto and other writings that investigators were examining, Police Chief John Drake told reporters. The latest in an epidemic of deadly mass gun violence that has come to routinely terrorize even the most cherished of U.S. institutions unfolded on a warm spring morning at The Covenant School, whose students consist mostly of elementary school-age children. Drake identified the suspect as Audrey Elizabeth Hale, 28, a resident of the Nashville area, and referred to the assailant by female pronouns. The chief said the suspect identified as transgender but provided no further clarity. Later, the Tennessean newspaper cited a police spokesperson as saying Hale used hehim pronouns. Hale used male pronouns on a LinkedIn page that listed recent jobs in graphic design and grocery delivery. Addressing an early evening news conference, Drake said police were working on a theory about what may have precipitated the shooting and would put that out as soon as we can. He said the suspect had no known prior criminal history. In a subsequent NBC News television interview, Drake said investigators believed the shooting stemmed from some resentment the suspect harbored for having to go to that school as a younger person. The police chief did not specify the nature of such presumed resentment, or whether it had anything to do with the suspects gender identity or the Christian orientation of the school. Drake said the school was singled out for attack but the individual victims were targeted at random. SWIFT POLICE RESPONSE The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department began receiving calls at 10:13 a.m. of a shooter at the school, and arriving officers reported hearing gunfire coming from the buildings second floor, police spokesperson Don Aaron told reporters. Two officers from a five-member team shot the assailant in a lobby area, and the suspect was pronounced dead by 10:27 a.m. The police department response was swift, Aaron said. Drake said the suspect, who was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns, had previously been a student at the school. The attacker gained entry to the building by shooting out the windows of a side door, the chief said. The victims were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all age 9, along with staffers Mike Hill, 61, a school custodian, Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher, and Katherine Koonce, 60, listed on the Covenant website as head of school. Reacting in Washington to the latest school shooting, U.S. President Joe Biden urged the U.S. Congress again to pass tougher gun reform legislation. Its sick, Biden said, addressing the issue during an event at the White House and urging Congress again to pass a ban on assault-style weapons. We have to do more to stop gun violence. Its ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation. U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, said on Twitter that her office stands ready to assist those affected by the shooting. But Rosanne Cash, daughter of Nashville country music icon Johnny Cash and a singer-songwriter in her own right, responded by criticizing Blackburns ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. You vote against every common sense gun control bill that comes across your desk, youve taken over 1 million from the NRA and you rank 14th in all Congress for NRA contributions. Spare us the hand-wringing, Cash tweeted. At the state level, Tennessee in 2021 did away with its permit requirement for carrying a concealed handgun and now allows anyone aged 21 and older to carry a firearm, either openly or concealed, without a permit, as long as they are legally allowed to purchase the weapon. Possessing a handgun is outlawed in Tennessee for anybody who has been convicted of a felony offense involving violence or drugs. The Covenant School, founded in 2001, is a ministry of Covenant Presbyterian Church in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville with about 200 students, according to the schools website. The school serves preschool through sixth graders and held an active shooter training program in 2022, WTVF-TV reported. Nashville Mayor John Cooper expressed sympathy for the victims and wrote on social media that his city joined the dreaded, long list of communities to experience a school shooting. There have been 89 school shootings  defined as any incident in which a gun is discharged on school property  in the U.S. so far in 2023, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database, a website founded by researcher David Riedman. Last year saw 303 such incidents, the highest of any year in the database, which goes back to 1970. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 28, 2023 11:39 am",
        "content": "Scientists have discovered a new and renewable source of water on the moon for future explorers in lunar samples from a Chinese mission. Water was embedded in tiny glass beads in the lunar dirt where meteorite impacts occur. These shiny, multicolored glass beads were in samples returned from the moon by China in 2020. The beads range in size from the width of one hair to several hairs; the water content was just a miniscule fraction of that, said Hejiu Hui of Nanjing University, who took part in the study. Since there are billions if not trillions of these impact beads, that could amount to substantial amounts of water, but mining it would be tough, according to the team. Yes, it will require lots and lots of glass beads, Hui said in an email. On the other hand, there are lots and lots of beads on the moon. These beads could continually yield water thanks to the constant bombardment by hydrogen in the solar wind. The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, are based on 32 glass beads randomly selected from lunar dirt returned from the Change 5 moon mission. More samples will be studied, Hui said. These impact beads are everywhere, the result of the cooling of melted material ejected by incoming space rocks. Water could be extracted by heating the beads, possibly by future robotic missions. More studies are needed to determine whether this would be feasible and, if so, whether the water would be safe to drink. This shows water can be recharged on the moons surface ... a new water reservoir on the moon, Hui said. Previous studies found water in glass beads formed by lunar volcanic activity, based on samples returned by the Apollo moonwalkers more than a half-century ago. These, too, could provide water not only for use by future crews, but for rocket fuel. NASA aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025. Theyll aim for the south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

The 30-year-old victim, R.M. Deepashika, who works in the same area where she resides, had been attacked with a sharp weapon by a resident of that area, while she was on the way to field duty last morning. Police arrested a 41-year-old suspect, identified as Jayawardene Pathiranage alias Danny Baby, on suspicion of committing the murder yesterday. He is a Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) candidate for the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha in the 2023 Local Government election, according to police. Police investigations have revealed that the victim was stabbed in the neck with a sharp weapon by the suspect as she had refused to issue a letter to one of the suspects friends working in the Hambantota Hospital, for obtaining free fertilizer from the government. However, the crime had been witnessed by the victims aunt, D.G. Dayawathi, who was waiting for the bus with the victim. Danny Baby, a fisherman by trade, had met the Agricultural Development Assistant several times demanding a letter mentioning the hospital worker as a farmer to obtain free fertilizer, the police said, adding that he had gone to the victims house twice on the night of March 26 asking for the relevant letter to be issued. There, the Agricultural Development Assistant had informed him to come to her office the next day to talk about the matter. However, the suspect had attacked her, while she was on the way to her office last morning. He had also stabbed the deceased woman multiple times on her neck and the face, while she was writhing in pain, the police revealed. Further, the police stated that the suspect Danny Baby had been holding the bloody knife, without allowing anyone to come close to the victim, who had fallen down in pain with cut injuries, and not allowing anyone to take her to the hospital. A police officer attached to the Tangalle Divisional Crimes Unit, who was on the way for his morning duties, had reportedly tried to control the suspect who was holding the knife with blood on his hands, but he had also tried to stab the police officer. Meanwhile, two traffic police officers of the Tangalle Traffic Division who were travelling from near the scene of the crime had inquired about the incident after seeing a large gathering of people. Having seen the murder, the traffic police officers had managed to control the suspect with the help of the police officer of Tangalle Divisional Crimes Unit and arrested the suspect after much effort. The arrested suspect is scheduled to be produced before Tangalle Magistrates Court today (March 28).",

        "content": "At least 39 migrants died after a fire broke out at a migrant facility in the Mexican northern border city of Ciudad Juarez, the governments National Migration Institute (INM) said on Tuesday. In a statement, the INM said there were 68 adult men from Central and South America staying at the facility. Twenty-nine migrants were also injured in the blaze and were taken to four hospitals in the area, the institute said. An AFP journalist saw firemen and rescuers placing several bodies covered with blankets in the parking lot of the INM facility in Ciudad Juarez. INM press personnel reached by AFP confirmed the fire, but declined to specify the number of victims. Local media, citing unnamed sources, estimated that there were nearly three dozens of deaths. A rescuer who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the press explained that there were about 70 migrants, mostly Venezuelans, at the site. The fire broke out shortly before midnight, prompting the mobilization of firefighters and dozens of ambulances. Ciudad Juarez, which neighbors El Paso, Texas, is one of the border towns where numerous undocumented migrants seeking refuge in the United States remain stranded. A recent report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) states that since 2014, some 7,661 migrants have died or disappeared en route to the United States, while 988 perished in accidents or while traveling in subhuman conditions.

The proposals were conveyed to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena when Dr. Sahasrabuddhe called on the former at the Temple Trees yesterday (27 March).

Dr. Sahasrabuddhe said he inaugurated the first meeting of Sri Lankan Alumni of ICCR to ensure continued interaction between those who benefitted from ICCR tradition of enriching skills and academic excellence, adding that those students who have studied in India will pursue bright careers in their home country and will also spread the light of education and knowledge tradition in India. He added that ICCR provides a large number of scholarships to students to enable them to pursue education in over 43,000 colleges under over 1,100 universities at undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral research levels.

        "date": "March 28, 2023 05:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced his plans to place Sri Lanka at the forefront of green economic policy, with a green economic policy being introduced in the next two months. Accordingly, he stated that the island nation will become the first country in the region to adopt a green economy, with the Environment, Power and Energy Ministries and the Climate Change Office working together to introduce a green economic policy focused on renewable energy within the next two months. President Wickremesinghe also committed to facilitating both local and foreign investors who attended the conference, adding that the green economic policy due to be implemented soon will be the first of its kind in the region. Speaking at a meeting with investors who attended the Sri Lanka Green Energy Summit at the Presidents Office yesterday (27 March), the Head of State expressed his gratitude to the investors who participated in the Clean Green Energy Summit, and pledged to provide the necessary facilities to meet their investment requirements. Sri Lanka is currently facing two major challenges  debt restructuring and transitioning to green energy. While debt restructuring is already underway, the country must also act quickly to establish a green economy. Sri Lanka has great potential to generate energy through renewable sources such as solar, wind, biogas, and sea waves. President Wickremesinghe believes that transitioning to a green economy could be the key to building a stronger economy for Sri Lanka, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. Wickremesinghe further emphasised on the need for legislation to be passed promptly pertaining to the new policy, adding that the green economic policy is not a short-term program, but a long-term initiative that requires a legal framework. The President highlighted that Sri Lanka has the potential to become the first in Asia in green energy, thanks to its natural resources and the experienced investors present at the meeting. He also mentioned the on-going discussion of bringing an oil pipeline from India to Trincomalee, and emphasised the importance of cooperation with South India in moving towards renewable energy. According to the President, Trincomalee has been identified as a potential port for green hydrogen due to its proximity to the North, which has abundant sources of green hydrogen, renewable energy, and strong wind power in Sri Lanka. He added that this would create development opportunities for the country and investors, leading to economic expansion and good returns on investment. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabri, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, Environment Minister Naseer Ahmed, State Minister Dilum Amunugama, Senior Advisor to the President on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene, International Adviser to the President on Climate Change Eric Solheim, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, as well as local and foreign investors and other officials participated in this discussion at the Presidential Secretariat.",

        "content": "Portuguese police shot a man suspected of stabbing two women to death at an Ismaili Muslim center in Lisbon, authorities said Tuesday. The women were Portuguese staff members at the center, Ismaili community leader Narzim Ahmad told Portuguese TV channel S.I.C. Police were called to the center late Tuesday morning where they encountered a suspect armed with a large knife, a police statement said. Police ordered him to surrender but he advanced toward them and was neutralized, the statement said. The suspect was taken to a Lisbon hospital where he was in police custody. Several other people were wounded, according to the statement, but it provided no further details. Prime Minister António Costa said police shot the suspect and told reporters the attack was a criminal act. Everything points to this being an isolated incident, Costa said, without elaborating. There was no immediate word on the identity of those killed. Armed police from a special operations unit could be seen forming a perimeter outside the building. Costa said police were investigating the attack and it was too soon to speculate about a motive. The Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims, generally known as the Ismailis, belong to the Shia branch of Islam, according to their website. The Ismaili Muslims are a culturally diverse community living in more than 25 countries around the world, it says. Portugal hasnt recorded any significant terror attacks in recent decades, and religious violence is virtually unheard of. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "March 29, 2023 09:06 am",
        "content": "Humza Yousaf has been confirmed as Scotlands new first minister after a vote in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP leader was backed by his own MSPs and the Scottish Greens - guaranteeing him a majority. All three opposition leaders stood against him but knew they had no prospect of being successful. Mr Yousaf, who succeeds Nicola Sturgeon, is the countrys sixth first minister and first from an ethnic minority background. He is also the youngest first minister at 37, and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party. Following the vote, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak phoned Mr Yousaf to congratulate him. He said he wanted to continue working constructively with the Scottish government to deliver on what he argued were the peoples priorities across Scotland, including the need to half inflation, delivering growth, and cut waiting times. Mr Yousaf raised the question of a second independence referendum, but Mr Sunak suggested this would distract from delivering on the things that are top of the priority list for people across Scotland. Minister for independence The new first minister started to shape his team on Tuesday afternoon with the announcement that Shona Robison - who has been serving as the social justice secretary and was a close ally of Ms Sturgeon - would be become his deputy first minister. He also confirmed he would have a minister for independence in his government, a role he pledged to create during the leadership campaign Ms Sturgeon formally tendered her resignation to the King earlier on Tuesday after more than eight years as first minister. She announced last month that she would be standing down once a replacement was appointed. Mr Yousaf was backed by all 64 SNP MSPs and the seven Greens, with the two parties having a power-sharing agreement in the 129-seat parliament. All 31 Conservative MSPs voted for Douglas Ross, the 22 Labour members for Anas Sarwar and the four Liberal Democrats backed Alex Cole-Hamilton. Mr Yousaf said it was a signal of the progress that Scotland has made that two of the nominees for first minister - himself and Mr Sarwar, who were at school together at the private Hutchesons Grammar in Glasgow - were from minority ethnic communities. He described the moment as a privilege of my life, and said Ms Sturgeon - who watched the vote from the backbenches - leaves some very big shoes to fill indeed. Mr Yousaf added: I pledge that Scotland will continue to be a positive, progressive voice on the world stage. And he said his government would listen carefully and pay respect to the views of all MSPs while standing up to any attempts to undermine devolution. The new first minister said: I will never shy away from tackling the big issues our country faces. My starting point will be that we all want the best for Scotland and the people that we are so privileged to represent. I will stand up unequivocally for this parliament and against any attempts to undermine devolution. I will work every hour of every day to harness the potential of Scotland and every single person. I will place no limits on the ambitions that we have collectively for ourselves, for our country or indeed for the world that we live in. Mr Yousaf will be officially sworn in as first minister during a brief ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Wednesday, and is expected to then start the process of appointing the rest of his cabinet team. He will also face opposition leaders for the first time at the weekly First Ministers Questions session on Thursday. There will be considerable interest in the future of Kate Forbes, who finished a close second to Mr Yousaf in the SNP leadership contest after attacking his competency and Ms Sturgeons record in government in a live STV debate during the campaign. Ms Forbes had herself been attacked by senior SNP figures including outgoing Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who has also now left the government, over her socially conservative views on issues like gay marriage and abortion. She has been on maternity leave as the countrys finance secretary and Mr Yousaf has said he has spoken to her and absolutely wants her to be part of the government - but it not yet known what role he would offer or whether she would accept. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was looking forward to meeting and working together with Mr Yousaf, but the UK government has already made clear it will continue to refuse to grant formal consent for another independence referendum. Mr Yousaf was also congratulated on his appointment by opposition leaders at Holyrood, with Mr Ross saying: With both the first minister and the prime minister representing the UKs diverse communities, this sends a strong, positive message to everyone that there are no barriers to what you can achieve in this country. But he went on to claim that Mr Yousaf seems to be doing his best to offer a poor imitation of his predecessor having decided on his first day to renew Nicola Sturgeons constitutional conflict with the UK government by calling on it to grant formal consent for an independence referendum. Mr Sarwar told Mr Yousaf that their respective grandparents could never have imagined that their grandchildren would reach the positions of first minister and Scottish Labour leader when they arrived in the country and made Scotland their home. He added: I know that he (Mr Yousaf) has faced personal abuse and racism, as have so many others who dont have the platform that he and I are fortunate to have. I am proud of the work we have done alongside others to stand against hatred and bigotry, and my promise is that I will continue to stand alongside you in that fight for all of us.

        "content": "National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) says it has observed an alarming increase in drug abuse in the country as 67,900 people in total had been arrested in connection with narcotics-related offenses between January and October last year. Speaking in this regard, NDDCBs Director-General Bhadrani Senanayake said 52 of these people had been apprehended for being in possession of heroin, while 37 of them were arrested for cannabis-related offenses. Meanwhile, a total of 6,728 individuals had been taken into custody with methamphetamine (commonly known as Ice) during this eight-month period, she added. When taking these figures into account, it is evident that there has been a substantial increase in the use and spread of heroin, cannabis and methamphetamine in the country, the NDDCBs Director-General explained. Speaking further, Senanayake also shed light on the inadequacy of facilities to rehabilitate drug addicts. She went on to note that despite there being at least 100,000 heroin addicts and 350,000 cannabis addicts in the country, only 4,000 of them turn up for treatments and rehabilitation annually. Although there are both governmental and non-governmental organizations operating treatment and rehabilitation centers for drug addicts, the facilities at these establishments are inadequate, especially for female drug addicts, Senanayake commented further.",

Speaking at a special press conference held this morning at the Ministrys premises in Colombo, the Minister stated that over 20 CPC employees who did not report to work today were sent on compulsory leave, and have been banned from entering the CPC premises. The conference comes amidst a rather turbulent backdrop in the fuel sector, with trade union collectives of the Ceylon petroleum Corporation (CPC) having staged a Satyagraha on the morning of 27 March. They later called off the Satyagraha last afternoon (28 March), and decided to engage in a strike action, withdrawing themselves from activities related to the filling and distribution of fuel. The Minister then called for the termination of employees and trade union activists of both CPC and the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Ltd (CPSTL), in the event they disrupt the distribution of fuel or hinder the work of other employees. Wijesekera, the CPC and the Government have assured an uninterrupted supply of fuel, adding that there is no shortage of fuel in the country, and that distribution will continue as usual.",

        "date": "March 29, 2023 12:46 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankans are hopeful that a new employment scheme with Saudi Arabia will help ease their countrys economic crisis, professionals and labor officials told Arab News, as they expect it to boost the nations manpower exports to the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka recently signed an agreement on the Skill Verification Program which aims to improve the professional competence of employees in the Saudi labor market and streamline the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation. Under the deal  which covers 23 professions, including electricians and auto mechanics  Saudi employers will recognize accreditations issued by Sri Lankas Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. The TVEC has embarked on the assessment process where Saudi Arabia would tell us their manpower needs and Sri Lanka would choose the right candidates for the right courses, commission director, Dr. Lalithadheera K. Arachchige, told Arab News on Tuesday. For many years, Sri Lankan professionals have been working in Saudi Arabia without recognition of their professional certification and often enrolled in jobs below their qualifications. The new deal is expected to change that. Abdul Nazar, managing director of Colombo-based recruitment company Air Kings Group who used to work in Jeddah, said Saudi Arabia had previously not recognized professionals from Sri Lanka unless they have gone through the technical skill tests processed by the Saudi government. He told Arab News: The new facility will enable the migrant workers to claim their salaries according to their professional qualifications which will help our country to earn increased volume of foreign exchange to our national coffers. The deal coincides with the Kingdoms launch of various megaprojects and its growing need for foreign workers. In Saudi Arabia, because of Vision 2030, there is a dearth for skilled workers where we can creep in and get the needed foreign exchange to Sri Lanka, Nihal Gamage, president of the Sri Lanka Cultural Forum in Riyadh, told Arab News. This is a God-sent opportunity. The program was also expected to encourage more Sri Lankans to look for jobs in the Kingdom, due to the extra perks they would receive. Both countries will benefit. Saudi Arabia is getting more qualified people and at the same time we are getting the high perks, Senarath Yapa, spokesman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, told Arab News. Only around 40 percent of Sri Lankan migrant workers departing for the Kingdom are recognized as skilled workers, Yapa said. H.P.A. Kumarasinghe, a Sri Lankan professional who works as a chief accountant at Riyadh-based ABV Rock Group, expected the agreement to help ease the economic crisis in his home country. Sri Lanka has been seeking foreign employment opportunities for its professionals as it is facing its worst financial crisis since gaining independence in 1948 and is in desperate need of foreign currency. I really believe this new program will help ease the crisis in Sri Lanka more broadly, Kumarasinghe told Arab News. This was a long overdue deal, but theres a saying that its better late than never, so in this point of view I believe it is a remarkable agreement between Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia.

        "date": "March 29, 2023 01:06 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), in light of the recent public inquiries and the developments observed in cryptocurrencies, has reiterated the significant risks associated with using and investing in digital currencies. Although crypto-trading is widely promoted by certain entities as a profitable investment, the Central Bank said the recent complaints it received have shown that the members of the public have incurred heavy losses on their crypto-investments. In certain instances, people were subject to financial scams conducted through crypto-related schemes, the Central Bank said further in a press release. The Central Bank previously cautioned the general public of cryptocurrency-related scams in 2018, 2021 and 2022, highlighting the significant financial, operational, legal and security risks as well as customer protection concerns posed to the users of cryptocurrency. These risks and concerns have already materialized with the recent failures of various global institutions engaged in cryptocurrency businesses, and the collapse and loss of value of some cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank went on to remind the public that cryptocurrencies are unregulated investment instruments that are not recognized as an asset-class in Sri Lanka. Further, cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in Sri Lanka and have no regulatory safeguards relating to their usage in the country, the Central Bank noted further. As per Directions No. 03 of 2021 under the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs) such as debit cards and credit cards are not permitted to be used for payments related to cryptocurrency transactions. Cryptocurrency operates through informal channels, and therefore, it does not contribute to the national economy and can also cause a loss of valuable foreign currency to the country. The public is also warned of the growing number of financial scams operating with the promise of high returns based on crypto-investments. These scams include deceiving individuals and obtaining money from them with the promise of providing a high return by investing money in cryptocurrency, as well as deceiving individuals to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency projects. Such scams circumvent traditional regulatory and legal protection mechanisms, resulting in individuals losing their hard-earned money, the Central Bank cautioned. Further, the Central Bank strongly advised the members of the public to safeguard their hard-earned money and not to invest or engage in any cryptocurrency scheme offered through the internet, other forms of media, or directly by any person. The public is also notified that Central Bank has not issued any license or authorized any individual or business to operate schemes involving cryptocurrency, and has not authorized any Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or any variant of it, cryptocurrency mining operations, cryptocurrency exchanges, deposit-taking or custody services related to cryptocurrency or any cryptocurrency investment advisory service. The Central Bank also urged those who are engaged in promoting and facilitating the promotion of investing and trading in cryptocurrency to refrain from such activities, considering the wide range of risks associated with cryptocurrency and the resulting hardships to the public, including financial losses. Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that is generated by private entities and not by a monetary authority of a country. The term cryptocurrency refers to a digital representation of value that is implemented using cryptography and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) or similar technology.",

On March 26, a 35-member Thai delegation led by Ms. Auramon Supathaweethum, Director General of the Department of Trade Negotiations, arrived in Sri Lanka for the fourth round of talks. Along with their focus on trade negotiations, the delegation also strengthened the long-standing religious and cultural ties between the two countries by offering over 500 alms-bowls to the Gangarama temple on the same day.

The team comprised officials from various departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security, Ministry of Industry, Department of Trade and Investment Policy, Attorney Generals Department, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. They participated in the negotiations on behalf of Sri Lanka. During the third round of negotiations in January, discussions on the proposed Sri Lanka-Thailand Free Trade Agreement focused on areas such as trade in goods, trade in services, investment, rules of origin, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and economic cooperation. The fourth round of talks will build on the principles already agreed upon, and delve deeper into these areas. Additionally, discussions will be held on trade remedies, technical barriers to trade (TBT), and legal matters. Prior to the fourth round of negotiations, the National Trade Negotiations Committee and relevant sub-committees engaged in discussions with various industry sectors and stakeholders. The points raised during these discussions were taken into consideration and used appropriately during the fourth round of talks. The Sri Lankan negotiating teams goals for the talks focused not only to increase Sri Lankan exports access to the Thai market, but also to improve market access to other ASEAN countries through the Thai market, and to reduce existing non-tariff barriers. The Sri Lankan Government hopes to sign the agreement in the first quarter of 2024.",

While participating in an event organized by the Overland Automobile Institute, Minister Nanayakkara also revealed plans to provide electric vehicle import licenses to other people who bring in dollars to the country on a private basis. He said the government, in a bid to increase the countrys depleted forex reserves, took measures to provide benefits to migrant workers when the country fell into an abyss last year due to the economic crisis. Despite being delayed due to certain officials who adamantly opposed the initiative, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers gave the go-ahead to expeditiously proceed with the implementation of the pilot project to allow migrant workers to import electric vehicles, he continued. Denouncing the remarks made by certain people that this initiative is just another political gimmick, the lawmaker insisted that the incumbent government does not endorse populist politics.

The accused was identified as 67-year-old Nagalingam Madanasekaran. Meanwhile, Colombo High Court Judge Navaratne Marasinghe also issued a warrant for the arrest of Dharmalingam Muhundan, who was found guilty of the same charges. Despite having been found guilty of the same charge of attempted murder, Muhundan has been evading the court.

Judge Marasinghe also ordered that the Katunayake, Mattala and Palali airports be informed of the arrest warrant against Muhundan, while the Director General of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was further ordered to execute the warrant through Interpol as well. Despite requests made by the defence counsel that the court take into consideration the facts that his client, a father of two, has been imprisoned for 15 years, the Judge emphasised that the charges the accused has been found guilty of are of a grave nature, and could have caused serious damage. In September 2008, the duo left an explosive device wrapped in a parcel under the seat of a bus, which was carrying over 50 passengers at the time, set to donate at around 01:30 p.m. near St. Bridgets Convent, endangering the lives of several persons, including school children. Upon a suspicion, however, the conductor of the bus, who noticed the parcel, had evacuated the passengers off the bus, and had informed nearby police officers. The bus was then moved to an unpopulated location, and the parcel containing the bomb was recovered upon inspection.",

        "date": "March 29, 2023 05:26 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry and Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs  Constitutional Reforms Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, concluded their three-day official visit to South Africa from 21-25 March 2023. During the visit, the two Ministers paid a Courtesy Call on the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and held bilateral meetings with the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa Naledi Pandoor and the Minister of Justice and Constitutional and Constitutional Development Ronald Lamola. They also met with former South African President Thabo Mbeki as well as Roelf Meyer, former Minister of Constitutional Development and one of the chief negotiators, along with President Ramaphosa, for the end of apartheid in South Africa and paving the way to the first democratic elections in the country. Meetings were also held with officials from the Public Prosecutions Office of South Africa, the Pan African Bar Association of South Africa, Freedom park, In Transformation Initiative and the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation. During the call on President Ramaphosa, the South African President warmly recalled his friendship with his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe and said that he wishes to further consolidate the bilateral relations with Sri Lanka. He further stated that South Africa is committed to sharing their experiences in relation to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission with a view to assisting Sri Lanka in the reconciliation process. Sri Lankas Cabinet of Ministers in January this year approved the concept of a Truth and Reconciliation mechanism as proposed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Reconciliation, chaired by President Wickremesinghe. The proposed concept states that an independent, domestic mechanism of truth seeking is identified as a meaningful way for Sri Lanka to advance and secure peace, after the countrys arduous journey of ending conflict of three decades. The Cabinet also authorized the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice to operationalize this concept and to initiate discussions and facilitate the drafting of a Truth and Reconciliation law. It is in support of this process, the current visit took place at the invitation of the South African Government. Foreign Minister Sabry and Minister Pandoor exchanged views on important bilateral issues as well as the current situation in Sri Lanka. Minister Sabry especially briefed the South African Minister on the progress being made by the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to national efforts on reconciliation and the promotion and protection of human rights. While acknowledging that the South African model would need to be adapted to the Sri Lankan context, both Ministers agreed to work together in sharing experiences and expertise in developing the contours of a truth-seeking mechanism that would best suit the needs of the Sri Lankan people. The interactions with the South African Minister of Justice and other experts provided valuable insights with regard to the South African experience in the establishment of their Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",

        "title": "Musk, experts urge pause on AI systems, citing risks to society",
        "date": "March 29, 2023 05:37 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives are calling for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAIs newly launched GPT-4, in an open letter citing potential risks to society and humanity. The letter, issued by the non-profit Future of Life Institute and signed by more than 1,000 people including Musk, called for a pause on advanced AI development until shared safety protocols for such designs were developed, implemented and audited by independent experts. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable, the letter said. The letter detailed potential risks to society and civilization by human-competitive AI systems in the form of economic and political disruptions, and called on developers to work with policymakers on governance and regulatory authorities. Co-signatories included Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, researchers at Alphabet-owned DeepMind, as well as AI heavyweights Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell. According to the European Unions transparency register, the Future of Life Institute is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, as well as London-based effective altruism group Founders Pledge, and Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The concerns come as EU police force Europol on Monday joined a chorus of ethical and legal concerns over advanced AI like ChatGPT, warning about the potential misuse of the system in phishing attempts, disinformation and cybercrime. Meanwhile, the UK government unveiled proposals for an adaptable regulatory framework around AI. The governments approach, outlined in a policy paper published on Wednesday, would split responsibility for governing artificial intelligence (AI) between its regulators for human rights, health and safety, and competition, rather than create a new body dedicated to the technology. Musk, whose carmaker Tesla is using AI for an autopilot system, has been vocal about his concerns about AI. Since its release last year, Microsoft-backed OpenAIs ChatGPT has prompted rivals to accelerate developing similar large language models, and companies to integrate generative AI models into their products. Sam Altman, chief executive at OpenAI, hasnt signed the letter, a spokesperson at Future of Life told Reuters. OpenAI didnt immediately respond to request for comment. The letter isnt perfect, but the spirit is right: we need to slow down until we better understand the ramifications, said Gary Marcus, a professor at New York University who signed the letter. They can cause serious harm... the big players are becoming increasingly secretive about what they are doing, which makes it hard for society to defend against whatever harms may materialize.

        "title": "Should equip students with knowledge on modern technology to prepare for future - President",
        "date": "March 29, 2023 09:32 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says it is crucial for students in the country to have comprehensive knowledge of modern technology and continually update themselves with the latest advancements to prepare for the future. This will enable them to take over the country by 2048, he added. Additionally, the President suggested that once the economy is stabilized with the support of the IMF in four years, it would be worthwhile to evaluate whether to continue with the same old path or take a new direction that aligns with the developing world, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. During the 135th Annual Prize Giving ceremony at Ananda Vidyalaya in Colombo this morning (March 29), President Wickremesinghe shared these remarks. At this event, students were awarded for the talents they demonstrated in 2020-2021, said the PMD. Upon arriving at the school premises, the President participated in religious observances at the shrine room. He was greeted by boy scouts and received a salute from them. Additionally, he laid a floral wreath at the statue of the fallen heroes erected on the school grounds. Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was awarded the Anandabimani Award, a once-in-a-lifetime recognition presented to an Anandian who has demonstrated excellence in all national, religious, cultural, political, and economic aspects and has committed to promoting ethnic harmony, according to the PMD. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conferred the award on Mr. Jayasuriya. Additionally, the President also bestowed the Fritz Kunz Memorial Trophy, which is the schools highest honour, on W.S. Nimsith for being the Most Outstanding Anandian to have passed out from the school. The statement made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is as follows: Professor Sampath Amaratunga reminded me of the last time I attended a prize-giving ceremony at this school. At that time, Mr. Kudaligama was acting as the principal. I have noticed that this school has made great progress since then. I would like to express my thanks to all those who contributed to its success. As part of the Nearest School - Best School program, I was involved in providing a seven-story building to this school. Its worth noting that Ananda Vidyalaya is the only school in Sri Lanka with such a tall building. Additionally, the school also received a swimming pool and a playground. Allow me to begin todays story with the reason behind the establishment of Ananda Vidyalaya. During the British colonization of our country, there were no schools available for our people. The only education available was being offered in English or Dutch through church-run schools. However, the temples continued to provide educational activities as well. In the same way, Tamil education was being offered in various locations throughout Jaffna. The year 1835 marked a significant turning point in the economy of Sri Lanka, as the Colebrook Cameron Commission report was released. This report led to a shift from the feudal economy of cinnamon cultivation to a commercial economy. This new economy was built on the cultivation of tea, coffee, rubber, and coconut. Additionally, the port of Colombo was developed into a large port, facilitating trade and commerce in the region. As a result of the economic changes of the 19th and 20th centuries, a new commercial economy emerged. This economy first took root in Sri Lanka and later spread to other countries, including Japan. Realizing the need for skilled workers in this field, it was suggested that a school be established. The school, initially named Colombo Academy, was founded near the Fort, Hulftsdorp. This school would eventually become my alma mater, Royal College in Colombo. During that time, as a response to educational needs, missionary societies established schools, including St. Thomas College. Recognizing that the Buddhists also required modern education, Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera, saw the need for a modern school. At that time, the only options available to Buddhists were private education and learning in the temples. Hence, he partnered with Mr. Henry Olcott to create a school that incorporated modern education within a Buddhist environment. The reason behind starting Ananda Vidyalaya was due to the Christian environment of the missionary system, whereas the Royal College of Colombo had a secular environment. Ananda Vidyalaya, on the other hand, was established with a Buddhist background. Interestingly, the first two principals of Ananda Vidyalaya were Christians who later converted to Buddhism. Ananda Vidyalaya has produced many notable alumni who have played significant roles in shaping independent Sri Lanka. One such notable alumnus of Ananda Vidyalaya who was recently paid tribute to is Mr. Karu Jayasuriya, who is fondly referred to as Ananda Abhimana. Mr. Jayasuriya has made significant contributions to his alma mater as a Speaker, a Mayor, and a Minister, and Ananda Vidyalaya can be rightfully proud of his achievements. His service to the school is a great example for current students to follow, as it highlights the importance of contributing to society in a meaningful way. Those currently studying at Ananda Vidyalaya are indeed fortunate. As far as my knowledge goes, Ananda Vidyalaya is the first modern school in the world to have a Buddhist environment. Its important to express gratitude to the Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera for initiating the establishment of Ananda Vidyalaya and Vidyodaya Pirivena. Now, with the education received at Ananda Vidyalaya, students are prepared to enter society and make meaningful contributions. The principal and the teaching staff of Ananda Vidyalaya are dedicated to providing students with the necessary training to succeed in life. Its important for students to take full advantage of the knowledge and resources provided by the school. Student leaders are also available to provide the necessary support to the teaching staff, while sports leaders and presidents of student unions help to build a well-rounded school community. Additionally, the schools alumni are a valuable resource and provide significant assistance to the school. As students of Ananda Vidyalaya, you have the privilege of receiving a valuable education that will equip you with the necessary skills to be leaders in society. Its important to make the most of this education and use it to contribute positively to society. The teaching staff plays a crucial role in providing you with the training needed to succeed in your future endeavours. Once you enter society, it becomes your responsibility to lead and contribute to building a better society. While the government and parliament have a role to play in creating a conducive environment for growth and development, its ultimately up to individuals to contribute to positive change. The current state of society is fraught with crises, both political and economic, and its imperative for the future generation to work toward rebuilding and creating a better society. Now the economy is being stabilized with the IMF support. If we want to develop the country, we need to get support to stabilize the economy. That alone is not enough and we have to decide the kind of society we need after those 4 years. We should decide if we follow the same old path or a new system to go forward along with the developing world. Following independence, we implemented free education and healthcare, initiated the Mahaweli project, established free trade zones, and made significant strides in our economy. However, despite our efforts, we have not progressed as much as other nations like Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia, and we now find ourselves stagnating. To move forward, we must decide whether to continue stagnating or to follow the lead of these countries. Today, we need to rethink our approach and take bold new steps, with the youth community taking the lead. Unlike our time, the younger generation has access to advanced technologies like high-quality phones and computers, which we must leverage to our advantage. Green energy presents a significant opportunity for growth and development across all sectors. Solar, wind, and offshore wind power are all viable options that we must capitalize on, just as we did with tea, coffee, and rubber in the past. It is crucial to act quickly to ensure that we lead the way in the global shift toward green hydrogen. Experts predict that we can produce at least 20 GW of green hydrogen, which will give us a significant surplus, unlike many other countries that struggle with self-sufficiency. Green hydrogen has tremendous potential as a future fuel for ships, and our country is fortunate to have access to Green Ammonia. By making Trincomalee the main port for these resources, we can establish ourselves as a country with an energy surplus. This will enable us to generate carbon credits that other countries will buy, providing us with a valuable source of income that can be used to reduce our debt. In addition, we must focus on developing our tourism industry. The Maldives is currently leading the way, but we have a unique advantage with our cultural heritage and scenic beauty. We have stunning beaches, rich Buddhist and Hindu religious sites, and a diverse upcountry culture that we have not fully leveraged. With more than a billion people living in India, our neighbouring country, even attracting just one million tourists can have a significant impact on our economy. We must make a concerted effort to capitalize on these opportunities and reap the benefits. India is rapidly developing but faces a shortage of certain raw materials and limited space in their ports to meet their needs. To address this, we should focus on transforming the Colombo Port into a larger port by expanding the South and North Ports and exploring offshore economy opportunities. We need to embrace new technologies like artificial intelligence and automation to position ourselves as pioneers in this field. It is up to the youth to lead this endeavour and build a better future for our country. Just as Ananda Vidyalaya took the lead in building a modern Sri Lanka in the 19th century, it is up to the youth of today to take charge and create a new country for the 21st century. This cannot be achieved overnight, but it will take one or two decades. Those present here today will be in their fifties by then, so it is up to them to shape their own future. China aims to become a developed country within 100 years, and India has set a goal of creating a modern India by 2047. Similarly, we should set our sights on achieving similar goals and take responsibility for our countrys development. The talented youth of this school will play a crucial role in this effort, and it is up to them to take on the challenge and build a better future for Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "March 29, 2023 09:56 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Fort Magistrate today (29 March) issued an order pertaining to the detention of the ill-famed underworld figures Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu. Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered that proper security measures be followed in the event the duo is taken out of the detention centre for investigative purposes. He further ordered to keep them in the custody of either an authorized officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or the OIC of the relevant police division in which the investigation is being carried out. The order was issued in view of a request made to the court by a group of lawyers, including Attorney-at-Law Rienzie Arsekularatne, PC, pertaining to the safety of the two criminals. The lawyers, referring to how notorious underworld figures Makandure Madush and Kosgoda Tharaka were previously shot dead by the police, requested the court to ensure that handcuffs and leg shackles are on the two suspects whenever they are taken out for investigation purposes. Harak Kata was brought back to the island with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika, alias Kudu Salindu after defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka, on 08 March, of the arrest of eight suspects including the infamous criminal duo, a Malagasy woman who claims to be the wife of Harak Kata and her father. They had been arrested in Madagascar on 01 March, in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The INTERPOL had previously issued Red Notices against Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata had posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others pretended to be his bodyguards. The extradition process was coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. The Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on 03 October 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, six robberies and transnational drug trafficking. He has reportedly smuggled in nearly 670kg of heroin to Sri Lanka via sea routes.",

        "date": "March 29, 2023 10:31 pm",
        "content": "The countries of the United Nations led by the island nation of Vanuatu adopted what they called a historic resolution Wednesday calling for the U.N.s highest court to strengthen countries obligations to curb warming and protect communities from climate disaster. The resolution was adopted by consensus and Vanuatu Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau called it a win for climate justice of epic proportions. He reeled off a string of recent disasters including back-to-back Category 4 cyclones in his own country and record-breaking Cyclone Freddy that refused to leave southeastern Africa in recent weeks. Catastrophic and compound effects like this are growing in number, he said. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday he hoped the opinion, when issued, would encourage nations to take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs. Saudi Arabia and Iraq sought to soften the resolution saying it would increase the workload of the international court. Some 132 countries co-sponsored the resolution. Vanuatu has not only faced the recent cyclones, it is also at risk of rising seas engulfing swathes of the islands. Scientists say both extreme weather and sea levels have worsened because of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The resolution specifically asks the court to pay particular attention to harms for small island nations. Youth groups were also involved in the effort, citing the need to protect the planet for current and future generations. I dont want to show a picture to my child one day of my island. I want my child to be able to experience the same environment and the same culture that I grew up in, said Cynthia Houniuhi, whos from the Solomon Islands and is president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, a group involved in getting the resolution to the U.N.s General Assembly. The environment that sustains us is disintegrating before our eyes. The groups Solomon Yeo added that young people across the world will recall the day when we were able to get the worlds highest court, the International Court of Justice, to bring its voice to the climate justice fight. The U.N.s International Court of Justice is the bodys highest court and can provide an advisory opinion on any legal question asked by states, said Nilufer Oral, the director at the Center for International Law at the University of Singapore. While the opinion isnt binding, it would encourage states to actually go back and look at what they havent been doing and what they need to do to address the climate emergency. The resolution now goes to the International Court of Justice, to clarify climate obligations and then begin proceedings. Countries have agreed to aim to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) with an upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) back in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement. The agreement asks countries to submit their plans to curb greenhouse gases to the United Nations and regularly revise and update those plans. Clarifying those obligations for states, as well as other promises to protect biodiversity and strengthen domestic policies are the main aims of the advisory opinion, said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatus climate change minister. We are also clear eyed that existing international frameworks have significant gaps, he said, adding that the advisory opinion could push for stronger legal measures like negotiating a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty or criminalizing climate destroying activities.

        "date": "March 29, 2023 10:39 pm",
        "content": "The State Trade Corporation (STC) says the distribution of imported eggs to bakery owners commenced this evening (March 29). A spokesperson of the STC stated that the stock of eggs imported from India would be provided for the bakery owners at a rate of Rs. 35 per egg. A shortage of eggs emerged in the country as a result of the steep rise in the price of eggs. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) had also launched raids as it was reported that some vendors were selling eggs above the controlled price for the eggs announced by the government. The officials of the CAA today (March 29) raided five shops in the Kiribathgoda area, where eggs were sold at higher rates. Against this backdrop, the government decided to import eggs in a bid to take this situation under control. Six days after the arrival of the imported eggs in Sri Lanka, approvals were finally given yesterday (March 28) by the Department of Animal Production and Health to release the consignment from the port. Accordingly, the STC notified that it took measures to distribute the consignment of imported eggs. The imported eggs can be kept stored for a period of 90 days, according to a spokesperson of the STC.",

        "title": "Pope Francis spends night in hospital after breathing issues",
        "date": "March 30, 2023 07:52 am",
        "content": "Vatican City (AFP)  Pope Francis spent the night in hospital in Rome, where the 86-year-old will continue receiving treatment on Thursday for what the Vatican has said is a respiratory infection. A spokesman initially said the pontiff had been admitted to Romes Gemelli hospital Wednesday for previously scheduled tests -- but in a later statement revealed that Francis had complained in previous days of breathing difficulties. Tests showed a respiratory infection that was not Covid-19, requiring a few days of appropriate hospital medical treatment, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. A Vatican source told AFP that the popes appointments for Thursday morning had been cancelled. Francis admission -- which prompted a few dozen journalists to camp outside the hospital Wednesday night -- came a few weeks after marking a decade as head of the Catholic Church. It also comes just ahead of Holy Week and Easter, Christianitys most important holiday. Over the past year Francis has suffered from chronic knee pain that has required him to use a wheelchair. His postponement last year of a scheduled trip to Africa and various events at home fueled intense speculation about his health, and in a July 2022 interview he acknowledged that he needed to slow down. At his weekly audience at the Vatican on Wednesday morning, the pope appeared in good spirits, smiling as he greeted the faithful from his popemobile. But he was seen visibly grimacing as he was helped getting into the vehicle. Francis was admitted in July 2021 to the same Rome hospital for 10 days for an operation on his colon after suffering from a type of diverticulitis, an inflammation of pockets that develop in the lining of the intestine. In an interview in January, Francis said the diverticulitis had returned. Francis has repeatedly said, most recently in February, that he would consider stepping down if his health required it, following the example of his predecessor Benedict XVI. He has cautioned, however, that papal resignations should not be the norm, and said in an interview last month that the idea was currently not on my agenda. Benedict, who died on December 31, shocked the world in 2013 by becoming the first pope since the Middle Ages to resign. In 1957, at age 21, Francis had part of one of his lungs removed, but he has said he made a full recovery. At age 86, Francis keeps a busy schedule at home and continues to travel internationally. Earlier this year, he visited South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, drawing huge crowds. Next month, he is due to visit Hungary and meet Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In the past decade, Francis has sought to forge an image of a more open, compassionate Church, although has faced internal opposition, particularly from conservatives. Source: AFP --Agencies",
