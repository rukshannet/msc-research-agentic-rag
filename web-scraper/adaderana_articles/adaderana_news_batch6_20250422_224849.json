        "content": "Israel launched an attack on the Lebanese capital Beirut on Friday for the first time since a ceasefire ended fighting between Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group in November. Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a large boom and witnessed smoke billowing from the area that Israels military had vowed to strike. Earlier Friday, Israels army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Hezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon. Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since a ceasefire took hold in November 2024, mostly targeting Hezbollah. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "India, Sri Lanka set to ink major defence pact next week",
        "date": "March 29, 2025 09:22 am",
        "content": "For the first time, India and Sri Lanka are set to sign an ambitious defence cooperation pact during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Colombo next week, in a significant move that comes nearly four decades after the IPKFs intervention in the island nation. The two sides are also likely to firm up a currency swap framework and seal several other agreements including one on debt restructuring following talks between Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Disanayaka on April 5, people familiar with the matter said. An arrangement to develop the Trincomalee oil firms jointly by India, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates is also being finalised, they said. In the second and final leg of his two-nation tour, Modi will arrive in Sri Lanka on the evening of April 4 on a three-day trip after concluding his visit to Thailand. At a media briefing Friday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) on defence cooperation is expected to be inked and it is being signed for the first time. If signed, the MoU on defence cooperation is set to signal a major upward trajectory in India-Sri Lanka defence leaving behind the bitter chapter relating to India pulling out the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) from the island nation around 35 years ago. Finer details of the proposed defence pact are not immediately available but it is expected to enhance the two-way defence engagements against the backdrop of Chinas increasing presence in the Indian Ocean Region. The docking of Chinese missile and satellite tracking ship Yuan Wang at Hambantota port in August 2022 had triggered a diplomatic row between India and Sri Lanka. Another Chinese warship docked at the Colombo port in August 2023. Sri Lanka is an integral part of our Neighbourhood First policy and the relationship, based on mutual trust and good will, has stood the test of time, Misri said on the overall relations. Modis visit will focus on promoting investments and deepening connectivity -- physical connectivity, digital connectivity, energy connectivity and boost cooperation in various other domains, he said. Modi will be the first foreign leader to be hosted by Disanayaka in his capacity as the Sri Lankan president. Modi last travelled to Sri Lanka in 2019. The prime ministers trip to Sri Lanka comes over three months after Disanayaka visited India during which he categorically conveyed to Modi that the island nation will not allow its territory to be used against New Delhis security interests. India has come to the assistance of Sri Lanka at critical moments, most recently during the unprecedented economic crisis that it faced in 2022, Misri said. India was glad to be able to play a key role in economic stabilisation and recovery of Sri lanka, demonstrating its commitment as a dependable neighbour to Sri Lanka, he said. Misri said Modis visit to the island nation comes in the context of a recovering Sri Lankan economy. As Sri Lanka resumes its growth path, the visit is coming at an opportune moment for giving the two countries an opportunity to explore new areas of partnership and cooperation, he added. Sri Lanka was reeling under a massive economic crisis two years back and India extended financial assistance worth USD 4.5 billion to the country. The foreign secretary said Modi is expected to raise the fishermen issue during his talks with Disanayaka. This is a longstanding issue, Misri said, adding India has been highlighting the need to avoid use of force under all circumstances.The foreign secretary said a long-lasting solution can be found through constructive engagement. In Colombo, Modi and Disanayaka will dedicate several projects that are being built in that country with Indias assistance. We will also witness exchange of several MoUs pertaining to energy connectivity, digitisation, health and multi-sectoral grant assistance, Misri said. The two leaders will also witness the virtual ground breaking of the Sampur solar energy project. This is in many senses going to be a milestone in the bilateral partnership, Misri said. Modi is also scheduled to meet several political leaders. On April 6, Modi and Disanayaka will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura where they will pay their respects at the Mahabodhi temple. They will also jointly inaugurate two India-assisted projects there, according to Misri. India-Sri Lanka bilateral ties witnessed upward trajectory in the last few years. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 29, 2025 09:38 am",
        "content": "A powerful earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, March 28, causing extensive damage across a wide swath of one of the worlds poorest countries and prompting officials to warn that the initial death toll was updated to 694 dead, 1,670 injured, according to the junta on Saturday. In Thailand, authorities in Bangkok said six people were killed, 22 were injured and 101 were missing from three construction sites, including the high-rise. They revised the death toll Saturday morning from 10 reported the previous day, saying several critically injured people were mistakenly reported dead. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said that more people were believed to be alive in the wreckage as search efforts continued Saturday morning. The 7.7 magnitude quake struck at midday, with an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmars second-largest city. Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. Myanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The US Geological Survey, an American government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000. In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the citys largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants. Source: Lemonde --Agencies",

        "title": "Myanmars earthquake death toll jumps to over 1,000 as more bodies recovered from rubble",
        "date": "March 29, 2025 01:28 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar jumped to more than 1,000 on Saturday as more bodies were pulled from the rubble of the scores of buildings that collapsed when it struck near the countrys second-largest city. The countrys military-led government said in a statement that 1,002 people have now been found dead and another 2,376 injured, with 30 others missing. The statement suggested the numbers could still rise, saying detailed figures are still being collected. Myanmar is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously. The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks including one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads, caused bridges to collapse and burst a dam. In the capital Naypyidaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday. In neighboring Thailand, the quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to some 17 million people  many of whom live in high-rise buildings  and other parts of the country. Bangkok city authorities said so far six people have been found dead, 26 injured and 47 are still missing, most from a construction site near the capitals popular Chatuchak market. When the quake hit, the 33-story high-rise being built by a Chinese firm for the Thai government wobbled, then came crashing to the ground in a massive plume of dust that sent people screaming and fleeing from the scene. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and family members of the missing that they would be found alive. I was praying that that they had survived but when I got here and saw the ruin  where could they be? In which corner? Are they still alive? I am still praying that all six are alive, said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site. I cannot accept this. When I see this I cant accept this. A close friend of mine is in there, too, she said. Waenphet Panta said she hadnt heard from her daughter Kanlayanee since a phone call about an hour before the quake. A friend told her Kanlayanee had been working high on the building on Friday. I am praying my daughter is safe, that she has survived and that shes at the hospital, she said, Kanlayanees father sitting beside her. Myanmar sits on a major fault line Earthquakes are rare in Bangkok, but relatively common in Myanmar. The country sits on the Sagaing Fault, a major north-south fault that separates the India plate and the Sunda plate. Brian Baptie, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said it appears a 200-kilometer (125-mile) section of the fault ruptured for just over a minute, with a slip of up to 5 meters (16.4 feet) in places, causing intense ground shaking in an area where most of the population lives in buildings constructed of timber and unreinforced brick masonry. When you have a large earthquake in an area where there are over a million people, many of them living in vulnerable buildings, the consequences can often be disastrous, he said in a statement. From initial reports, that seems likely to be the case here. A natural disaster on top of a civil war Myanmars government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept outside assistance. Myanmars military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. Although a full picture of the damage is still emerging, most of us have never seen such destruction, said Haider Yaqub, Myanmar country director for the NGO Plan International, from Yangon. Without a doubt, the humanitarian needs will be significant. Rescue groups head to Myanmar China and Russia are the largest suppliers of weapons to Myanmars military, and were among the first to step in with humanitarian aid. A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached the city of Yangon early Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Russias emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as provisions, while Malaysias foreign ministry said the country will send 50 people on Sunday to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. South Korea announced it would provide 2 million worth of humanitarian aid to Myanmar through international organizations to support recovery efforts. The Foreign Ministry added that Seoul would closely monitor the situation and consider additional support if needed. The United Nations allocated 5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administrations deep cuts in foreign assistance. The Trump administrations cuts to the United States Agency for International Development have already forced the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to cut many programs in Myanmar.

The bravery and selflessness of these women amid uncertainty was the very definition of courage.",

        "date": "March 30, 2025 10:19 am",
        "content": "Myanmars military rulers let in hundreds of foreign rescue personnel on Saturday after an earthquake killed more than 1,600 people, the deadliest natural disaster to hit the impoverished, war-torn country in years. Fridays 7.7 magnitude quake, among the biggest to jolt the Southeast Asian nation in the last century, crippled airports, bridges and highways amid a civil war that has wrecked the economy and displaced millions. The death toll in Myanmar climbed to 1,644, the military government said on Saturday, according to BBC Burmese news service. In neighbouring Thailand, where the quake rattled buildings and brought down a skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, at least nine people were killed. Survivors in Mandalay, Myanmars second-biggest city, dug with their bare hands on Friday in desperate attempts to save those still trapped, lacking heavy machinery and with authorities absent. In Bangkok on Saturday, rescue operations continued at the site of the 33-story towers collapse, where 47 people were missing or trapped under the rubble - including workers from Myanmar. The U.S. Geological Services predictive modelling estimated Myanmars death toll could exceed 10,000 and losses could exceed the countrys annual economic output. A day after making a rare call for international assistance, Myanmars junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, travelled to hard-hit Mandalay near the epicentre of the quake, which brought down buildings and triggered fires in some areas. The Chairman of the State Administration Council instructed authorities to expedite search and rescue efforts and address any urgent needs, the junta said in a statement on state media, referring to Min Aung Hlaing. Airports Closed An initial assessment by Myanmars opposition National Unity Government said at least 2,900 buildings, 30 roads and seven bridges had been damaged by the quake. Due to significant damage, Naypyitaw and Mandalay international airports are temporarily closed, said the NUG, which includes remnants of the elected civilian government ousted by the military in a 2021 coup that triggered the civil war. The control tower at the airport in Naypyitaw, Myanmars purpose-built capital city, collapsed, rendering it inoperable, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. A Myanmar junta spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment. Hospitals in central and northwestern Myanmar were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, warning that damage to roads was hindering access. Seventeen cargo trucks of shelter and medical supplies were due to arrive on Sunday to address shortages of medicines, including blood bags and anaesthetics, the agency added. A Chinese rescue team arrived at the airport in Myanmars commercial capital of Yangon, hundreds of kilometres from Mandalay and Naypyitaw, and will travel upcountry by bus, state media said. Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone with the junta chief, Chinas embassy in Myanmar said on Saturday, and said Beijing would provide 13.77 million worth of aid, including tents, blankets and emergency medical kits. The United States, which has a testy relationship with the Myanmar military and has sanctioned its officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, has said it would provide some assistance. Relief supplies from India on a military aircraft also landed in Yangon, according to Myanmar state media, and Indias government said it was also dispatching ships with 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid. Russia, Malaysia and Singapore were also sending planeloads of relief supplies and personnel. No Help Coming Residents in the hardest-hit areas are desperate for the help. The quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, affected wide swathes of Myanmar, from the central plains around Mandalay to the hills of Shan in the east, parts of which are not completely under the juntas control. Rescue operations in Mandalay could not match the scale of the disaster, one resident said by phone, asking not to be named because of security concerns. Many people are trapped but there is no help coming just simply because there isnt manpower or equipment or vehicles, he said. In Bangkok, 1,000 km (620 miles) from the epicentre, authorities on Saturday pushed ahead with efforts to find construction workers trapped under the rubble of the collapsed tower, using excavators, drones and search-and-rescue dogs. Thailands Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said all possible resources had been deployed to search for survivors and to bring out bodies of the deceased. We always have hope, he told reporters. Were still working around the clock. Chanpen Kaewnoi, 39, said she rushed over on Friday afternoon after seeing news reports that the under-construction building where her mother and younger sister were working had collapsed. I called my sister, but no matter how many times I tried to call her there was no connection, she said after a sleepless night at the site. I want to wait for my mother and sister, said Chanpen, herself a construction worker, I want to see their faces again. Across the sprawling metropolis, where such quakes are rare, there may be up to 5,000 damaged buildings, including residential towers, said Anek Siripanichgorn, a board member of Council of Engineers Thailand, which is helping municipal authorities. We are going through hundreds of cases, he said. If we see cases where there is potential danger, we will immediately send engineers. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 30, 2025 10:53 am",
        "content": "Hamas has agreed to a new Egyptian proposal to release 5 hostages, including the American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a renewed ceasefire, a Hamas source tells CNN. The proposal is similar to one presented several weeks ago by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, although it is not clear whether it also includes the release of additional bodies of deceased hostages. In exchange for the release of 5 hostages, Hamas expects a return to phase 1 ceasefire conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid, as well as an agreement to negotiate the second phase of the ceasefire, the source said. In a televised address, Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya said the militant group enaged with the proposal positively before agreeing to it. Al-Hayya added that Hamas has fully abided by the terms of the first ceasefire deal and hopes Israel does not obstruct this proposal. Israel has responded to the Egyptian offer with a counter-proposal, according to a statement from the Israeli Prime Ministers office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted a series of consultations yesterday, following a proposal received from the mediators. In recent hours, Israel transferred its counter proposal to the mediators, in full coordination with the United States, the office said. Israel earlier this month renewed attacks in Gaza and imposed a complete blockade of humanitarian aid entering the enclave, warning that its forces will maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza until the release of the remaining 24 hostages who are believed to still be alive. According to health authorities in Gaza, at least 50,277 Palestinians have been killed and another 114,095 injured since Israels military offensive began in the enclave, following deadly terror attacks launched by Hamas on October 7, 2023.

        "date": "March 30, 2025 01:32 pm",
        "content": "A 17th-century painting looted by the Nazis in 1940 from a Jewish art collector in Belgium will be returned to his descendants after spending three decades in a London gallery, the British government said on Saturday. Samuel Hartveld and his wife were among those escaping Nazi persecution when they left Antwerp, leaving behind a number of belongings including the oil-on-canvas work Aeneas and his Family Fleeing Burning Troy. But, following a review by a British advisory body that looks into claims of Nazi theft, the government ordered the painting to be returned to Hartvelds heirs and great-grandchildren. The 1654 artwork by English painter Henry Gibbs depicts the mythological story of Aeneas, a Trojan hero, escaping with his family after the Greeks invade Troy using the trickery of the Trojan Horse. Bought by Londons Tate Britain gallery in 1994, the painting will change hands once again after the independent Spoliation Advisory Panel approved its repatriation following a review that began last May. The 10-member panel was set up in 2000 to consider claims from anyone of lost cultural property during the Nazi era that is now in a British public collection. The property, library and the paintings in (Hartvelds) gallery were looted as an act of racial persecution, the panel said in its recommendation, adding that the legal and moral arguments for returning the painting were obvious. A 2009 law allows British institutions to return objects related to the Holocaust and the Nazi era, if the arts minister agrees with the panels recommendation. But other laws forbid Britains biggest museums from permanently returning objects, many of which have long faced foreign repatriation demands on the grounds they were looted or forcibly taken during British colonial rule.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert, warning that hazardous waves could affect coastlines within 300 kilometres (185 miles) of the epicentre. Hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within 300 kilometres (186 miles) of the epicentre along the coasts of Tonga, the US tsunami warning system said.

Modi will begin a two-day visit to Sri Lanka on April 4. This visit represents a cherished milestone in the timeless relationship between our two great nations, a party statement said. The UNP said the visit presents an opportunity to strengthen the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision adopted in July 2023. The UNP recalls that Indias provision of USD 4 billion in assistance during Sri Lankas economic crisis was a testament to the depth of our friendship. The development of the eastern port district of Trincomalee jointly with India holds the potential to establish a dynamic centre for trade, energy and maritime activity and enforces regional connectivity. The UNP attaches importance to the proposed power grid interconnection to deliver affordable and reliable energy, the statement said. Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said the memorandum of understanding on the power grid integration between Sri Lankas northeastern Mannar and Indias southern region through an undersea cable would be one of the bilateral agreements to be entered during the visit. This partnership is ultimately dedicated to the well-being of our people, the UNP said. In hosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the UNP calls upon all stakeholders to reaffirm their dedication to this bilateral vision. This will be Modis fourth visit to Sri Lanka since assuming office in 2015. He last visited Sri Lanka in June 2019.

        "date": "March 31, 2025 06:25 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran on Sunday with bombing and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program. In Trumps first remarks since Iran rejected direct negotiations with Washington last week, he told NBC News that U.S. and Iranian officials were talking, but did not elaborate. If they dont make a deal, there will be bombing, Trump said in a telephone interview. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before. Theres a chance that if they dont make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago, he added. Iran sent a response through Oman to a letter from Trump urging Tehran to reach a new nuclear deal, saying its policy was to not engage in direct negotiations with the United States while under its maximum pressure campaign and military threats, Tehrans foreign minister was quoted as saying on Thursday. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated the policy on Sunday. Direct negotiations (with the U.S.) have been rejected, but Iran has always been involved in indirect negotiations, and now too, the Supreme Leader has emphasized that indirect negotiations can still continue, he said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the NBC interview, Trump also threatened so-called secondary tariffs, which affect buyers of a countrys goods, on both Russia and Iran. He signed an executive order last week authorizing such tariffs on buyers of Venezuelan oil. Trump did not elaborate on those potential tariffs. In his first 2017-21 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehrans disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions. Since then, the Islamic Republic has far surpassed the agreed limits in its escalating program of uranium enrichment. Tehran has so far rebuffed Trumps warning to make a deal or face military consequences. Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian energy purposes. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Presidents full Eid-ul-Fitr Message: Eid-ul-Fitr, celebrated by Muslims worldwide after a month of fasting and upon sighting the new moon, holds great significance in the Islamic religious calendar. Fasting during Ramadan, one of the five pillars of Islam, embodies the values of sacrifice, self-discipline and simplicity by distancing oneself from worldly desires. This period serves as a reminder of the importance of generosity towards those suffering from hunger and as an opportunity for self-restraint and spiritual growth, which devout Muslims deeply cherish. As Sri Lanka undergoes various social, economic and political transformations, the teachings of Islam provide an excellent example for building a society rooted in freedom, equality, solidarity and human dignity. I strongly believe that these values serve as guiding principles in our collective journey toward a just and harmonious nation. Furthermore, as we strive to foster a responsible and ethical political culture, one that values accountability over corruption and the misuse of public resources, the principles of self-restraint and sacrifice emphasized during Ramadan offer an inspiring model.

        "title": "Pissed off at Putin, Trump threatens tariffs on Russian oil if Moscow blocks Ukraine deal",
        "date": "March 31, 2025 09:26 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was pissed off at Russian President Vladimir Putin and will impose secondary tariffs of 25 to 50 on buyers of Russian oil if he feels Moscow is blocking his efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Trump told NBC News he was very angry after Putin last week criticized the credibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiys leadership, the television network reported, citing a telephone interview early on Sunday. Since taking office in January, Trump has adopted a more conciliatory stance towards Russia that has left Western allies wary as he tries to broker an end to Moscows three-year-old war in Ukraine. His sharp comments about Putin on Sunday reflect his growing frustration about the lack of movement on a ceasefire. If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russias fault ... I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia, Trump said. That would be, that if you buy oil from Russia, you cant do business in the United States, Trump said. There will be a 25 tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil. Trump later reiterated to reporters he was disappointed with Putin but added: I think we are making progress, step by step. Trump said he could impose the new trade measures within a month. There was no immediate reaction from Moscow. Russia has called numerous Western sanctions and restrictions illegal and designed for the West to take economic advantage in its rivalry with Russia. Trump, who spent the weekend at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, told NBC News he planned to speak with Putin this week. The two leaders have had two publicly announced telephone calls in recent months but may have had more contacts, the Kremlin said in video footage last week. The White House had no immediate comment on when the call would take place, or if Trump would also speak with Zelenskiy. Trump has focused heavily on ending what he calls a ridiculous war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but has made little progress. Putin on Friday suggested Ukraine could be placed under a form of temporary administration to allow for new elections that could push out Zelenskiy. Trump, who himself has called for new elections in Ukraine and denounced Zelenskiy as a dictator, said Putin knows he is angry with him. But Trump added he had a very good relationship with him and the anger dissipates quickly ... if he does the right thing. Trumps comments followed a day of meetings and golf with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on Saturday, during Stubbs surprise visit to Florida. Stubbs office on Sunday said he told Trump a deadline needs to be set for establishing a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire to make it happen and suggested April 20 since Trump would have been in office then for three months. U.S. officials have been separately pushing Kyiv to accept a critical minerals agreement, a summary of which suggested the U.S. was demanding all Ukraines natural resources income for years. Zelenskiy has said Kyivs lawyers need to review the draft before he can say more about the U.S. offer. Trump told reporters on Air Force One he thought Zelenskiy was trying to back out of the rare earth deal.... if hes looking to renegotiate the deal, hes got big problems. Trump also told reporters that Ukraine would never be part of NATO. Trumps latest tariff threats would add to the pain already facing China, India and other countries through trade measures imposed during his first two months in office, including duties on steel, aluminum and cars. More duties on imports from the countries with the largest trade surpluses are slated to be announced on Wednesday. William Reinsch, a former senior Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the haphazard way Trump was announcing and threatening tariffs leaves many questions unanswered, including how U.S. officials could trace and prove which countries were buying Russian oil. Trump set the stage for Sundays news with a 25 secondary tariff imposed last week on U.S. imports from any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela. His remarks to NBC suggest he could take similar action against U.S. imports from countries that buy oil from Russia, a move that could hit China and India particularly hard. The U.S. has not imported any Russian barrels of crude oil since April 2022, according to U.S. government data. Before that, U.S. refiners bought inconsistent volumes of Russian oil, with a high of 98.1 million barrels in 2010 and low of 6.6 million in 2014, according to a review of EIA data since 2000. India has surpassed China to become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, which comprised about 35 of Indias total crude imports in 2024. Trump on Sunday also said he could hit buyers of Iranian oil with secondary sanctions if Tehran did not reach an agreement to end their nuclear weapons program. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has announced that a bill aimed at recovering illegally acquired assets will be presented to the Parliament on April 8 by the government. Speaking at a public meeting in the Welipitiya area of Matara, the President emphasized that individuals involved in fraud and corruption would not be allowed to govern the country again. How does a government punish the corrupt? How does a government punish criminals? What is the governments role? There are several laws for the government. On April 8, we will pass legislation in Parliament to recover stolen and illegally accumulated wealth. This bill is not about personal revenge but about upholding the law and restoring sovereignty in our motherland, he stated. Additionally, the President announced that proposals for the 2026 Budget would be accepted starting from June this year. Meanwhile, speaking on the countrys economic recovery, President Dissanayake highlighted that several foreign-funded projects abandoned due to the economic crisis would be recommenced. The Japanese government halted 11 projects that had been funded through loans from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). However, they have now agreed to resume all 11 projects, which indicates economic stability. He further stated that the construction of the Kadawatha-Mirigama highway section, which was financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, was suspended when the country declared bankruptcy. This suspension resulted in an estimated loss of Rs. 56,000 million, while an interest payment of Rs. 21 million per day was required to be paid to a Chinese company. Following discussions with the Chinese government during our recent visit, an agreement was reached to resume the halted projects, including the expressway, and to initiate 76 new projects. This is a clear indication that the economy is stabilizing, the President added.",

The agreement seeks to create an exchange forum to facilitate technology development and sharing, human resource sharing, product development, regulatory collaboration, investor protection, and knowledge exchange across the three markets, reads a press statement issued by the DSE. The MoU signing ceremony held in Colombo was attended by DSE Chairman Mominul Islam, Colombo Stock Exchange Chairman Dilshan Wirasekara, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan Chairman Akif Saeed, along with directors and senior officials of the institutions. Commenting on this initiative, DSE Chairman Mominul said, Due to their small size, stock exchanges in South Asia, except India, have technical and procedural limitations. Due to resource constraints, these highly promising stock exchanges are failing to achieve their desired capabilities. Through the mutual exchange of resources and experience and joint investment in technology, our stock exchanges will be able to play an effective role in building efficient and strong capital markets in their respective countries. Working together, we can unlock opportunities for prosperity and innovation in our financial ecosystem, which will bring benefits to investors and stakeholders. DSE Directors Md Shakil Rizvi, Minhaj Mannan Emon, Richard D Rosario, and General Manager and Company Secretary Mohammad Asadur Rahman, FCS were also present on the occasion as part of the DSE delegation. Meanwhile, the PSX, in a statement, said, This initiative will foster deeper regional cooperation among the three South Asian nations while creating new opportunities for investors and market participants across the region. Joint initiatives in system development and digital transformation, cross-exchange training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives, collaborative development of new financial instruments, harmonization of market oversight and investor protection frameworks, exploration of cross-border listing opportunities to expand investor access and facilitation of broker partnerships and institutional connectivity were listed in the PSX statement as the key areas of collaboration under the MoU. This strategic partnership marks a significant step forward in regional market integration. By combining our strengths, these three exchanges can drive innovation, enhance market resilience, and create new opportunities for investors across South Asia, said Akif Saeed, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), who was present at the ceremony. Farrukh H Sabzwari, MD  CEO of PSX, said the agreement represented a transformative chapter in regional capital market cooperation. Through this partnership with our counterparts in Colombo and Dhaka, we aim to elevate market standards, foster sustainable growth, and deliver greater value to all market participants, he added. The MoU establishes a formal platform for ongoing dialogue and joint initiatives, with working groups to be formed to implement the cooperation framework.

The earthquake, whose epicenter was near Mandalay, brought down scores of buildings and damaged other infrastructure like the citys airport. Relief efforts have been hampered by buckled roads, downed bridges, spotty communications and the challenges of operating in a country engaged in a civil war. In neighboring Thailand, the quake rocked much of the country and killed at least 18 people, many at a construction site in Bangkok where a partially built high-rise collapsed.

        "date": "March 31, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "Apple is reportedly planning a major shift in its iPhone lineup with the upcoming iPhone 17 series, introducing a brand-new model called the iPhone 17 Air. Leaks suggest that this model might replace the Plus variant, which has seen lackluster sales in recent years. The new device is expected to focus on an ultra-slim and lightweight design, potentially making it Apples thinnest iPhone ever. iPhone 17 Air: Expected Launch Date Apple traditionally launches new iPhones in September, and the iPhone 17 Air is expected to follow the same timeline. Reports suggest that the official unveiling could take place between September 11 and 13, 2025, alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup. However, Apple has yet to confirm these details officially. One of the most talked-about aspects of the iPhone 17 Air is its razor-thin design. Leaks indicate that the phone could measure between 5.5mm and 6.25mm in thickness, making it the slimmest iPhone to date. This is a significant reduction compared to Apples previous thinnest model, the iPhone 6, which measured 6.9mm. A recent leak by tipster Majin Bu showcased 3D-printed models of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Air side by side, highlighting the stark contrast in thickness. The Air model appeared noticeably slimmer than the Pro variant, sparking excitement among fans of compact smartphones. Whats Under the Hood? The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to feature a 6.6-inch ProMotion OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and Always-On functionality. The device could be powered by Apples upcoming A19 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM. Additionally, it is expected to support Apple Intelligence features, enhancing AI-driven capabilities across the system. Camera: A Single-Lens Setup? Unlike the Pro models, the iPhone 17 Air might not include an ultrawide lens. Leaks suggest that the device could come with a single 48MP primary camera offering 2x optical zoom. On the front, users may get a 24MP selfie camera for detailed and vibrant self-portraits. Will It Support 8K Video Recording? An interesting leak from Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital hints that 8K video recording may not be exclusive to the Pro models. The leak stated, With 8K in your hand, iPhone 17 series should expect more. If true, this would mark a major upgrade for non-Pro models, which have traditionally lagged behind in camera capabilities. However, some reports suggest Apple might reserve this feature for the iPhone 17 Pro lineup to maintain product differentiation. Achieving such a slim design may come with some compromises. Reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Air could house a smaller battery, although Apple might use high-density battery technology to optimize power efficiency. The camera bump remains, with reports indicating a 4.4mm module, making the thickest part of the device around 9.9mm. iPhone 17 Air Price in India: What to Expect? The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to be priced at approximately Rs 89,900 for the base 128GB model. This places it in the premium category, though slightly more affordable than the Pro models. While these leaks provide an exciting glimpse into what Apple might have in store, its important to take them with caution until Apple makes an official announcement. If the rumors hold true, the iPhone 17 Air could be a game-changer for users who prefer a sleek and lightweight iPhone over bulkier, feature-packed alternatives.

        "content": "Days ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to his country, Sri Lankan minister for fisheries, aquatic and ocean resources Ramalingam Chandrasekar has said that govt level talks on the fishing dispute between Sri Lanka and India would be held soon in the presence of fishermen. He issued the statement on Sunday after a delegation of fishermen from Rameswaram held a meeting with him in Jaffna on Saturday evening. The delegation, led by fishermen leader R Sahayam, appealed to the minister to initiate talks between fishermen of the two countries. The last ministerial level talks on the dispute were held in 2016. Calling for a lasting solution to the problem, the delegation pleaded with the minister to secure the release of Indian fishermen and their fishing crafts held in the island nations custody. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to visit Sri Lanka on April 4, and the fishermen row is likely to be one of the issues that will figure in his meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart. Meanwhile, the delegation from Rameswaram met fishermen lodged in Sri Lankan prisons, and took stock of the fishing crafts confiscated by the authorities on charges of poaching in Sri Lankas territorial waters. The fishermen leaders had met their counterparts at Vavuniya on March 26 and discussed the issue. The Indian side sought time to stop trawling but the Sri Lankan fishermen made it clear that trawling wont be accepted in their waters, though they are ready for an amicable solution. Reiterating this stand, leaders of the Northern Province Fisher People Unity, an umbrella forum of fishermen associations of the northern provinces of Sri Lanka, told reporters on Sunday that Indian trawlers should stop coming to Sri Lankan waters. Else, their countrys law should find its course to stop it. They are determined that their people should fish in their waters independently and leave the marine resources for future generations, said forum spokesperson Annarasa Annalingam.

According to the Bloomberg report, Apples team is working on Project Mulberry, which will see the Apple Health app completely revamped, adding a health coach via an AI agent to replicate some of the analysis done by a real doctor. Reportedly, Apples upcoming Health app will collect data from all the users devices like iPhone, Apple Watch, earbuds and even third-party products. The AI agent in the app will then use this data to make personalised recommendations to improve the users health. Apple is reportedly currently training its AI agent using data from doctors on its staff, with plans to bring in outside doctors. The Tim Cook-led company is also said to be opening a facility near Oakland, California, where doctors can shoot their video content for the app, and is looking for a great doctor personality to act as a host of sorts for its revamped Health app. While Gurman doesnt go into detail about this doctor personality, this could potentially be an attempt to add a human angle to the app, similar to how Google and OpenAI have used human artists to create voices for their chatbots. The new health app is said to be a priority for Sumbul Desai, the doctor who runs Apples health team. The companys chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, is also heavily involved in the project. Gurman hints that development of the project is in full steam, and the revamped app could be released as early as iOS 19.4. Apples iOS 19 will be announced at its WWDC 2025 event on 9-13 June, with the stable update due to arrive with iPhone 17 sometime in September. Apple is due to release its iOS 18.4 update on 1 April (not an April Fools joke), and if work on the Health app overhaul goes on as expected, we could see the companys AI Doctor in action around the same time next year. While Apple has made big bets on artificial intelligence in recent times, the company has yet to see any significant payoffs as rivals like Google and Samsung continue to add new features while its own efforts hit roadblocks. Apple first unveiled its AI efforts with iOS 18 at WWDC 2024 last year. While Google and Samsung had already rolled out many of their iconic features, such as Circle to Search, by then, Apples foray into AI was still met with a lot of optimism, given the companys history of getting features right rather than rolling them out quickly. However, Apples rollout of AI features, which it calls Apple Intelligence, has been patchy at best. Most of the features announced at WWDC 2024 were not available when the iPhone 16 hit the shelves last year. These features have been released in stages since then. Even Apples news summary feature, which was introduced with the iOS 18.3 beta update, caused a stir when the BBC and many other news outlets criticised its inaccurate results, prompting the company to stop showing AI-generated summaries for news and entertainment apps.

        "content": "A French court on Monday convicted French far-right leader Marine Le Pen of misusing European Union funds in an alleged fake jobs scheme. Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate and head of the National Rally party, had denied any wrongdoing. But prosecutors called for a five-year suspended prison sentence, a 300,000 (324,000) fine and a five-year ban on holding public office  a move that would prevent her from running in the next presidential election if upheld. The ban would apply immediately even if Le Pen appeals, according to the prosecutions request submitted last year. That effectively eliminates the far-right figurehead from the 2027 race at a time when she is seen as having her strongest chance yet at winning the presidency. Le Pen has argued the case is politically motivated and has framed it as part of an effort to weaken her ahead of the next national vote. A ruling that bars her from office makes for a major shakeup in French politics, as polls suggest she is a leading contender to succeed President Emmanuel Macron, who is not eligible to run again.

        "date": "March 31, 2025 05:42 pm",
        "content": "Myanmars military leadership declared a week of national mourning on Monday with flags to fly at half-mast until April 6 in sympathy for the loss of life and damages from a massive quake, which has killed more than 2,000 people. In Thailand, hopes faded of finding more survivors amid the rubble. Myanmar quake death toll rises to 2,056 The death toll in Myanmar has risen to 2,056, the ruling junta said Monday, with more than 3,900 people injured. A statement from a junta spokesperson said that 270 more people were still missing. Survivors were pulled out of rubble in Myanmar and signs of life were detected in the ruins of a skyscraper in Bangkok on Monday as efforts intensified to find people trapped three days after a massive earthquake in Southeast Asia that killed around 2,000. Rescuers freed four people, including a pregnant woman and a girl, from collapsed buildings in Mandalay, the city in central Myanmar near the epicentre of Fridays 7.7-magnitude earthquake, Chinas Xinhua news agency reported. A civil war in the Southeast Asian nation, where a military junta seized power in a coup in 2021, was complicating efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by Myanmars biggest quake in a century. Access to all victims is an issue...given the conflict situation. There are a lot of security issues to access some areas across the front lines in particular, Arnaud de Baecque, resident representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Myanmar, told Reuters. One rebel group said Myanmars ruling military was still conducting airstrikes on villages in the aftermath of the quake, and Singapores foreign minister called for an immediate ceasefire to help relief efforts. In the Thai capital Bangkok, rescuers pulled out another body from the rubble of an under-construction skyscraper that collapsed in the quake, bringing the death toll from the building collapse to 12, with a total of 19 dead across Thailand and 75 still missing at the building site. Scanning machines and sniffer dogs were deployed at the site and Bangkoks Deputy Governor Tavida Kamolvej said rescuers were urgently working out how to access an area where signs of life had been detected, three days on from the quake. Realistic chances of survival diminish after 72 hours, she said, adding: We have to speed up. Were not going to stop even after 72 hours. In Myanmar, state media said at least 1,700 people have been confirmed dead as of Sunday and that the military government had declared a week-long mourning period from Monday. The Wall Street Journal, citing the junta, reported the death toll had reached 2,028 in Myanmar. Reuters could not immediately confirm the new death toll. Media access has been restricted in the country since the junta took power. Junta chief General Min Aung Hlaing warned at the weekend that the number of fatalities could rise. RELIEF EFFORTS China, India and Thailand are among Myanmars neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia. It doesnt matter how long we work. The most important thing is that we can bring hope to the local people, said Yue Xin, head of the China Search and Rescue Team that pulled people out of the rubble in Mandalay, Xinhua reported. The United Nations said it was rushing relief supplies to survivors in central Myanmar. Our teams in Mandalay are joining efforts to scale up the humanitarian response despite going through the trauma themselves, said Noriko Takagi, the U.N. refugee agencys representative in Myanmar. The United States pledged 2 million in aid through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organizations. It said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, is deploying to Myanmar. The quake devastation has piled more misery on Myanmar, already in chaos from a civil war that grew after the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted by the military. Critical infrastructure - including bridges, highways, airports and railways - across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system, rages on. We see devastated communities across the country in Mandalay and (the capital) Naypyidaw in particular...People are still sleeping outside, cant access their homes, so they dont have capacity to cook their meals, said the ICRCs de Baecque. All the health structures that have been damaged... are not delivering what they were doing in terms of healthcare and have a difficulty to absorb extra needs. --With agencies inputs",

Drawing parallels to Sri Lankas past humanitarian efforts, he recalled the countrys response to the 2015 Nepal earthquake. When there was an earthquake in Nepal, we deployed an army team and provided the second-largest aid package after India. Today, countries like India, Thailand, Malaysia, China, and even Australiadespite being farther awayhave extended assistance to Myanmar. We must also take action, he urged. Wickremesinghe further suggested mobilizing medical supplies from Colombo and other regions to support relief efforts, stating, We can collect the necessary medicines and send them to Myanmar. This is about maintaining our regional ties and playing a responsible role in humanitarian aid. The former President also referenced Sri Lankas past contributions to global crises, highlighting a recent donation to Gaza. Last year, I allocated one million dollars from Sri Lanka for Gaza. Similarly, I propose that we take immediate action to support Myanmar in this time of need, he stated.",

        "date": "March 31, 2025 09:35 pm",
        "content": "Israels military on Monday issued sweeping evacuation orders covering Rafah and nearby areas, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation in the Gaza Strips southernmost city. Israel ended its ceasefire with the Hamas militant group and renewed its air and ground war earlier this month. At the beginning of March it cut off all supplies of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to the territorys roughly 2 million Palestinians to pressure Hamas to accept proposed changes to the truce agreement. Israels military ordered Palestinians to head to Muwasi, a sprawl of squalid tent camps along the coast. The orders came during Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive Muslim holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Last May, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, leaving large parts in ruins. The military seized a strategic corridor along the border as well as the Rafah crossing with Egypt, Gazas only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel. Israel was supposed to withdraw from the corridor under the ceasefire it signed with Hamas in January under U.S. pressure, but it later refused to do it, citing the need to prevent weapons smuggling. Medics killed by Israeli fire are buried Dozens gathered at a funeral for some of the 15 emergency responders killed by Israeli fire during a ground operation in Rafah last week. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies called it the deadliest attack on its medics in several years. Raed al-Nems, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, said the paramedics were killed in cold blood despite wearing uniforms and operating in clearly labeled ambulances. At funeral prayers, their shrouds were draped with Red Crescent banners. Israels military has said its forces opened fire on several vehicles that raised suspicions by advancing without headlights or emergency signals. The military said a Hamas operative and eight other militants were among those killed. The United Nations humanitarian office said the dead included eight Red Crescent workers, six members of Gazas Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, and a U.N. worker. Rescuers were only allowed to access the area nearly a week later to recover the bodies. Footage of Sundays recovery operation released by the U.N. showed Civil Defense workers digging into a mound of sand and pulling out a body wearing the same orange vest as theirs. Netanyahu vows to implement Trumps Gaza plan Israel has vowed to intensify its military operations until Hamas releases the remaining 59 hostages it holds  24 of them believed to be alive. Israel has also demanded that Hamas disarm and leave the territory, conditions that were not included in the ceasefire agreement and which Hamas has rejected. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel would take charge of security in Gaza after the war and implement U.S. President Donald Trumps proposal to resettle Gazas population in other countries, describing it as voluntary emigration. That plan has been universally rejected by Palestinians, who view it as forcible expulsion from their homeland. Human rights experts say it would likely violate international law. Hamas has insisted on implementing the signed agreement, which called for the remainder of the hostages to be released in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout. Negotiations over those parts of the agreement were supposed to begin in February but only preliminary talks have been held. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, rampaging through army bases and farming communities and killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militants took another 251 people hostage, most of whom have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israels retaliatory offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. At its height, the war had displaced some 90 of Gazas population, with many fleeing multiple times. Large areas of Gaza have been destroyed, and its unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt.

        "content": "At least 17 Tesla cars were destroyed after a fire broke out at a dealership on the outskirts of Rome on Monday morning, according to Italian fire officials. No one was at the dealership when the fire broke out and no injuries have been reported. Romes fire service said it was investigating all avenues while looking into how the fire started, but it did not rule out arson. Local police said officers interviewed the dealership owners and are looking at surveillance footage. The fire comes after a string of reports across Italy in recent weeks of Tesla vehicles being vandalized and defaced, with anti-Elon Musk and anti-Donald Trump sentiments written with spray paint. Another car dealership burned down in northern Rome a week ago, destroying 30 cars, including used Teslas. That fire was initially blamed on an electrical fault, but an investigation is underway. Also in Rome, several Teslas in the Garbatella neighborhood, where Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni grew up, were defaced, according to police and social media posts. Meloni and Musk are self-described close friends, but the Italian leader has not commented on the vandalism. Tesla dealerships in Milan have also been targeted by environmental groups in recent weeks. Reports of Tesla vandalism have also surfaced in France and various parts of the United States, including the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. Peaceful protests have taken place at multiple Tesla locations in the US, where demonstrators chanted Elon Musk has got to go in response to the slashing of federal jobs by Musks Department of Government Efficiency.

        "content": "The Inland Revenue Department has announced that individuals earning less than Rs. 1.8 million annually can now claim relief on the advance income tax (AIT) charged on interest or discounts from deposits. To avail themselves of this tax relief, eligible individuals must submit a self-declaration to their respective banks or financial institutions. The Inland Revenue Department has instructed these institutions to implement a 10 percent reduction in AIT on interest and discounts payable to depositors, effective from today (01). As per the new directive, banks and financial institutions operating as withholding agents must deduct a 10 percent AIT on interest, discounts, and income derived from Islamic financial transactions originating in Sri Lanka. However, individuals whose annual assessable income does not exceed Rs. 1.8 million can reclaim the deducted amount by submitting a self-declaration detailing their total income. Revisions to Personal Income Tax and Other Levies Alongside the AIT relief, the government has revised personal income tax regulations. Effective today, the taxable monthly income threshold has been increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000, offering tax relief to lower-income earners. Additionally, a 15 percent tax on income from services provided to foreign countries has been implemented under amendments to the Inland Revenue Act. Meanwhile, stamp duty on lease and rental agreements has also been revised.

        "date": "April 1, 2025 09:08 am",
        "content": "Japans economy could lose as much as 1.81 trillion in the event of a long-anticipated megaquake off its Pacific coast, which could trigger devastating tsunamis, the collapse of hundreds of buildings and potentially killing about 300,000 people, a government report said on Monday. The expected economic damage of 270.3 trillion yen, or nearly half of the countrys total gross domestic product (GDP), was up sharply from the previous estimate of 214.2 trillion yen as the new estimate accounted for inflationary pressures and updated terrain and ground data which have expanded anticipated flood areas, the Cabinet Office report showed. Japan is one of the worlds most earthquake-prone countries, and the government sees about an 80 chance of a magnitude 8 to 9 earthquake along a tremulous seabed zone known as the Nankai Trough. Under the worst-case scenario, based on a potential magnitude 9 earthquake in the area, Japan is likely to see 1.23 million evacuees or 1 of its total population. As many as 298,000 people could die from tsunamis and building collapses if the quake occurs late at night in winter, the report showed. The trough is off Japans southwest Pacific coast and runs for approximately 900 km (600 miles), where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Eurasian Plate. The accumulating tectonic strains could result in a megaquake roughly once in 100 to 150 years. Last year, Japan issued its first-ever megaquake advisory that there was a relatively higher chance of a quake as powerful as magnitude 9 in the trough, after a magnitude-7.1 quake occurred at the edge of the trough. A magnitude 9 quake in 2011 that triggered a devastating tsunami and the triple reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant in northeast Japan killed more than 15,000 people.

        "content": "Parliamentarian Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was brought before the Colombo Magistrates Court today (01) in connection with three corruption-related cases. Dassanayake, who was taken into custody on March 27, was granted bail in two of the cases but was ordered to remain in remand custody over the third charge. The court had previously remanded him until today for further proceedings. The allegations stem from his tenure as Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016. According to the Bribery Commission, Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission has filed a case against the MP, citing a government financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions. After reviewing the evidence, the Colombo Magistrates Court ruled that while Dassanayake could be released on bail for two of the charges, he would remain in remand custody for the third. Investigations into the matter are ongoing.",

        "title": "Adolescence hard to watch as a dad, UK Prime Minister tells creators",
        "date": "April 1, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was really hard to watch with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online. Sir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder, served as a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people dont know how to respond to. But he warned there was not a silver bullet response or some policy lever that can be pulled. Sir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools. The programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and manosphere influencers. Jack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should rather urgently consider a smartphone ban in schools and a digital age of consent, similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media. Thorne and producer Jo Johnson gave their views to Sir Keir at Mondays meeting, along with charities including the NSPCC and Childrens Society, and young people. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there. The prime minister told them the show was at times harrowing but had lit a touch paper under the debate about the issues. Weve been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard, he told BBC political editor Chris Mason. It was so arresting, he said, because in a sense, what happens in the drama could really happen anywhere, and almost happen to any child. It shone a light on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world, he said. But unlike some things the government deals with, there isnt an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions, he added. Its much broader than that. Its a cultural issue, and therefore were going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why Im really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it. Netflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film schools streaming service. Asked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97 of schools were already doing that - so it was not, to my mind, the central issue. If were going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether youre at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue, he said. And whether its at school or elsewhere, theres material that clearly shouldnt be accessed. The government has pointed to measures including the Online Safety Act, which says social media companies will have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts. Platforms will be expected to adopt age assurance technologies to prevent children from seeing harmful content. Sir Keir said it was an important piece of legislation, but that we should go back and revisit whether theres further work that we need to do to protect young people. The PM also denied a suggestion that showing the programme in schools would demonise boys who spend a lot of time online but havent ended up like Jamie in Adolescence. I think its probably wrong to think that theres just a group of boys that are drawn to this material, he told BBC Radio 1s Newsbeat. Certainly, theres a group that are drawn to the extreme edges of this, and we see that in the drama, of course, but I think many boys would be somewhere, possibly, on a continuum here. School screenings The government is also updating its guidance on how schools should teach children about relationships, sex and health education (RSHE). The Times recently reported that it would include lessons to counter misogyny and the growing appeal of influencers such as Andrew Tate, in the wake of the discussions about Adolescence. Speaking afterwards, Thorne said it was a brilliant meeting. The brilliant thing was that it wasnt about us, he said. It was about facilitating conversations with charities and youth groups who really understand whats going on, and I hope a solution can be found to this problem. The success of Adolescence has helped those charities and groups get the opportunity to have conversations that they havent had before and that they should have had, and that might lead to a policy change and things being made better for our young people, he added. Boys looking to belong need an alternative option For 22-year-old Harry Foster, being radicalised as a teenager was very easy. When youre a child, its very easy when theres a lack of any sort of direction or positive role models to get swept along with something, he said. He said extremist groups exploited his vulnerability with addiction issues as a teenager, manipulating him into sharing racist and misogynistic views. I thought I was finding some sense of belonging, he told Newsbeat. What I was actually being given was a very harmful and very radical set of political views, which is almost like the trade-off for belonging to these people. He got help through The Warren youth group in Hull and now works with them to help other boys and young men in similar situations. Harry welcomed Sir Keirs plans to work with Netflix to show Adolescence in secondary schools, but said more work must be done. I dont think theres ever been a time where young people as a whole feel more disconnected from politicians, he said. Its one thing to make young men aware of the problems around these kind of ideologies, but its equally important were offering an alternative to young boys and men who are so desperately looking for something to identify with. I dont think its as simple as showing a TV show. There needs to be a positive alternative for young people. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Korean star Kim Soo-Hyun denies accusations by late actress family",
        "date": "April 1, 2025 10:51 am",
        "content": "South Korean star Kim Soo-hyun has made a tearful public statement denying allegations made by the family of actress Kim Sae-ron, who died in an apparent suicide in February. I cant admit to something I didnt do, the 37-year-old said on Monday at a press conference in Seoul. At the centre of the controversy are two allegations: that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron when she was 15 - a minor - and that his agency pressured her to repay a loan she owed him. The scandal has shocked South Korea and its entertainment industry - and has generated a backlash against Kim Soo-Hyun, whose roles in multiple hit drama series and films has made him one of its best-known stars. Kim wept as he said that although he dated the actress for a year when she was an adult, they never dated while she was underage. Mondays media conference came after weeks of accusations and counter-accusations between Kim Sae-rons family and Kim Soo-hyuns camp in the wake of her death. The scandal broke on 10 March, less than a month after Kim Sae-rons death. A YouTube channel, known for its controversial political content, claimed that the two had dated for six years, when she was 15. The channel has since released videos and photos it claims were taken during their relationship. Last week, the attorney representing Kim Sae-rons family held a press conference, revealing more chat history allegedly between the two actors from 2016, when she was 16. Kim Soo-hyuns agency initially denied the allegations but later clarified that they dated, though only between 2019 and 2020, when she was an adult. The actor himself had remained silent until Monday. At the press conference, he became emotional, reiterating to reporters that they only dated as two adults. Many people are suffering because of me, he said, apologising to his fans and staff. I also feel sorry that the late actress Kim Sae-ron isnt able to rest in peace. I never dated her when she was a minor, he continued. Except for the fact that both of us were actors, our relationship was just like that of any other ordinary couple. He also explained why he denied the relationship when she uploaded a later-deleted photo of the two of them to her Instagram account in 2024 during the airing of Netflix hit show Queen of Tears, in which he played the lead role. I had so much to protect as its lead actor. What would have happened if I had admitted to a year-long relationship? What would happen to the actors, the staff who were working overnight and the production team who had everything staked on that project? he said. The more I thought of it, the more I thought that shouldnt be what I do. Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner is still seen as scandalous to fans in South Koreas entertainment industry, where celebrities personal lives come under intense scrutiny. Kim Sae-ron herself was a victim of online hate by fans after she was fined 20 million won (11,000; 14,000) for a 2022 drink-driving incident. Prior to that, she had been seen as one of the most promising young actresses in South Korea. At the time, she was managed by the same agency as Kim Soo-hyun, which was co-founded by his relative. Kim Sae-ron joined GoldMedalist in January 2020 and left in December 2022. Kim Sae-rons family claimed that GoldMedalist covered the compensation for her drunk-driving incident. They allege that the agency later pursued legal action for repayment and that, while the actress asked Kim Soo-hyun for more time to settle the debt, her request went unanswered. On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun denied claims that she made the tragic choice because of me or my agency pressuring her over a debt. He released a voice recording of a phone call from a year ago, allegedly between his agency and Kim Sae-rons representative. In the recording, the CEO of GoldMedalist appears to explain that the document they sent her regarding the debt was merely for procedural reasons and that her team could take time to respond. He also accused Kim Sae-rons family of manipulating chat records as evidence and stated that he had submitted his own evidence to the relevant authorities for verification. He urged her family to do the same. Kim Soo-hyun, 37, is an A-list actor in South Korea, known for his roles in multiple hit drama series and top-grossing movies, including My Love from the Star, Netflixs Queen of Tears, and the film Secretly, Greatly. He has also been a favourite among advertisers in the country, though many brands have now distanced themselves from him amid the controversy. On 17 March, fashion brand Prada announced that it had mutually decided to end its collaboration with him, according to Reuters. This followed similar moves from Dinto, a Korean cosmetic brand. A Disney show that stars Kim Soo-hyun has also been put on pause due to the scandal, according to local news outlet Yonhap. His lawyer stated on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against Kim Sae-rons family and the YouTube channel operator, along with a civil lawsuit for damages worth 12 billion won. Her family has not commented on the lawsuits or his latest remarks. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Speaking at a press conference today (01), President of the association Lalith Dharmasekara stated that rather than reducing three-wheeler fares, the government should intervene to provide a more efficient service to the public through proper regulation. Commenting further, the Dharmasekara added, Petrol has been reduced by Rs. 10 per liter. We usually drive about 20 kilometers per liter. Therefore, even if we give the entire Rs. 10 without keeping a penny, the amount we can reduce is only 50 cents. That is not practical. Even now, there are three-wheelers all over Sri Lanka that charge arbitrary prices without any fixed fare. Therefore, reducing the price by 50 cents or Rs. 10 is not the answer, but regulation is, he added. Dharmasekara further stated that their primary goal is to create a more efficient and reliable three-wheeler service, and emphasized that reducing the fuel price by Rs. 10 will not reduce the three-wheeler fare.",

This order was issued after he was produced before the Colombo Magistrates Court today (01). Dassanayake, who was taken into custody on March 27, was granted bail in two of the cases but was ordered to remain in remand custody over the third charge. The court had previously remanded him until today for further proceedings. The allegations stem from his tenure as Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016. According to the Bribery Commission, Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission has filed a case against the MP, citing a government financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions. After reviewing the evidence, the Colombo Magistrates Court ruled that while Dassanayake could be released on bail for two of the charges, he would remain in remand custody for the third. Investigations into the matter are ongoing.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has ordered the petitions filed against the rejections of nominations submitted by several political parties and independent groups for the upcoming Local Government (LG) Elections, to be taken up for consideration on April 03, 2025. This order was issued when 37 writ petitions filed related to the matter were taken up today (01) before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices S. Thurairaja, Mahinda Samayawardena and Sampath Abeykoon. Appearing for the Attorney General (AG), Deputy Solicitor General Kanishka de Silva stated before the court that a settlement can be reached regarding three petitions filed in relation to the rejection of three nominations as the Election Commission has agreed to accept the said nominations following a discussion pertaining to the matter, which was held with the participation of the Attorney General and also the petitioning party. Accordingly, Attorneys-at-Law Nuwan Bopage and Ilham Kariapper, who appeared for the petitioning party, agreed to withdraw the three relevant petitions. Meanwhile, the Deputy Solicitor General informed the court that preliminary objections will be filed in relation to the remaining petitions. She also argued that in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act, it is not possible to file writ petitions before the Supreme Court regarding the rejection of nomination papers related to a local government election or any action taken by the Returning Officers. Thus, the Deputy Solicitor General requested the Supreme Court to dismiss the petitions without taking them up for hearing. However, the legal representatives of the petitioning parties stated that since the Returning Officers act in compliance to the orders and regulations of the Election Commission, argued that accordingly, the petitioners have the ability to challenge the functions performed by the Returning Officers before the Supreme Court through writ petitions, considering it to be the functions of the Election Commission. They also pointed out that the nomination papers of their clients have been rejected due to deficiencies in the birth certificates of the candidates, failure to properly complete the affidavits, etc. Later, the court separately considered the facts presented pertaining to the 37 writ petitions filed by political parties and independent groups, including Jana Aragala Sandhanaya, challenging the rejection of their nomination papers and adjourned the further consideration of the petitions until April 03, 2025.",

        "content": "Colombo is set to witness a rare celestial phenomenon on Monday, April 7, 2025, at 12.12 p.m., when shadows will momentarily vanish, according to astronomer Anura C. Perera. This is actually an optical illusion, Perera explained. He further commented: At this time of year, the sun is directly overhead, meaning Sri Lanka is receiving maximum solar energy. That means the sun will be directly overhead the country in the first two weeks of April. This will last from April 5th to 15th. The sun will be directly overhead of Colombo on April 07. If someone stands outside at exactly 12.12 p.m. on that day, they will not be able to see their own shadow for a brief moment. One would not be able to see their own shadow, but others might still perceive it. This phenomenon is part of a 10-day solar event from April 5 to April 15, during which the sun will pass directly overhead different parts of Sri Lanka. The event, known as the Zero Shadow Day or Lāhainā Noon, begins when the sun first appears directly over Point Pedro on April 4 and will progress through the following locations: Elamaldeniya on April 5 Kalutara on April 6 Colombo and Kelaniya on April 7 Nainamadama and Mahiyanganaya on April 8 The sun will complete its overhead passage and will move away from Sri Lankas Point Pedro on April 15. This rare alignment - Zero Shadow Day - also known as Lāhainā Noon, is a phenomenon where the sun is directly overhead at a specific latitude, causing vertical objects to cast no shadow. It occurs twice a year in regions between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.",

        "title": "Fab four stars revealed for major Beatles films",
        "date": "April 1, 2025 06:28 pm",
        "content": "Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan have been confirmed as part of the all-star line-up who will play members of the Beatles in four major new films about the band. Normal People and Gladiator II actor Mescal will portray Sir Paul McCartney, while Saltburn star Keoghan will step into Ringo Starrs shoes. The acting supergroup will also feature Harris Dickinson, who was most recently seen opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, as John Lennon. And Joseph Quinn will go from Marvels Fantastic Four to the Fab Four, playing George Harrison in the big-screen quadrilogy, which will be directed by Sir Sam Mendes. The Oscar-winning director was joined by the four actors for the announcement at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas on Monday. Each film will focus on a different member of the legendary group. Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys, Sir Sam told the event. They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not. Theyre four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history. The films will be released in proximity to each other in April 2028. The director explained: I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didnt feel right. Meet the Beatles Paul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBCs Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers, and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet. Harris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The Kings Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidmans love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers favourites to be the next James Bond. Barry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn. Joseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflixs Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny StormHuman Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films. Although several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film. Sir Sam called the films the first bingeable theatrical experience, adding: Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house. On stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the bands song Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band: Its wonderful to be here, its certainly a thrill, youre such a lovely audience, wed like to take you home with us. They then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow. Formed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history. Restlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Peppers and The White Album. Despite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time. Only two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001. In 2023, the surviving members released what was described as the Beatles final song, Now And Then. Based on one of Lennons old demo tapes, and featuring an archive recording of Harrisons guitar work, it went to number one and was nominated for awards at the Brits and the Grammys. The Beatles on film This is by no means the first film project to explore the lives of The Beatles - Iain Softleys Backbeat, released in 1994, dramatised their early career in Hamburgs clubs, where they cut their musical teeth. Sam Taylor-Johnsons Nowhere Boy in 2009 starred her future husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lennon and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McCartney. It delved into Lennons early years and family relationships, and documented him meeting McCartney and Harrison and the bands origins. Martin Scorsese made a factual film in 2011 called George Harrison: Living in the Material World, which included contributions from the surviving band members plus archive material. In 2021, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson restored more than 50 hours of outtakes from 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be for Get Back, a three-part film. The epic Disney movie, which was nearly seven hours long, shed new light on the relationship between McCartney and Lennon before the band split in 1970. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 1, 2025 07:01 pm",
        "content": "Gold prices extended their record run on Tuesday, hitting a record high buoyed by safe-haven demand as investors braced for U.S. President Donald Trumps planned announcement on reciprocal tariffs. Spot gold was up 0.3 at 3,133.01 per ounce at 1147 GMT, after hitting an all-time high of 3,148.88 earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures were 0.4 higher at 3,161.60. Trumps tariff comments and his increasingly volatile stance on Russias war against Ukraine are proving the perfect chaos for new record gold prices, surpassing even the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, said Adrian Ash, head of research at online marketplace BullionVault. Trump said on Sunday his reciprocal tariffs to be announced on Wednesday would include all countries, not just a smaller group of 10 to 15 countries with the biggest trade imbalances. On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised the probability of a U.S. recession to 35 from 20 and said it expected more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Non-yielding bullion thrives in a low-interest rate environment. Golds recent bull run has benefited from two drivers - growing demand from central banks beginning in spring 2022, and the return of Western safe-haven seekers this year - said Carsten Menke, analyst at Julius Baer. Geopolitical instability in the Middle East and Europe, and increased flows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds have also supported bullions rally. Gold closed out its strongest quarter since 1986 on Monday, and climbed over 3,100ounce, marking one of the most significant upswings in the precious metals history. On a technical basis, golds Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands above 70, indicating the metal is overbought. Im looking for a long overdue correction before an eventual push towards our target at 3,300... a correction will only get a bit more serious if we break below the 2,955 area, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Investors now await U.S. job openings data later on Tuesday and the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Silver fell 0.7 to 33.85 an ounce and platinum eased 0.8 to 984.51.

        "title": "Mexicos security chief quietly forms an elite force to take on the drug cartels",
        "date": "April 2, 2025 06:39 am",
        "content": "Six years ago Mexicos president disbanded the countrys Federal Police and handed security responsibilities fully to the military. Now, his successor has quietly begun to build an elite civilian investigative and special operations force to fight the drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown a willingness early in her presidency to move away from former President Andrés Manuel López Obradors oft-criticized hugs, not bullets strategy. It focused on addressing the social roots of crime rather than directly confronting Mexicos powerful cartels. Sheinbaums security chief, Omar García Harfuch, is drawing on his law enforcement contacts  mostly from the former ranks of the Federal Police  to claw back security capabilities from the armed forces with a civilian force under his direct command. The government has yet to formally announce the new National Operations Unit, known by its Spanish initials UNO, but its existence is an open secret among former members of the Federal Police, where García Harfuch started his career. Three Mexican officials, all of whom requested anonymity to speak about the still unannounced force, confirmed its existence to The Associated Press. Security analyst David Saucedo, who has spoken with people who have joined the force, said he believes García Harfuchs main objective is to have an armed force that allows him to meet demands from Washington. UNO takes shape The unit began to form shortly after Sheinbaum took office and it hopes to have 800 members by the end of the year, said one federal official, who is familiar with many of the units details. On Monday, while García Harfuch was in Washington meeting with the Trump administration, the security ministry published a call for college graduates to make up the first generation of investigative and intelligence agents, saying only they would be part of a specialized group to strengthen the countrys security. UNO will have three branches distributed geographically across Mexico, as well as a high-impact team that will be the elite of the elite, the federal official said. Its current members are mostly former Federal Police and members of the special operations team García Harfuch created when he was Mexico Citys police chief. Most have previously received training from security forces from the United States, Colombia, Spain or France. His challenge is rebuilding the trust of his U.S. counterparts after López Obrador limited U.S. agents movements in Mexico and do it as President Donald Trump pressures Mexico to step up the fight against fentanyl trafficking. A controversial past Shortly after taking office, López Obrador replaced the Federal Police with a new force, the National Guard, that he sold to the public as civilian, but that was always led by and made up of the armed forces. He lambasted the Federal Police as too corrupt to save and made Mexicos former security chief Genaro García Luna, then facing trial in the U.S. and eventually convicted of working for the Sinaloa cartel, the poster child. He cut funding for training and equipping local police. What followed were six years of what critics decried as militarization that effectively concentrated unprecedented authority in the hands of the armed forces. Despite that, levels of violence remained stubbornly high and critics said the cartels grew stronger, fueled by soaring revenue from fentanyl. One of the main criticisms of the National Guard and military was that while they had numbers and fire power they did not have the investigative skills needed to dismantle large criminal organizations. García Harfuch was initially a toothless tiger, who was frequently denied resources, information and investigative files by other security entities, said Saucedo, based in Guanajuato state, Mexicos most violent. UNO puts an elite force under his direct command. The Mexican federal official denied that UNOs objective was to satisfy Trump, but noted the unit was involved in the unprecedented delivery of 29 high-profile cartel figures to the United States at the height of negotiations between the two countries to suspend threatened tariffs. They were pulled out of prisons all over Mexico, assembled and sent to the U.S. without incident. The challenge: avoid corruption Special operations forces, be it from the Navy, Army, Federal Police or state police, have a checkered history in Mexico, having been involved in many scandals and abuses of power, extrajudicial killings and infiltration by cartels. There have been a lot of cases that were bad, said the previously quoted federal official, who added that there were also honest police. He said the security ministry is emphasizing stricter screening, exhaustive background investigations and better pay once theyre in. García Harfuchs influence also extends to states where Sheinbaums party holds power. People he trusts are taking key security positions and UNO will train state special operations teams that are also made up of many former Federal Police. The southern state of Chiapas, where Mexicos most powerful cartels are battling for control of smuggling routes, announced a special operations force in December called the Pakal with some 500 members. Two members told the AP they were ex-Federal Police and did eight months of specialized training to join the Pakal. But doubts remain. For Saucedo, since the new elite force doesnt yet have effective internal controls and accountability mechanisms, theres no guarantee that this elite group wont commit the excesses committed by other special operations groups.

        "content": "The National Farmers Union has raised concerns over the governments failure to implement a fertilizer subsidy plan for the Yala cultivation season. Union Chairman Anuradha Tennakoon stated that although farmers have already commenced cultivation activities, the government has yet to take even the basic steps necessary to distribute the fertilizer subsidy. When Ada Derana inquired about the matter, Commissioner General of Agrarian Services U. B. Rohana Rajapakshe assured that the relevant circular will be issued in the coming days. The fertilizer subsidy for the Yala season will be distributed in a manner similar to that of the Maha season. Farmers will receive Rs. 5,000 per hectare, with Rs. 15,000 provided in the first phase and Rs. 10,000 in the second phase. The subsidy will be granted for up to two hectares per farmer, he explained. He further noted that farmers cultivating other crops would receive a subsidy of Rs. 15,000 per hectare. Rajapakshe confirmed that the circular outlining these provisions is expected to be released within the next two to three days.",
