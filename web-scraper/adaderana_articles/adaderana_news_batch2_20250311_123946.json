        "content": "The Supreme Court has fixed for consideration the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by former Minister Rajitha Senaratne, seeking an order to recount the preferential votes obtained by the New Democratic Fronts (NDF) candidates for the Kalutara District in the 2024 General Election and issue the revised results. Accordingly, the FR petition is fixed for consideration on 30 September 2025, as per a decision made by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Janaka de Silva, and Sampath B. Abeykoon today (06). The Election Commission and its members, including its Chairman, the Kalutara District Returning Officer, Member of Parliament Rohitha Abeygunawardena (elected from the NDF in the 2024 General Election), and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in this petition. The petitioner claims that irregularities in the preferential vote-counting process in the Kalutara District during the last General Election prevented him from being elected to Parliament. He points out that the vote difference between him and the elected Member of Parliament from the Kalutara District was only 119 votes and that this situation arose due to those irregularities. The petitioner has further requested the Supreme Court to rule that his fundamental human rights were violated due to this and to issue an order to the respondents to recount the preferential votes obtained by the candidates who contested the Kalutara District from the NDF in the last general election and issue new results. Legal counsels including Attorney-at-Law Keerthi Thilakarathne and Presidents Counsel Faisz Musthapha, appeared on behalf of the petitioner.",

        "content": "At least 2 million devotees are expected to travel to Kandy to witness the special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which is scheduled to be held from April 18 to 27. This was revealed during a discussion held today (06) under the patronage of the Central Province Governor Sarath Abeykoon regarding the special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic. The discussion about its organizational activities was held at the Kandy District Secretariat. It was also revealed that although it is estimated that three devotees per second will be able to worship the Tooth Relic during the 10 days of the exposition, only about 600,000 people will be able to enter the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy during that time. Expressing his views at the event, Central Province Governor Sarath Abeykoon said that, taking all these factors into consideration, as many people as possible should be given the opportunity to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic. The Central Province Governor further stated that schools in Kandy city will be closed during the period of the special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic and that schools will be held on other dates instead. A number of issues, including providing facilities to the public visiting the Sacred Tooth Relic exposition, lighting the city, and improving infrastructure, were discussed at length.

        "date": "March 6, 2025 08:28 pm",
        "content": "Former Sri Lankan President and six-time Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe denied shielding ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa from prosecution, during an interview for Al Jazeera Englishs Head to Head that aired today. He also rebuffed renewed accusations that his own administration failed to credibly investigate alleged government links to deadly terrorist attacks that rocked Sri Lanka in 2019. Wickremesinghe, who was voted out of office in 2024, threatened to leave 8 minutes into the hour-long interview with Mehdi Hasan, but ultimately remained seated for a heated debate that also covered the governments handling of war crimes investigations following the countrys civil war, and allegations of torture committed under his watch in the late 1980s. In my country, its the attorney general, who is not a political figure, who decides on prosecution - We can only send the evidence before him, Wickremesinghe said when asked if hed covered for ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled the country in 2022 following mass protests. Both Gotabaya and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former Prime Minister and President, have been widely accused of corruption and war crimes and driving the country into a major financial crisis. On letting Gotabaya Rajapaksa back into the country without arrest after Wickremesinghe took over the presidency in 2022, the latter said: He could come back in. Theres no charge against him. How could I? Am I a dictator? Hasan also pressed Wickremesinghe on renewed accusations by the Catholic Church that his own government had protected other forces involved in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings carried out by an ISIS-affiliate. In response, Wickremesinghe called the allegations all nonsense and an example of the politics of the Catholic Church. The head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is talking nonsense? Hasan clarified. Yes, Wickremesinghe said. Wickremesinghe, who was Prime Minister in 2019, was responding to public statements by local Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, as well as exclusive comments the Cardinal had made to Al Jazeeras Head to Head team before the TV recording. In a phone call with Al Jazeera, Ranjith said Wickremesinghe had failed to heed the Churchs request for a truly independent investigation and called an earlier inquiry and report during Wickremesinghes presidency not worth the paper it was written on. Turning to truth and reconciliation for Sri Lankas civil war with the LTTE (also known as the Tamil Tigers), Hasan asked if justice had been served to the thousands of victims of the conflict that ended in 2009. Wickremesinghe conceded: No. Justice has not been served to any of the communities. He accepted that aid had been blocked to war victims and some hospitals had been bombed but denied that such bombings were systematic. There had been occasions where the Air Force had bombed hospitals and action was taken against some of them. But on a large-scale, this thing? I wouldnt say that. According to a U.N. panel , Sri Lankan government forces blocked the delivery of aid to victims of the war, Hasan prompted. I admit that took place, Wickremesinghe conceded, who was the opposition leader at the time of the final phase of the war. Pressed on why, as President, he reappointed General Shavendra Silva  whom the US State Department accuses of war crimes  to head Sri Lankas armed forces, Wickremesinghe said, Its a practice not to replace military commanders during an election. He added, When I took over, I checked on it and I was satisfied that General Silva was not involved in it. Wickremesinghe went on to deny allegations made by a government commission that he knew of illegal detention, torture and killings happening at Batalanda, a housing complex he was living in as a minister in the late 1980s. I deny all those allegations, he said when confronted with a government inquiry that named him as a main architect of securing the housing complex and alleged he, to say the least, knew about the violations taking place there. Wickremesinghe first denied the existence of the report, of which Al Jazeera had obtained a copy, and later questioned its validity, saying it had never been discussed in parliament. That was not tabled in Parliament and there is nothing to be found against me. Wickremesinghe, who was appointed president by parliament in 2022 amidst one of the biggest political and financial crises in Sri Lankan history, defended his own presidency and 2024 election loss: In two years, I put the economy back on track. And that means disinflation, compression. Its very, very difficult. Will you survive that? No, I cant see that, he said about last years election in which he finished third. Im quite happy. I did the job, he said, referring, in part, to a landmark IMF deal he brokered as president. There would have been a political and economic collapse of the country (if he hadnt taken over the Presidency). Hasan and Wickremesinghe were joined by a panel of experts: Former BBC Sri Lanka correspondent and author of Still Counting the Dead, Frances Harrison; Former UK MP and envoy to Mr Wickremesinghe during his presidency, Nirj Deva; and Madura Rasaratnam, Executive Director of human rights organization PEARL and Senior Lecturer in Comparative Politics at City, University of London.

        "date": "March 6, 2025 09:50 pm",
        "content": "Police investigations have revealed that the recent shooting and killing of Anura Vidanagamage, alias Kajja, and his two children in Middeniya was part of a revenge killing linked to the underworld. Police confirmed that the murder was orchestrated as revenge for stealing a parcel of Cannabis belonging to a notorious drug trafficker infamously known as Backhoe Saman. According to police, the gunmanwho was arrested along with nine othersconfessed that he carried out the execution on a contract from Backhoe Saman due to his own mounting personal debt. On February 18, Kajja was shot dead by an unidentified gunman, while his two children, who sustained critical injuries in the attack, succumbed later. However, the shooter later revealed under interrogation that he had made three previous failed attemptson February 10, 11, and 12on orders from Backhoe Saman, who is reportedly operating from Dubai. Police investigations have uncovered that on the day of the murder, the shooter had set out on a motorcycle with another suspect, acting under the directions of a close associate of Backhoe Saman, also hiding in Dubai. This individual, identified as Lahiru, allegedly guided the motorcyclist over the phone, instructing them to wait near an unfinished building close to Kajjas usual route. Upon spotting Kajja riding a motorcycle with his two children, the shooter initially hesitated but was pressured by the motorcyclist to proceed with the attack. The gunman confessed to firing the fatal shots while seated on his motorcycle, with the firearm resting on his lap, before fleeing the scene. Police have identified the shooter as a welder by profession, who was also skilled in repairing firearms. Investigators suspect he is a contract killer operating within the underworld. So far, ten individualsincluding the gunman and a woman suspected of aiding and abetting the murderhave been arrested. However, police are still searching for the motorcycle rider who assisted in the murder and the T-56 firearm used in the shooting. Further investigations have confirmed that Kajja was targeted not just for the stolen narcotics but also due to his criminal activities. Police say he had been impersonating law enforcement officers to rob gambling dens and drug dealers. A search of his residence has led to the discovery of multiple communication devices used in these robberies. The suspects were produced before the Walasmulla Magistrates Court today (March 6), where police were granted 72 hours to detain and question them further. Police say efforts are ongoing to apprehend the remaining suspects and recover the missing firearm.",

        "date": "March 7, 2025 06:46 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis on Thursday sent his first audio message since being hospitalized for double pneumonia nearly three weeks ago, expressing thanks from the bottom of my heart to well-wishers around the world who have offered their support. A brief, two-line message recorded by Francis from Romes Gemelli hospital earlier on Thursday was played during a nightly prayer service for the pope in St Peters Square at the Vatican. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers in the Square for my health, said the pope, speaking in his native Spanish, and pausing every few words to take a deep breath. May God bless you. The audio message came shortly after the Vatican said the pontiff had remained stable on Thursday and did not have any new episodes of respiratory crisis. In a sign of progress as the 88-year-old pontiff continues treatment, the popes doctors said they would not issue another medical bulletin until Saturday, considering the stability of the clinical picture. Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that has required continuously evolving treatment. In the latest detailed medical update on his condition, the Vatican said the pope had not had a fever and his blood tests had remained stable. Despite pausing the daily readouts about his condition, the doctors continued to call the popes prognosis guarded, meaning he was not yet out of danger. The tone of the updates from the Vatican has been more upbeat in recent days, following what was described as two episodes of acute respiratory insufficiency on Monday. On Thursday, the Vatican said the pope had been able to work between receiving his treatments and taking rest. It also said the pontiff, who has used a wheelchair in recent years due to knee and back pain, had continued with some physical therapy to help with mobility, which first started on Wednesday. POPE CONTINUES WORK Mondays respiratory episodes had required Francis to use non-invasive mechanical ventilation, which involves placing a mask over the face to help push air into the lungs. The pope is now only receiving ventilation at night, said the Vatican. During the day, he receives oxygen via a small hose under his nose. Francis has not been seen in public since entering hospital, his longest such absence since his papacy started 12 years ago. His doctors have not said how long the treatment might last. The pope, who is known to work himself to exhaustion, has continued to work from hospital. On Thursday, the Vatican announced the appointments of two bishops that would have required his approval. The pope has experienced several bouts of ill health over the last two years and is prone to lung infections because he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed. Double pneumonia is a serious infection in both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 7, 2025 08:44 am",
        "content": "The number of people injured after South Korean fighter jets accidentally dropped bombs on a civilian area on Thursday increased to 15 civilians and 14 soldiers, the Yonhap News Agency said on Friday, citing the countrys defence ministry. On Thursday, eight MK-82 unguided bombs carried by two KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fell outside the designated training zone in Pocheon, Gyeonggi, during a joint live-fire exercise involving the Korean Army, Air Force and U.S. Forces Korea. The misfire occurred approximately six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the intended target during a pre-exercise drill for the annual Freedom Shield (FS) exercise set to begin on March 10. As a result, civilians sustained injuries, while a church, several civilian structures and multiple vehicles were severely damaged. The MK-82 bomb is designed to destroy buildings and bridges. It is a stroke of luck that there were no fatalities despite the gravity of the incident. The military dispatched an explosive ordnance disposal team to assess the site, but all of the bombs dropped reportedly detonated, eliminating the risk of additional explosions. Pocheon Mayor Baek Young-hyeon has demanded full compensation for the victims and called for a complete halt to military exercises in the area until a satisfactory resolution is reached. The Air Force attributed the incident to an error in coordinate input by the lead fighter pilot, which was then followed by the second pilot bombing the same place. The Air Force is primarily responsible for conducting precision strikes on key North Korean military facilities during the early stages of a conflict. Training a single fighter pilot costs over 10 billion won (7.5 million) to ensure precise, one-shot, one-kill targeting while evading enemy air defense networks. That such a fundamental error in coordinate entry led to an attack on civilian property is deeply concerning. If this had been a real combat situation, the Air Force would have flown deep into enemy territory only to bomb the wrong target. --With agencies inputs",

Failure to comply with this will result in the suspension of the importers import permit, according to the Finance Ministry. This measure has been introduced in order to protect foreign exchange reserves, discourage excessive vehicle imports, and prevent the unnecessary accumulation of motor vehicles. However, these conditions do not apply to individuals importing vehicles for personal use, as they are allowed to import only one vehicle, the Finance Ministry says. These regulations were discussed at a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) regarding vehicle imports. At the event, Controller General of Imports and Exports, Upulmali Premathilaka, provided further clarification: In 2020, vehicle imports were temporarily suspended. A gazette notification was issued to lift this temporary suspension following a decision by the Cabinet and observations made by the Central Bank. Accordingly, the gazette has now been issued, allowing vehicle imports into Sri Lanka under HS Code 8703. She further explained that imported vehicles must be registered within 90 days. If not, a fine of 3 of the CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) value will be imposed, up to a maximum of 45. Additionally, if 25 of the imported quantity is not registered within six months, their import permit will be suspended.

        "date": "March 7, 2025 10:48 am",
        "content": "SpaceXs massive Starship spacecraft exploded in space on Thursday minutes after lifting off from Texas, prompting the FAA to halt air traffic in parts of Florida, in the second straight failure this year for Elon Musks Mars rocket program. Several videos on social media showed fiery debris streaking through the dusk skies near south Florida and the Bahamas after Starship broke up in space shortly after it began to spin uncontrollably with its engines cut off, a SpaceX live stream of the mission showed. The failure of the eighth Starship test comes just over a month after the seventh also ended in an explosive failure. The back-to-back mishaps occurred in early mission phases that SpaceX has easily surpassed previously, a setback for a program Musk had sought to speed up this year. The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket system is central to Musks plan to send humans to Mars as soon as the turn of the decade. The Federal Aviation Administration briefly issued ground stops at the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and Orlando airports because of space launch debris. It said it had opened a mishap investigation into the incident. The rocket lifted off about 6:30 p.m. ET (2330 GMT) from SpaceXs sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, rocket facilities. The Super Heavy first stage booster flew back to Earth as planned and was successfully grabbed in midair by a SpaceX crane. But minutes later, SpaceXs live stream showed the Starship upper stage spinning in space, while a visualization of the rockets engines showed multiple engines shut down. Then the company said it had lost contact with the ship, and announcers immediately drew a connection to the previous flight. Unfortunately this happened last time too, so weve got some practice now, SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said on the live stream. In a statement late Thursday, SpaceX said Starship experienced an energetic event in its aft section, which resulted in the loss of several engines. This in turn led to a loss of attitude control and ultimately a loss of communications with Starship, the statement said. Final contact with Starship came approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff. SpaceX said there were no toxic materials among the debris. The Starship failure in January ended eight minutes into flight when the rocket exploded, raining debris over Caribbean islands and causing minor damage to a car in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, which regulates private rocket launches, said its investigation would require SpaceX to examine the failures cause and get the agencys sign-off before Starship can fly again. The FAA last month approved SpaceXs launch license for Thursdays test flight while its investigation into the companys previous Starship failure remained open.

        "content": "New Zealands high commissioner to the UK has been fired after questioning US President Donald Trumps grasp of history at an event in London. Speaking at international think tank Chatham House on Tuesday, Phil Goff, the former mayor of the city of Auckland who has also served as foreign minister, said: I was re-reading Churchills speech to the House of Commons in 1938 after the Munich Agreement, and he turned to Chamberlain, he said, You had the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, yet you will have war. President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office, added Goff. But do you think he really understands history? Goff was making a comparison between Trumps efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the 1938 agreement signed by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the leaders of France and Germany which gave Adolf Hitler permission to annex part of Czechoslovakia. The Nazi leader invaded Poland a year later, triggering World War II. New Zealands Foreign Minister Winston Peters later fired Goff over his comments and said he would have done the same if he had said something similar about other countries. If he (Goff) had made that comment about Germany, France, Tonga, or Samoa, Id have been forced to act, Peters told journalists. Its seriously regrettable and one of the most difficult things one has had to do in his whole career, he added. Ive worked with Phil Goff, Ive known him for a long time, said Peters, adding that Goffs comments were seriously disappointing. When you are in that position, you represent the government and the policies of the day; youre not able to free think; you are the face of New Zealand, he added. However the move was not without its critics, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark. This looks like a very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former NZ Foreign Minister from his post as High Commissioner to the UK, wrote Clark in a post on X. I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938  US actions now. Source: CNN --Agencies",

A Seoul Central District Court spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. South Koreas rule of law is still alive, Yoons legal counsel said, according to broadcaster YTN. Yoon is expected to be released immediately and take part in his trial while out of detention, local media said. Yoons lawyers had argued the warrant issued on January 19 that has kept him in detention was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed. He declared martial law on December 3 saying it was needed to root out anti-state elements but lifted the decree six hours later after parliament voted to reject it. He has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule. Weeks later he was impeached by the opposition-led parliament on accusations he had violated his constitutional duty by declaring martial law. Yoon faces a separate criminal trial and became the first sitting president to be arrested on criminal charges on January 15. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

A special court for economic offences granted the custodial interrogation after the DRI said that the actor needed to be investigated on matters concerning national security implications and to break the syndicate of gold smuggling. The Revenue officials had requested Ms Raos custody from March 9 to March 11. Ranya Rao, the 33-year-old stepdaughter of a senior IPS officer, was caught smuggling gold on Monday at the Bengaluru Airport. She was carrying 14.2 kg of gold, some of which she was wearing and the rest was concealed in her clothes. The officials tracking her movement grew suspicious since this was her fourth Dubai trip in 15 days and confronted her, leading to the seizure. She was just a few feet away from the exit when the revenue officials caught her. Subsequently, officials searched her home, where she lived with her husband, and found gold jewelry worth Rs. 2.06 crore and Indian currency amounting to Rs. 2.67 crore. Ms Rao was reportedly a part of a smuggling network and took hefty commissions to smuggle goods from Dubai to Bengaluru - about Rs 4-5 lakh to smuggle a kilogram of gold. In a confession to the revenue officials, the actor admitted that 17 gold bars were found on her and revealed the details of her international trips. I have travelled to Europe, America, and (the) Middle East and have visited Dubai, Saudi Arabia. I wish to state that I am tired at present as I did not get enough rest, the statement read. It was earlier reported that she made 27 trips to Dubai last year that brought her under the scanner of the revenue officials. Revealing her family details, Ms Rao said that her father is KS Hegdesh, a real estate businessman, and her husband is Jatin Hukkeri, an architect who lives with her in Bengaluru. She had also agreed to cooperate with the investigators, the statement said. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

Empowerment, calls for actions to unlock equal rights, power and opportunities for all women and girls, for a future where no one is left behind, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Empowering youth, particularly young women and adolescent girls is central to this vision. This year also marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action - the most progressive and widely endorsed blueprint for womens and girls rights worldwide. In South-East Asia, we recognise that the growth and development of our societies is inextricably linked to the health and wellness of women, the statement said. The second pillar of our Regional Roadmap for Results and Resilience calls for greater investment in women and girls, recognizing historical discrimination and the greater individual and societal challenges faced by them. The Roadmap calls for investment in, and working across, health-affecting sectors, such as education, water and sanitation, and pollution. In our South-East Asia region, the gender gap in womens labor force participation has narrowed in most countries. In the past decades, total fertility rate has decreased for most of the countries in the region. Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has also declined significantly  between 2010 to 2020, a 41 decline in the region versus a 12 decline globally. In fact, our region is on track to achieve the SDG target on MMR by 2030. The 2024 WHO global survey report notes that all our countries in South-East Asia have national guidelines and policies on sexual and reproductive health, family planning and contraception, STI treatment and counselling among others. Gender and health is also integrated as a priority area of work in all the current WHO SEARO Country Cooperation Strategieswith member states. However, as far as we have come, we have to acknowledge our journey is far from over, WHO stated. In our region, all countries rank high on the global Gender Inequality Index. Nearly 40 of women have experienced physical andor sexual violence in their lifetime. This aggravates the risks of communicable diseases like HIV and STI, along with mental health challenges. During crisis and emergencies, womens access to healthcare is often disrupted more than men due to various factors like mobility restrictions, and economic insecurity. Approximately 60 of our countries live in rural areas, with a significant proportion being women, it added. Rural areas face specific obstacles to accessing health services, including inadequate comprehensive services, insufficient health infrastructure, and a limited workforce. These issues are compounded for women, who face a layered disadvantage linked to gender, further exacerbated by socio-economic difficulties and cultural norms that restrict their access to healthcare. To protect and promote the health of women and girls, WHO SEARO is deploying the 4P approach: Promote: Advocating for investment in women and girls across health and related sectors like education, water and sanitation etc. Provide: Prioritizing unmet health needs and addressing access related barriers for women and girls. Protect: Enhancing female representation in decision making to catalyze inclusive policy planning and preparedness. Power and perform: Identifying hotspots of health risks for women and girls for targeted action. On International Womens Day, let us commit to the rights, equality and empowerment of all women and girls, throughout South-East Asia and beyond. Source: WHO -- Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2025 07:39 am",
        "content": "On the occasion of International Womens Day, President Anura Kumara Dissanayaka highlighted the historical significance of the global womens movement and the vital role Sri Lankan women have played in shaping the countrys political and economic future. Acknowledging the roots of International Womens Day in the labor rights struggles of New York in the early 1900s and the Russian womens strike for Bread and Peace in 1917, the President emphasized that the day stands as a direct victory for the global womens rights movement. Reflecting on Sri Lankas progress, President Dissanayaka expressed gratitude for the immense contribution of women to the formation of the National Peoples Power (NPP) government. He noted that despite decades of discussion, womens political representation remained stagnant until the last general election, which saw a breakthrough with the election of 22 female Members of Parliament. The President reaffirmed the governments commitment to gender equality and social justice, highlighting the implementation of a production-based economic policy aimed at ensuring active female participation. With women making up 51.7 of our population, their role in economic development is indispensable, he stated. He also underscored the administrations dedication to safeguarding womens rights in all areas of life, including workplaces, public transport, and communities, with a firm stance against gender-based violence and discrimination. The government has prioritized embedding these principles into national policies. In alignment with this years International Womens Day theme, For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment, Sri Lanka is celebrating under the theme, Strong She Will Be: A Pathway to Build a Sustainable Future! The President emphasized that this theme underscores the countrys commitment to achieving tangible gender equality. As we strive for economic prosperity and a secure future for the daughters of our society, we look forward to the unwavering support of all women in leading our country toward a new era of progress, he said, extending his warmest wishes to all Sri Lankan women. Full Speech by President Anura Kumara Dissanayaka on International Womens Day 2025: International Womens Day is a direct victory for the movement advocating womens rights. The concept of Womens Day originated from a march in New York City, where approximately 15,000 women demanded shorter working hours, better wages and voting rights. Later, March 8 was recognized as International Womens Day, inspired by the Russian women who went on strike demanding Bread and Peace during the February Revolution of 1917, which laid the foundation for significant political change. The contribution of Sri Lankan women to the formation of the National Peoples Power (NPP) government has been immense. As a government, we express our gratitude for this invaluable support and take pride in the initial steps we have taken within a short period to secure victories for Sri Lankan women. For decades, the topics of womens political representation, participation and leadership remained subjects of discussion rather than action. However, the election of 22 women as Members of Parliament in the last general election marked a turning point in the countrys political landscape. Furthermore, in pursuit of gender equality and social justice, we have implemented our economic policy; a production-based economic approach, ensuring the active and effective participation of women, who make up 51.7 of the population. With a vision of a just society, a free nation and empowered women, we are committed to safeguarding womens rights in all aspects of life, including the home, public transport, workplaces, communities and politics. This includes preventing all forms of violence against women, ensuring gender-discrimination and protecting womens rights. We have prioritized incorporating these principles into national policies. In alignment with this years International Womens Day theme, For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment, we celebrate Womens Day under the theme, Strong She Will Be a Pathway to Build a Sustainable Future! This theme powerfully reflects the commitment to equal rights for all women and girls, emphasizing a practical and meaningful approach to achieving gender equality. As we strive for economic prosperity and a secure future for the daughters of our society, we look forward to the unwavering support of all women in leading our country toward a new era of progress. On this International Womens Day, I extend my warmest wishes to all.",

        "date": "March 8, 2025 07:45 am",
        "content": "As the world marks International Womens Day, Sri Lankas Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has called for urgent and transformative action to address the deep-rooted inequalities that continue to shape the lives of women, particularly those from marginalized communities. In her speech, the Prime Minister emphasized that while progress has been made, structural barriers and misogynistic ideologies still hinder womens rights and safety. No woman is safe until every single woman is safe, she declared, urging collective action to ensure no one is left behind. Dr. Amarasuriya highlighted the disproportionate challenges faced by women in rural areas, war-affected regions, plantations, and the informal labor sector, pointing out that gender-based violence, economic hardship, and political exclusion continue to impact them the most. She underscored the importance of womens representation in leadership, stating that despite a significant increase in the number of women in parliament during the last election, it remains insufficient. Our democracy is incomplete when a significant portion of our citizens is excluded from leadership and decision-making, she stated. At a time when Sri Lanka is navigating economic recovery, climate change, digital transformation, and democratic challenges, the Prime Minister stressed that the country cannot afford to sideline half of its population. Womens voices, leadership, and agency are essential to overcoming these challenges and building a resilient future for all, she said. Acknowledging the contributions of feminist movements, Dr. Amarasuriya reaffirmed her governments commitment to advancing policies that prioritize the rights and agency of women and girls. She urged action beyond rhetoric, calling for gender-sensitive policies, budgets, and tangible change in womens lived experiences. When women thrive, communities thrive. When women lead, nations transform, the Prime Minister said, concluding her statement with a powerful call for unity and lasting change. Full Speech by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya on International Womens Day 2025 Today, as we mark International Womens Day, we stand at a crucial moment in history. This is a time to come togethernot just to celebrate the progress we have made, but to confront the deep structural inequalities as well as misogynistic ideologies that continue to shape the lives of women, in all their diversitynot only in Sri Lanka but all over the world. Gender-based violence, economic hardship, and political exclusion disproportionately affect womenparticularly those from rural communities, war-affected regions, plantations, and the informal labor sector. No woman is safe until every single woman is safe. We must commit to protecting one another, ensuring that no one is left behind, and that the rights and safety of every woman are upheld. Women make up 52 of our population, and we received universal franchise in 1931. At the last election, we were able to significantly increase the number of women in parliament. While we celebrate that, we need to acknowledge that it is still too low. Our democracy is incomplete when a significant portion of our citizens is excluded from leadership and decision-making. At a time when Sri Lanka is navigating economic recovery, climate change, digital transformation, and democratic challenges, we cannot afford to sideline half of our population. Womens voices, leadership, and agency are essential to overcoming these challenges and building a resilient future for all. Feminist movements have long shown us that change is possiblebut only when we challenge the status quo and demand systemic transformation. As the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, I reaffirm my unwavering commitment to advancing policies that center the rights and agency of women and girls. This IWD, let us commit to transformative actionnot just in words, but through gender-sensitive policies, budgets, and the lived experiences of all women and marginalized communities. When women thrive, communities thrive. When women lead, nations transform. This International Womens Day, lets unite and move beyond words. Lets commit to real, lasting changefor the generations before us, for those fighting today, and for those who will come after.",

        "content": "Chief Minister M K Stalin on Friday wrote to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, apprising him of the arrest of 14 Tamil Nadu fishermen by Sri Lanka and sought effective steps for the release of all the detained fishermen and their fishing boats. As on date, 227 Tamil Nadu fishing boats and 107 fishermen are still under the custody of Sri Lankan authorities, Stalin said. Expressing anguish, the chief minister said that 14 fishermen who ventured for fishing from the Rameswaram fishing harbour of Ramanathapuram District were apprehended by Sri Lanka and their mechanised fishing boat was also seized on March 6, 2025. This is the ninth incident of apprehension of Tamil Nadu fishermen along with their boats by the Sri Lankan Navy in the last 2 months of the current year 2025, the chief minister said in his letter. With deep concern, I would like to point out that as on date 227 Tamil Nadu fishing boats and 107 fishermen are still under the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. The Sri Lankan authorities are now detaining fishermen for longer period of time and have started imposing heavy fines for their release. Beyond the hardships of imprisonment, fines, and lost income during the detention period, fishermen are now facing an even greater loss of their economic livelihoods, as the Sri Lankan government are not returning their boats which are their sole means of economic support. Stalin requested the union government to take effective steps to ensure the prompt release of all the detained fishermen and their fishing boats currently in Sri Lankan custody. Also, the CM urged the External Affairs Minister to utilise all available diplomatic channels to prevent further apprehensions of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2025 10:08 am",
        "content": "Fighters siding with Syrias new government stormed several villages near the countrys coast, killing dozens of men in response to recent attacks on government security forces by loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad, a war monitor said. The village assaults erupted Thursday and continued Friday. Ongoing clashes between the two sides have marked the worst violence since Assads government was toppled in early December by insurgent groups led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The new government has pledged to unite Syria after 14 years of civil war. More than 200 people have been killed since the fighting broke out, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In addition to around 140 killed in apparent revenge attacks in the villages, the dead include at least 50 members of Syrias government forces and 45 fighters loyal to Assad. The civil war that has been raging in Syria since March 2011 has left more than half a million people dead and millions displaced. The most recent clashes began when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh on Thursday and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. On Thursday and Friday, gunmen loyal to the new government stormed the villages of Sheer, Mukhtariyeh and Haffah near the coast, killing 69 men but harming no women, according to the observatory. They killed every man they encountered, said observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman. Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV also reported the attacks on the three villages, saying that more than 30 men were killed in the village of Mukhtariyeh alone. Another 60 people were killed in the town of Baniyas, including women and children, the observatory said. Syrian authorities did not publish a death toll, but Syrias state news agency SANA quoted an unidentified security official as saying that numerous people went to the coast seeking revenge for recent attacks on government security forces. The official said the actions led to some individual violations and we are working on stop them. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in a video statement called on armed groups affiliated with the former government to hand over their weapons and for those loyal to the new government to avoid attacking civilians or abusing prisoners. When we compromise our ethics, we reduce ourselves to the same level as our enemy, he said. The remnants of the fallen regime are looking for a provocation that will lead to violations behind which they can seek refuge. Overnight, Damascus sent reinforcements to the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartus and nearby villages that are home to Assads minority Alawite sect and make up his longtime base of support. A curfew remained in effect in Latakia and other coastal areas. Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the countrys new security forces over the past several weeks. There also have been some attacks against Alawites in recent weeks, though the new government says it wont allow collective punishment or sectarian vengeance. As of Friday, the observatory said, Jableh and the coastal town of Baniyas were still under the control of Assad loyalists, along with other Alawite villages nearby and Assads hometown of Qardaha, in the mountains overlooking Latakia. One Qardaha resident told The Associated Press in a text message that government forces were firing with heavy machine guns in the towns residential areas. Another said people had not been able to leave their homes since Thursday afternoon because of the intensity of the shooting. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Gregory Waters, an associate fellow with the Middle East Institute who has researched Syrias coastal areas, said he doesnt expect the flareup to escalate into sustained fighting between the two sides. However, he said he was concerned it could stoke cycles of violence between different civilian communities living along the coast. Also, any violations by the security forces sent from Damascus would leave young Alawite men more fearful of the new government  and more prone to take up arms, Waters said. In Damascus, a crowd gathered in the rain at Umayyad Square to show support for the new government. Weve had enough of long periods of wars and tragedies, said retiree Mazen Abdelmajeed. He blamed the violence on remnants of the former regime and said Syrias unity must be preserved. No one wants a civil war to happen, he said. Were not against any of the components of the Syrian people.  Were all one Syrian people. Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said that apart from the danger of sectarian escalation, the violence had laid bare a big security challenge for the government in terms of potentially its inability to address multiple security threats on multiple fronts across the country. Armed groups opposed to the new authorities may take note, he said. Scores of people gathered Friday outside the main Russian air base in Syria near Jableh to ask Moscow for protection. Russia joined Syrias conflict in 2015, siding with Assad, although it has since established links with the new government. Assad has been living in Moscow since leaving Syria in December. Russias foreign ministry said in a written statement that Moscow is closely coordinating efforts with foreign partners in the interests of a speedy de-escalation of the situation. We reaffirm our principled position in support of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, the statement said. We expect that all states that have influence on the situation in Syria will contribute to its normalization. Turkey, which backed the insurgents when Assad was still in power, warned on Friday that the current fighting poses a serious threat to the new government. Intensive efforts are underway to establish security and stability in Syria, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said in a post on X. At this critical juncture, the targeting of security forces could undermine the efforts to lead Syria into the future in unity and solidarity. Source: AP --Agencies",

In addition to the 700,000 cards in position, we still need 1.6 million more cards., M.S.P. Suriyapperuma, director general of, the Department of Registration of Persons told Biometric Update on Thursday. The new electronic NICs will include biometrics, as part of the new system. The electronic IDs will include biometric features such as fingerprint, iris, and face recognition details, for more security and efficiency in identification confirmation. Suriyapperuma said already the Sri Lankan banks are already accessing their repository and verifying certain details of clients. The plan is to integrate the Sri Lanka Unique Digital ID project with the e-NIC, she added. e-NICs will assign unique ID numbers, centralize various types of IDs, and capture data like birth certificates and tax identification. Digitisation enables the collection of data, and data-driven policy initiatives are important to drive the right outcomes, Suriyapperuma said. An awareness program was held at the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) in Colombo recently, to discuss the e-NIC process and operational aspects. The event, under the patronage of Deputy Minister of Digital Economy, Eranga Weeraratne, aimed to address key challenges and provide a platform for stakeholders to exchange ideas and identify solutions. The initiative aims to streamline e-NIC implementation and ensure a smooth rollout for citizens. Meanwhile, the Registrar Generals Department plans to complete the digital population registry, an electronic database of basic information on all Sri Lankan citizens, in Colombo this month. The project aims to create an efficient life events registration system, increase information sharing with government institutions, and ensure data accuracy. The digital birth certificate will be issued for those born after January 21 in Colombo, alongside handwritten birth certificates. The project is backed by the civil registration and vital statistics project, with the Ministry of Digital Economy, United Nations Development Programme, and Asian Development Bank as partners.

The Minister made this statement during the first meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Energy of the First Session of the Tenth Parliament, which was held recently (06) at the Parliament under his chairmanship. During the meeting held, Members of Parliament inquired about the said project, and in response Minister Kumara Jayakody further stated that, as the pricing of Adani Companys power project was high, the matter had been referred to the Cabinet for reconsideration. At that time, Indias Adani Group parent company had sent a letter to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) informing that they were withdrawing from this project, and accordingly, the Board of Investment had informed the Ministry regarding the same, the minister further said. However, discussions regarding the wind power project were held with the representative institution of Adani in Sri Lanka, and thus, that institution had been informed to consider this matter, the Minister pointed out. Therefore, the Minister stated that a response regarding this matter is expected within two weeks following the letter that was sent. He further emphasized that only if a negative response is received within these two weeks it will be necessary to move toward an alternative. Additionally, he stated that in the future, such projects will only be carried out through government-to-government (G2G) agreements and competitive procurement. Furthermore, attention was also drawn regarding the steps taken to fill the existing vacancies in the Ceylon Electricity Board, including for engineers. The officials present pointed out that during the period of economic crisis, many engineers had migrated overseas, creating vacancies. However, they further noted that Cabinet approval had recently been obtained to fill these vacancies under three phases, and recruitment for the first batch is currently underway. Moreover, discussions were held regarding unexpected power outages, with officials highlighting that even minor fluctuations in the system have the potential to destabilize it. Therefore, they stated that efforts are currently being made to maintain system stability by utilizing other energy sources such as solar power. Additionally, attention was drawn to the inadequate maintenance of streetlights, and the Committee emphasized the necessity for local government institutions and the Electricity Board to work together on this matter. Particularly, as this is a nationally essential issue, the Committee suggested that local government institutions and the Electricity Board should engage in discussions. Moreover, the Minister stated that a policy on this matter will be formulated and finalized within two months. Furthermore, discussions were held regarding matters related to the Ministry at the provincial, district, and divisional levels.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake held a highly productive virtual meeting with the Managing Director of the IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, yesterday (07), according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The discussion focused on further strengthening the partnership between Sri Lanka and the IMF as the country successfully reaches the halfway mark of its 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, which commenced in March 2023. During the meeting, President Dissanayake expressed his profound appreciation for the IMFs continued support in recovering from the catastrophic economic crisis of 2022. He highlighted the significant progress Sri Lanka has made in implementing economic reforms, strengthening macroeconomic stability, supporting the vulnerable and improving governance.

He emphasized the importance of ongoing collaboration to ensure the resilience of Sri Lankas economy amidst global economic uncertainties, the PMD said. Ms. Georgieva congratulated the President for ensuring macroeconomic stability and completing the 3rd review under the EFF, as well as the successful completion of the bond exchange and most of the debt restructuring. The Managing Director commended Sri Lankas efforts in pursuing key reforms and reaffirmed the IMFs commitment to supporting Sri Lankas economic agenda.

        "title": "Google Doodle celebrates women in STEM on International Womens day",
        "date": "March 8, 2025 03:39 pm",
        "content": "To celebrate this years International Womens Day, Google is honouring the achievements of visionary women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields with a special doodle. The artwork, visible on the Google homepage, spotlights groundbreaking contributions by women who revolutionised space exploration, uncovered ancient discoveries, and pioneered lab research that has fundamentally shaped the understanding of physics, chemistry and biology. This Doodle celebrates International Womens Day. The United Nations first recognized this holiday in 1975 to highlight how important womens contributions have been all around the world, Google said. While acknowledging the advancements made, Googles message included the statistic that women still represent only 29 per cent of the global STEM workforce. Their work represents the ongoing progress towards gender equality, yet STEM remains one of the areas where significant gaps still persist, the tech giant added. Significance of International Womens Day In 1975, the United Nations celebrated International Womens Day on March 8th for the first time. Since then, the UN has become the primary sponsor of the annual event and has encouraged countries around the world to embrace it. International Womens Day is observed to recognise the cultural, political, social, and economic achievements made by women. It serves as an opportunity to inspire efforts to end gender biases and discrimination and achieve gender equality. This year, the theme of International Womens Day is, Accelerate Action, which is a worldwide call to acknowledge strategies, resources, and activities that positively impact womens advancement, and to support and elevate their implementation. A Google Doodle is a thematic motif that is used by the search engine on its homepage to mark special occasions. Google has also used doodles to celebrate prominent people, their achievements, and more. The first Google Doodle was published in 1998 as a quick way for Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to let people know they would be out of office for Burning Man. In 2000, Google launched the first international doodle to celebrate Bastille Day in France. The first interactive game Doodle was launched on May 21, 2010, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the popular game, Pac-Man. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "content": "The total number of foreign tourists who have arrived in Sri Lanka in the first two months of 2025 has already surpassed 500,000, according to the latest data. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has expressed confidence in reaching the target of 3 million tourist arrivals for the year 2025. The tourism industry, which remains a significant contributor to Sri Lankas economy, is currently experiencing remarkable growth. The expected target of 2 million foreign tourist arrivals for 2024 was successfully achieved. It is noteworthy that more than 500,000 foreign tourists visited Sri Lanka in the initial two months of this year, which has further fueled optimism within the sector. According to the SLTDA, a total of 530,746 foreign tourists arrived in Sri Lanka between January 1 and March 5, 2025. The largest nationality of tourists, numbering 84,476, arrived from neighboring India. Following India, Russia contributed more than 70,000 tourist arrivals, while the United Kingdom ranks third with over 50,000 visitors.

        "title": "Actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa died of natural causes one week apart",
        "date": "March 8, 2025 04:56 pm",
        "content": "Forensic experts came to a heartrending conclusion Friday about the manner of death for actor Gene Hackman: he died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimers disease on an empty stomach a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease took the life of his wife at their home in Santa Fe. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances and revealed that Arakawa likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimers, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead. He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately thats what resulted in his death, chief medical investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said. Its quite possible he was not aware she was deceased. Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Arakawas last known outing was a round of errands and shopping Feb. 11. She visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to the couples gated neighborhood that evening. Arakawa stopped answering emails that day. The couples cellphone communications have not yet been analyzed. Hackmans pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said. Hackman was found in the homes entryway, and Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Their bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fes especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters). The revelations about the manner of the couples deaths jolted Santa Fe, the state capital city known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors. All of us that knew him should have been checking on him, said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery, who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio. I had no idea. ... Its just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God. Experts believe Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimers disease and unable to deal with his wifes death in the last week of his life  or seek help after she died. Their (the authorities) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible, said Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case. Most older Americans with Alzheimers diesease and related dementias live at home, and many receive care from family or friends. Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year. While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection. Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died. One of the couples three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. A necropsy will be done on the dog. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dogs necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home. Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym. Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywoods social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia OKeeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and Arakawa were investors in local businesses. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Major powers should not bully the weak, Chinas foreign minister says",
        "date": "March 8, 2025 05:56 pm",
        "content": "Beijing will resolutely counter U.S. pressure on tariffs and the fentanyl issue, Chinas foreign minister said on Friday, adding that major powers should not bully the weak, in a veiled swipe at the Trump administrations foreign policy. Top diplomat Wang Yi also presented China as a reliable global power in the midst of geopolitical turmoil and U.S. President Donald Trumps withdrawal from international institutions, part of a clear appeal from Beijing to Europe and countries in the Global South. The U.S. levied an additional 10 tariff on Chinese imports this week over the continued flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the country, threatening to worsen an escalatory spiral of trade actions. If one side blindly exerts pressure, China will resolutely counter that, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference on the sidelines of Chinas annual parliamentary meeting. The U.S. should not repay kindness with grievances, let alone impose tariffs without reason, Wang added, referring to the various assistance Beijing has provided Washington on tackling the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs into the U.S. No country can suppress China on the one hand and develop good relations with China on the other, said Wang, when asked how China would engage with the Trump administration over the next four years. Such a two-faced approach is not helpful to stable ties, he said, without identifying any individual in the U.S. administration. Wangs largely subdued remarks on the U.S., without mentioning Trump once by name, suggested Beijing wishes to keep the prospect of potential future trade talks alive, said Wen-Ti Sung, a Taiwan-based nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Councils Global China Hub. They want to pursue any room for de-escalation with Trump when it comes to trade, Sung said. One way of doing it is to keep the level of rhetorical intensity down to manageable size to preserve room for manoeuvre for both sides. UKRAINE STANCE On resolving the Ukraine war, China wants to achieve a fair, lasting and binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties, Wang Yi said. China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in the final resolution of the crisis and the realisation of lasting peace, in accordance with the wishes of the parties concerned, together with the international community. Western countries have urged Beijing to take a more active role in using its economic leverage over Russia to stop the war, but Beijing has so far refused to publicly criticise its strategic partner or halt its economic support of Moscow. China-Russia relations are a constant in a turbulent world, not a variable in geopolitical games, Wang told the press conference. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently reaffirmed Beijings no limits partnership with Moscow in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart on the third anniversary of Moscows 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump has upended U.S. policy on Ukraine after taking office last month, showing a more conciliatory stance towards Russia that has unnerved Washingtons traditional allies in the West. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday the Ukraine conflict is a proxy war between Washington and Moscow that needs to end, and has previously said that Washington wishes to peel off Moscow from Beijing. Analysts say Beijing wishes to exploit the growing transatlantic rift to bolster its ties with European countries, which have been strained over Ukraine and trade tensions. China still has confidence in Europe, and believes Europe can still be Chinas trusted partner, Wang said. GLOBAL SOUTH Wang also urged developing countries to continue to improve our representation and discourse power in global governance. If every country emphasizes its own national priorities and believes in strength and status, the world will regress to the law of the jungle, small and weak countries will bear the brunt, said Wang in a veiled reference to Washingtons actions. Major powers ... should not be profit-driven, and they should not bully the weak. Within the first two months of taking office, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from several multilateral organisations and climate agreements, suspended most foreign aid, and voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia for the Ukraine invasion. At a time when the Trump administrations foreign policy is revising a lot of established expectations, China wants to present itself as preserving the status quo, said Sung, the analyst. When the Global South sees a retrenching, inward-looking U.S., theres a fear of a strategic vacuum - one that China intends to help fill. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2025 07:27 pm",
        "content": "CPI(M) MLA Muhammad Yousuf Tarigami has questioned the allotment of land to Sri Lankan cricket legend Muttiah Muralitharan in Kathua, during the ongoing budget session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on Saturday. He expressed concerns regarding the legal basis of the decision, although he did not specify the cricketers name, Indian media reporter. The cricketer in question is former Sri Lankan ace spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who has been allotted 206 kanals (about 25 acres) in Kathua to set up an INR 1,642-crore aluminium can manufacturing and beverages filling unit, according to a report on The Week. The project is part of the new industrial policy introduced after abrogation of Article 370. His company, Ceylon Beverages, already has a plant in Karnataka and is now expanding into Jammu and Kashmir. The lease was signed on June 14 last year. Muralitharans investment aligns with the JK governments plan to turn Kathua into an industrial hub, particularly in Bhagthali village near the Punjab border, which has been designated for industrial expansion. As the government actively promotes JK as an investment destination, Muralitharans venture is among the high-profile foreign investments in the region. The issue has reignited discussions on land allotment policies in JK, especially regarding foreign investors. Opposition leaders are demanding more transparency in the land allotment process, making it a politically sensitive issue. Congress MLA Ghulam Ahmad Mir, too, called for transparency, describing it as a serious issue that required immediate scrutiny. Responding to the concerns, Agriculture Production Minister Javaid Ahmad Dar acknowledged the matter but said it falls under the Revenue Departments jurisdiction. Muralitharan, who is regarded as one of the best spinners in the history of the game, holds the record for the most number of wickets in Tests (800) and ODIs (534), and five-wicket (67) and 10-wicket (22) hauls in Tests.

Police said that two unidentified assailants on a motorcycle had opened fire on them before fleeing the scene. The incident occurred at around 6:45 p.m. today (8). The attack targeted two individuals at a motorcycle spare parts shop, police said. The injured victims, aged 30 and 34, have been identified as Chamara Nadi Sadaruwan, the owner of the shop, and Asitha Devinda, the assistant at the shop. They are residents of the Katugastara and Yakkala areas and have been admitted to the Gampaha Hospital for treatment. Reports claim that Chamara Nadi Sadaruwan, the owner of the shop, is allegedly involved in drug trafficking activities and has connections to the notorious underworld figure known as Kehelbaddara Padme. It is also reported that Sadaruwan had been threatened by Thammita Sumith, who runs drug operations for the slain underworld figure Ganemulla Sanjeewa, who was fatally shot dead at the Aluthkade No. 05 Magistrates Court on February 19, 2025. Sadaruwan was allegedly threatened and told to stop his drug-related activities, according to police. Initial findings suggest that the shooting was carried out under the direction of Thammita Sumith in connection to this dispute. The shooting is believed to have been carried out using a 9mm pistol, said police. Gampaha Police are conducting further investigations to apprehend the suspects.",

The Minister made this statement in Parliament today (March 8) during the Committee Stage Debate on expenditure head of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, in response to a statement made by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa. During the debate, Premadasa emphasized the importance of incorporating childrens and womens rights into the countrys fundamental rights chapter. He proposed amending the Constitution to guarantee these rights and strengthening Sri Lankas commitments to international agreements on womens and childrens rights. I also specifically propose the announcement and implementation of two special presidential task forcesone for children and the younger generation, and another for women in this country, he said. Minister Nanayakkara, in his response, acknowledged the necessity of a robust legal framework to protect women and children. He agreed with the Opposition Leaders call for constitutional amendments but pointed out that legal measures alone may not be sufficient to change societal attitudes. Can attitudes be changed solely through law? These attitudes are shaped during childhood, Minister Nanayakkara said. A childs character develops based on what they see in their environment. If we want to create a society where women are safe and respected, it starts at home. While we can enact laws and amend the Constitution, I believe that if every mother and father teaches their children to respect women from a young age, we will gradually build a society where men stand up for the protection of women. The Minister also reiterated his commitment to addressing corporal punishment in childrens upbringing. We specifically need to ban corporal punishment that harms children, he stated. A bill has already been drafted, and as the Minister of Justice, I will take the necessary steps to present it to Parliament as soon as possible, Minister added.",

        "date": "March 9, 2025 08:37 am",
        "content": "The Excise Department of Sri Lanka has announced plans to introduce a new type of alcohol at a lower price to combat the growing consumption of illicit liquor. Commissioner General of Excise, Udaya Kumara, stated at a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) that the increase in alcohol prices had led many people to resort to consuming illicit alcohol, resulting in a significant loss of tax revenue for the government. Kumara explained that due to rising alcohol prices, many individuals have turned to illicit alcohol, a trend that has been prevalent for some time. He emphasized, however, that through regulation and oversight, it is possible to bring consumers back to legal alcohol, thereby increasing government revenue. He further stated, In the past two months, we have implemented targeted raids and enforcement actions, which have helped boost our income. It was not the increase in taxes that led to this rise in revenue, but rather the shift from illegal to legal trade. As we continue to regulate the sector, we anticipate further revenue growth. Therefore, I believe that if we continue to regulate this market further, we can increase our income. Commissioner General Kumara also highlighted that introducing a new, affordable alcohol product could generate additional income of approximately Rs. 50 billion. By introducing a new alcoholic beverage that caters to consumers seeking a lower price point, we estimate that it could generate an income of approximately Rs. 50 billion. I will consult with my team to develop a proposal, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. Additionally, Excise Officer Jayantha Bandara, speaking at the event, noted that the consumption of hard liquor has been declining annually since 2022. He explained that the proposed new alcohol product aims to minimize the harm caused by the harmful substances typically found in illegal alcohol. The initial phase of the plan involves introducing a 180-milliliter bottle of alcohol, which is expected to generate tax revenue ranging from Rs. 50 billion to Rs. 100 billion, according to Officer Bandara.",

        "date": "March 9, 2025 08:54 am",
        "content": "Israel and Hamas signaled on Saturday they were preparing for the next phase of ceasefire negotiations, as mediators pushed ahead with talks to extend the fragile 42-day truce that began in January. Hamas said there were positive indicators for the start of the ceasefires second-phase talks but did not elaborate. Israel also said it was preparing for talks. Israel has accepted the invitation of the mediators backed by the U.S., and will send a delegation to Doha on Monday in an effort to advance the negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said. A delegation from Hamas is engaging in ceasefire talks in Cairo with Egyptian mediators who have been helping facilitate the talks along with officials from Qatar. They aim to proceed to the next stage of the deal, which could open the way to ending the war. We affirm our readiness to engage in the second-phase negotiations in a way that meets the demands of our people, and we call for intensified efforts to aid the Gaza Strip and lift the blockade on our suffering people, Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said in a statement. In a later statement reporting its delegations meeting with the head of Egypts general intelligence agency, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, Hamas affirmed the groups approval of forming a committee of what it described as national and independent characters to run Gaza until elections. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi earlier said Cairo had worked in cooperation with Palestinians on creating an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the end of the Israel-Gaza war. His remarks came during the Arab summit which adopted Egypts alternative reconstruction plan for Gaza, as opposed to U.S. President Donald Trumps Middle East Riviera vision. Even as diplomacy continued, an Israeli airstrike killed two Palestinians in Rafah in southern Gaza on Saturday, medical sources said. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck a drone that crossed from Israel into southern Gaza and several suspects who tried to collect it in what appeared to be a botched smuggling attempt. The strike came after an Israeli drone strike killed two people in Gaza on Friday. The Israeli military said it attacked a group of suspected militants operating near its troops in northern Gaza and planting an explosive device in the ground. The Gaza ceasefire deal that took effect in January calls for the remaining 59 hostages in Hamas captivity to be freed in a second phase, during which final plans would be negotiated for an end to the war. The first phase of the ceasefire ended last week. Israel has since imposed a total blockade on all goods entering the enclave, demanding that Hamas free the remaining hostages without beginning the negotiations to end the Gaza war. Fighting has been halted since January 19 and Hamas has released 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israeli authorities believe fewer than half of the remaining 59 hostages are still alive. Israels assault on the enclave has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. It has also internally displaced nearly Gazas entire population and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. The assault began after Hamas-led Islamist fighters raided southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

        "date": "March 9, 2025 06:10 pm",
        "content": "Russian special forces crept miles through a major gas pipeline near the town of Sudzha in an attempt to surprise Ukrainian forces as part of a major offensive to eject Ukrainian soldiers from the western Russian region of Kursk, pro-Russian war bloggers said. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers seized about 1,300 square km of Russias Kursk region in August last year in what Kyiv said was an attempt to gain a bargaining chip in future negotiations and to force Russia to shift forces from eastern Ukraine. Russia has been pressing the attack with some success in recent days, with open source maps on Friday showing Kyivs contingent in Kursk nearly surrounded after rapid Russian advances. Russian advances in 2024 and U.S. President Donald Trumps upending of U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia have caused fears among European leaders that Ukraine will lose the war and that Trump is turning his back on Europe. The United States paused military aid and the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine this month after a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on February 28 descended into acrimony in front of the worlds media. In its daily update on the situation in Kursk, Russias Defence Ministry said its forces had retaken the village of Lebedevka, as well as seizing Novenke, a hamlet across the border in Ukraines neighbouring Sumy region. Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said Russian special forces had walked miles along the inside of the major gas pipeline and some had spent several days in the pipe before surprising Ukrainian forces from the rear near Sudzha. Sudzha is the home of major gas transfer and measuring stations on a pipeline that used to carry Russian natural gas into the Ukrainian gas transmission system for onward transportation to Europe. Battle for Sudzha Pro-Russian war blogger Two Majors said a major battle was under way for Sudzha and that Russian forces had surprised Ukrainian soldiers by entering the area via a major gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed pictures of special forces in gas masks and lights, some using colourful Russian curses, along the inside of what looked like a large pipe. A statement from Ukraines general staff said that Russian soldiers had used the gas pipeline in an attempt to gain a foothold, but airborne assault forces promptly detected them and responded with rocket, artillery and drone attacks that were destroying the Russian units. Owing to battlefield reporting restrictions on both sides, Reuters was unable to verify the reports. Russias invasion of Ukraine has led to the biggest confrontation between the West and Russia since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Both the Kremlin and White House have said missteps could trigger World War Three. In the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have made slow but steady progress during gruelling fighting in what was once Ukraines industrial heartland, Moscow said on Sunday that its forces had taken the village of Konstyantynopil. Ukraines incursion into Kursk last August was the most serious attack on Russian territory since the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Fighting continued throughout the night in Sudzha, said Podolyaka, adding that part of the town was under Russian control. Another war blogger, Yuri Kotenok, said that Ukrainian forces have been moving equipment away from Sudzha, closer to the border. At the moment, our units are attacking in the north-eastern part of Sudzha and fighting in the area of Lomonosov Street and the industrial zone of Sudzha, Kotenok said. The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline used to bring gas from western Siberia via Sudzha to Ukraine but Ukraine terminated all Russian gas transit through its territory from January 1.

The driver and conductor of an SLTB bus plying between Welikanda and Galkanda have been interdicted in connection with an incident in which they allegedly neglected their duties while under the influence of alcohol during duty hours.

A team of Welikanda Police officers subsequently responded to the call. It is reported that the conductor was already asleep at the scene, intoxicated, and the driver had fled. The bus, which was parked at the Welikanda bus stand, was the only one available for travel to the Galkanda area, and a group of passengers including school students, had already gathered, waiting for the bus, Ada Derana reporter said. However, the Welikanda Police had taken steps to provide transportation in a police jeep for passengers who were facing difficulties, as the bus was not operating due to the absence of the driver and conductor. A spokesperson for the SLTB Polonnaruwa Depot said that the relevant authorities had filed a complaint with the Welikanda Police regarding the incident, and the driver and conductor have been temporarily interdicted pending further investigations.",

        "date": "March 10, 2025 06:38 am",
        "content": "Former central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canadas ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed on Sunday. Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United Statesunder President Donald Trump and must hold a general election soon. Carney, 59, took 86 of votes cast to beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland in a contest in which just under 152,000 party members voted. Theres someone whos trying to weaken our economy, Carney said of Trump, spurring loud boos at the party gathering. Hes attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses. We cant let him succeed. This wont be business as usual, Carney said. We will have to do things that we havent imagined before, at speeds we didnt think possible. Trudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him. Make no mistake, this is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given, Trudeau said. Carney, a political novice, argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canadas export-dependent economy. Trudeau has imposed C30 billion of retaliatory tariffs on the United States in response to tariffs Trump levied on Canada. My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect, Carney said. Carneys win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks - Canada and England - meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump. The prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trumps tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes. Rally-around-the-Flag Moment At the start of 2025 the party trailed by 20 or more points but is now statistically tied with the official opposition Conservatives led by career politician Pierre Poilievre in several polls. At a protest outside Canadas Parliament building in Ottawa on Sunday, dozens of Canadians held up signs protesting Trump with no reference to domestic politics. There is a rallying-around-the-flag moment that we would never have predicted a year ago, said University of British Columbia politics professor Richard Johnston. I think its probably true as we speak that the Liberals have been saved from oblivion. Polls though indicate that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives would be able to form a majority government. An election must be held by October 20. Two Liberal Party sources said Carney would call an election in coming weeks, meaning one could take place much sooner. Carney could legally serve as prime minister without a seat in the House of Commons but tradition dictates that he should seek to win one as soon as possible. Liberals sought to compare Conservative leader Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 10, 2025 11:01 am",
        "content": "An earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Afghanistan on Monday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks. In a post on X, the NCS said, EQ of M: 4.0, On: 10032025 07:01:10 IST, Lat: 36.97 N, Long: 73.14 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Hindu Kush Region, Afghanistan. Shallow earthquakes like this one are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earths surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface. Earlier in the day, Afghanistans neighbour, Pakistan, was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter Scale. EQ of M: 4.2, On: 10032025 02:46:22 IST, Lat: 36.10 N, Long: 71.43 E, Depth: 170 Km, Location: Pakistan, the NCS stated in a post on X. On March 8, Pakistan was struck by an earthquake of 4.3 magnitude, as per NCS. As per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes. These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks, UNOCHA noted. Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes, and the Hindu Kush Mountain range is a geologically active area where quakes occur every year, according to the Red Cross. Afghanistan sits on numerous fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, with a fault line also running directly through Herat. Source: ANI --Agencies",

TikToks fate has been up in the air since a law requiring its owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on January 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. Asked if there was going to soon be a deal on TikTok, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One, it could. Were dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it ... all four are good, he added. TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment outside of normal business hours. The turmoil at TikTok has attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business analysts estimate could be worth as much as 50 billion.

        "title": "Worm Blood Moon: Total lunar eclipse to grace the skies this week",
        "date": "March 10, 2025 12:30 pm",
        "content": "Are you ready for one of the most extraordinary full moons of the decade? Later this week, one of the most beautiful celestial sights of all comes to North America as the full Worm Moon is totally eclipsed by Earth. The final full moon of winter will pass through our planets dark shadow in space to become, for 65 minutes only, a reddish-hued blood moon. Viewable by the entirety of North America if skies are clear, this first total lunar eclipse for two and a half yearsthe good view of one for the continent until 2029promises to be a highlight of 2025. Heres everything you need to know to see the blood moon at its best. What Is The Worm Moon? The Worm Moon is the traditional name for the March full moon in early Native American and European folklore. It marks a time of year when earthworms begin to emerge from the thawing soil, signaling the end of winter and the approach of spring. In 2025, the Worm Moon will reach its full phase at 2:56 a.m. EST on Friday, March 14, and will rise later that evening, glowing warmly in the eastern sky. This year, however, Earths shadow will fully envelop the almost full moon during the night, turning it red for a dramatic 65 minutes. When Is The Total Lunar Eclipse? The total lunar eclipse will occur overnight on Thursday, March 13, and Friday, March 14, 2025. The event is global, occurring at the same time for everyone on the night side of Earth. Here are the key times for North American viewers: Eastern Time (EST): Totality from 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14. Central Time (CST): Totality from 1:26 a.m. to 2:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14. Mountain Time (MST): Totality from 12:26 a.m. to 1:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14. Pacific Time (PST): Totality from 11:26 p.m. on Thursday, March 13, to 12:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14. Alaska Time (AKST): Totality from 10:26 p.m. to 11:31 p.m. on Thursday, March 13. Hawaii Time (HST): Totality from 8:26 p.m. to 9:31 p.m. on Thursday, March 13. The partial phases, which occur before and after totality, are also worth watching. They begin about an hour before totality and continue for about an hour minutes after, as Earths shadow gradually moves across and then away from the moon. How To Watch The Blood Moon The best time to observe the blood moon is during totality, when the full moon is fully immersed in Earths shadow and takes on a reddish and even coppery glow. Its briefly striking color is caused by sunlight filtering through Earths atmosphere and refracting onto the moons surface, with smoke or ash in the atmosphere contributing to the exact colors seen. You dont need to go anywhere special to see the eclipselight pollution in urban areas wont affect the view. However, what light pollution will lessen the impact of is the appearance of stars around the moon as the night sky darkens considerably during totality. Thats why astrophotographers will likely visit dark sky destinations to take wide-angle shots of the sky and landscapes below, though close-ups through telescopes are possible from any location on the night side of Earth. Since the event takes place overnight in March in the Northern Hemisphere, warm clothes, blankets and hot drinks are recommended, as are binoculars or a telescope for a close-up, though naked eyes are all thats needed. When To See The Worm Moon Rise After the eclipse is over, the Worm Moon set in the west during dawn on Friday, March 14, only to rise again in the evening, just after sunset. Moonrise times vary by location: New York: sunset at 7:01 p.m. EDT; moonrise at 7:38 p.m. EDT. Los Angeles: sunset at 6:59 p.m. PDT; moonrise at 7:41 p.m. PDT. London: sunset at 6:02 p.m. BST; moonrise at 6:31 p.m. BST. While the total lunar eclipse the previous night will have been visible only to those on the night side of Earth, the sight of the full moon appearing on the eastern horizon and climbing higher in the sky will be visible across the world. When Is The Next Full Moon? The final full moon of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Worm Moon, will be followed on Saturday, April 12, by the Pink Moon, the first full moon of spring. Before that, on March 29, a partial solar eclipse will be visible from northeastern North America and across Europe. Source: Forbes --Agencies",

        "content": "Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Dr. Anil Jayantha, stated that steps have already been initiated to look into the ratification of the ILO Convention No. 190 on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work for Sri Lanka. He made this statement while responding to the Motion at the Adjournment Time moved by Member of Parliament Rohini Kumari Wijerathna representing the Women Parliamentarians Caucus on March 8, in line with International Womens Day, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Further elaborating on the matter, the Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Dr. Anil Jayantha, emphasized that the government is committed to creating a world of work free from violence and harassment. He stated that discussions regarding this had taken place during two prior meetings with the representative of the International Labour Organization in Sri Lanka, the statement added. Accordingly, he underscored the expectation of everyones support in eliminating violence and harassment in the workplace, it added. During this debate held on March 8, 2025, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., several Members of Parliament expressed their views on the significance of ILO Convention 190. Recognizing the right of all individuals to a work environment free from violence and harassment based on gender equality, ILO Convention 190 on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work was adopted on June 21, 2019, during the 108th session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Every member state that ratifies this convention is obligated to commit to ensuring a work environment where all individuals can operate without violence and harassment, the statement highlighted. The ratification of this convention further affirms the governments responsibility to uphold a world of work free from violence and harassment and requires necessary legal enforcement mechanisms to be implemented accordingly. During the debate, it was highlighted that Sri Lankas failure to take the necessary steps to ratify this convention has deprived all individuals, including women in Sri Lanka, of the opportunities and protections provided by it.",

        "title": "Lab-grown food could be sold in UK within two years",
        "date": "March 10, 2025 03:40 pm",
        "content": "Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods. Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants. UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations. Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month. In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year. However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans. The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers. It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting. But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest. The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time. Prof Robin May, the FSAs chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety. We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can, he said. But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach. The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it, she said. The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as deregulation. It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation, he told BBC News. It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication. Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the foods properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier. The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures. Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows. The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farms CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait. If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britains food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive. Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial Colleges Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. It doesnt make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks. In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Grahams firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval. The path to getting approval is not straightforward, she tells me. They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we dont have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like. The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right. It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them. But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold. Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications, he said. And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The ceremonial awarding of the Sri Sannas Patra to the newly appointed Supreme Mahanayaka Thero of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Karagoda Uyangoda Maithree Moorthi Maha Nayaka Thero, Chief Incumbent of the Rassagala Chapter and Balangoda Sri Dharmananda Vidyayathana Pirivena, was held on Monday (March 10) at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake presented the Sri Sannas Patra to the newly appointed Supreme Mahanayaka Thero of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Additionally, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, Dr. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi offered the Vijinipata to the Supreme Mahanayaka Thero. Most Venerable Karagoda Uyangoda Maithree Moorthi Maha Nayaka Thero was born on October 1, 1948, in Kamburupitiya, Matara, and entered the noble monastic life in 1962 under the guidance of Aggamaha Pandita Balangoda Ananda Maithriya Thero.In recognition of his more than six decades of dedicated service to Buddhism, religion, society, and education, the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya has appointed him as the new Supreme Mahanayaka Thero. Addressing the ceremony, President Dissanayake stated that in the process of restoring a morally upright nation, the Maha Sangha and religious institutions of this country bear an irreplaceable and profound responsibility, the PMD added. The President further emphasized that no matter how many economic and political victories are achieved, they would be meaningless if a just and virtuous society is not established. The President highlighted that the restoration of the nations fractured society cannot be achieved through law alone and stressed the need to build a compassionate society. He further stated that the country urgently requires a strong national dialogue on the essence of liberation, as preached by the Buddha and other religious leaders, for the well-being of its citizens. The President also mentioned that discussions are currently underway with the Mahanayaka Theros regarding the Buddhist Dialogue Act. The President further noted that amendments to Sections 41 and 42 of the Viharagam and Dewalagam Ordinance have been drafted, and steps will be taken to present them to the Cabinet soon. Once approved, they will be submitted to the Parliament for enactment, ensuring the formal establishment of the Sangha Council and granting the necessary authority to the Mahanayaka Theros and the Sangha Sabha, according to the PMD. During the ceremony, commemorative publications, including the biography of the Mahanayaka Thero, were also presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The event was attended by the Maha Sangha representing the tri-Nikaya, former Presidents and Prime Ministers, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Ministers, MPs, foreign Ambassadors and High Commissioners, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, government officials, members of Dayaka Sabha, and a large gathering of devotees. --PMD",

        "title": "Japans Nissan tests driverless vehicles in city streets filled with cars and people",
        "date": "March 10, 2025 04:49 pm",
        "content": "The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and theres no one in the drivers seat. The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japans eagerness to catch up with players like Googles Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S. Japan, home to the worlds top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building. Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details havent been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along. During Nissans demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app. Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car  simply because it knows cars better. How the sensors must be adapted to the cars movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall, he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride. Nissans technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industrys Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automakers headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails. Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing. Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030. Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nations shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers. Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology. So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyos Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissans autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels. Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own city or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving. Progress has been cautious. University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because its human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes. In human driving, the driver takes responsibility. Its so clear. But nobody is driving so you dont know who will take responsibility, Igarashi told The Associated Press. In Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service  restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable. Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human cant be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors. When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well. Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started. The main problem is whats known as edge cases, those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said. We will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years, said Koopman. There is no magic switch. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Ex-CBSL Governor defends ISB borrowings, says it averted early default",
        "date": "March 10, 2025 05:39 pm",
        "content": "Former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, addressed allegations regarding the surge in International Sovereign Bond (ISB) borrowings during his tenure that led to the countrys debt default, clarifying that much of the debt was used for liability management and to avert an earlier default. Speaking at a public lecture on A New Paradigm in Macroeconomic Management, Dr. Coomaraswamy responded to claims that his administrations borrowing policies contributed to Sri Lankas eventual default. He acknowledged that ISB borrowings increased from USD 5 billion in early 2015 to USD 15 billion by the end of 2019 but argued that nearly half of this was due to switching financial instruments for better cost management and stability. Commenting further, he clarified: Thank you very much for asking me that question, giving me a chance to explain. One is I think the ISBs went up from 5 billion in the beginning of 2015 to 15 billion by end of 2019. So theres a 10 billion increase in the ISBs outstanding. Of the USD 10 billion increase in ISBs, USD 5 billion was due to switching instruments. In 2015, USD 3.5 billion of portfolio investment was in rupee securities, which are highly volatile. We reduced that to USD 600 million by 2019, and we also cut down SWAPs from USD 2.5 billion to USD 500 million. By shifting from these short-term and expensive options to ISBs, which had lower interest rates and longer maturities, we improved both cost efficiency and financial stability. He also defended the controversial USD 4.5 billion raised in 2019, noting that the issuance was intended as a buffer in anticipation of potential policy shifts under a new government. The second thing to say is that 4 billion that was raised in 2019, the practice was to have one issuance  usually at the beginning of the year, somewhere in February-March and we were used to raise about 2 and a half billion. That was actually successfully completed in March. Then we had the Easter bombing and it was clear as night follows day that the government was going to change. It was also clear that the incoming government and the people who are going to be doing economic policy in that government were likely to change policy significantly. I shouldnt talk for others, but my own thinking at the time was that the IMF programme will be discontinued. We may have difficulty in retaining our access to capital markets. We were told by our advisors that the markets were willing to give us some more money which was very surprising to me because we had had the constitutional crisis in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had the Easter bombing and people were still saying you know, we can give you money. Mainly because at that time, we had passed the Active Liability Management Act, we had published the medium term debt management strategy and the national exports strategy was published. All those things had been put out as to explain how we are going to manage this situation. Our line was - yes we have a very fragile debt dynamics, but we know how to handle it and this is what we are doing to handle it. Because of that, the markets were willing to give us more money. So, we took the money to build up our reserves that even if there is a reversal in policy as there was, we would have a bit of a buffer and give the government a bit more time to go back to the IMF. We thought they would leave the IMF, but then we thought that would be the wrong policy and that it would leave into a lot of reserves eventually, but we gave a bit more time for the government to switch course by building up our reserves, by taking a second ISB. So, thats how the 4.5 billion came in 2019 to give really a buffer for the government which was likely to come in, to basically as to how they wanted to proceed, he added. Dr. Coomaraswamy emphasized that much of the borrowing under his tenure was used to service existing debt rather than fund new spending. Theres also some Vérité research that was published that the total debt undertaken between 2015 and 2019, 89 of that was accounted for by repaying previous debt and in fact, in the World Banks development update I think a couple of years ago there was a development update had a box in which they said that in 2017, 90 of the total borrowings went to repay previous debt. The government was basically borrowing to repay debt, Dr. Coomaraswamy noted. If we hadnt continue to borrow, issue ISBs and borrow, the maturity will have been increased, the cost would have been gone down. If we didnt continue to do that, we would have I think defaulted much earlier. He concluded by stressing that CBSLs debt strategy at the time aimed to gradually reduce external borrowings while extending maturities to avoid sudden rollover crises. We were trying to contain the situation. The medium term debt management strategy says basically that we must gradually reduce our external borrowings, because if you suddenly reduce it, you have a rollover problem. Thats what we had in here. We were trying to gradually reduce it and increase time to maturity, get rid of SWAPs and the short term stuff. I think we were on course, then markets recognized it. Thats why they gave us a second ISB and that was really to build up a buffer in terms of reserves in case the government wanted to change course, he added.",
