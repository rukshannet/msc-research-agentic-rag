        "content": "The service extension granted to the current Inspector General of Police (IGP), C.D. Wickremeratne is scheduled to end today (Oct. 09). The current IGP C.D. Wickramaratne was initially supposed to retire from the police service on March 26, 2023, however, President Ranil Wickremesinghe extended his tenure by three months until June 26 by way of a special gazette notification dated April 06. Later on July 09, he was granted another 03-month service extension as the police chief. However, a final decision on whether to appoint a new IGP or to grant current IGP Wickremeratne with another service extension will reportedly be arrived at today. Nevertheless, the sources predict that in view of the current situation, Wickramaratne will continue to work in the same position further. It is also reported that several parties have informed the President that there is a risk of some dissension within the Sri Lanka Police if a new IGP is appointed.",

Pugalendhi, the petitioner stated that he was a Sri Lankan national, and hence had been detained in a special camp (foreigners detention centre) under the Foreigners Act, 1946 ever since he was released from prison on November 12, 2022 pursuant to a Supreme Court order. Mr. Santhan claimed that the Union Home Ministry had passed an order on November 11, 2022 ordering that he should not move out of the boundaries of the special camp till his deportation to his home country. The petitioner said that he wanted to go to Sri Lanka immediately, since his 75-year-old mother residing in Valvetti in Jaffna was seriously ill.

        "date": "October 9, 2023 05:04 pm",
        "content": "China aims to boost the countrys aggregate computing power by more than 50 by 2025, according to a plan released by authorities on Monday, as Beijing tightens its focus on supercomputing and artificial intelligence innovations. The plan comes amid rising competition between China and the U.S. in many high-tech areas ranging from semiconductors and supercomputers to AI, including U.S. export controls on chipmaking equipment. The plan, released by six departments in Beijing including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), has set a target for Chinas total computing power to reach 300 EFLOPS by 2025. EFLOPS, equal to one quintillion floating-point operations per second, measures a computers speed. The MIIT revealed in August that Chinas computing power has reached 197 EFLOPS this year, up from 180 EFLOPS in 2022. The ministry said it ranks China as second behind the United States, but did not elaborate on the scale of the U.S. computing power it referenced. As AI training requires a large amount of computation, the effort to expand the supply of computing power is increasingly becoming a focus for Beijing. According to a blog post by Google last month, the worlds top-tier generative AI models will require tens of EFLOPs of AI supercomputing to maintain training times of several weeks or less. According to the plan, China aims to build out more data centres across the country to facilitate businesses access to computing power. In order to meet the demands of the rapidly developing AI industry, Beijing also plans to improve computational infrastructure in western China. Expansive but less populated provinces in China such as southwestern Guizhou have long been tasked to establish massive data centres to power the countrys internet. For example, Apple has set up data centres in Guizhou with a local partner to serve its users in the country. Another focus is to improve the speed and efficiency of the computation network. The plan said that transmission speeds between critical computing facilities must not allow a latency of more than 5 milliseconds. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Nobel economics prize goes to Claudia Goldin",
        "date": "October 9, 2023 05:59 pm",
        "content": "American economic historian Claudia Goldin won the 2023 Nobel economics prize for her work examining wage inequality between men and women, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the last of this years crop of Nobel prizes and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns, or nearly 1 million. This years Laureate in the Economic Sciences, Claudia Goldin, provided the first comprehensive account of womens earnings and labour market participation through the centuries, the prize-giving body said in a statement. Her research reveals the causes of change, as well as the main sources of the remaining gender gap. The award for economics is the final instalment of this years crop of Nobels that have seen prizes go to COVID-19 vaccine discoveries, atomic snapshots and quantum dots as well as to a Norwegian dramatist and an Iranian activist. Goldin, who in 1990 became the first woman to be tenured at the Harvard economics department, is only the third woman to win the Nobel economics prize. She was surprised and very, very happy, said Hans Ellegren, Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Goldins 1990 book Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women was a hugely influential examination of the roots of wage inequality. She has followed up with studies on the impact of the contraceptive pill on womens career and marriage decisions, womens surnames after marriage as a social indicator and the reasons why women are now the majority of undergraduates. Claudia Goldins discoveries have vast societal implications, said Randi Hjalmarsson, member of the Economic Prize committee. By finally understanding the problem and calling it by the right name, we will be able to pave a better route forward. BOTH LOSE While it is illegal across much of the world for employers to discriminate based on gender, women still face significant shortfalls in pay compared to men. In the United States, women last year earned on average 82 of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. In Europe, meanwhile, women earned 13 on average less per hour than men in 2021, according to European Commission data. Goldins work revealed that while there has been progress in narrowing the gap over past decades, there is little evidence of it fully closing any time soon. She has attributed the gap to factors ranging from outright discrimination to phenomena such as greedy work, a term she coined for jobs that pay disproportionately more per hour when someone works longer or has less control over those hours - effectively penalising women who need to seek flexible labour. The important point is that both lose, she told the Social Science Bites blog last year. Men forgo time with their family and women often forgo their career. The economics award is not one of the original prizes for science, literature and peace created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, but a later addition established and funded by Swedens central bank in 1968. The first economics prize was awarded the following year and past winners include a host of influential thinkers and academics such Friedrich August von Hayek, Milton Friedman and, more recently, U.S. economist Paul Krugman. Last year, a trio of U.S. economists including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke won for their research on how regulating banks and propping up failing lenders with public cash can stave off an even deeper economic crisis, like the Great Depression of the 1930s. As with the other Nobel prizes, the vast majority of the economics awards have gone to men. Only two women have previously landed one - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 and Esther Duflo a decade later.

        "content": "In a briefing to the Cabinet, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed deep concern over the recent attacks in Israel and its implications on Sri Lankans and Israelis residing in both countries. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for immediate action to ensure the safety of Sri Lankans working in Israel. He directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to locate and ensure the well-being of these individuals, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Additionally, he called for assistance in facilitating the return of Israelis, including tourists and employees, from Sri Lanka to Israel and urged the police to provide necessary security measures for Israelis within Sri Lanka. While reaffirming Sri Lankas longstanding support for the two-state concept of Israel and Palestine, President Wickremesinghe condemned the recent Hamas attack on Israel, which resulted in the loss of numerous civilian lives. He stressed that despite past criticisms of Israels actions, such attacks could not be justified, it added. President Wickremesinghe called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in line with the African Union proposal, emphasizing the broader consequences of the crisis on global fuel prices. He noted that the ongoing conflict would likely lead to a prolonged period of high fuel prices, adversely affecting developing economies, including Sri Lanka. The Presidents statement underscores Sri Lankas commitment to peace and stability in the region and its concern for the safety and well-being of its citizens and foreign residents amidst the current crisis, according to the PMD. Statement to the Cabinet by President Wickremesinghe: There are many Sri Lankans working in Israel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must locate them and ensure their safety. There are a number of Israelis in Sri Lanka  some are tourists and some are employed. We must help them to travel back to Israel. I have also asked the Police to look after the Israelis here. Sri Lanka has always supported two states concept of Israel and Palestine. We are steadfast in our support. At times we have condemned Israels actions. Nevertheless, all this does not justify Hamas attack on Israel killing a large number of civilians. The Government of Sri Lanka condemns this unprecedented attack. The fighting and violence must be brought to an end immediately. Sri Lanka is in agreement with the African Union proposal. There is another impact of this crisis. The petrol prices were expected to rise to USD 100. per barrel and thereafter recede from end February. This crisis will only create a further shortage of fuel ensuring that fuel prices will remain high for a longer time. This is a big blow to the developing economies.",

Earlier in September, the Finance State Minister had stated that restrictions imposed on imported goods, except vehicles, will be lifted in October, which will help price stabilization. Due to these restrictions, he said an increase is observed in the prices of certain goods as there is not enough supply to meet the demand. On August 14, the government, by way of a special Gazette notification, eased the restrictions on importing public transport buses and special-purpose heavy vehicles including, tankers, bowsers and fire trucks. Further, the government also decided to release heavy vehicles imported during the restricted period and still remain uncleared at ports. This was the first time Sri Lanka rolled back the restrictions on imported vehicles that were imposed in March 2020. However, the import bans on passenger vehicles are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon.

        "title": "Intl consultant appointed to help restructure SriLankan Airlines  Minister",
        "date": "October 9, 2023 11:44 pm",
        "content": "In a significant development, Sri Lankas aviation sector has reported a substantial profit of Rs. 22 billion in the period spanning from January to August 2023, said Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. Speaking during a news briefing held at the President Media Centre (PMC) today (09) focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country, the Minister highlighted that approximately Rs. 10 billion from this profit has already been contributed to Treasury, providing a much-needed boost to the countrys finances. He further said that efforts are underway to restructure SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier, with a focus on improving its operations and financial performance. Importantly, the government is committed to ensuring the job security of the approximately 6,000 employees of the airline during this restructuring process. To facilitate this, an international consultant has been appointed. This consultant is expected to bring expertise and best practices to guide the restructuring efforts, he said. The Minister highlighted the success of operations at Palali International Airport, emphasizing that the airport has completed 200 flights. This achievement underscores the airports increasing significance and efficiency in handling air travel. The Minister acknowledged the challenges faced by the aviation sector in the past, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced tourist arrivals, and a dollar crisis that affected fuel supply for airplanes. He mentioned that, at one point, fuel for airplanes had to be procured by sending aircraft to Madras to obtain the necessary fuel. To address these challenges, the Minister of Petroleum and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva intervened and facilitated the import of aviation fuel by the private sector, ensuring a stable supply of fuel for airplanes. Additionally, modern technology was employed to develop Bandaranaike International Airport, earning it recognition as a prominent airport in Southeast Asia. Efforts were made to increase the frequency of flights by different airlines operating in Sri Lanka. This likely contributes to improved connectivity and accessibility for travellers. These developments in the Sri Lankan aviation sector signify a positive turn in its financial performance, reflecting resilience in overcoming challenges. The governments interventions, such as facilitating fuel supply and enhancing airport infrastructure, have contributed to this success. Increased profitability in the aviation sector is expected to have a positive impact on the countrys overall economic stability. Among the key points highlighted by Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva: In accordance with the report, Emirates Airlines currently operates 28 flights per week, China Eastern Air operates 05 flights weekly, Etihad offers 06 flights, Qatar Airways provides an impressive 35 weekly flights, Air Arabia manages 11 flights, Air India operates 17 flights, and Jazeera Air conducts 04 flights per week. Furthermore, several other airlines have expressed their commitment to commence operations in Sri Lanka. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the operations at Palali International Airport continue to demonstrate remarkable success. Specifically, the flight operations between Madras and Palali, which are scheduled three times a week, have already completed a total of 200 flights, underscoring the airports increasing prominence and efficiency. The Minister pointed out that Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake once a scarcely frequented facility, has now evolved into a bustling aviation hub. Notably, in the month of August, it catered to the needs of over 650,000 passengers. This surge in passenger traffic has contributed significantly to its financial prosperity. In the first eight months of this year alone, the airport has managed to generate a substantial profit of Rs. 22 billion through its aviation services. A commendable portion of this profit, amounting to Rs. 10 billion, has been allocated to the national treasury. In parallel, a strategic initiative is currently underway to attract potential investors to the Mattala Airport. Furthermore, measures have been put in place to actively mitigate the airports operational losses, thereby ensuring its long-term sustainability and financial health. The Cabinet has recently granted approval for a comprehensive restructuring plan for SriLankan Airlines. Following the submission of this proposal to the Treasury, constructive discussions have taken place in collaboration with the World Bank. In an effort to ensure transparency in the restructuring process, it was recommended to enlist the assistance of an international consultant. Consequently, a qualified consultant has been appointed, and crucial steps are actively being taken to expedite the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines. If progress aligns with the planned timeline, the anticipated benefits should be realized by February of the forthcoming year. It is essential to note that the airline presently does not own any aircraft; instead, all available aircraft are leased. Acquiring new aircraft is not an immediate process and generally involves a waiting period of approximately one year post-order. Due to the absence of A330 aircraft in the current fleet, the airline faces limitations in offering services to destinations such as England, France, and Australia. The existing fleet primarily comprises A320 aircraft, which are unsuitable for long-haul or remote operations. Thus, the restructuring of the airline is imperative to address these challenges effectively. Recent operational setbacks have resulted in substantial losses amounting to approximately 6 billion. While unions have attributed these delays to technical faults in the aircraft, its important to emphasize that pilots must possess certification from a qualified aeronautical engineer before they can undertake flight operations. Moreover, a noteworthy contrast exists in the monthly flight hours flown by our pilots compared to those from other airlines. The majority of our pilots have averaged only 63 flight hours per month, whereas their counterparts in other airlines often accumulate a hundred flight hours. In light of this, a plea is made to our aviation professionals to demonstrate unwavering commitment to institutional success, fostering a culture of responsibility and accountability. Its worth mentioning that pilots in our employment receive a monthly salary of four million rupees (40 lakhs). While there have been demands for higher salaries, citing comparisons with the remuneration packages offered by global aviation giants, it is essential to recognize that substantial salary increments may not be feasible in the current circumstances. Furthermore, Tatas acquisition of Air India, which includes orders for 250 Boeing 777 aircraft, presents opportunities for collaboration. These collaborations, possibly with regional airlines, offer the potential to secure the future prospects and rights of the 6000th employee of the Sri Lankan company, thereby fortifying the industrys position. --PMD",

Joining the 360 current affairs program on TV Derana last night (Oct. 09), the lawmaker said the Sri Lankan government has permitted the Chinese ship to dock here in November, although China has sought a port call in October. Sabry said the Sri Lankan government, however, maintains that the port call should be made in November. This is not a mere visit, the foreign minister said adding that the island needs to be prepared to provide all required facilities during its stay. We have assigned them a date to dock the ship after considering the internal matters. Speaking further, the foreign affairs minister underscored Sri Lankas bilateral relations with China are of great importance. India remains concerned about the scheduled arrival of another Chinese vessel in Sri Lanka, after the high-tech research ship Yuan Wang-5 made a port call in August last year. India has expressed its security concerns over the research vessels capability of mapping the ocean bed, which is critical to anti-submarine operations of the Chinese navy. In September 2023, Sabry told Indian media that the Chinese research vessel Shi Yan 6 was not given permission to make a port call in October, as negotiations were still on. He also highlighted that Indias security concerns, which he said were legitimate, were important for the island nation. According to reports, the Chinese vessel Shi Yan 6 is expected to conduct research with the National Aquatic Resources Research  Development Agency (NARA).",

        "content": "To deepen UK-Sri Lanka cooperation on environmental protection, regional security and human rights, the UKs Foreign, Commonwealth  Development Minister for the Indo-Pacific, Anne-Marie Trevelyan arrived in Sri Lanka today (Oct. 10) for a three-day visit. The visit, which is Minister Trevelyans first to Sri Lanka in her role, marks the celebration of 75 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and Sri Lanka, the UK High Commission in Colombo said in a press release. Minister Trevelyan has emphasized the UKs long-term commitment to the region at the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Ministerial hosted by Sri Lanka. She has also sought to strengthen IORAs work on climate mitigation. Through collaborative programmes that underpin biodiversity objectives and the Glasgow Pact (agreed upon at COP26), the Minister highlighted UK support for Sri Lankas environmental work. This builds on the UKs strong track record as the first major economy to legislate for Net Zero, cutting carbon emissions faster than any other G7 country. Indo-Pacific Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: As the UK celebrates 75 years of diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka, were working together on climate action, peacebuilding and human rights. Through key regional forums like IORA, we can accelerate progress towards enhanced security for the Indian Ocean region, collaborate on shared climate goals and on boosting maritime security. While in Colombo, Minister Trevelyan met with members of the Sri Lankan government including Foreign Minister Ali Sabry. During her meeting with Minister Sabry, Minister Trevelyan exchanged views on IORAs priorities and fostering greater collaboration for regional prosperity.

        "date": "October 10, 2023 01:04 pm",
        "content": "Air raid sirens blared in Israels largest city, Tel Aviv, again Monday morning as Palestinian militants fired more missiles at the Jewish state and the death toll on both sides soared to over 1,500, with at least 11 Americans among the dead. Explosions rang out as Israels Iron Dome air defense system brought down some of the rockets, but there was no immediate word on how many might have slipped through. The latest salvo of rockets, claimed by Hamas al-Qassam Brigades military unit, came after Israel said it had struck hundreds of Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip overnight and as four Israeli combat divisions were deployed to the countrys south. Some 100,000 Israeli reservists were called up to fight as battles with Hamas militants continued. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets and helicopters, aircraft and artillery struck over 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip Sunday night and Monday morning, claiming to have destroyed tunnels and at least seven Hamas command centers in the blockaded Palestinian territory. The IDF said it also struck a command center used by Islamic Jihad, another Iran-backed terror group based in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Its taking more time than we expected to get things back into a defensive security posture, Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told journalists Monday morning, acknowledging the ongoing battles in southern Israel three days after Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on the Jewish state. Death toll mounts as Israel bolsters Gaza blockade An Israeli embassy spokesperson said Monday the death toll has risen to at least 900 Israelis. Most were civilians. Another 2,500 were reported wounded, and IDF spokesperson told CBS News on Monday. More than 250 of the dead were people who had been attending a music festival near the border with Gaza when gunmen attacked. At least 11 U.S. nationals were among the dead, President Biden said in a statement Monday afternoon. Its heart wrenching. These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence, Mr. Biden said. An undetermined number of Americans remained missing. Israel made it clear that it wants vengeance, and in the Gaza Strip, retribution was falling from the sky. The airstrikes had killed more than 687 people as of Monday, including at least 140 children, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. It said another 3,700 more were wounded in the strikes. In the coming days, Israel is expected to launch a ground incursion into Gaza, a small, densely packed region sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea to the west and Israel to the north and east. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday that hed ordered a tightening of the Gaza blockade: Nothing is allowed in or out. There will be no fuel, electricity or food supplies, he said in a statement. We fight animals in human form and proceed accordingly. CBS News Marwan al-Ghoul reported from Gaza City that the Israeli airstrikes had been relentless since Saturday. While Israel insists it is targeting Hamas and other terror groups, it has long accused those militants of positioning both fighters and weapons in or near civilian infrastructure. Houses, apartment buildings and mosques were all among the targets hit overnight, most of them without prior warning, al-Ghoul said. I could not sleep last night as the planes bombed the mosque nearby, causing casualties and breaking the windows of my house, Samar Alyan, who lives in the sprawling al-Shati refugee camp just west of Gaza City, told CBS News. We do not know what fate has in store for us, she said. Israel retaliates on civilians. The camp is home to some 150,000 refugees. In the center of Gaza City, schools run by the U.N.s humanitarian agency in the Palestinian territories, UNRWA, were full of displaced people looking for any safety they could find. Israeli infrastructure minister Israel Katz said in a tweet that he had ordered to immediately cut off the water supply from Israel to Gaza, adding that electricity and fuel were cut off yesterday to the Palestinian territory, which is home to some 2 million people. Israel has been locked in a cycle of violence with Palestinian militant groups for decades, but what happened on Saturday was unprecedented. Hundreds of Hamas militants broke through the steel and concrete barrier that Israel has used for decades to contain Palestinians inside Gaza. They stormed into Israel by land, sea and even on paragliders as waves of rockets  more than 3,000 of them  were unleashed on Israeli towns and cities. The gunmen from the group, which has long been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Israel, went on a rampage, slaughtering civilians in the streets, engaging Israeli security forces with deadly effect, and kidnapping hostages including women, children and the elderly. Some of them were paraded through the streets of Gaza  human trophies that Hamas knows it can use as leverage against its enemy. One of the captives is Noa Argamani, a university student who was hauled away on the back of a motorcycle as she screamed for help. She is an amazing person, a sweet child, her father Yaacov told CBS News. I cannot believe it. The shocked father said he wanted the Israeli government to rescue his daughter, but only by peaceful measures. We need to act with sensitivity, he said. They Palestinians also have mothers who are crying, the same as it is for us. Seems like Israel had no clue For many in Israel, the question burning Monday morning was how the countrys intelligence agencies could have failed to detect and disrupt planning for such a significant Hamas assault. It seems like Israel had no clue, former Israeli intelligence officer Gonen Ben Itzhak, who used to recruit spies to infiltrate Hamas, told CBS News. He said Israel  distracted by simmering violence in the other Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where its been protecting Israeli settlers  let down its guard in Gaza. I wont be surprised if they will start to even kill some of the hostages on camera, he said, predicting that Hamas would try to force the Israeli government to negotiate. But Israeli leaders and military officials werent discussing any negotiations Monday morning. With some people calling the attack Israels 911, military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said the objective was to make sure that at the end of this war, Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israeli civilians with, and in addition to that, we also need to make sure Hamas will not govern the Gaza Strip.

        "content": "The Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed before the Supreme Court by Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara seeking the nullification of the Samagi Jana Balawegayas (SJB) decision to suspend their party membership, has been fixed for hearing. Accordingly, the FR petition, which requests the court to issue an order nullifying the SJBs decision to expel them from the political party and disqualify them of their parliamentary seats, will be taken up for hearing on 12 October. The relevant order was issued when the petition was considered before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court today (10 Oct.). Meanwhile, the attorneys who appeared on behalf of the respondents informed the court that the hearing of the relevant petition must be completed within two months from the date it was filed, as per the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Considering the facts presented, the court ordered the petitioning party to file their counter objections, if any, within today itself. Ministers Fernando and Nanayakkara filed the relevant petition on 15 August, with SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara among those named as the respondents. On 18 July, the SJB Working Committee decided to expel Fernando and Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. MPs Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara were sworn in as the Minister of Tourism  Lands and Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment, respectively. Fernando and Nanayakkara had said they accepted ministerial portfolios in the government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to do their utmost to find solutions to the ongoing economic crisis as a positive response was not received from many political party leaders for a collective effort. They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign. However, they were both reappointed to the same ministerial portfolios by President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he appointed a new Cabinet on July 22, 2022.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) - China said one of its financial institutions has reached a preliminary agreement with Sri Lanka on resolving China-related debt, a potentially major step toward resolving the South Asian nations fiscal woes. The deal involving Export-Import Bank of China was reached late last month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing. Wang didnt give details on how the debt was resolved, and officials in Sri Lanka didnt immediately respond to request for comment. Chinese financial institutions have fully participated in creditors meetings as observers, maintain friendly communication with other creditors and have shared developments on debt disposal, Wang said. The deal puts Sri Lanka closer to completing its debt restructuring, as the nation boosts efforts to win agreements with other creditors such as Japan and India, as well as with holders of its foreign bonds. China accounts for about 52 of the bankrupt nations bilateral debt. Reaching a deal quickly will allow Sri Lanka to keep tapping funds from its 3 billion bailout program with the International Monetary Fund. Sri Lankan dollar bonds due 2030 were steady at 45.8 cents on the dollar. The nations dollar bonds had returned more than 50 this year, according to a Bloomberg index. Bloomberg News reported last month that some members on the committee of Sri Lankas official creditors were pushing to reach a deal to restructure the nations debt without Chinas participation. The members wanted the group of major creditors to sign a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka around the time of the IMF and World Bank meetings which are ongoing in Marrakesh, Morocco. Separately, Sri Lanka may be able to draw the outlines of a deal with holders of its defaulted dollar bonds as early as this month, Bloomberg reported in September. Sri Lanka in September agreed to restructure about 10 billion of local debt. -Agencies",

        "content": "The beleaguered dairy sector of Sri Lanka, which is facing its worst-ever economic crisis, will finally get back its say cheese moments with Indian dairy majors set to usher in a transformation in the island nation. And, the revival path for the country, which imports 60 of its milk and milk products requirement, has been charted out in Gujarat, the cradle of Indias White Revolution. Sources said that Lanka plans to bring dairy farms currently managed by MILCO, a government-owned organization, and its brand, Highland, under the new joint venture. Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe had last year appointed a committee with representatives from the countrys public and private sectors to work with the NDDB and prepare a roadmap to increase local milk production and reduce dependence on imported milk powder. We expect the details to be finalized within a week as we are close to concluding the necessary agreement, said NDDB chairman Dr Meenesh Shah. The shareholder agreement, which will lead to the formation of a JV that will have Indian as well as Sri Lankan shareholders, is being finalized, he said. GCMMFs vice-chairman Valamji Humbal said NDDB and GCMMF will have a 51  stake in the new venture, while Sri Lanka is finalizing the local shareholder who will own 49. GCMMF, which will manage the commercial aspects like marketing and branding, is chalking out a business plan and the financial details. NDDB will take care of the development side of the dairy sector like setting up co-operatives, breeding, fodder, nutrition etc. This will be a major step towards development of the dairy sector in the region and upliftment of rural livelihoods, said We are finalizing the business plan and financial aspects, said Humbal. Interestingly, such a partnership is not new to Sri Lanka. Former Sri Lankan president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had invited late Dr Verghese Kurien, the father of Indias White Revolution which had led to the formation of Kiriya Milk Industries of Lanka (Private) Limited in 1998. But in the wake of labour issues, the project did not take off after which NDDB withdrew from the agreement while all the assets and liabilities were transferred to MILCO. Source: TNN --Agencies",

        "date": "October 11, 2023 01:23 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during the inauguration of the National Information Technology and Business Process Management Professional (IT  BPM) Exhibition at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Hall today (11 Oct.), opened the doors for active participation of the private sector in the nations journey toward a technology-driven and eco-friendly green economy. Commencing the National IT and BPM Week, the exhibition will be held from October 11 to 13 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Hall in Colombo. The exhibition, aimed at accelerating Sri Lankas transition to a digital economy, seeks to provide insights into new technology, promote skill development, offer career guidance and create avenues for IT entrepreneurship. It is expected to benefit school students, university students, vocational education candidates, job seekers and aspiring entrepreneurs in the Western Province. As part of this three-day event, opportunities for industry and career counselling, internships, job placements and workshops on IT and business processes will be offered by technical education institutions. In his address, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the aspirations of many exhibition attendees to seek opportunities abroad. He encouraged a shift in focus towards how the nation can benefit from the event. With Sri Lankas economy in recovery, the President stressed the importance of not only achieving economic stability but also addressing the repayment of loans and fulfilling import requirements, all necessitating foreign exchange reserves that might require additional loans. The President underscored the need to break free from the debt cycle and move toward a highly competitive economy capable of thriving in the global marketplace. The goal is to augment revenue streams through both goods and services, with the expectation that such efforts will attract Sri Lankans who have left the country to return home. Key to this transformation is the three-pronged strategy of creating a competitive economy, fostering a sustainable green economy and advancing the digital economy. Notably, the digital economy requires a skilled workforce proficient in information technology. In this regard, Sri Lanka is embarking on the establishment of a new university system, with plans to launch three universities based on the Kotelawala Defence University model. Additionally, the nation is encouraging the creation of non-government universities, with the vision that they will reinvest profits into education, similar to esteemed institutions like Harvard and Cambridge. The President emphasized the importance of establishing numerous new universities to impart advanced technological knowledge, along with the integration of 450 vocational training centres and the launch of vocational colleges. Professional training programs are being modernized and measures are being taken to introduce new technology into schools. Sri Lankas future hinges on its technological and green sectors. The countrys legacy of transitions, from paddy cultivation to cinnamon, coffee, tea, rubber and the present emphasis on tourism and the garment industry, is now in the past. The future beckons and to thrive in it, the nation must continually educate and produce skilled individuals, even exceeding domestic demands. President Wickremesinghe also recognized that the future of Sri Lanka lies in the technology and green sectors, requiring comprehensive training initiatives to produce a workforce exceeding the countrys immediate needs. He encouraged citizens to explore job opportunities within Sri Lanka, a move that not only bolsters the local economy but also reduces the outflow of foreign exchange. The declining populations in East Asian countries, such as Japan, China and South Korea, present an opportunity for Sri Lanka to source skilled labour and the President called for cooperation in capturing this potential. President Wickremesinghe concluded by posing a direct question to the audience, asking about their readiness to participate in this transformative journey. He noted the involvement of Prime Ministers Secretary Mr. Anura Dissanayake and secretaries from relevant ministries. The President highlighted the potential for new factories, driven by cutting-edge technology, to create new career opportunities, providing a solution to the challenges faced by many unemployed individuals today. He urged stakeholders to share their responses and collaborate in shaping a brighter future for Sri Lanka. Key figures present at the event included Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath, Prime Ministers Secretary Mr. Anura Dissanayake, Secretary of the Ministry of Technology Professor A.D. Gunawardena, Director (Development) of the Ministry of Technology Mr. Janaka Sampath Geekianage, National Future Skills Initiatives Institute (NFTI) President Mr. Madhu Ratnayake, Sri Lanka Society for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM) President Mr. Jehan Perinpanayagam and DIGIECON 2023-2030 Project Director Mr. Prasad Samarawickrama, among others.",

        "content": "Discussions between Sri Lanka and all its creditors are ongoing, though the International Monetary Fund has not been informed about any specific agreements, its mission chief for the country said on Wednesday. We will need to assess the entire package of agreements in its totality to assess consistency with IMF debt targets, Peter Breuer told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Bank IMF annual meetings in Marrakech. Sri Lanka, mired in its worst economic crisis in 70 years, is in debt restructuring talks with a range of creditors, including China, its largest single creditor. Colombo suspended debt repayments in May 2022. Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the Export-Import Bank of China reached a preliminary deal on the disposal of China-related debts, but did not share further details. Sri Lanka owed EXIM 4.1 billion, or 11 of the countrys foreign currency debt, as of the end of 2022. Sri Lanka is also in talks with IMF over a 2.9 billion bailout. But in September the fund declined to release a second tranche of around 330 million after it failed to reach a staff-level agreement over concerns of a possible government revenue shortfall. Other bilateral creditors of Sri Lanka including the Paris Club, Japan and India are expected to make an announcement on a deal during the IMF meetings a source with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters. Japan, India and France announced in April a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, a move they hope would serve as a model for solving the debt woes of middle-income economies. As a middle-income country, Sri Lanka is not part of the G20 debt initiative known as the Common Framework, so talks with official creditors from China are conducted separately.

        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says despite the early signs of stabilization, Sri Lankas full economic recovery is not yet assured. Daniel Leigh, IMF Research Departments Division Chief made this remark during the press briefing on World Economic Outlook for October 2023 on Tuesday (Oct. 10). He said Sri Lankas growth momentum remained subdued, with real GDP (gross domestic production) in the second quarter contracting by 3.1 on a year-on-year basis and high-frequency economic indicators continuing to provide mixed signals. Thus, Mr. Leigh highlighted that Sri Lanka continuing with the reforms is critical to put the economy on a path towards a lasting recovery, and stable and inclusive growth. He also commended the people of Sri Lanka for showing remarkable resilience. In the face of enormous challenges, Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult but much-needed reforms. These reforms are already bearing fruit, as the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization, Mr. Leigh pointed out. Inflation is down from a peak of about 70 percent a year ago, in September 2022, down to below 2 percent in September 2023. Gross international reserves have increased. And shortages of essentials have eased. The press briefing was held on the margins of the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group (WBG) and the IMF, which are taking place in Marrakech, Morocco this year. The Boards of Governors of the IMF and the WBG usually meet once a year to discuss the work of their respective institutions. The meetings bring together central bankers, ministers of finance and development, private sector executives, civil society, media and academics to discuss issues of global concern, including the world economic outlook, global financial stability, poverty eradication, inclusive economic growth and job creation, climate change, and others. According to IMFs World Economic Outlook report released on Tuesday (Oct. 10), world economic growth has slowed and recovery is marked by important divergences between advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies. The global economy is limping along, not sprinting, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMFs economic counselor and the director of the Research Department, told the press briefing on Tuesday. Gourinchas said the global economic growth is projected to slow from 3.5 in 2022 to 3 this year and 2.9 next year, a 0.1 percentage point downgrade for 2024 from Julys previous projections. Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 8.7 in 2022 to 6.9 in 2023 and 5.8 in 2024.",

        "date": "October 11, 2023 06:05 pm",
        "content": "Indias Minister of External Affairs, Dr. S. Jaishankar, has met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Secretariat a short while ago. Extensive discussions were held to further strengthen Indo-Sri Lankan relations, resulting in the signing of three new bilateral agreements aimed at enhancing cooperation between the two countries, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Furthermore, the inauguration of the third phase of the housing project, supported by Indian loan assistance, was conducted during the meeting. While an initial allocation of Rs. 1.026 million had been allocated per unit for the fourth phase, it was necessary to revise the budget to Rs. 2.8 million per unit due to increased housing unit costs. To uplift the lives of Sri Lankan citizens, the Government of India has committed to providing additional funds for the speedy completion of nine development projects in the country, which are currently supported by the Government of India. The relevant agreement for this initiative was also signed today, it said in a statement. These projects include the modernization of 27 schools in the Northern Province, housing initiatives in Mannar and Anuradhapura, improvements to the Hatton Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and Pussellawa Saraswati Central College, the construction of a multi-ethnic trilingual school in Polonnaruwa, the establishment of 2889 rainwater harvesting projects in the Jaffna area, the promotion of vegetable cultivation in the Dambulla area and the construction of greenhouse facilities with a capacity of 5000 metric tons for fruit preservation. Additionally, a new surgical unit for the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital will be promptly built as part of these efforts. An agreement concerning a joint project involving the Indian National Dairy Development Board, the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation of India (Amul), and the Cargills Group of Sri Lanka was signed with the aim of elevating Sri Lankas local dairy industry. This agreement emerged as a result of President Ranil Wickremesinghes official visit to India and allocation of funding for the modernization of Sri Lankas livestock sector. The primary objective of this new project is to increase milk production by 53 within the first five years and achieve self-sufficiency in milk production for Sri Lanka within 15 years. As part of this endeavour, it is anticipated that approximately 200,000 local farmers will be empowered through the provision of facilities such as high-quality medicines, animal nutrition and technical support. Furthermore, this initiative encompasses digitalization of the livestock sector, investments in new technologies to enhance the quality of milk-related by-products and ensuring access to milk-related products at affordable prices, the PMD mentioned. In addition to this significant agreement, a special commemorative logo was unveiled today to celebrate the 75 years of Indo-Sri Lankan relations. Present at the signing ceremony were Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay, Union Secretaries of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Puneeth Agrawal and J. P.

        "date": "October 11, 2023 07:50 pm",
        "content": "The rapid spread of an eye infection called Conjunctivitis has been reported from several parts of the country, according to health officials. The Ministry of Health, which informs the general public not to have undue fears of the matter, however, has outlined some necessary safety measures in a bid to minimize the infection. It was further confirmed however, that the eye infection poses no health threat and is most likely to improve within a span of 3 to 4 days. Conjunctivitis or the pink eye is a common eye disease which is currently seeing a spike within the country. Doctors predict that the disease is often spread from one individual to the other by tears and related secretions of an infected person. Accordingly, redness in one or both eyes, itchiness in the eyes, increased tear production, headaches, sensitivity to light and dry eyes are some common symptoms of the aforementioned eye disease, according to health officials. As a result, the general public are urged to follow the necessary safety measures in a bid to reduce the risk of infecting the disease. Speaking in this regard, Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni emphasized that spread of the disease can be minimized by following necessary safety measures such as washing hands often with soap and water, using hand sanitizers especially when using public transport and avoiding intimate contact with people. The doctor also advised the people to avoid touching the eyes in order to avoid risk of infection. Moreover, Dr. Wijayamuni asserted that there is no serious health threat following the infection and that the condition will improve within a span of 3 to 4 days. Meanwhile, Dr. Hiranya Abeysekara, the Paediatric Eye Surgeon at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, mentioned that this eye disease is linked to the respiratory system of children, adding that symptoms will gradually reduce within a week. However, in certain cases the disease is likely to affect the pupil of the eye, which can affect the vision of children. If so, we advise that you urgently meet an eye surgeon and receive necessary treatment if the condition lasts for more than 05 days, the doctor noted. In the meantime, warnings have been made that the risk of spreading the infection is greatly amplified due to the prevailing rainfall and wet weather. Furthermore, several classes in Kotahena Central College have already been cancelled due to the spread of the disease among children. However, Principal of the Kotahena Central College stated that based on the advices from officials of the regional educational services, it was decided to cancel the classes of grades 6,7 and 8 for four days since around 40 children in the school had reportedly been infected with the disease as of last Thursday. Further, another 30 students were reported as of last Friday and 35 on Monday, he added. As such, the Ministry of Health has requested the general public to avoid sending their children to schools if the aforementioned symptoms are observed.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka assumed the chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) at the 23rd IORA Council of Ministers which concluded in Colombo today (11). The meeting was chaired by Foreign Minister Ali Sabry. Sri Lanka is a founding member of IORA which was established in 1997, and previously served as its Chair from 2003 to 2004. The 23rd IORA Council of Ministers was inaugurated with a colourful opening ceremony that brought the Indian Ocean into the conference room via virtual reality, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The Council of Ministers is the highest decision-making body of IORA and the Ministers are guided by the Senior Officials who meet as a Committee of Senior Officials, prior to the Council of Ministers. Accordingly, the 23rd IORA Council of Ministers was preceded by the 25th Committee of Senior Officials held on 09-10 October 2023, chaired by Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, who reported on the deliberations and work carried out by the Senior Officials during their two-day meeting to the Council of Ministers.

Welcoming the Ministers and representatives of the Member States and Dialogue Partners who have gathered in Colombo, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said their presence was testament to the spirit of collaboration and cooperation that defines the region, and that Sri Lanka appreciated their commitment to strengthen the ties that bind the Indian Ocean community. He said that in the great tradition of hospitality, Sri Lanka opens its doors and its heart to all of its guests. Minister Sabry added that the progress and recovery Sri Lanka has made would not have been possible without the unwavering support and cooperation of its friends in the region and beyond, as well as the resilience of the Sri Lankans, the Foreign Affairs Ministry mentioned. Referring to the important role Sri Lanka has played in international affairs, Minister Sabry recalled that Sri Lanka was a part of the Bandung Conference which paved the way for the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement, which Sri Lanka led in 1976. Sri Lankas foreign policy has centred on peace, stability, diversity, and inclusivity both in the region, and beyond. Minister Sabry also recalled the indelible mark Sri Lanka made on the world stage in the introduction and the passage of the historic resolution at the United Nations to declare the Indian Ocean region and its airspace as a Zone of Peace in 1971 which sought to transform the Indian Ocean into a symbol of cooperation, understanding, and tranquillity, transcending political boundaries and ideologies. He reiterated the unwavering faith Sri Lanka has placed on multilateralism and diplomacy as a means for the international community to work towards resolving a variety of recurrent challenges. The Ministers discussed the ways to cooperate on the six priority areas identified by the Association, including Trade and Investment, Maritime Safety and Security, Fisheries Management, Disaster Risk Management, Womens Empowerment and Blue Economy, among others. The Ministers adopted the Colombo Communiqué at the conclusion of their Meeting as the outcome document. In the Communiqué, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the IORA goals and objectives enshrined in the Charter and pledged their support to Sri Lanka as the Chair of IORA to lead a vibrant and purpose-driven Association which fulfils its mandate to benefit all Member States and their peoples under the theme Strengthening Regional Architecture: Reinforcing Indian Ocean Identity. The Ministers also acknowledged with appreciation the offer of the Government of Sri Lanka to host a Leaders Summit of IORA in Colombo in 2024 to reflect on the Way Forward for the Indian Ocean Rim Association towards and beyond 2030.

In a press release on Wednesday (Oct. 11), the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies announced that the agreement in principle covers approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. The ministry said the agreement constitutes a key step towards restoring Sri Lankas long-term debt sustainability and will pave the way to a prompt economic recovery. The indicative terms agreed are expected to provide the necessary fiscal space for Sri Lanka to implement its ambitious reform agenda. Sri Lanka commended the engagement and continuous support of China Exim Bank in reaching this agreement in principle, which demonstrates a mutual commitment in line with the goalobjective of restoring public debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported program. Sri Lankan authorities are hopeful that this landmark achievement will provide an anchor to their ongoing engagement with the Official Creditor Committee and commercial creditors, including the bondholders. It should also facilitate approval by the IMF Executive Board of the first review of the IMF-supported program in the coming weeks, allowing for the next tranche of IMF financing of about USD 334 million to be disbursed. Speaking in this regard, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said it was a big step for Sri Lanka as it reached this landmark agreement in principle on debt treatment terms with the islands largest single creditor. We thank China Exim Bank for the support in resolving our countrys debt situation. This agreement constitutes a key milestone in Sri Lankas ongoing efforts to foster its economic recovery. Over the next few weeks, the Sri Lankan authorities and China Exim bank will be actively working on formalizing and implementing the agreed parameters of the debt treatment, the press release read further. The statement came a day after Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular press briefing in Beijing about the deal involving the Exim Bank and Sri Lanka which he said was reached in September. However, he had not given details on how the debt was resolved.

Japan, India and France say the talks have been making progress, but many challenges remain. According to Japanese sources, they confirmed their intention to work toward Sri Lanka reaching early agreement with its creditors. Sri Lanka has been facing a rapid weakening of its currency and inflation due to failed financial policies. It has not been able to repay foreign debts since April last year and is effectively in default. To help the country, Japan and others set up a framework in April this year to discuss issues such as creditor nations changing repayment conditions. The recent meeting was held on Wednesday in Marrakech, where finance ministers and central bank governors of G20 nations will meet. Creditor nations are considering changes in repayment conditions such as extending deadlines and lowering interest rates. The talks have made some progress but problems remain. Reaching a final agreement is a major challenge, but how each creditor nation implements any agreement will be another issue as Sri Lankas biggest creditor, China, is taking part only as an observer.

Furthermore, appearing for the petitioning party, Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando stated before the court that the petitioner does not seek any compensation, adding that his client wants the court to rule that a series of guidelines be prepared in order to prevent such unfortunate incidents happening at universities in the future. Thus, the Supreme Court judge bench which ordered the case to be recalled on November 10, 2023, also ordered 16 state universities including the Colombo, Kelaniya, Peradeniya, Vavuniya, Sabaragamuwa and North-Western universities to submit the relevant reports pertaining to the matter on that date.",

        "date": "October 12, 2023 04:08 pm",
        "content": "Israel has said there will be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all its hostages are freed, amid growing concern over dwindling water, food and fuel supplies after a fifth night of bombardment. The energy minister, Israel Katz, wrote on social media that no electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the abductees are free. Israel is preparing to launch a ground invasion in response to bloody massacres carried out in 20 Israeli communities by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas last weekend, during which dozens of hostages were also seized. Israel Defence Forces strikes killed 33 people within two hours overnight on Thursday, according to Al Jazeeras local reporter, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 1,200. The reporter said fighter jets attacked houses in several areas, and civil defence groups recovered the bodies of the dead. According to the report, since the fighting began, six neighbourhoods in the strip have been destroyed. Eighteen healthcare facilities and 20 ambulances have been affected and 11 healthcare workers killed, the World Health Organization said, in the most intense bombing campaign the strip has suffered in the 16 years since Hamas seized control of the tiny, overcrowded area, home to 2.3 million people. The UN said late on Wednesday the number of people displaced by the airstrikes had soared 30 within 24 hours to 339,000  two-thirds of them crowding into UN schools. Palestinian media said that bombing had killed the brother of Mohammed Deif, Hamass military commander, and a senior commander from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Hazem Balousha, the Guardians reporter in Gaza, reached by phone this morning, said the strips residents have been told that hospitals have stopped admitting all but emergency cases. Rafah, Gazas crossing point with Egypt, remains closed, and the only power station ran out of fuel on Tuesday, leaving the strip powered by scattered private generators. Those will shut off as well if fuel is not allowed in. In Israel, the death toll has climbed to 1,200. Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters on Thursday that forces are preparing for a ground assault but that the political leadership has not yet ordered one. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to crush and destroy Hamas. He leads a newly formed unity government and war cabinet, including members of the opposition. We are all in this together. We are all enlisting. This is not a political partnership, but rather a unity of fate. This is the time to close ranks and to win, said Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist National Unity party and a strident critic of Netanyahus current far-right government. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in Tel Aviv on Thursday as part of a Middle East tour to show Washingtons solidarity with Israel, after a first plane loaded with US munitions arrived in Israel on Wednesday night. His arrival is expected to coincide with the arrival of a US aircraft carrier in the region, amid fears that the events of the last week could escalate, drawing in Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, and Palestinian factions in the occupied West Bank and the restive city of Jerusalem. Gen Michael Kurilla, commander of US Central Command, said: The arrival of these highly capable forces to the region is a strong signal of deterrence should any actor hostile to Israel consider trying to take advantage of this situation. The emergency war cabinet must decide now what the countrys strategic objectives will be in Gaza. A ground offensive, the first since a seven-week war in 2014, is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. Overnight, fighting continued on Israeli soil on the Gaza periphery, as the IDF struggles to secure the breached security fence the country had relied on to contain Hamas. Strategic planning has been complicated by the presence of Israeli hostages, among them children and elderly people, inside the Gaza Strip. Israels Army Radio, citing a foreign diplomat, said that those kidnapped had been spread out across the enclave, some being held in private houses, and the factions themselves were not sure of the total number of hostages. Israeli media has put the figure at between 100 and 150. Keren Shem, whose daughter Mia has been missing since she attended a rave in Reim kibbutz, where 260 people were murdered, told the station this morning that no government officials have yet been in contact with her. I demand that the decision-makers drop everything now and ask for and demand an orderly list of the missing people, with names. Because my daughter may have bled to death  I dont know. I demand to know, said Shem. Is my daughter on the list, and how do I make contact and what do I do? Ive done everything I can to inform the authorities that my girl is missing. Nobody has reached out to me. Source - The Guardian - Agencies",

Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Vengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekera sat for todays legal proceedings. Appearing on behalf of Minister Nanayakkara, Presidents Counsel Faiszer Musthapha told the judge bench that the main oppositions decision to suspend his clients party membership is entirely unlawful. Pursuant to the partys constitution, he said that only the Working Committee is authorized to oust party members, noting that neither Party Leadership nor the Disciplinary Committee has such powers. The presidents counsel said the Disciplinary Committee is only tasked with filing charges against and conducting inquiries into the members who are found to have violated the partys constitution. Musthapha said his client had been expelled from the SJB as per a notice from its general secretary despite Nanayakkara having obtained an injunction from the district court against party membership suspension. Speaking further, he said the Supreme Courts verdict backing Sri Lanka Muslim Congress decision to expel Minister Naseer Ahamed from the party is irrelevant to this case. Subsequently, further hearing of the petition, of which Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and SJBs General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara were named as respondents, was fixed for October 24.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka is likely to clinch an agreement in the next several days that would help it tap more funds from the International Monetary Fund even though its still trying to firm up negotiations with creditors on debt restructuring. Officials from the South Asian nation and the IMF are close to reaching a staff-level agreement following talks in Morocco this week, according to people involved in the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the matter isnt finalized yet. Only a few outstanding issues remain, one person said, declining to provide more detail. The IMF is assessing Sri Lankas progress toward meeting economic targets and reform goals set under the nations 3 billion bailout package. A staff-level agreement is the first step needed in order for a second tranche of 334 million in loans to be disbursed. Sri Lanka needs that deal, as well as separate agreements with its creditors on restructuring terms that also align with the programs debt sustainability criteria, before the IMF board signs off on the next round of funding. The debt restructuring talks with creditors from the Paris Club and other lenders are also taking place in Morocco this week at the IMF-World Bank annual meetings. The official creditors committee had aimed to sign a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka this week, although an announcement is looking increasingly unlikely, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified. Failure to conclude talks on the debt restructuring this week wont halt the IMF funding program, although it may delay its progress. Sri Lankas central bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe and Junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe, who are in Marrakech this week, didnt respond to questions seeking confirmation. IMF officials in Colombo werent immediately available for comment. Separately, Sri Lanka reached an agreement with Export-Import Bank of China to restructure 4.2 billion of debt. The government said it hoped the agreement would be an anchor for talks with other bilateral creditors and holders of the nations bonds, and would allow the IMF to approve the second tranche of funding to the country.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed that Sri Lanka should adopt the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) outlook of the Indo-Pacific as two distinct oceans and prioritize freedom of navigation and undersea cables in the Indian Ocean. Delivering the keynote address at the 11th edition of the Galle Dialogue; International Maritime Conference, which aims to strengthen regional maritime cooperation and formulate a global strategy to face common challenges in the maritime domain. The conference commenced at the Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel today (12 Oct.) under the theme Emerging New Order in the Indian Ocean. Delivering the keynote address, President Wickremesinghe began by commending the Navy for recommencing the Galle Dialogue after the COVID-19 break. He emphasized the importance of rethinking the focus of the Galle Dialogue in light of the changes brought about by the pandemic. The President pointed out that the focus should primarily be on the Indian Ocean and its surrounding areas. He acknowledged the role of Dr. Ram Madhav, a pioneer of the Indian Ocean Conference, in drawing attention to the region. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the uniqueness of the Indian Ocean as a civilization rather than a construct, emphasizing its rich history, diverse cultures and religious significance. He then discussed various global constructs, such as the Asia Pacific, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Indo-Pacific and how they differ from the Indian Oceans cultural and historical context. He stressed that the Indian Ocean represents a political entity, given its history and role in recognizing non-European sectors of the world as colonialism collapsed. The President also discussed the economic significance of the Indian Ocean, predicting that development would shift from East Asia and the Asia Pacific to the Indian Ocean, India, Bangladesh, and Africa. He mentioned Africas potential for significant economic growth by 2050. President Wickremesinghe underlined the importance of ports and their role in the evolving global trade landscape, emphasizing Sri Lankas strategic location and the development of key ports like Colombo, Trincomalee and Hambantota. He urged a long-term perspective on these developments and their global implications. The President also discussed the changing dynamics in sports and noted that various nations from this region are expanding their influence in cricket and football. He emphasized the interconnectedness between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. In conclusion, President Wickremesinghe proposed that Sri Lanka should adopt the ASEAN outlook of the Indo-Pacific as two distinct oceans and prioritize freedom of navigation and undersea cables in the Indian Ocean. He acknowledged that the emerging order could rapidly change due to global events and emphasized the need for wise leadership and diplomacy in addressing evolving challenges. President Wickremesinghes speech provided a comprehensive perspective on the Indian Oceans unique place in global politics, culture and economics and its role in shaping the emerging new order in the region. Meanwhile, during his speech at the Galle Dialogue, Dr. Ram Madhav, President of India Foundation, addressed the current global transformation, noting the emergence of a new world order following the pandemic. He described this new order as multipolar and heteropolar, emphasizing that non-state actors, including tech giants, global agencies, NGOs, transnational terror groups and spiritual and religious movements, would have a significant influence on people and nations. Dr. Madhav also expressed his condolences for those affected by the conflicts in Eastern Europe and West Asia. He recognized Sri Lankas role in hosting the 23rd meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Council of Ministers and congratulated President Ranil Wickremesinghe on assuming the Chairmanship of IORA, with India as the Vice Chair. Dr. Madhav emphasized the importance of developing IORA as a platform for promoting sustainable development, economic growth and stability in the region and he called for a commitment to creating a free, open and inclusive region guided by the rule of law, where sea lines are not used for piracy, overexploitation, or terrorism. He also expressed hope that the efforts by leaders like President Ranil Wikremesinghe would result in establishing the Indian Oceans distinct identity and role in the emerging world order.

        "content": "A special report on the real state of the affairs in Sri Lankas conflict is set to be presented before the President, MP Sarath Weerasekara, Chairman of the Sectoral Monitoring Committee on National Security revealed. Speaking at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (12 Oct.), Weerasekara emphasised that the report was compiled in a bid to address the constant accusations of war crimes levelled against Sri Lanka during every United Nations Human Rights Council held in Geneva. He further noted that the relevant report comprehensively outlines the genuine circumstances surrounding the conflict in our nation. We have taken these accusations seriously and acted accordingly. It is crucial to understand that Sri Lanka experienced a non-international armed conflict. Therefore, our committee has promptly compiled a report elucidating the nature of the conflict within our borders. Our foremost objective is to present the Geneva Human Rights Council with an accurate depiction of our current situation, he said in this regard. MP Sarath Weerasekara further said; National security holds immense significance for a nation. It is imperative to foster an environment where the citizens can lead their lives free from fear and uncertainty. Moreover, ensuring a robust national security framework is crucial to attracting investment opportunities. National security encompasses not only physical safety but also economic stability, food security, environmental protection and personal well-being. Shockingly, over the past decade, road accidents have claimed the lives of approximately 27,000 individuals, surpassing the toll of 29,000 casualties during the thirty-year war. Regrettably, road accidents have become distressingly common in our country. In addition, the scourge of drugs poses a considerable threat to our national security. Energy and public health also fall within the purview of national security concerns. Terrorism, extremism, the drug epidemic and underworld activities are challenges faced by all nations. However, it is the governments solemn duty to address these issues in a manner that does not disrupt the lives of its citizens. As a committee, our dedicated efforts are focused on making the most substantial contributions to bolster our nations security. We categorize terrorism rooted in separatism and extremism stemming from terrorism as physical threats.",

        "date": "October 12, 2023 08:32 pm",
        "content": "International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday the heartbreaking Israel-Hamas conflict threatened to darken an already murky global economic outlook. We are closely monitoring how the situation evolves, how it is affecting, especially oil markets, Georgieva said. There had been some fluctuations in oil prices and reactions in markets but it was too early to predict the economic impact, she added. Very clearly, this is a new cloud on not the safest horizon for the world economy, a new cloud darkening this horizon, she told a news conference at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Marrakech, Morocco. Georgieva joined a growing chorus of financial leaders expressing concern about the sudden eruption of violence in the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict which has already claimed more than 2,500 lives. Israel has vowed to annihilate the Hamas movement that rules the Gaza Strip in retribution for the deadliest attack on Jewish civilians since the Holocaust, when hundreds of gunmen poured across the barrier fence and rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday. Israel said on Thursday there would be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all hostages taken by Hamas were freed, after the Red Cross pleaded for fuel to be allowed in to prevent overwhelmed hospitals from turning into morgues. Its heartbreaking to see innocent civilians dying, an emotional Georgieva told reporters. Who pays the price? It is the innocent who pay the price. Georgieva said severe shocks were becoming the new normal in a global economy characterized by weak growth, economic fragmentation and deepening divergences, with interest rates expected to stay higher for longer to tame persistent inflation. She appealed to countries to avoid escalating the situation and focus on areas of cooperation. We do need to build our agility in terms of anticipating shocks and being quick to respond, she said. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters any regional expansion of the conflict would lead to problematic economic consequences for energy prices and global growth.

        "title": "Sri Lanka bondholders sent 12 billion debt rework proposal to government - report",
        "date": "October 13, 2023 07:10 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas private creditors have sent a proposal on how to restructure 12 billion of overseas debt, including a new type of bond designed to ease repayments in case of future economic pressure, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The country of 22 million people tipped into its first foreign debt default in May 2022, after a severe shortage of dollars triggered its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. The proposal sent on Oct. 2 provides a write-down, or haircut, on both capital and interest, added the sources who declined to be named because the talks are private. It foresees issuance of regular sovereign bonds and also of so-called Macro Linked Bonds (MLBs), which will automatically lower coupon payments starting in 2027 if Sri Lanka fails to meet some of the economic targets linked to its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Representatives for the government did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson representing the creditor committee did not reply to a request for comment. The overall proposal includes an option for creditors that combines MLB notes with a regular bond and a second option of regular bonds with a Value Recovery Instrument (VRI), one of the sources said. The MLBs were included to ensure the new instruments would be index-eligible, the sources said. Bonds included in an index generally have more liquidity. The proposal would be a crucial step for Sri Lanka which, under the terms of a 2.9 billion IMF bailout secured in March, has to provide assurances of debt restructuring from bondholders and key bilateral lenders including China, Japan and India. It would be the first time such step-down bonds are being used in a debt restructuring, the sources added. The trigger of the step-down payments on the MLBs would be linked to indicators such as Sri Lankas gross financing needs (GFN) to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio and debt to GDP ratio, one of the sources said. If the GFNGDP ratio rises above 4.5 in 2027, coupons will adjust downwards, the source added. The restructuring proposal is based on parameters from the debt sustainability analysis that the IMF produced when it agreed upon the programme for the battered economy. A copy of the proposal was also sent to the IMF and the Paris Club secretariat, one of the sources said. Bondholders and the government remain in discussions through financial and legal advisers, so they are still not restricted to trade the countrys securities. Source: Reuters -Agencies",
