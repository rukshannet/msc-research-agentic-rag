        "title": "Substandard medicine imports: suspicions raised over actions of former Health Secretary",
        "date": "December 14, 2023 02:44 pm",
        "content": "The Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama has emphasized that the court finds the actions of the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta with regard to the process of purchasing the batch of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as suspicious. Therefore, the Magistrate has ordered that all responsible parties must be arrested and produced before the court irrespective of their positions, for the administration of justice over the providing of substandard medicine to the public. The case related to the purchase and release of the batch of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin within the countrys hospital system was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court on Wednesday (13). There, the owner of the company responsible for supplying the batch of medicine in question, the Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, and four other officials, who were arrested in relation to the case, were produced before the court. Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, who reported the progress of the investigations related to the matter to the court, on behalf of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), stated that she will submit to the court the investigation report of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) pertaining to the quality of the relevant immunoglobulin vials. Furthermore, the Deputy Solicitor General revealed that the relevant batch of medicine had failed the Microbiological test and that the solutions injected into the patients bodies had contained microorganisms, as per the report. She also highlighted that thereby, the microbiology experts are of the opinion that those drugs would have caused fatal allergies in patients. In addition, the Deputy Solicitor General expressed that investigations have been launched regarding 04 other types of drugs apart from the IVIG vials in question and Rituximab, which have currently been found to be substandard. The relevant investigations were launched into a type of drug given for Colorectal cancer (cancers associated with the rectum and large intestine), a drug given for cancers associated with the lungs and stomach, a drug used in eye surgery and another type of drug used for treating disorders related with blood clotting, according to the Deputy Solicitor General. Accordingly, she requested the court to issue an order suspending the use of relevant medicines in treating the patients for now, and to re-import the drugs in question. The magistrate, who took the request into consideration, has ordered the Medical Supplies Division to immediately suspend the use of those 04 types of drugs and to store them safely for further investigations. Furthermore, the Deputy Solicitor General also presented facts at length regarding the investigations. Later, the lawyers representing the suspects had submitted bail requests for their clients. However, the Maligakanda Magistrate once again rejected the relevant bail requests, after considering the facts presented. Accordingly, the court has also ordered the five suspects including the four officials of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division who were arrested and remanded in custody in relation to the case, to be remanded further until December 27, 2023.",

        "date": "December 14, 2023 04:10 pm",
        "content": "Health authorities warn that there is a high risk of Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, spreading in the Puttalam District. Entomological officer of health Buddhika Chamila states that there is a higher risk of this disease spreading in the rural areas. Furthermore, he mentioned that this situation is caused by the high proliferation of plants such as Salvinia and Water Hyacinth. Commenting further, Mr. Chamila said: Lymphatic Filariasis can be separated into two categories, namely rural filariasis and urban filariasis. Rural filariasis has existed since the past. The mosquito species identified as Mansonia carries out its breeding associated with the root system of plants like Salvinia and Water Hyacinth, he said. In addition, he also pointed out that at present, a large number of children under 5 years of age are at risk of contracting rural filariasis. Mr. Buddhika Chamila, who expressed that the high proliferation of Salvinia and Water Hyacinth plants are a huge threat in rural areas, which enhances the possibility of mosquito breeding, also stated that the population of the disease-spreading mosquitoes can be reduced by removing such types of plants that are mostly seen in water bodies such as lakes. The most cases reported within the Puttalam District so far are rural filariasis, he added.",

        "title": "Drugs seized will be promptly destroyed hereafter  Acting IGP",
        "date": "December 14, 2023 04:15 pm",
        "content": "Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Deshabandu Tennakoon, has stressed that measures will be taken to destroy all drugs taken into custody during raids within a very short time period from hereon. Speaking to reporters ahead of the destruction of over 100 kilograms of heroin today (14 Dec.), on orders of the Colombo High Court, Tennakoon acknowledged the various concerns with regard to the handling of confiscated drugs from raids and otherwise. There are allegations that these drugs, in various ways, end up in the hands of drug dealers or drug addicts again. The media has also reported of such incidents, he said in this regard. The Acting IGP assures, however, that henceforth, steps will be taken for the swift and immediate destruction of all confiscated drugs. Meanwhile the Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa highlighted that, in accordance with the amendments made to the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act in 2022, the disposal of all seized narcotic substances is authorized once they have undergone examination by the Government Analyst. He further noted that a gazette notification in this regard, too, has already been issued by the Minister of Justice. Therefore, SSP Thalduwa indicated that although there are approximately 4,000 kilograms of confiscated narcotics awaiting destruction pending the resolution of their respective court cases, measures are currently underway to destroy an additional 1,000 kilograms of such seized drugs, taken into custody after the amendments made to the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act in November 2022. This is because they are not required to wait until their court cases conclude, he explained. On 13 December, the Colombo High Court ordered to destroy 107 kilograms of heroin as well as 01 kilogram and 104 grams of another substance, suspected to be heroin, which were taken into custody by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) in 2019.",

        "date": "December 14, 2023 05:44 pm",
        "content": "Former Mayor of Kurunegala Thushara Sanjeewa Vitharana and four others have been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment after being found guilty over the destruction and removal of the ancient Raja Sabha Mandapaya (Kings Court) in Kurunegala. On 06 August 2020, the Kurunegala Magistrate had issued arrest warrants against the Kurunegala Mayor, the Municipal Commissioner, Engineer and two others in the case filed over the demolishing of the Buwaneka Hotel, a building historical value which dates back to the 13th century and is presumed to be the Kings Court of King Buwanekabahu II. The then Attorney General had previously directed the then Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) to obtain warrants from the court and arrest the said individuals. Three days later, on 10 August, the arrest warrants were re-issued by the Kurunegala Magistrate as the Kurunegala Police failed to execute the warrants previously issued for their arrests. On 11 August, five persons including the Kurunegala Mayor filed writ petitions challenging the arrest warrant issued against them. The building in question, also known as the Buwaneka Hotel, dates back to the 13th century and is presumed to be the assembly hall used by the contemporary rulers. On 16 July 2022, the Mayor of Kurunegala had demolished the said building for a road development project. He had claimed that the Road Development Authority (RDA) had given its approval for the demolition. The Department of Archaeology then filed a complaint claiming that the building demolished by the Kurunegala Mayor is a 13th-century Kings Court, adding that the archaeological site has been listed under the provisions of the Antiquities Ordinance No. 9 of 1940. A five-member committee was then formed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs, under the directives of then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to look into the incident. In the meantime, then Attorney General Dappula de Livera obtained an order from the Kurunegala Magistrates Court to protect and prevent access to the demolished historic building site pending investigations. The prevention order was issued against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Kurunegala, Municipal Councillors, Municipal Commissioner, and Engineer Municipal Council staff and their representatives. On 28 July, 2020, the Kurunegala Magistrate ordered the Mayor of Kurunegala to hand over all documents pertaining to the demolished building to the safe custody of the court. Further, the Kurunegala Magistrate called for all the documents and minutes of the City Development Committee from the Governor of the North-western Province.

        "title": "Putin tells Russia his war objectives are unchanged",
        "date": "December 14, 2023 06:39 pm",
        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Russians that peace with Ukraine will only take place when we achieve our objectives. He is holding his first major news conference since he launched his first full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin has combined his annual direct line phone-in with Russians with an audience of journalists. The annual event did not take place last year. Much of the first part of this marathon event has been focused on what Mr Putin calls the special military operation in Ukraine. His initial thoughts addressed the importance of Russian sovereignty. The existence of our country without sovereignty is impossible. It will simply not exist, he told state-controlled Channel One host Yekaterina Berezovskaya. Mr Putin said Russias economy was strong for a time of war and the topic of conversation quickly moved to Ukraine. 617,000 Russians fighting in Ukraine Mr Putin said that there will be peace in Ukraine when we achieve our objectives. Those objectives do not change, he said, listing denazification, demilitarisation and its neutral status. These are themes he has highlighted from the start of the war. At one point he revealed that Russia currently has a total of 617,000 troops fighting in Ukraine. He also claimed that on top of 300,000 people called up for service last year, another 486,000 have signed up voluntarily as contract soldiers. The stream of our men who are ready to defend the interests of the homeland with weapons in their hands is not diminishing, he said. Altogether there will be just under half a million men by the end of this year. Why do we need a mobilisation? He gave no number of military losses, but disclosed that children of people within his close circle have fought for so-called private military companies, and a number of people close to me have died. A classified US intelligence report estimated this week that 315,000 Russian soldiers had been either killed or wounded since the war began - which it said was almost 90 of Russias military personnel at the start of the invasion. A war reporter for Russian daily Izvestia based in occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine then asked Mr Putin about Ukraines recent foothold on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro river. Describing Ukraines military success in a small area as a last-ditch attempt by Ukraine to break through to Crimea, President Putin explained that Russian forces decided to withdraw several metres into wooded areas to save our lads. He went on to suggest Kyivs main motive is to show the West that it needs more military funding. I dont know why they are doing it, they are pushing their people to get killed, its a one-way trip for Ukrainian forces. The reasons for this are political, because Ukrainian leaders are begging foreign countries for aid. While the Russian leader was speaking, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave a press conference at alliance headquarters in Brussels where he warned: If Putin wins in Ukraine, there is a real risk that his aggression will not end there. Mr Putin went on to claim that Russian forces have the upper hand across the front line in Ukraine. Practically along the entire line of contact our armed forces are improving their situation, to put it modestly, he said at his marathon news conference. There has been very little movement on the front line in recent months, but Russia is targeting two eastern towns in the Donetsk region, Mariinka and Avdiivka. Mr Putin insisted that Russia could move forward despite Western economic sanctions and political isolation stemming from its Ukraine invasion. Americans held in Russian jails Mr Putin also covered Russian relations with the United States and EU. He described the US as an important country but accused it of imperialism. He urged the US to respect other people and countries and said Russia was ready to restore relations once this happened. New York Times correspondent Valerie Hopkins asked the Russian leader what it would take for Russia to release two American citizens held in Russian jails - the Wall Street Journals widely respected correspondent Evan Gershkovich and former marine Paul Whelan. The US sees both men as wrongfully detained and Mr Gershkovichs detention was extended on Thursday until 30 January. He was arrested while he was reporting for the newspaper in the city of Yekaterinburg and accused of espionage, which he and his colleagues firmly deny. As regards a possible exchange we want to reach an agreement, and that agreement must be mutually acceptable and suit both sides, Mr Putin responded, pointing out the men were subject to a court order. A dialogue on the subject is under way. Its a difficult dialogue and I wont go into the details now, but I think on the whole were speaking in a language which we both understand. I hope we find a solution. Aside from the spontaneous questions put to Mr Putin by Russian and international journalists, a reported two million questions were submitted for the event by ordinary Russians and carefully vetted beforehand.

        "date": "December 14, 2023 09:01 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe declared that work on more than 200 development projects, initiated with foreign aid but halted midway, is set to recommence in the first quarter of the next year. State Minister Semasinghe made this announcement in light of the bolstering of the countrys economy with the second tranche of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Speaking at a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective path to a Stable Country, today (14 Dec.) the State Minister emphasized the significance of political stability reflected in the passage of the 2024 budget proposal. He underscored that this years budget provides the necessary groundwork for effective management of state income and expenditures. Addressing the economic challenges faced by the country, Semasinghe pointed out that slogans alone are insufficient, advocating the necessity of the IMF program. He highlighted the successful passing of the 2024 state budget and the anticipated release of USD 337 million from the IMF as a positive development. He expressed hope for similar cooperation from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Pointing out that the countrys economy is not at a level where popular political slogans can be used to find solutions, the State Minister emphasized that there was no other option but the program with the IMF. State Minister Shehan Semasinghe further stated that it was possible to pass the 2024 state budget, reflecting the political stability of the parliament. Highlighting the IMFs decision to release the second installment of USD 337 million to Sri Lanka, Semasinghe noted that hopes are high for the release of the previously agreed installments from the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank(ADB). The opposition created anxiety among the people by suggesting that the government would not succeed in the debt restructuring process, creating a very unfortunate situation. If the debt restructuring process fails, we will be unable to achieve our desired economic goals. The success of these efforts will contribute significantly to improving the economic condition of the country, the Presidents Media Division )PMD) reported. The State Minister also said that just a few months ago, the country faced a challenging economic situation. Comparing the economic conditions then and now, it becomes evident that the International Monetary Fund played a crucial role in facilitating this success. Apart from that program, there had no other means to uplift the economy as a country State Minister Semasinghe emphasized that during the implementation of the program with the IMF, the operational procedures of the countrys creditors and other multilateral financial facilities played a crucial role. Within the financial framework of the IMF, Sri Lankas efficiency and commitments held significant importance. As a responsible government, it was not inclined to underestimate the difficulties faced by the people. However, the government acknowledged that if such decisions were not made, the country might find itself in a worse situation than the last economic crisis in the future. He stated that it is noteworthy that the leadership provided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in this brief period was crucial for managing these situations. Gratitude must be extended to the people for their involvement in the governments reform process, despite its challenges. In addition to the approval of the budget document in the parliament, there is a need to concentrate on increasing state income. The problematic situation arises from the fact that government revenue has not been adjusted to match the expenditure. The agreement with the IMF has faced strong criticism in Parliament. However, it must be acknowledged that the countrys economy is not at a level where political solutions can be found. Criticizing and blaming the past are not effective in solving the crisis. Opposition groups have opposed government decisions solely for the sake of popularity, requiring a decision on whether to continue as a bankrupt country or strengthen the gained momentum. He also pointed out that without a change in the countrys tax policy, the government will struggle to achieve the desired state revenue. The previous governments neglected the tax system, contributing to the current predicament. The President proposed strengthening the tax network through last years interim budget. As it did not yield the expected results, the necessary conditions for expanding the tax network were established in this years budget. Therefore, increasing government revenue and managing expenditures are crucial. Furthermore, work on over 200 projects, initially halted due to foreign loan challenges, will resume in the first quarter of next year. Despite the economic challenges, the country is optimistic and exhibits signs of recovery. Building the countrys economy cannot be solely approached from a political angle, as suggested by the opposition. Criticizing groups that didnt shoulder responsibility during challenging times is unfair. Survey institutes should responsibly express their opinions on the countrys economy, especially considering the critical juncture. The press release from the IMF emphasizes that misinformation is being disseminated for political purposes, the PMD reported.",

        "content": "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has branded the governments decision to engage in a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with an Australia-based firm as an act of corruption. Delivering a special statement today (14 Dec.), the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader accused the government of endorsing a proposal to engage in a PPA with the Australian firm United Solar Group (USG) without following the proper tender process. Meanwhile, speaking in Parliament in this regard recently, the leader of the National Peoples Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake also charged that the move would only result in consumers having to pay higher electricity tariffs. On 12 December, the Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal seeking to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement with the Australia-based company United Solar Group. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said through this deal, plans are afoot to invest in a 700MW Solar Power Project with a 1,500MW Battery Energy Storage System. The Solar power project will be installed on the surface of the Poonakary Tank in the Killinochchi District, with a Foreign Direct Investment of USD 1,727 Million, Wijesekera added. Earlier this year, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to call for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from prospective investors to develop renewable energy projects with a capacity of 50MW or more in order to support the implementation of expeditious renewable energy development programs in the country. As such, United Solar Energy Sri Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., the local subsidiary of United Solar Group, had submitted a proposal to develop a solar power plant of 700MW with a battery energy storage system, at Poonakary Tank, Kilinochchi enabling to provide a power supply of 134MW.",

Expressing a deep sense of anguish on yet another incident of apprehension of six Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy on 13 December, he said this was the third such occurrence in a week. Six fishermen from Jegathapattinam fishing harbour, Pudukkottai district, who ventured for fishing in a mechanised fishing boat were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy along with their fishing boat, the Chief Minister said in a letter to Union External Affairs Minister C Jaishankar, a copy of which was made available to the media here. He said the Sri Lankan Navy continued to infringe upon the traditional rights of our fishermen, and their frequent arrests have jeopardised the livelihoods of the fishermen and have instilled fear and panic in the fishing hamlets. In addition to the above fishermen, 137 boats and 39 fishermen were still under Sri Lankan custody. I therefore request you to take this up urgently with the Sri Lankan government through appropriate diplomatic channels to immediately secure the release of 45 fishermen and 138 fishing boats in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities, Stalin said in the letter.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering a speech at the Defence Services Command and Staff College (DSCSC) Course 17 Award Ceremony on Thursday (Dec.14) has emphasized the need for a broader international perspective in military education and highlighted the evolving global landscape. The ceremony was held at Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo with a diverse group of students, including participants from foreign countries, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said.

Acknowledging this, the Head of State emphasized the need to provide opportunities to officers and cadets from various countries, reinforcing the importance of global collaboration among the three defence academies. The president stressed the significance of idea exchange and international interactions, citing the profound changes occurring in the present decade. He outlined major geopolitical shifts, predicting new methods, strategies, technologies and global situations that armed forces worldwide would encounter by the decades end. Addressing the rise of Asian armed forces, Wickremesinghe noted their substantial capabilities compared to some Western counterparts. He discussed the implications of technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence, 3D printing, and the transition from fossil fuels. The President underscored the importance of studying social, economic, and political issues alongside military strategies. The president then delved into the complex and changing nature of conflicts, citing ongoing wars and insurgencies.

The president highlighted the political nature of the conflict and its impact on public opinion globally. Wickremesinghe also discussed the unique nature of the war in Gaza, where political strategies and global media play a decisive role. He highlighted the changing face of warfare, with battles extending beyond traditional battlefields into homes through media coverage. The evolving nature of warfare, with battles extending into the media and public discourse, was a focal point. The Head of State compared it to historical events like the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. He noted the political manipulation of war, as seen in Hamass tactics, which transcend traditional military considerations. Concluding his speech, the president urged the audience to recognize the changing nature of war, where politics and military actions intertwine. He acknowledged the uncertainty of how these shifts would unfold in the future, leaving it to the next generation to navigate the evolving geopolitical and military landscape.

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has ordered that the retirement age of specialist doctors in public service be extended to 63 years. This decision was delivered this morning (Dec.15), when a writ application filed by 176 specialist doctors challenging the Cabinet decision to lower their age of retirement to 60 years. Appeals Court President, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar sat for the petition hearing today. On October 17, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers gave its approval to revise the retirement age of specialist doctors from 63 to 60, however, the move was widely criticized by the medical officers. As per the Cabinet decision, doctors aged 60, 61 and 62 by the end of 2022 were allowed to serve until 61, 62 and 63 respectively, however, those aged 59 were required to retire by the age of 60. Later, 176 specialist doctors filed a writ application challenging the Cabinet decision to revise the retirement age of specialist doctors. On June 28, the Ministry of Health informed the Appeals Court of its decision to extend the compulsory retirement age of specialist doctors in the public service to 63 years. The Health Secretary had told the court that the service period of specialist doctors would thus be extended to 63 years by revising the current compulsory retirement age, pending the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.",

        "date": "December 15, 2023 12:01 pm",
        "content": "European Union leaders agreed to open membership talks with Ukraine even as it continues to fight Russias invasion, but they could not agree on a 50 billion euro package of financial aid for Kyiv due to opposition from Hungary. At a summit in Brussels, other leaders bypassed objections from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban by getting him to leave the room while they took the historic step of agreeing to start accession negotiations with a country at war. But they could not overcome resistance from Orban - who maintains close ties to Russia - to a revamp of the blocs budget to channel vital financial support to Ukraine and provide more cash for other EU priorities such as managing migration. They ended talks on the financial package, which requires unanimity of the 27 EU leaders, in the early hours of Friday morning and said they would try again in January, with some voicing optimism a deal could be clinched then. Officials said leaders of 26 of the EUs 27 member countries were satisfied with a compromise budget proposal put forward by summit chairman Charles Michel. We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on leaving the talks. I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January, said Rutte. Orban has argued Ukraine should not get such large amounts of money from the EU budget as it is not part of the bloc. Other leaders have assured Kyiv they channel aid to Ukraine outside the EU budget if Budapest maintains its blockade. The news on the financing struck a bittersweet note for Ukraine, coming just hours after leaders agreed to open membership talks. Although membership would likely be many years away, the decision at a summit in Brussels takes Ukraine a step closer to its long-term strategic goal of anchoring itself in the West and liberating itself from Moscows orbit. The move came at a critical time for Ukraine, after its counter-offensive against Russian forces has failed to make major gains and with U.S. President Joe Biden so far unable to get a 60 billion package for Kyiv through the U.S. Congress. This is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens, declared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. I congratulate every Ukrainian on this day ... History is made by those who dont get tired of fighting for freedom. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz played a key role in getting Orban to leave the room to clear the way for a decision, diplomats and officials said. Scholz said the decision was a strong sign of support for Ukraine. The leaders also agreed to accession talks with another former Soviet republic, Moldova, and to grant another, Georgia, the status of membership candidate. It is clear that these countries belong to the European family, Scholz said on social media platform X. The leaders said they would also start membership talks with Bosnia once it has undertaken certain political reforms. ORBANS OBJECTIONS Orban had cited corruption and other issues in arguing Ukraine was not ready for EU talks but EU diplomats suspected he was using the issue as a bargaining chip to try to unlock EU funds frozen over concerns about the rule of law in Hungary. On Wednesday, the European Commission - the EUs executive body - restored Hungarys access to up to 10.2 billion euros in refunds for economic projects after finding it had fulfilled conditions on the independence of its judiciary. Orban stood by his objections to membership talks for Ukraine even after the decision was taken. Hungarys stance is clear, Ukraine is not prepared for us to start talks on EU membership, he said, calling the decision to start talks irrational and inappropriate. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, reflecting frustration with Orban, said it was time for the Hungarian to pipe down. If you are part of the decision, you agree with the decision, or afterwards you just have to keep your mouth shut, he said. In the midst of war, geographically bigger than any EU member and with a population of 44 million, Ukraine presents some unique challenges for admission to the 27-member bloc. But membership talks will likely take years and will not start immediately. First, the EU will have to agree to a negotiating framework for the talks - which will require another unanimous decision. The leaders said they would take this step once Ukraine meets outstanding requirements on democracy and the rule of law. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The Mahapola Education Exhibition and Trade Fair reopened its doors on 13 December, after a decade-long break, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Addressing the Mahapola 2023 Exhibition, President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the transformative impact of Mahapola on education, stating that it plays a crucial role in creating knowledgeable citizens and bringing the benefits of the open economy to rural areas. The event, organized by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Safety, was held at the Municipal Council Grounds in Ja-Ela yesterday (14 Dec.). Expressing gratitude for the late Minister Lalith Athulathmudalis contribution to education through the initiation of the Mahapola Scholarship Fund, President Wickremesinghe announced that the Seethawaka University Post Graduate Institute for Research would be named after him. The Mahapola Trade Fair was initiated to support the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Fund, established by the late former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali. The fund aims to provide educational opportunities for the children of underprivileged parents in Sri Lanka. It is noteworthy that the 226th Mahapola Fair is being held this year after a 10-year hiatus, with the exhibition scheduled to continue until December 17th. Featuring over 350 diverse booths, the exhibition offers a platform for inventors and entrepreneurs to showcase their products and tap into potential markets. The exhibition commenced on 13 December. Yesterday marked the second day, which was dedicated to education, and the President also visited the exhibition booths. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had a friendly meeting with the school students who came to see the exhibition. Additionally, the President launched the website www.eservices.mahapola.lk, providing an online donation facility for the Lalith Athalamudali Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund. Parakrama Banadara made the first donation for that fund. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe actively participated in the award ceremony for the winners of the art, essay, short film and street drama competitions associated with Mahapola 2023.

        "date": "December 15, 2023 12:12 pm",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal has terminated consideration of the petition filed against the gazette notification issued by former Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe to appoint an interim committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). President of the national cricket governing body Shammi Silva had put forward the petition. However, the judge bench has decided to allow the petitioners to reconvene their application if a legal need that is deemed reasonable arises in the future. On November 06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. Chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, the panel consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move. Later, on November 13, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on November 27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was subsequently sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasinghe. Not long after his appointment, Minister Fernando, on December 12, issued a new Extraordinary Gazette to dissolve the panel appointed by Ranasinghe. Accordingly, by means of the new communiqué, the Extraordinary Gazette bearing reference No. 235643 dated November 05, 2023, has been rescinded with immediate effect, thereby dissolving the Interim Committee appointed to exercise the powers, functions and duties of SLC. The sports minister communicated this to the Appeals Court on December 13.",

        "title": "World Bank forecasts Chinas economy to slow sharply in 2024, calls recovery fragile",
        "date": "December 15, 2023 01:00 pm",
        "content": "Chinas economy grew at a 5.2 pace in the first three quarters of the year and showed signs of improvement in November, with factory output and retail sales rising, the government said Friday. But investments in property sank 9.4, the National Bureau of Statistics said, indicating the real estate sector has yet to recover from a crisis that has led dozens of developers to default on hundreds of billions of dollars in debts. The worlds second-largest economy is still contending from the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other shocks, dogged by weakness in the property sector and in global demand for Chinas exports, high debt levels and wavering consumer confidence. The 10.1 jump in retail sales in November from a year earlier, up from a 7.6 jump in October, showed a glimmer of hope given that sluggish consumer spending has been a key factor hindering a stronger recovery. But its unclear if it will be sustained. A survey of factory purchasing managers, called the purchasing manager index, or PMI, showed a slightly bigger contraction in factory activity compared with October, a fact that statistics bureau spokesperson Liu Aihua said was partly due to the fact that some industries were entering their usual off season after holiday production rushes. But Liu added that at the same time there is insufficient market demand. Liu told reporters in Beijing. Looking to the future, the internal and external environment facing our countrys development is still complex and severe, Liu said. To further promote economic recovery, we need to overcome some difficulties and challenges. Chinas economy has the advantages of a vast market of 1.4 billion people and an advanced industrial base, he said. Fridays report followed an update Thursday from the World Bank that forecast that 5.2 annual growth this year will slow to 4.5 next year and to 4.3 in 2025. Chinas economy has yoyoed in the past few years, with growth ranging from 2.2 in 2020 to 8.4 in 2021 and 3 last year. Stringent limits on travel and other activities during the pandemic hit manufacturing and transport. Job losses due to those disruptions and to a crackdown on the technology sector, combined with a downturn in the property industry, have led many Chinese to tighten their purse strings. Pockets of strength have kept the economy growing at a pace matching the governments target for about 5 growth this year, helped by robust exports of industrial machinery, mobile phones and vehicles. Factory output rose 6.6 in November compared with a year earlier, the statistics bureau reported. That was the strongest growth since September 2022. Most of the jobs created during Chinas recovery have been low-skilled work in service industries with low pay, it noted. Chinese also are cautious given the threadbare nature of social safety nets and the fact that the population is rapidly aging, putting a heavier burden for supporting elders on younger generations. The outlook is subject to considerable downside risks, the report said, adding that a prolonged downturn in the real estate sector would have wider ramifications and would further squeeze already strained local government finances, as meanwhile softer global demand is a risk for manufacturers. Chinas leaders addressed such issues in their annual Central Economic Work Conference earlier this week, which set priorities for the coming year, but state media reports on the gathering did not provide specifics of policies. Real estate investment has fallen by 18 in the past two years, the World Bank report said. It said the value of new property sales fell 5 in January-October from a year earlier while new property starts dropped more than 25. The slowdown was worst in smaller cities that account for about 80 of the market in the country of 1.4 billion people. To sustain solid growth China needs a recovery in consumer spending, which took a nosedive during the omicron wave of COVID-19 and has remained below par since late 2021, the report said. It noted that gains from more investments in construction in a country that already has ample modern roads, ports, railways and housing projects  and also massive overcapacity in cement, steel and many other manufacturing sectors will give the economy less of a boost than could be achieved with more consumer spending.

Israel Defense Forces reported on social media that the body of Elia Toledano was recovered by Israeli special forces and returned to Israel, where he was positively identified. No further details were immediately provided on where and how Toledanos body was located. According to the Times of Israel, on Oct. 7, Toledano was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival in the southern Israeli desert  along with his friend, 21-year-old Mia Schem, and dozens of others  during Hamas bloody and violent assault that left at least 1,200 people dead. Israeli officials have said at least 260 people attending the Supernova festival were killed in the massacre. Schem, a French-Israeli woman, was one of more than 100 Hamas-held hostages who were freed during the seven-day cease-fire as part of a deal that also saw Israel release several hundred Palestinians jailed in Israel. Prior to her release, Schem had appeared in a distressing propaganda video released by Hamas in which her right arm seemed to be injured. Her mother, Karen Schem, told CBS News at the time that its very hard to see my daughter, I see the pain, I see that shes in physical pain. On Tuesday, the IDF said it recovered the bodies of two more hostages in Gaza, Eden Zakaria, 27, and Ziv Dado, 36.

While India has already raised objections with both Sri Lanka and Maldives and asked them not to allow the Chinese vessel to conduct exploration of the Indian Ocean for future military operations, the vessel Xiang Yang Hong 03 is currently off the coast of Xiamen in the South China Sea and will travel via Malacca to these countries after securing permission. Made in 2016, Xiang Yang Hong 03 is a 4813-ton vessel equipped with the latest survey and surveillance equipment and is registered at the port of Xiamen. The previous survey vessel, Shi Yan 6, which was allowed permission by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government despite Indias strong objections exited the Malacca Straits on November 20- after conducting an exploration of the Sri Lankan EEZ and South Indian Ocean. The ship was also seen 500 nautical miles off Chennai before it entered Colombo port on October 25, 2023. The Indian concerns over Chinese ballistic missile trackers and Research Surveillance Ships being allowed by Sri Lanka and now with a pro-China government in Maldives are over Beijing using these vessels to spy on India in the name of marine exploration. Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue with visiting President Ranil Wickremesinghe on July 21, 2023, that Sri Lanka should respect the strategic concerns of India. With the PLA Navy rapidly acquiring maritime assets including three aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and guided missile destroyers, China is expanding its footprint all over the Indian Ocean with a string of naval bases from Cambodia to Djibouti on the mouth of the Red Sea. China has already acquiredinvested in ports in Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, and in UAE with an eye towards future naval operations. In the name of marine exploration, Beijing is actually mapping the Indian Ocean bed from the ninety-degree ridge south of Andamans and Nicobar Islands to the deep South Indian Ocean. Detailed ocean bed maps are prepared for future submarine operations all the way up to the coast of Africa. With the PLA already operating off the coast of Africa and the Gulf of Aden in the name of anti-piracy operations, it is only a matter of time before Chinese carrier strike forces will be patrolling in international waters of the Indian Ocean. Last month, the Chinese Navy conducted an exercise with the Pakistan Navy off the Makran Coast with a PLA Song class diesel hunter-killer submarine participating in specialized sea bottoming operations along with client state Pakistan.

        "date": "December 15, 2023 03:36 pm",
        "content": "Suspected members of a separatist group killed 11 people and wounded eight others in a nighttime attack on a police station in southeastern Iran, state TV said Friday. The deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan province, Ali Reza Marhemati, said senior police officers and soldiers were killed and wounded in the 2 a.m. attack in Rask town, about 1,400 kilometers (875 miles) southwest of Tehran. He said police killed several of the attackers in a shootout. The advocacy group HalVash, which reports on issues affecting the Baluch people, shared video online that purported to include the heavy gunfire that accompanied the predawn attack. It also showed helicopters later flying over the area in daylight. State TV blamed the attack on Jaish al-Adl, a separatist group. In 2019, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on a bus that killed 27 members of Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. However, the militants did not immediately claim the new attack. They typically conduct hit-and-run operations from their hideouts in neighboring Pakistan. Majid Mirahmadi, a deputy interior minister, told state TV that the attack wounded eight police officers. He said two gunmen had been killed and one arrested. He said during the attack the gunmen also ambushed deployed forces to stop them from reaching the shootout. He said a search was underway in the area to find the gunmen. In recent months, militants and small separatist groups have attacked police stations as part of a low-level insurgency against the government. Sistan and Baluchestan province is one of the least developed areas of Iran. It was the site of heavy crackdowns on rallies following nationwide protests over the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, in Tehran who had been detained for allegedly improperly wearing an Islamic veil. Anti-government demonstrations have been happening for months as well on Fridays in the restive province, which is a majority Sunni region. Its Baluch people long have complained about being treated as second-class citizens by Irans Shiite rulers. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "December 15, 2023 05:41 pm",
        "content": "A rush hour collision between two subway trains in Beijing has left 102 people with broken bones, Chinese state media reported. More than 500 people were sent to hospital after the incident, which occurred at about 19:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday. The trains collided during heavy snowfall while going downhill on the Changping subway line. As of Friday morning, 423 people have been discharged from hospital. While such accidents are not common on the Chinese capitals transport network, snowstorms reportedly led to slippery tracks. This then caused a signal degradation which led the first train to brake suddenly, China Daily reported, citing Beijing transport authorities. The following train was unable to brake in time while coming down the icy tracks, causing it to slam into the rear of the first train. The impact caused the last two carriages of one of the trains to detach. It is unclear which train was decoupled. Images and footage posted online show commuters crowded in carriages, left in the dark due to power cuts. A few were seen using emergency hammers to smash out windows for some fresh air. In a clip posted on Chinese social media network Weibo, a woman who appears to have fainted is seen lying across several train seats. Sixty-seven people remain in hospital for treatment, while 25 are under observation, reports said. There were no deaths. The incident sparked furious comments from Chinese netizens. Some were shocked by the number of injuries, while others lamented the inconvenience caused by the collision. Does Beijing Subway have no maintenance staff? No routine inspection?... Are we taking the lives of hundreds of people too lightly, wrote a Weibo user. Beijing Subway, owned by the municipal government, operates the 27 subway and rail lines that run through the city. Beijing Subway apologised for the incident, adding that the company will cover the medical bills of those injured. Given the current extreme weather, the operator has also instructed that trains traveling above ground be driven in manual mode and for intervals between trains to be widened. The section of the subway line affected by the incident - spanning three stations - was closed on Friday. Road, rail and air transport have all been disrupted by snowfall in Beijing. Temperatures are expected to plummet across northern China in the coming days. Meteorological authorities warned that temperatures will fall by 8C to 12C in most parts of the country from Thursday through Sunday. This means the temperature in Beijing could dip below -20C over the weekend. In some cities, authorities have shut schools and suspended train services. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "December 15, 2023 06:01 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy grew by 1.6 in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023, official data showed on Friday (Dec.15). According to a press release published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant price has increased to Rs. 2,946.1 billion in the Q3 of 2023 from Rs. 2,900.6 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2022. The year-on-year GDP growth rate for the third quarter of the year 2023 has been reported as 1.6 of positive growth rate, the DCS mentioned. In addition, the GDP for Sri Lanka for the Q3 of 2023 at current price has increased up to Rs. 6,906,8 billion from Rs. 6,586,6 billion, recorded in the same quarter in 2022 registering a 4.9 positive change in the current price GDP. During this period, three major economic activities, namely agricultural, industrial and services contributed their share to the GDP at current prices by 7.8, 28.1 and 57.5, respectively. The agriculture sector grew by 3 from a year earlier, while industrial output saw a 0.3 increase, and the services sector, a 1.3 growth between July 01 and September 31. The DCS said the Q3 of 2023 began with the favourable change in uncertainties in foreign exchange which were observed in previous quarters, and the economy and its expectations about the future had been growing at a lower rate, and transformed into a positive state. The input costs declined parallel to the favourable change in the exchange rate and the demand for debts which were at a lower level, showed a positive indication in this quarter along with the reduction in interest rate. With the expansion of the tourism sector, a positive impact could be observed in the service exports during this quarter. Accordingly, accommodation, food and beverage service activities have recorded a high positive growth while agricultural activities have also recorded a positive growth rate in the Q3 of 2023. Moreover, some of the manufacturing industries have also recorded expansions in this quarter. The expansion of the economy was the first since the end of 2021, with the upturn driven by a lower base, moderating inflation, a strengthening currency and lower interest rates. Helped by a USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout in March, Sri Lankas economy began a painful path towards growth. It locked down a second tranche of USD 337 million this week, although the IMF has warned the islands economy is not yet out of the woods. Sri Lankas economy is expected to contract by 3.6 this year, the IMF says, after shrinking 7.8 in 2022. Full-year growth is likely to return next year, with the Sri Lankan economy projected to grow 1.8, but challenging reforms lie ahead, such as higher taxes, reforms to loss-making state enterprises and a complete restructuring of its foreign debt. --with inputs from agencies",

        "date": "December 16, 2023 10:19 am",
        "content": "State Minister for Higher Education, Suren Raghavan has unveiled plans for significant reforms in the humanities faculties of the universities. Addressing a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (Dec.15), the lawmaker shed light on the forthcoming initiatives aimed at revitalizing the education sector. Raghavan revealed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken the initiative to institute a National Higher Education Authority. This Authority will be tasked with conducting comprehensive research and studies on the ongoing education reforms within the region and globally. In his remarks, Raghavan conveyed that a significant financial allocation has been designated for the education and higher education sectors. The intention is to execute a series of reforms within the Humanities Faculty of the countrys universities. To facilitate this, a specialized discussion session for this purpose has been planned for the upcoming month. President Wickremesinghe has made the strategic decision to institute a National Higher Education Authority. The primary objective of this authority is to conduct comprehensive studies on research and advancements related to the on-going education reforms within regional countries and across the international landscape. Emphasizing alignment with 21st-century standards, the establishment of this authority also aims to centralize university administration into a cohesive framework. To enhance the administrative efficiency of universities, a strategic initiative has been formulated to appoint Deputy Vice-chancellors alongside the existing Vice-Chancellors. Recognizing the considerable number of lecturers and professors from the country who have pursued opportunities abroad, concerted efforts are underway to repatriate their expertise. Invitations have been extended to these qualified professionals, urging them to return to Sri Lanka and contribute to teaching and research activities in state universities. As a result, several lecturers are currently responding to this call, actively engaging in providing their valuable services in the local academic landscape. Efforts have been initiated to curtail incidents of violence in the universities and foster an atmosphere conducive to quality education. In pursuit of this objective, a comprehensive plan has been devised to enrol 41,000 students in Sri Lankan universities for the upcoming academic year. As a prerequisite for university admission, these students are mandated to participate in a four-month social service activity aligned with their chosen subjects. A novel program has been meticulously designed to facilitate this pre-university engagement. --PMD",

        "title": "Matthew Perrys death an accident caused by ketamine, autopsy finds",
        "date": "December 16, 2023 11:48 am",
        "content": "Actor Matthew Perrys death was an accident caused by the acute effects of ketamine, medical officials in Los Angeles have confirmed. The star was found unresponsive in the pool of his LA home in October, but a post-mortem examination was inconclusive at the time. Drowning was listed as a contributing factor in his death. He was best known for playing the wise-cracking Chandler Bing in the sitcom Friends. The show followed six young friends living in New York City and aired from 1994 until 2004. Its finale was watched by 52.5 million in the US, making it the most-watched TV episode of the 2000s. At the height of his fame, Perry was battling with addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and attended rehabilitation clinics on multiple occasions. In 2016, he told BBC Radio 2 that he could not remember three years of filming during Friends, because of drink and drugs. After attempts at treatment, he wrote in his memoir that he had been mostly sober since 2001 - save for about 60 or 70 mishaps. Other contributing causes of the 54-year-olds death were given as coronary artery disease and the effects of buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, the LA County medical examiner said in a statement. At the high levels of ketamine found in his post-mortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression, senior deputy medical examiner Raffi Djabourian wrote, according to the Press Association. Drowning contributes due to the likelihood of submersion into the pool as he lapsed into unconsciousness; coronary artery disease contributes due to exacerbation of ketamine-induced myocardial effects on the heart. He was found unresponsive at his home on 28 October, and paramedics pronounced his death when they were called to the scene. A day later, the medical examiners office updated its file to say his case had been deferred, which usually means that the post-mortem is complete but more detail is needed. His fellow Friends actors paid tribute to Perry in the weeks following his death, with actress Jennifer Anniston - who played Rachel in the sitcom - writing that having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that Ive never experienced before. David Schwimmer, who played Ross, thanked Perry for 10 incredible years of laughter and creativity. He was laid to rest at an LA cemetery following a private funeral, US media reported in November. Films he starred in included crime caper The Whole Nine Yards and sequel The Whole Ten Yards with his friend Bruce Willis. He played the lead in romantic comedy Fools Rush In with Salma Hayek, and he played the older Zac Efron in 17 Again. In 2016, he also wrote a play called The End of Longing - which the Times noted explores his characters search for love and commitment and the damage that can be wrought when those things continue to be absent from life.

        "title": "IDF says Israeli troops mistakenly killed 3 hostages in Gaza",
        "date": "December 16, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military says it has mistakenly killed three hostages during its campaign in Gaza after they were mis-identified as a threat. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The military shared its remorse and said the three were shot by troops operating in Shejaiya, in Gazas north. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured in the 7 October attacks on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Fridays incident was under investigation, and that it expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences. Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home, it added. Hundreds of people gathered in central Tel Aviv following the announcement and marched to an IDF military base in the city, calling on the government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages. Demonstrators held candles and carried placards that read Bring them home and Hostage exchange now! The bodies of the three men have been returned to Israeli territory, where checks confirmed their identities. Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October, was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food. On the morning of the Hamas attack, he called his family and told them that his house was on fire. When he opened the window for some fresh air, Yotam was kidnapped by Hamas. Speaking to the BBC before her sons death, his mother said they had messaged each other as they hid in their home shelters - before their connection was lost. Alon Shamriz was at also Kfar Aza at the time of attack. His family gave permission for him to be named after asking earlier that his identity not be revealed. Samer Talalka, a Bedouin, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, he loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends. He lived in the town of Hura and worked at a chicken hatchery in the kibbutz. On the morning of 7 October, he was at work. He called his sister after the attack to tell her that he had been injured by gunfire. His father told local media they lost touch at 07:00 local time on the morning of the attacks. A photograph of him being led through Gaza was shared on Telegram. Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called their deaths an unbearable tragedy. Even on this difficult evening, we will bind up our wounds, learn the lessons and continue with a supreme effort to return all our abductees home safely, he said. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the killings were a tragic mistake, and that the US did not have perfect visibility on exactly how this operation unfolded. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 18,800 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave so far in the war that followed. Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were among the released, said he often heard people say hostages could be rescued by military means. But there is no military way that would bring them back safely, he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The conclusion for every person who has both heart and mind is the same: Israel must initiate a deal to bring them back alive and not in coffins. Source: BBC -Agencies",

Baglay assumed duties in Sri Lanka in May 2020 and his term as Indias top diplomat in the country witnessed several unmatched milestones in the bilateral partnership, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said in a statement. He was instrumental in realizing several crowning achievements in India-Sri Lanka ties. Among the key highlights of his term was the multi-pronged assistance worth USD 4 billion, in response to the economic challenges in Sri Lanka in 2022. Signing of Modalities Agreement for the possession, development and use of Trincomalee Tank Farms and Joint Venture between CPC  LIOC in January 2022 also deserve a special mention. Under his watch, India supplied more than 25 tons of medicines, Made-in-India COVID vaccine, Rapid Antigen Test kits, Liquid Medical Oxygen, to Sri Lanka to tide over COVID-19 pandemic. Further, Indian Naval and Air Force assets were deployed specially for expediting humanitarian supplies to Sri Lanka during this period. Further, the economic and commercial engagement between the two countries got a major boost during his tenure. There have been multiple bilateral MoUs including for cooperation in renewable energy, for intergrid connection, for development of Trincomalee, for UPI-application acceptance  digital payments, utilization of INR-denominated trade settlements. India has also emerged as the largest trading partner of Sri Lanka. While development partnership featured landmark projects such as the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity Project, generational linkages in Buddhism were reinforced through numerous noble initiatives such as the USD 15 million grant assistance for the promotion Buddhist ties, inaugural international flight from Sri Lanka to the sacred city of Kushinagar in October 2021, with almost 100 monks on board. Various dimensions of connectivity also deepened such as the resumption of Chennai-Jaffna flights and recommencement of ferry services. Meanwhile, senior Indian diplomat Santosh Jha will be assuming duties as the next High Commissioner of India. He is currently serving as Indias Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union.

        "date": "December 16, 2023 03:25 pm",
        "content": "The Covid subvariant JN.1, a descendant of BA.2.86, has been detected in parts of Kerala, triggering concerns about its impact. The India SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), which is a multi-laboratory, multi-agency, pan-India network tasked with sequencing and keeping an eye on new threatening Covid-19 variants, has done surveillance where JN.1 has been found in Kerala. Speaking to ANI, Chief of INSACOG, N.K. Arora, said, This variant has been isolated and reported in November; this is a subvariant of BA.2.86. We have some cases of JN.1. India is keeping a vigil and thats the reason no hospitalisation or severe disease has been reported so far, he added. JN.1 was first detected in September 2023 in the United States. According to Rajeev Jayadevan, the National Indian Medical Association Covid Task Forces co-chairman, After a seven-month gap, cases are rising in India. In Kerala, there are reports of people getting Covid, but the severity so far appears to be the same as before. Genome sequencing pinpoints what type of virus is circulating in each region. For example, in India, during the April 2023 wave, XBB sublineages were found to cause it. However, the December genome sequencing results are still coming in and early results show that a JN.1 case was found in Kerala, he added. Mr. Jayadevan said that the JN.1 variant is capable of spreading faster and evading immunity. JN.1 is a severely immune-evasive and fast-spreading variant, markedly different from XBB and all other prior versions of this virus. This enables it to infect people who had previous Covid infections and also people who were vaccinated, he said. Rajeev Jayadevan also noted that JN.1 has been reported in various countries. JN.1 is rising quickly in several Western countries, and India being connected by international travel with the rest of the world should be no exception, he said. Source - The Hindu - Agencies",

        "date": "December 16, 2023 05:16 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is trying to attract Arab visitors by promoting the travels of the famed 14th-century explorer Ibn Battuta, Colombos envoy to Riyadh said on Saturday. The famed Moroccan explorers ship arrived in the northwestern port of Puttalam from the Maldives in September 1344. At that time, Puttalam was under the rule of the king of Jaffna, who received him with honors. He spent a few days there, entertaining the king who, as he recalled in his Travels, understood Persian and was interested in his voyages and stories about the rulers of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia whom he had met since starting his journeys in 1325. Ibn Battuta then went on a pilgrimage to Adams Peak, a 2,243-meter tall conical sacred mountain located in central Sri Lanka, which is venerated by Muslims as the site of the footprint of the first man and prophet, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The king gave him a palanquin and sent men to accompany him. From Adams Peak, he took a southern route to Dondra, a southern coastal town, which was a rich temple port town complex. It was destroyed by the Portuguese in the 16th century. From Dondra, Ibn Battuta went to Galle and Colombo, and from there, he went back to Puttalam and sailed to the coast of Tamil Nadu. Sri Lanka, whose economy is highly dependent on tourism, is now hoping to attract visitors from Arab countries by evoking the memory of his travels. Its important to refresh the memories of this historic visit and project it among the Arabs, P.M. Amza, ambassador of Sri Lanka to Saudi Arabia, told Arab News. Ibn Battuta is a celebrated traveler  We believe such a celebrated travelers connection with Sri Lanka will be of definite attraction to the tourism sector of Sri Lanka. Earlier this week, the embassy in Riyadh inaugurated the Ibn Battuta Trail as part of the Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministrys economic diplomacy program in the Kingdom. The trail package follows the footsteps of the famed traveler to Adams Peak with highlights including cultural attractions, wildlife, nature, adventure activities, and cuisine. Amza was hopeful that it would contribute to increasing arrivals of Saudi travelers, which have dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic. We used to attract over 35,000 Saudi tourists to Sri Lanka annually before 2019 and it has significantly dropped since 2019, he said. Now there is a renewed interest, and we would like them to explore Sri Lankas beauty, beaches, waterfalls, rich culture, hospitality, nature and adventure. Source: Arab News -Agencies",

The corporations chairman Asiri Walisundara said the egg consignment scheduled for tomorrow would be released to the local market after sending the products for testing. On Friday (Dec.15), Trade Minister Nalin Fernando revealed that permission was granted to the State Trading Corporation to import eggs until the end of April 2024. During this period, 30 million eggs are planned to be brought into the country each month. The decision was taken in a bid to control the unreasonable increase in the price of eggs in the local market. The Trade Minister also reiterated that the government would continue to import eggs if local egg producers fail to bring down the exorbitant prices. Earlier this week, egg producers said that eggs cannot be sold below Rs. 55 each until the end of Christmas.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, emphasizing the monumental responsibility borne by the security forces, underscored that protecting the sovereignty of the country is paramount. The President further stated that no external interference or restriction shall be tolerated. President Wickremesinghe, serving as the Chief Guest at the Parade of Cadet Officers during the ceremony of Colours Re-Awarding and Commissioning Parade of Sri Lanka Military Academy, Diyatalawa on Saturday (16), highlighted the security forces role in safeguarding both the peoples sovereignty and the distinctive identity of Sri Lanka. He emphasized that any attempt to act independently based on racism or religion would pose a threat to the Sri Lankan identity, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The 98th Colours Re-Awarding and Commissioning Parade of Sri Lanka Military Academy Diyatalawa, renowned as the premier officer training institute that has produced esteemed leaders for the nation and the Sri Lanka Army, took place. During the ceremony, a total of 274 cadets successfully completed their training and were officially appointed to their respective roles. Notably, six cadet officers from foreign countries also underwent training and assumed their duties. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, actively participated in the inspection of the Colours Re-Awarding and Commissioning Parade, where he bestowed the championship award upon the best cadet team and presented a sword to the outstanding cadets. On October 14, 1972, the distinguished honour of presenting the Presidents colours was bestowed for the first time by Mr. William Gopallava, the President at that time. Additionally, on June 20, 1997, another significant presentation occurred when the then President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, presented the Presidents colours to the Sri Lanka Army College, marking a pivotal moment in the institutions history. After a span of 25 years, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again reinstated the Presidents colours for the second time. This act holds immense significance, symbolizing continuity and a commitment to the rich traditions of the Diyatalawa Military Academy, the statement said. Following the Colours Re-Awarding and Commissioning Parade, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photograph with the cadet officers, capturing the shared moment of achievement and camaraderie.

        "title": "Netanyahu hints new negotiations under way to release Gaza hostages",
        "date": "December 17, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm on Saturday that new negotiations were under way to recover hostages held by Hamas, after a source said Israels intelligence chief met the prime minister of Qatar, a country mediating in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a televised press conference a day after Israeli forces mistakenly killed three of more than 100 hostages held by Hamas, Netanyahu called the conflict an existential war that must be fought until victory, despite pressure and costs, and said Gaza would be demilitarized and under Israeli security control. He said Israels offensive in Gaza had helped clinch a partial hostage-release deal in November and vowed to maintain intense military pressure on Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza and that he has vowed to destroy. The instruction I am giving the negotiating team is predicated on this pressure, without which we have nothing, he said. Netanyahu spoke after the head of Israels Mossad spy agency, David Barnea, met Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe late on Friday, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, and attention turned to a possible new Gaza truce and a prisoner and hostage deal. Netanyahu sidestepped a question about the meeting, but confirmed he had given instructions to the negotiating team. We have serious criticisms of Qatar ... but right now we are trying to complete the recovery of our hostages, he said, alluding to the gas-rich Gulf states ties to Hamas and Israels arch-foe Iran. A Hamas statement said the group affirms its position not to open any negotiations to exchange prisoners unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all, adding: The movement communicated this position to all mediators. Israel bombarded targets across Gaza on Saturday, but two Egyptian security sources said Israeli officials now appeared more willing to work towards a ceasefire and an exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Israels counterattack on Gaza - after a surprise cross-border assault on Oct. 7 in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages - has killed close to 19,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. Thousands more are feared buried under rubble. An Israeli military official said the three hostages killed had been holding a white flag, according to an initial inquiry. Their deaths have put increased pressure on Netanyahu to find a way to secure the release of those held. In a post on social media platform X, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said that another hostage, 27-year-old Inbar Haiman, 27, has been murdered in Hamas captivity. The post gave no more details. As Netanyahu spoke, several hundred people staged a protest in Tel Aviv, with some holding placards, including one saying get them out of hell. A speaker shouted: Bring them home now! The meeting in Europe was apparently the first between senior officials from Israel and Qatar, which has been acting as a mediator, since the collapse of a seven-day ceasefire in late November. Combat has intensified in the past two weeks since the truce, which had allowed dozens of Israeli hostages held in Gaza to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Israeli targets across Gaza on Saturday included a crowded YMCA building, and Palestinian health officials reported dozens killed or wounded in attacks, despite a renewed U.S call to scale down the campaign and focus on Hamas leaders. The YMCA has been sheltering hundreds of displaced people. Two Christian women who had taken refuge in a church complex were shot dead by an Israeli soldier, Roman Catholic Church authorities said. Seven other people were shot and wounded. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. In Khan Younis in Gazas south, Palestinian health officials said the Nasser Hospital had received 20 Palestinians killed in air strikes, in addition to dozens of wounded, including women and children. The Israeli military said it was operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least three dozen people had been killed in strikes on three houses in the Jabalia refugee camp, which health officials were unable to confirm. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had bombed a building in Jabalia from the air after its forces came under fire and Hamas militants were seen on the roof. At nightfall on Saturday, residents reported intensified fighting in the centre of Khan Younis, with Israeli planes and tanks bombing and shelling and the sound of rocket grenades, apparently fired by Hamas fighters. U.S. URGES ISRAEL TO NARROW ITS CAMPAIGN U.S. President Joe Bidens national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has urged Israel to scale down its Gaza campaign and transition to more narrowly targeted operations against Hamas leaders, U.S. officials said. With Israeli officials publicly emphasising they would continue the war until they eradicate Hamas, Washington appeared to acknowledge disagreement. Sullivan said the timing was under intensive discussion between the allies. The three hostages were killed in an area of intense combat where Hamas militants operate in civilian attire and use deception tactics, the Israeli official said, but the hostages were fired upon against Israels rules of engagement. Israel, which said it recovered the bodies of three other hostages killed by Hamas, believes around 20 of more than 130 hostages still held in Gaza are dead. The Israeli military also said it had killed militants holed up in two school buildings in Gaza City, and raided apartments in Khan Younis stocked with weapons, uncovering what it described as underground infrastructure used by Hamas. Every day the situation gets worse. Food gets less, water gets worse; only death, fear and destruction get greater, said Samira, 40, a mother of four, who is displaced in Rafah, near the southern border with Egypt. In signs of the wider ramifications of the conflict, Yemens Iranian-backed Houthis said they had attacked the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat with a swarm of drones, one of several drone incidents reported in the region on Saturday. Two major freight firms said they would avoid the Suez Canal as the Houthis stepped up attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The U.S. Central Command said the destroyer Carney had shot down 14 Houthi drones in the Red Sea. Britain also said one of its warships had shot down a suspected attack drone targeting merchant shipping. Source: REUTERS --Agencies",

        "date": "December 17, 2023 03:28 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged the relevant authorities to promptly address the issue of unauthorized constructions in the Ohia area, spanning from Boralanda to Horton Plains. Noting the significant environmental degradation resulting from these illicit structures, the President emphasized the need for immediate intervention to avert potential serious consequences in the future. President Wickremesinghe conveyed these directives during his participation in the Special District Coordination Committee (DCC) meeting in Badulla District, convened at the Auditorium of the Uva Provincial Library yesterday (16). Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed officials to communicate in writing with relevant institutions when approving building plans within the district. During the meeting, the President sought updates on the disaster relief program for those affected in Badulla district. He instructed officials to provide a comprehensive report on areas susceptible to future disasters. The meeting also addressed challenges in resettling displaced individuals and the legal release of land from estate companies. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for prompt discussions with plantation companies to overcome obstacles. In attendance were political authorities of Badulla district along with government officials. The extensive discussion covered various issues in education, health, highways, and transportation within the district. The President took proactive measures to address and resolve some of the identified challenges. Additionally, discussions covered the development plans slated for implementation in the Badulla district in 2024. President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the vision for a decentralized budget for districts starting next year. This approach aims to prioritize the districts development needs by consolidating funds from the Upcountry development program, ministry allocations, provincial council disbursements, and foreign aid projects. The President anticipates commencing these initiatives by July of the upcoming year. In further remarks, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to all participants for their engagement in the discussion, despite it being on a Saturday. He highlighted the stagnation in the countrys development over the past three years, citing halted projects, including highway construction. With the successful collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), development projects are set to recommence systematically. Acknowledgment from creditors, including the Paris Organization, India and China, has paved the way for renewed discussions and foreign aid. The President expects to provide updates on projects slated for immediate commencement in the early months of the coming year. The President outlined the financial measures for development, emphasizing the allocation of funds from the 2024 budget. This funding, collected through income tax, is crucial for the countrys developmental needs. The President emphasized the need to initiate projects with dedication, acknowledging that while all projects cannot be launched in a single year, a gradual commencement is anticipated with a focus on prioritized initiatives. Starting from the next fiscal year, the districts will receive a decentralized budget based on the available number of seats. Additionally, the Upcountry program, aimed at supporting isolated mountain villages, has commenced, with each divisional secretariat receiving 10 million. Plans are in place to incrementally increase this support. Financial allocations to provincial councils will contribute to the overall funding available to each district. Capital expenditure at the ministry level, along with foreign aid-supported projects, will be integrated into the funding structure. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that this comprehensive approach, combining resources from various channels, aims to commence the work by July 2024. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed plans to establish committees at the provincial level, collaborating with district development committees. These committees, comprising district chairpersons, members and officers, will oversee development activities in their respective divisional secretariats. Provincial Council projects will be initiated through the Governor, while Central Government projects will be managed by relevant institutions. In addition, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the initiation of the agriculture modernization program, with active participation from the private sector. A designated individual will be appointed to collaborate between the Ministry of Agriculture and the private sector. Furthermore, the transformation of Agrarian Services centres into modernization centres is in the pipeline. A significant initiative planned for February involves the commencement of a program to grant freehold deeds to individuals holding licenses under the Land Development Ordinance. The President anticipates substantial progress through these strategic measures. During the discussion, the President addressed various issues, and here are some key concerns raised along with his responses: Question: Attention has been drawn several times to the need for an increase in the compensation provided for houses and buildings affected by calamities. Mr. President, is there any course of action that can be taken in this regard? Answer: There are issues related to increasing the compensation amount. Although it may not be feasible next year, I believe it can be increased in the next few years. However, we need a new plan. Another point that should be emphasized is: Who approves these housing plans? If this continues, action will be taken against both the Municipal Council and the officer responsible. In the event of these constructions collapsing, the municipality will bear the financial burden. If plans are approved for construction, the related criteria should be provided in writing and acted upon accordingly. Such activities should not be allowed to proceed arbitrarily. During my visit to Horton Plains, I observed several Guest Houses built above the Ohia, near the river. If all of them draw water from the stream, it will deplete the water supply. Therefore, I request that no construction be allowed in the Ohia area until we discuss and inform. If this situation persists, high-level tourists will avoid coming to these areas. Additionally, another consequence is that the city and the area below will suffer from a lack of water taken from the river. Hence, I request not to permit construction in the area above Boralanda. In the Blackpool area as well, the region has been adversely affected by such informal constructions Question: The problems faced by the people of Badulla due to the Uma Oya project have not yet been resolved. Mr. President, we request your intervention in this matter. Answer: A comprehensive analysis of the impact of the Uma Oya project on the Badulla district is essential. The Uma Oya project was initiated during President Premadasas tenure, but due to numerous issues, it was rejected. Uma Oya proposed redirecting the Mahaweli as per the plan, leading to various problems associated with the tunnel. To address these issues comprehensively, as mentioned earlier, a thorough analysis of the Badulla district is required. Question: We urgently request the expedited repair of the internal roads and drainage system in the Dikarawa area, which has been damaged by the Uma Oya project. Answer: Regrettably, due to the economic crisis faced by the country, the I Road project had to be halted. However, we are now prepared to resume the project. Consequently, we anticipate discussions on such projects and the commencement of related work. Ministers Nimal Siripalada Silva, Harin Fernando, State Ministers Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Aravinda Kumar, Uva Provincial Governor A.J.M. Muzammil, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Badulla District Coordination Committee Major Sudarshan Denipitiya, Senior Advisor to the President and Member of Parliament Vadivel Suresh, Chairman of the Uva Provincial Council A.M. Buddhadasa, along with political representatives from the district, including Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake and Badulla District Secretary Panduka Sri Prabhat Abeywardena, were also present at this occasion. --PMD--",

        "date": "December 17, 2023 04:46 pm",
        "content": "Sixty-one migrants, including women and children, drowned following a shipwreck off Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Libya said. IOM, in a post on social media platform X, quoted survivors as saying the boat, carrying around 86 people, departed the Libyan city of Zwara, about 110 km (68 miles) from the capital, Tripoli. The central Mediterranean continues to be one of the worlds most dangerous migration routes, IOM said. Deadly incidents this year included one in June, when a fishing boat packed with hundreds of migrants sank off Greece after departing from Tobruk, Libya. The voyage, which was supposed to end in Italy, resulted in 78 recorded deaths with the fate of 518 others unknown, according to an IOM report. Drowning was the main cause of death on migration routes globally in the first half of 2023, with 2,200 recorded fatalities in the period, according to the IOM report. The central Mediterranean route was the deadliest, accounting for a total of 1,727 deaths and disappearances along its shores in the period, the IOM report said. The majority of the deaths were recorded in Tunisia, followed by Libya, it said. The figures remain an undercount, IOM said in its report. Sea migrant arrivals to Italy have almost doubled in 2023 compared with the same period last year, with around 140,000 people coming ashore so far. Some 91 came from Tunisia, with the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa bearing the brunt of landings. The European Union and Tunisia signed a strategic partnership deal in July that includes combating human traffickers and tightening sea borders during a sharp increase in boats leaving the North African nation for Europe. Britain and Italy announced plans on Saturday to jointly finance the journey home for migrants stranded in Tunisia, according to statements from both countries, but did not say how much would money was being provided.

        "content": "In a momentous event held at the Presidents House in Kandy today (17), the final draft of the Greater Kandy Comprehensive Urban Plan was unveiled and presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This visionary plan, aimed at transforming Kandy into a well-planned, organized and developed city. In the course of the discussion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized his commitment to engage in consultations with JICA to expedite pertinent development activities, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The journey towards this ground-breaking urban transformation initiative began in February 2023 when President Wickremesinghe submitted a proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers, emphasizing the need to elevate Kandy into a modern city with improved infrastructure facilities and services. Recognizing the significance of this endeavour, the Cabinet of Ministers gave its approval for the establishment of a Special Committee tasked with crafting a Comprehensive Development Plan for the Katugasthota, Kandy and Kundasale areas. Under the capable leadership of the Secretary to the Prime Minister Mr. Anura Dissanayake, a committee comprising key stakeholders and experts was formed and tasked with the responsibility of crafting a Comprehensive Development Plan. The development plan, initially discussed with Ministers representing the Kandy district, including the Governor of the Central Province, has undergone additional scrutiny, incorporating feedback and suggestions. The final draft, meticulously prepared by the Urban Development Authority, was officially presented to the President today The development plan underwent thorough review, with the President emphasizing the imperative to execute development initiatives that concurrently uphold the historical and cultural heritage of Kandy city while prioritizing the enhancement of public infrastructure Additionally, the President revealed plans to allocate certain universities to be established in the country to the city of Kandy, envisioning its transformation into a future educational hub State Minister Dilum Amunugama, Central Province Governor Lalith U.

        "title": "Sri Lankan workers plug gap in Israeli labor force",
        "date": "December 17, 2023 10:27 pm",
        "content": "One of the consequences of the war has been a lack of manpower in Israel. The agriculture and construction sectors have been particularly hard-hit since work permits were withdrawn from Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. This situation has been compounded by the loss of foreign workers, including thousands of Thai nationals, many of whom have returned home. Sir Lankan Ambassador to Israel Nimal Bandara said he has been working tirelessly with the Israeli and Sri Lankan governments to find a solution to the problem. Bandara said he was devastated by the Hamas atrocities on October 7. Two Sri Lankan caregivers, Anula Ratnayaka, 49, and Sujith Yatawara, 48, both of whom lived and worked on Kibbutz Beeri, were murdered in the attacks, leaving the Sri Lankan community here and in the homeland shaken to its core, he said. Bandara said he immediately took action, identifying their bodies and arranging for their repatriation. He also encouraged Sri Lankan citizens in Israel to remain here and help with the war effort by donating blood and volunteering on farms. None of them returned home, he said, adding that they stayed to help wherever possible. Recognizing that the lack of manpower was a significant problem, Bandara said he met with Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Avi Ditcher, Director-General Oren Lavi, and Senior Deputy Director-General Yakov Poleg to discuss how Sri Lankan workers could help. They agreed on a plan of action, he said. Thousands of work permits being issued to Sri Lankans With a significant number of vacancies, thousands of permits are being issued to Sri Lankans for this project, which is being administered government to government, with no private-sector involvement, Bandara said. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment is interviewing and choosing applicants in Sri Lanka, representatives of the Sri Lankan embassy said. Sri Lankans who are selected will start to arrive in small numbers over the next few weeks, depending on flight availability. They will have to cover the cost of their flights, which the bureau will arrange on their behalf. The Sri Lankan embassy in Israel and the Population and Immigration Authority will coordinate the project in Israel. Upon arrival, most of the Sri Lankans will work in the agriculture and construction sectors. A smaller number will work as caregivers alongside the Sri Lankans who already live and work in Israel in this field. While for many years, Sri Lankans have been an integral part of the caregiving community in Israel, the new arrangement will see their role expand among the workforce. Bandara anticipates that this will be beneficial for both countries. Not only will Israel be able to service its construction and agriculture sectors, thereby boosting its economy, but the Sri Lankan economy will receive a considerable boost through the workers who send money home to their families, he said. This strengthening of ties between the two countries, both of which can expect to see economic growth as a result, has been a welcome development in an otherwise bleak period, Bandara said.

        "title": "President urges political leaders to act responsibly over IMF program",
        "date": "December 18, 2023 08:08 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged all political leaders to exhibit responsibility in their approach to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and cautioned against engaging in rhetoric merely for public appeasement without shouldering responsibilities. He emphasized that those opposing the program should provide concrete proposals to rescue the country from financial crisis, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The President cautioned against engaging in rhetoric merely for public appeasement without shouldering responsibilities, noting that such political tactics could lead the nation back into economic turmoil. The President underscored that, despite facing blame and acknowledging the challenge of making tough decisions, individuals resorting to popular statements exhibit an unwillingness to take necessary measures. Emphasizing the absence of alternative options to salvage the countrys economy, he reiterated the initiation of the program with the IMF. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while participating in the inauguration of the Karaliya Convention Centre and Performing Arts at Kandy Municipality on Sunday (17). The construction of the Karaliya Convention Centre and Performing Arts by the Kandy Municipal Council commenced in 2018, with an expenditure of nearly Rs. 600 million from the Municipal Council Fund. The establishment of this conference and performing arts centre aims to address the citys infrastructure gap by providing auditorium facilities and creating exhibition halls for art and sculpture. The President inaugurated the building complex by unveiling the commemorative plaque. President Ranil Wickremesinghe awarded certificates of appreciation to individuals and businesses for their outstanding contributions to the Pivithuru Dorakada business contribution program and the city beautification program. These initiatives were collaboratively implemented by the Urban Development Authority and the Kandy Municipality under the Kandy Formal City Development Program, aiming to enhance and preserve the distinctive features of the world heritage buildings in the city of Kandy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the gathering, emphasized that the construction of the new Karaliya Convention Centre signifies a modern architectural model for the city of Kandy in the 21st century. Highlighting the cultural significance of such structures, he expressed that the city, deeply rooted in history, plays a crucial role in the cultural and tourism industries of the country. The newly established centre has the capacity to host conferences and events, thereby elevating the significance of Kandy city. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed the intention to enhance Kandys cultural infrastructure by introducing a modern library. Plans are underway to construct a three or four-story library building as part of the Bogambara program. The relocation of the D.S. Senanayake Library to this new facility is expected, enabling the integration of the library with the theatre building. This transformation aims to create a facility comparable to the Bandaranaike Conference Hall. President Wickremesinghe expressed plans to initiate the Kandy development program in the coming year. Additionally, a multimodal transport centre is slated to commence construction next year in Kandy. The President emphasized the need for upgrading infrastructure on Gopallawa Mawatha, advocating for the replacement of single-story houses with at least three-storied structures. These endeavours are projected to be completed within the next five years. A modern Kandy city is set to take shape, with the commencement of the first phase scheduled for the upcoming month. Although previously initiated, progress on these projects had been impeded by the economic crisis afflicting the nation. The President highlighted that the stagnation resulting from the countrys financial distress had obstructed the momentum of crucial development initiatives. Following the countrys descent into bankruptcy, the administration had to engage with two distinct groups. Several nations extended loans, including India, China, Japan and entities associated with the Paris Club. While India and other organizations participated in discussions within the framework of the Paris Club concerning these loans, separate negotiations were held with China. The President highlighted that, akin to Sri Lanka, other nations grappling with bankruptcy also confronted similarly challenging circumstances. Divided into three distinct groupsIndia on one side, the Paris Club on the other and China forming the thirdthe government initiated dialogues with each, facilitated by the Lazard team. The negotiations adhered to the terms set forth by the IMF. In a significant milestone, the administration successfully secured the initial agreement with the IMF and devised a debt restructuring plan that garnered acceptance from India, China and the Paris Club. Consequently, the first instalment of the loan, as stipulated by the IMF, has been received. Engaging in a series of diplomatic dialogues, President Ranil Wickremesinghe held discussions with the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States. Following this, deliberations were conducted with the President, Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Japan. Subsequently, meetings were held with the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister of India. A visit to China ensued, during which discussions were conducted with the President and Finance Minister of China. Negotiations were held with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which serves as an aid organization. However, there is a notable absence of similar aid organizations in China. Despite this, negotiations were successfully conducted with Chinas Exim Bank, culminating in the challenging acquisition of the loan agreement. Examining the situation in Zambia, it is evident that they remain entangled in a predicament. The absence of consensus on credit review has emerged as a significant impediment for them. The President further said: Our next step involves heading to London to engage in negotiations with private creditors. Successfully emerging from bankruptcy has paved the way for us to regain access to credit, facilitating the commencement of development initiatives in the near future. The upcoming year will witness a surge in development projects, marking a significant milestone achieved through agreements pertaining to loans from the IMF and other nations. We find ourselves in the position of demonstrating a minimum income to meet our countrys debt obligations. Despite the challenges, we have committed to moving forward. Our primary objective is to increase the GDP by 10.4, a target initially. The target set for 2024 may not be achievable; however, there is an expectation to reach this goal by 2025 or 2026. Recognizing the need for flexibility, we engaged in negotiations with the IMF to revise the target to 9.2 for 2024. Although they indicated reluctance to further adjustments, our determination is unwavering and we are poised to achieve this revised goal. If you were in my position, facing the dilemma of extending the timeline or achieving these goals by 2024, what would you choose? I firmly asserted that expediting these accomplishments is the priority. Meeting the 2024 goal will leave us with a deficit of 534 billion in our incomea challenge we are steadfastly working to address. The shortage we face is partly attributed to the Aswasuma project. We invested 61 billion in Samurdhi, but an allocation of 207 billion has been earmarked for Aswasuma relief, specifically for the underprivileged citizens of our nation. Additionally, the augmentation of government employee salaries required an allocation of another Rs. 133 billion. It is essential to recognize that the 534 billion deficits is a result of vital investments. For three years, the countrys economy suffered a collapse without adequate capital expenditure, necessitating the infusion of funds into these crucial areas. The IMF suggested that we should increase taxes. This presents an unbearable situation. While raising taxes may lead to a decrease in popularity, rescuing the economy is paramount to eliminating bankruptcy. Although there were options to increase various taxes, such as fuel taxes, it was recognized that such measures would have widespread repercussions across multiple sectors. When accounting for the cascading impact on electricity charges, the cumulative effect of raising the fuel tax becomes significantly more burdensome. So we focused only on value Added Tax (VAT). The VAT, which was 15, was increased to 18. Also, VAT was charged on those that were not currently VAT charged. In other countries, VAT is charged on all of them. Also, in India, the VAT rate is up to 23 while Pakistan up to 18. Their per capita income is lower than ours. Hence, I made the difficult decision within the Cabinet. The Cabinet comprises individuals who will be seeking re-election in the next election and it is widely acknowledged that none of them favour tax increases. However, we realized that there was no alternative. The government is steadfast in its commitment to pulling the country out of bankruptcy by 2024. Consequently, although met with reluctance, everyone in the Cabinet ultimately agreed, recognizing that overcoming bankruptcy is essential for the progress of our nation. Furthermore, what is our alternative? One option is to refrain from spending, but I find that impractical. I challenged others to propose an alternative, but no one has come forward with a viable solution. Some experts and politicians suggest renegotiating with the IMF. However, this is a misleading proposition. The IMF is not a singular entity. We engaged in discussions with numerous countries, meeting with their leaders. Altering the terms now would mean our country must repay the debt anew. I am not in favour of such a scenario. It is crucial to ask the people if they are willing to return to bankruptcy or not. Those opposing this should articulate alternative solutions if the program with the IMF is rejected. It is imperative to declare how we can generate revenue and navigate our way out of bankruptcy. This reflects a significant weakness in our political landscapeunwillingness to take responsibility and make challenging decisions. Mere attempts to please without contemplating the source of funds wont suffice. This lack of foresight was evident last May when no one stepped up to shoulder the responsibility. Hence, I urge all political leaders to act responsibly in this matter. Central Province Governor Mr. Lalit U. Gamage expressed gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for inaugurating this theatre building in the heart of the historic city of Kandy. He also extended appreciation to former Mayor Mr. Kesara Senanayake and the councillor group for their valuable contributions to the welfare of future generations of artists. Notably, this theatre was erected following the unfortunate incident of the D S Senanayake library being destroyed by fire. The event was attended by State Minister Mr. Dilum Amunugama, Members of Parliament Mr. Rauf Hakeem, Mr. A.H.M. Halim, Mr. M. Velukumar, former Chief Minister of Central Provincial Council Mr. Sarath Ekanayake, former Mayor of Kandy Metropolitan Council Mr. Kesara Senanayake, Central Provincial Chief Secretary Mr. Ajith Premasinghe, Kandy District Secretary Mr. Chandana Thennakoon, Municipal Commissioner of Kandy Metropolitan Council Mr. Ishan Wijethilaka and an invited group. --PMD",

        "title": "Israel uncovers biggest Hamas tunnel near Gaza border",
        "date": "December 18, 2023 08:20 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Israeli forces battling Hamas said they had uncovered an unusually large concrete and iron-girded tunnel, designed to carry carloads of militant fighters from Gaza right up to the border. Razing or disabling hundreds of kilometres of underground passages and bunkers is among the aims of the offensive Israel launched after Hamas gunmen went on a killing and kidnapping spree in its southern towns and army bases on Oct. 7. Among sites that Hamas overran in that attack was the Erez border crossing between Gaza and Israel. Just 100 metres (yards) south of the checkpoint, concealed in a sand dune, the military showed reporters the exit point of what it said was a flagship Hamas project. The tunnel ran down diagonally to a depth of 50 metres, where it expanded to a relatively capacious 3 metres (10 feet) in height and width, with electrical fittings. Chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari put the full length of the tunnel at 4 km (2.5 miles) - enough to reach into northern Gaza City, once the heart of Hamas governance and now a devastated combat zone. It was the biggest tunnel we found in Gaza ... meant to target the (Erez) crossing, Hagari said, without specifying whether it was used by Hamas for the Oct. 7 attack. Millions of dollars were invested in this tunnel. It took years to build this tunnel ... Vehicles could drive through. Hamas did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Israeli account. Generally the tunnels shown to the media by the group, or by the Israeli military after their discovery, have been narrow and low - designed for single-file movement of gunmen on foot. The tunnel shown by Hagari had shafts plunging vertically downward that, he said, suggested it was part of a wider network. The tunnels have been a challenge for Israels engineers, worried that the networks could conceal hostages held by Hamas. That has slowed an offensive whose steep Palestinian civilian toll has alarmed world powers. Hagari showed reporters a video of Mohammed Sinwar, brother of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and himself a senior operative in the group, sitting in the passenger seat of a vehicle that he said was driving inside the tunnel. On Oct. 29, Israels Ynet news site reported that troops killed several gunmen who attacked Erez after accessing the area from a tunnel. Hagaris office did not respond to a query on whether that referred to the tunnel he showed. Source: REUTERS --Agencies",

        "date": "December 18, 2023 10:39 am",
        "content": "Gunmen attacked a Christmas season party early Sunday, killing a dozen people in the town of Salvatierra in Mexicos north-central state of Guanajuato, prosecutors said. State prosecutors also reported that four other people died in a shooting in the city of Salamanca, but did not describe the circumstances of that attack. Local media said the victims in Salvatierra were leaving an event hall following a Christmas party known as a posada when they were gunned down. Guanajuato has been the scene of bloody turf battles between the Jalisco cartel and local gangs backed by the Sinaloa cartel. The state has long had the highest number of homicides in Mexico. Meanwhile, in the Caribbean coast resort of Tulum, three men were shot to death and four people were wounded in an attack at a bar Sunday, authorities said. Quintana Roo state prosecutors said a preliminary investigation indicated the shooting may have been a dispute involving retail drug sales, and for that reason the safety of the public and that of our visitors, was never at risk. But shootouts between local drug gangs in Tulum have killed tourists who were caught in the crossfire in the past. In 2021 in Tulum, two tourists  one a California travel blogger born in India and the other German  were killed while eating at a restaurant. They apparently were caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between rival drug dealers. Early this year, the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert warning travelers to exercise increased situational awareness especially after dark, at Mexicos Caribbean beach resorts like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum.

Biden and First Lady Jill Biden had just left his campaign headquarters when the collision occurred. Jill Biden was also safe following the incident, the witness said. The Bidens had emerged from the Biden-Harris 2024 headquarters in rainy downtown Wilmington at 8:07 p.m. (0107 GMT) after having a meal with members of his re-election team at the time of the incident, according to the White House press pool report. Moments after Biden responded to a question from a reporter a silver sedan with Delaware license plates hit what seemed to be a motorcade SUV shielding the motorcade at the intersection across from the entrance of the campaign headquarters, the pool report stated. Television footage showed secret service agents escorting Biden to his car after the impact. The silver sedan, which sustained damage to its bumper, was quickly surrounded by security officers after it stopped. Agents cornered the car and pulled weapons on the driver, who held his hands up. The Bidens returned safely to their home in Wilmington following the incident, the witness said. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 18, 2023 01:02 pm",
        "content": "In a significant move echoing regional cooperation and mutual support, Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana has arrived in Delhi, India. The visit is part of a larger diplomatic engagement designed to strengthen ties between Sri Lanka and India, particularly in light of the recent economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka. As a close neighbor and a significant player in the region, India has demonstrated a deep interest in supporting Sri Lanka during its economic crisis. Strengthening Bilateral Relations The arrival of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana in Delhi is anticipated to facilitate further discussions and collaborations that could aid in Sri Lankas recovery and foster stronger bilateral relations. The specific details of the agenda or meetings which Speaker Abeywardana will attend have not been disclosed, but such visits typically involve discussions on mutual interests, economic cooperation, and regional stability. India-Sri Lanka Economic Interdependence Recent data from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shows a shift in the financial landscape of the country. Credit to the Government of Sri Lanka and public corporations has overshadowed credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month, a trend last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989. This trend has been consistent since August 2021, highlighting the economic challenges that Sri Lanka is facing. Indias role in this scenario is significant. As part of its international trade policy, India has been investing millions of dollars to develop strategically positioned island chains, including Sri Lanka. The aim is to export threefold as much goods and services by 2030. The economic interdependence between India and Sri Lanka is clear, given the financial and humanitarian aid amounting to nearly USD 4 billion that India has extended to help Sri Lanka recover from its economic crisis. Indian Diplomacy Amid Challenges Simultaneously, India is navigating complex diplomatic waters. Despite allegations of plotting to murder pro-Khalistan elements in the United States and Canada, Indias external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, has made it clear that these issues are separate and India is willing to look into specific issues raised by other countries. This includes the ongoing probe into an alleged plot to kill Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Sing Pannun and Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. These allegations have strained diplomatic relations between India, the US, and Canada, but military cooperation between India and Canada remains unaffected. Indias diplomatic relations with its neighbors, including Sri Lanka, are a testament to its commitment to cooperation and stability in the region. This, along with the desire for better relations with China despite challenges, highlights Indias strategic approach towards diplomacy in the region. Source: BNN --Agencies",

        "content": "The Attorney General has raised preliminary objections before the Court of Appeal requesting to dismiss the petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando, seeking a ruling to invalidate the order issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate to remand him in custody. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal announced that the decision pertaining to the relevant preliminary objections will be delivered on Wednesday (Dec. 20). The objections were raised by Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, when the petition was taken up before the court today (18). On December 01, the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court ordered that the accused who had stirred controversy over his controversial remarks on several religions to be remanded in custody, after he was produced before the court following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the CID premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day. He found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Fernando then flew out to Singapore on 14 May, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29. He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. As per a court directive, the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",

        "date": "December 18, 2023 05:53 pm",
        "content": "Eight terrorists linked to an Islamic State module in Karnatakas Ballari have been arrested and plans to trigger IED blasts foiled, the National Investigation Agency said Monday after raids this morning in 19 locations across four states, including Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra and Delhi. Caches of explosive materials, such as sulphur, potassium nitrate, and gunpowder, as well as weapons and documents with details of proposed strikes have been recovered, the anti-terror agency said. The NIA also recovered sharp-edged weapons like daggers, cash, and digital devices. The leader of the Ballari module - Minaz, also known as Mohammed Sulaiman - is among those who were arrested in these ops, which were carried out by the NIA and police in Karnatakas Ballari and Bengaluru, in Pune and Mumbai in Maharashtra, and Delhi, as well as Jharkhands Bokaro. The terrorists, who used IM apps to communicate with each other, planned to use the explosive materials to create IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, to carry out, as yet unspecified, terror acts. They reportedly also targeted college students to radicalise and recruit. The NIA case against the Ballari module was filed last week. Since then, the agency has been working closely with state police and other central agencies to track down and apprehend the terrorists. Last week, the NIA raided over 40 locations in Maharashtra and arrested 15 people, one of whom was the leader of a module, and was administering an oath of allegiance to new recruits. There were also raids in Bengaluru in a related case - one linked to radicalisation by a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist The agency also raided locations in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Madhya Pradesh, and recovered an Indian Army uniform, as well as arms and ammunition, cash and jewelry, and other incriminating evidence. It said the arrested suspects were cadres and sympathisers of PLFI (Peoples Liberation Front of India, a banned group), and that they were involved in a conspiracy to commit terrorist activities. The NIA said its probe revealed PLFI cadres were extorting money from coal traders and other businessmen in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha to finance their terror activities.

        "date": "December 18, 2023 07:04 pm",
        "content": "A growing number of companies, including BP, have paused shipments through the Red Sea after recent attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels. The oil giant revealed on Monday that it had temporarily stopped its operations via the Suez Canal. The safety and security of our people and those working on our behalf is BPs priority, the company said. In light of the deteriorating security situation for shipping in the Red Sea, BP has decided to temporarily pause all transits through the Red Sea. BP followed in the footsteps of shipping giants Maersk, Swiss-based MSC and French group CMA CGM in avoiding the area. Evergreen also confirmed that it had temporarily suspended import and export services in Israel until further notice, citing the security risk. We ask for your understanding under these serious circumstances, the container ship firm told its clients. Journeys through the Suez Canal started to be paused on Friday following attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. The group, which supports Hamas in its war with Israel, has vowed to target vessels which it believes are heading to and from Israel. It emerged on Saturday that Royal Navy warship HMS Diamond, sent to the region two weeks ago, had shot down a drone in the Red Sea that was deemed a threat. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said then that attacks on commercial ships in the global trade artery represented a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. The UK remains committed to repelling these attacks to protect the free flow of global trade, he said in a statement. The Houthis have launched a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as well as launching drones and missiles targeting Israel. Earlier this month, three commercial ships were struck by ballistic missiles and a US warship shot down a further three drones. The Suez Canal is a key route for global trade, particularly for the transport of oil, grain and consumer goods from east Asia. The prospect of longer journeys to complete deliveries is raising transit costs, albeit from record low levels, and boosting the share prices of listed shipping firms as a result. The disruption has also been blamed for a rise in global oil prices, with Brent crude oil up by more than 1 on Monday to stand at 77 per barrel. Source - Sky News --Agencies",
