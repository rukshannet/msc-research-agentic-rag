Last week, the Sri Lankan Navy held two Indian trawlers with 15 Indian fishermen aboard while three Indian trawlers with 12 fishermen aboard were apprehended near the Delft and Kachchativu Islands, local officials here said. Consular officials of CGJaffna provided material  legal assistance to Fifteen Indian fishermen detained today in Jaffna District. Consular officials sought the welfare of fishermen  facilitated phone calls to their family in India, the Consulate General of India in Jaffna said in a post on X on Monday. On Sunday, the Consular officials provided material and legal assistance to 12 fishermen detained in Jaffna district, the Indian mission said. In a separate post, the mission said that the Consular officials sought the welfare of fishermen and facilitated phone calls to their families in India. On Monday, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin asked the central government to take immediate steps to get the Indian fishermen freed and secure the release of fishing vessels. The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with the Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankans territorial waters. The Palk Strait, which is a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. There have been periodic instances of Indian fishermen being apprehended by Sri Lankan authorities for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and fishing in Sri Lankan waters.

        "title": "At least 500 killed in Israeli air strike on Gaza hospital, local officials say",
        "date": "October 18, 2023 12:02 am",
        "content": "An Israeli air strike on Tuesday killed about 500 Palestinians at a Gaza City hospital crammed with patients and displaced people, health authorities in the besieged enclave said. The strike was the bloodiest single incident in Gaza since Israel launched an unrelenting bombing campaign against the densely populated territory in retaliation for a deadly cross-border Hamas assault on southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7. It took place on the eve of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden to Israel to show support for the country in its war with Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip. Arab countries, Iran and Turkey swiftly condemned the attack. The Palestinian prime minister called it a horrific crime, genocide and said countries backing Israel also bore responsibility. Sources at the Gaza Ministry of Health told Reuters that around 500 Palestinians were killed in the air strike on Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital. Hamas said the bombing mostly killed people left homeless by Israel bombardments, and that the dead included patients, women and children. There are scores of dismembered and crushed bodies, baths of blood, said Izzat El-Reshiq, a senior Hamas member. Video obtained by Reuters showed several full ambulances arriving at another Gaza hospital carrying people injured at Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital. One man was staggering, bleeding heavily from the head. A boy was being carried on a stretcher. The Israeli military said it did not have any details about the reported bombing, but was checking. It has previously accused Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields. In Washington, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports about the hospital being hit but had no details. The Pentagon, which has sent five C-17 aircraft with military assistance to Israel so far, reiterated that there were no preconditions on the aid being provided and added: We expect all democracies like Israel to uphold the law of war. Earlier on Tuesday, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said an Israeli air strike had killed at least six people at one of its schools that has been functioning as a shelter for displaced people. This is outrageous and again it shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians, UNRWA said in a social media post. No place is safe in Gaza anymore, not even U.N. facilities. Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 people have been killed in Israels 11-day bombardment since Hamas militants rampaged into Israeli towns and kibbutzes on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,300 people, mainly civilians. Israel has flattened parts of heavily urbanised Gaza with air strikes, driven around half of its 2.3 million population from their homes and imposed a total blockade on the enclave, halting food, fuel and medical supplies. Amid the death and destruction, the humanitarian crisis in the enclave worsened as Israeli troops and tanks massed on the border for an expected ground invasion. Scores of trucks carrying vital supplies for Gaza headed towards the Rafah crossing in Egypt on Tuesday, the only access point to the coastal enclave outside Israeli control, but there was no clear indication that they would be able to enter.

        "date": "October 18, 2023 09:44 am",
        "content": "State Minister of Trade S. Viyalanderan, says Tamil political leaders should collaborate with President Ranil Wickremesinghes flexible approach to achieve national unity and address the challenges faced by the Tamil population. Addressing the press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (Oct. 17) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country, the lawmaker emphasized that the economic difficulties experienced by the people in the recent past have begun to ease off. He stressed the importance of everyone rallying behind the continuous and effective advancement of President Wickremesinghe-led governments program aimed at a complete economic recovery for the nation. State Minister Viyalanderan further elaborated: The country is gradually emerging from its economic downturn, but the process is not yet complete. We cannot claim that the financial burden on the people has been entirely lifted. However, considerable progress has been made in mitigating the hardships faced by the people during the preceding economic crisis. Further measures are required to alleviate these hardships. Relevant ministries, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, are diligently working towards this objective. The effort must be on-going and highly efficient, requiring collective engagement. As the Minister of State overseeing this matter, it is our responsibility to further reduce the prices of essential commodities in the country. The escalation in the cost of essential goods directly impacts the everyday lives of the people in our country. Thus, it is imperative to lower the prices of commodities to meet the publics expectations. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Commerce is taking decisive steps to ensure the availability of essential goods at affordable prices. Despite price reductions in many essential goods, certain traders have yet to adjust their pricing. Some items continue to be sold at higher rates. Consequently, we have instructed the officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority to initiate legal action against those responsible. In addition to economic challenges, we are actively working to find resolutions to the ethnic issues and foster national harmony. In this context, President Wickremesinghe has convened multiple rounds of discussions with members of both the ruling and opposition parties, both inside and outside parliament, to deliberate on matters such as the 13th Amendment and related topics. These discussions are on-going, with diverse opinions being voiced. However, our commitment remains to meet the expectations of the people. It is worth noting that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a Tamil person as the Governor of the Eastern Province for the first time. We express gratitude to the President for this significant step. The current President is particularly dedicated to addressing the concerns of the Tamil community and President Wickremesinghes flexibility provides an opportunity for Tamil leaders to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve our issues. This should be regarded as their shared responsibility. We must actively involve Tamil leaders and civil society activists in discussions concerning our challenges. This process must be expedited. It is essential to acknowledge that, within the brief period available, we have initiated numerous projects. Furthermore, we will continue implementing development initiatives, including road construction, bridge projects and improvements in agriculture and fisheries, as well as enhancing the livelihoods of our citizens. Measures have also been taken to combat unauthorized sand mining in the Eastern Province, with a focus on environmental preservation and resource conservation.",

        "title": "Hamas and Israel trade blame after Gaza hospital blast kills hundreds",
        "date": "October 18, 2023 10:22 am",
        "content": "A massive blast rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military blamed a rocket misfired by other Palestinian militants. At least 500 people were killed, the ministry said. As rage spread through the region because of the hospital carnage, and with US President Joe Biden heading to the Mideast in hopes of stopping the war from spreading, Jordans foreign minister said his country canceled a regional summit scheduled for Wednesday in Amman, where Biden was to meet with Jordans King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. The war between Israel and Hamas was pushing the region to the brink, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state-run television. He said Jordan would host the summit only when everyone had agreed its purpose would be to stop the war, respect the humanity of the Palestinians and deliver the aid they deserve. Biden will now visit only Israel, a White House official said. The explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital left gruesome scenes. Video that The Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed fire engulfing the building and the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. The grass around them was strewn with blankets, school backpacks and other belongings. The bloodshed unfolded as the U.S. tried to convince Israel to allow the delivery of supplies to desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals in the tiny Gaza Strip, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas deadly rampage in southern Israel last week. Hundreds of thousands of increasingly desperate people were searching for bread and water. Hamas called Tuesdays hospital blast a horrific massacre, saying it was caused by an Israeli strike. The Israeli military blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often works with Hamas. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital and that intelligence from multiple sources indicated the group was responsible. In a briefing with reporters, the chief army spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army determined there were no air force, ground or naval attacks in the area at the time of the blast. He said radar detected outgoing rocket fire at the same moment, and intercepted communications between militant groups indicated that Islamic Jihad fired the rockets. Hagari also shared aerial footage collected by a military drone that showed a blast that he said was inconsistent with Israeli weaponry. He said the explosion occurred in the buildings parking lot, and he noted that the death toll could not be confirmed. Since the war began, the military said in a statement that roughly 450 rockets fired at Israel by militant groups had landed in Gaza, endangering and harming the lives of Gazan residents. Islamic Jihad dismissed those claims, accusing Israel of trying hard to evade responsibility for the brutal massacre it committed. The group pointed to Israels order that Al-Ahli be evacuated and its previous bombing of the hospital complex as proof that the hospital was an Israeli target. It also said the scale of the explosion, the angle of the bombs fall and the extent of the destruction all pointed to Israel. Hundreds of Palestinians had taken refuge in al-Ahli and other hospitals in Gaza City in past days, hoping they would be spared bombardment after Israel ordered all residents of the city and surrounding areas to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip. Ambulances and private cars rushed some 350 casualties from the al-Ahli blast to Gaza Citys main hospital, al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed with wounded from other strikes, said its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia. The wounded were laid onto bloody floors, screaming in pain. We need equipment, we need medicine, we need beds, we need anesthesia, we need everything, Abu Selmia said. He warned that fuel for the hospitals generators would run out within hours. Before the al-Alhi Hospital deaths, Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and nearly two-thirds of those killed were children. Another 1,200 people across Gaza are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians who were slain in Hamas Oct. 7 attack. The assault also resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza. Hamas militants in Gaza have launched rockets every day since, aiming at cities across Israel. Hundreds of Palestinians flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades. Others threw stones at Israeli checkpoints, where soldiers killed one Palestinian, West Bank authorities said. Elsewhere, hundreds of people joined protests that erupted in Beirut, Iraq and Amman, where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli Embassy. In Amman, a palace statement said Jordans king condemned the ugly massacre perpetrated by Israel against innocent civilians. The king warned that this war, which has entered a dangerous phase, will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster, the statement said. With tens of thousands of troops massed along the border, Israel has been expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza, but its plans remained uncertain. We are preparing for the next stages of war, military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said. We havent said what they will be. Everybodys talking about a ground offensive. It might be something different. Throughout the day Tuesday, airstrikes killed dozens of civilians and at least one senior Hamas figure in the southern half of the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military told fleeing Palestinians to go. An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital after strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts, infrastructure and command centers. An airstrike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble, killing a man and 11 women and children inside and in a neighboring house, some of whom had evacuated from Gaza City. Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike. Shelling from Israeli tanks hit a U.N. school in central Gaza where 4,000 Palestinians had taken refuge, killing six people and wounding dozens, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said. At least 24 U.N. installations have been hit the past week, killing at least 14 members of the agencys staff. A barrage of strikes crashed into the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, leveling an entire block of homes and causing dozens of casualties, residents said. Among those killed was one of Hamas top military commanders, Ayman Nofal, the groups military wing said. He is the highest-profile militant to have been killed in the war. In Gaza City, Israeli airstrikes also hit the house of Hamas top political official, Ismail Haniyeh, killing at least 14 people. Haniyeh is based in Doha, Qatar, but his family lives in Gaza City. The Hamas media office did not immediately identify those killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to put the blame on Hamas for Israels retaliatory attacks and the rising civilian casualties in Gaza. Not only is it targeting and murdering civilians with unprecedented savagery, its hiding behind civilians, he said. With Israel barring entry of most water, fuel and food into Gaza since Hamas brutal attack, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken secured an agreement with Netanyahu to discuss creation of a mechanism for delivering aid to the territorys 2.3 million people. U.S. officials said the gain might appear modest, but stressed that it was a significant step forward. Still, as of late Tuesday, there was no deal in place. A top Israeli official said his country was demanding guarantees that Hamas militants would not seize any aid deliveries. Tzahi Hanegbi, head of Israels National Security Council, suggested entry of aid also depended on the return of hostages held by Hamas. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled their homes  roughly half of Gazas population  and 60 are now in the approximately 14-kilometer (8-mile) long area south of the evacuation zone, the U.N. said. At the Rafah crossing, Gazas only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid have been waiting to enter for more than a day. The World Food Program said it had more than 300 tons of food ready to cross into Gaza. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "A total of 45 petitions have been received by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, challenging the recently introduced Online Safety Bill. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena revealed this in parliament this morning (18 Oct.). The Online Safety Bill was presented before the House by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles on 03 October. The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. Several petitions were filed soon after the Bill was presented in parliament, by numerous parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Socialist Youth Union (SYU), and the General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara, SJBs Rehan Jayawickrama and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L.

        "date": "October 18, 2023 12:47 pm",
        "content": "A new study has suggested that OpenAIs AI chatbot, ChatGPT, may outperform primary care doctors in adhering to recognized treatment standards for clinical depression while avoiding the gender and social class biases sometimes present in doctor-patient relationships. Published in the open-access journal Family Medicine and Community Health, the study reveals that ChatGPT can provide rapid, objective, data-driven insights that complement traditional diagnostic methods, all while maintaining confidentiality and anonymity. The researchers assessed the AI technologys ability to recommend appropriate treatment approaches for mild and severe major depression, examining whether these suggestions were influenced by biases related to gender or social class. When asked, What do you think a primary care physician should suggest in this situation? ChatGPTs responses included watchful waiting, referral for psychotherapy, prescribed drugs (for depressionanxietysleep problems), and referral for psychotherapy plus prescribed drugs. The study found that just over 4 of family doctors recommended referring patients for psychotherapy in mild cases, as per clinical guidelines. In contrast, ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 suggested this option in 95 and 97.5 of cases, respectively. Most physicians recommended either drug treatment exclusively (48) or a combination of psychotherapy and prescribed drugs (32.5). In severe cases, a majority of doctors recommended psychotherapy combined with prescribed drugs (44.5). ChatGPT proposed this treatment plan more frequently than doctors (72 for ChatGPT-3.5 and 100 for ChatGPT-4, in accordance with clinical guidelines). In contrast, 40 of doctors recommended drug treatment exclusively, an approach not endorsed by either ChatGPT version. Additionally, doctors frequently recommended a combination of antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and sleeping pills (67.5 of cases). ChatGPT was more likely than doctors to recommend antidepressants alone, with 74 for version 3.5 and 68 for version 4. ChatGPT-3.5 (26) and ChatGPT-4 (32) also suggested a combination of antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleeping pills. The researchers noted that ChatGPT-4 demonstrated greater precision in aligning treatment with clinical guidelines. Furthermore, no discernible biases related to gender and socioeconomic status were detected in the ChatGPT systems. They concluded that ChatGPT has the potential to enhance decision-making in primary healthcare. This study highlights the potential of AI chatbots like ChatGPT to assist healthcare professionals in providing evidence-based and unbiased treatment recommendations for clinical depression, ultimately improving patient care.

        "title": "President Biden meets with Israeli leaders as he kicks off historic wartime visit",
        "date": "October 18, 2023 03:05 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden arrived in Israel Wednesday for one of the most complicated diplomatic trips of his presidency, an extraordinary high-stakes trip to a region gripped by violence in the aftermath of Hamas attacks and Israels subsequent response. Bidens historic arrival in wartime Tel Aviv Wednesday  the first trip to Israel by an American president during a time of war  marked his most forceful public show of support for Israel since the October 7 attacks by Hamas that left 1,400 of Israelis  and dozens Americans  dead. Other Americans, along with many Israelis, are also being held hostage by Hamas. And at least 3,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said Tuesday. Americans are grieving with you, they really are. And Americans are worried, Biden told Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they began a bilateral meeting, acknowledging the complex dynamic. Because we know this is not an easy field to navigate, what you have to do. Biden said it was important he personally come, suggesting the trip was a critical signal to other democratic nations as the world watches the events unfolding in the Middle East. I wanted the people of Israel  the people of the world  to know where the United States stands.  The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies. And theyre looking to see what were going to do, he told Netanyahu, who called Bidens presence as the first American president in Israel at a time of war deeply, deeply moving. Netanyahu thanked Biden for the unequivocal support and unprecedented cooperation between the two nations. From the moment Israel was attacked, youve rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism, Netanyahu told the president. The trip comes less than a day after a horrifying blast at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian officials have said hundreds are dead following the explosion at the center of the city and blamed Israel. The Israelis denied responsibility and pinned blame on a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Biden expressed outrage at the explosion, but assigned blame to the other team and not Israel. I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what Ive seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But theres a lot of people out there whore not sure. So we have to overcome a lot of things, he said. The president did not elaborate on what evidence led him to that conclusion. The hospital explosion caused a scramble of Bidens plans for the trip as the president walked onto Air Force One. The president was expected to meet King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss a humanitarian response during the Jordan leg of the visit, but the summit  and the Jordan leg of the trip  was scrapped. The White House cited a period of mourning announced by Abbas as the reason for the postponement. Israel has provided the US with intelligence it has gathered related to the deadly explosion, according to an Israeli official and another source familiar with the matter. The US is analyzing it and administration officials have communicated that message to at least some congressional lawmakers, the source familiar said. The explosion led to a last-minute briefing by the presidents top national security advisers and a phone call with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, still traveling in the Middle East, to assess the intelligence available. But no conclusion was drawn about who was behind the blast, CNN has learned, with the president instructing his team to continue evaluating the available information. The explosion and subsequent blame game will hang over Bidens meetings in Israel. He was greeted at the airport by Israeli Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, hugging them on the tarmac before embarking for the meeting site in Tel Aviv. The presence of Biden, who places a premium on personal diplomacy, is meant to show solidarity with the United States closest allies and to deter rogue actors in the region from opening up a second front in the war. The president has been attempting to walk a fine line between supporting Israel and keeping the violence from spiraling into a wider military conflict, a mission made more complicated by the hospital blast. He and other US administration officials have been warning other regional players, namely Iran and its proxy Hezbollah, from expanding the fighting further. Bidens focus will be on managing a complicated situation and less on securing clear deliverables, according to two sources close to the matter  a clear sign that the White House is seeking to manage expectations after the Jordan portion of the trip was scrapped. While violence such as the hospital blast was always seen as a possible risk of the visit, the presidents team concluded that the merits of the trip outweighed those risks. Multiple sources told CNN that the presidents top advisers did not come close on Tuesday to canceling the Israel portion of the trip. Israel readies its next steps The high-stakes diplomacy while on the ground will be closely watched as Israel prepares its latest response to the Hamas attacks. While Biden largely refrained from calling on the Israeli government to use restraint in the days following the attack, he warned the Israelis against occupying Gaza during an interview with CBS News 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan told CNNs Kaitlan Collins earlier this week Israel has no interest in occupying Gaza. Israel has been signaling it is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza, even as a humanitarian crisis grows inside the coastal Palestinian enclave. Biden has called for the protection of civilians, and the United States has been working to alleviate shortages of food, water, and gas. Biden said in the interview he believes that there needs to be a humanitarian corridor to help civilians trapped amid the fighting and that Israel will abide by the rules of war. Im confident that Israel is going to act under the measure  the rules of war, Biden said in the interview. Theres standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And so, Im confident that theres gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water. American officials want humanitarian plans for Gaza fully signed off on and implemented before start of the invasion, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, describing that task as among Bidens main objectives during his visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday. We want to see humanitarian assistance flow in  and its not just a one and done  we want to see it be able to be sustained: food, water, obviously electrical power, medicine, all the things that the people of Gaza are going to continue to need as this conflict continues to go on. So hell make that case very, very clearly, he said. While many Americans feel deep sympathy for Israelis in the wake of the attacks, according to a CNN poll released Sunday, Biden also faces political pressure at home over how he responds to the attacks and how much support he offers Netanyahus government. Americans are split on whether the Israeli governments response to the attacks are fully justified, including just 38 of Democrats, according to CNNs poll. The same poll shows the public is mixed over how much trust it has in Biden to make the right decisions on the fighting between Israel and Hamas  47 have at least a moderate amount of trust. And about half of Democrats are also feeling a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people who are feeling the brunt of Israels response to the attack, the poll shows, which could further complicate Bidens decision-making on how much support to provide the Israelis. Biden deeply affected by the conflict The president and other officials have said the US has no plans to put American boots on the ground at this time. But roughly 2,000 US troops are preparing for a potential deployment to Israel to help with tasks like medical and logistical support, multiple defense officials said. The decision to travel to Israel so soon after the Hamas attack signals just how affected Biden has been by the violence in the region. Advisers to the president told CNN that the days after the attack were a deeply emotional time for him, as he grappled with the second major outbreak of a war during his presidency and as the images and stories of Hamas reprehensive actions poured in. During his trip, Biden will meet with some families impacted by the violence of the past week, including some who have lost loved ones in Israel, and some who still dont know the fate of their loved ones, Kirby said. Some of those family members have loved ones who are being held hostage, though it was not immediately clear whether they are Americans. But despite ongoing discussions with Israel and other partners, sources downplayed the expectation that the visit would result immediately in a refugee deal or the release of American hostages in Hamas custody. The president spoke forcefully throughout the week about his horror at Hamas actions, frequently comparing the violence to some of the things European Jews experienced during the Holocaust. Biden has taken family members on trips to the Dachau concentration camp to learn about horrors of the Holocaust, and he emphasized in the 60 Minutes interview how important it is for the world to learn about past persecution of the Jewish people. The Jews have been subject to abuse, prejudice and attempts to wipe them out for, oh, God, over a thousand years, Biden told interviewer Scott Pelley. For me, its about decency, respect, honor. Its just simply wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It violates every religious principle I have and  every single principle my father taught me. The presidents interactions with his Israeli counterpart will also be closely watched. Biden and Netanyahu have known each other for decades and have relied on that history as they weathered deep strains over the past year related to Netanyahus far-right governing coalition and judicial overhaul plan. Biden believes he knows Netanyahu better than anyone, one official said, and in the past has carefully applied pressure on the Israeli leader to avoid inflaming or escalating conflicts with the Palestinians. Its also the second time the president has visited a nation at war this year, following Februarys surprise trip to Kyiv. While Biden previously made visits to Iraq and Afghanistan during his time as vice president, the trips to Israel and Ukraine posed a unique security challenge without as much US military control of the area.

Rajitha Naveen Christopher Senaratna Perera 6. Ahamed Lebbe Mohamed Saleem 7. Sagarica Delgoda 8. Esther Sriyani Nimalka Fernando 9.

There is a tendency on certain occasions for political parties, independent groups and their membership to engage in unbecoming behaviour in their political and public affairs and in inappropriate media use, a need has arisen to introduce a code of conduct and media standards, it added. Furthermore, it has been mentioned in the gazette notification that due to the registration of political parties without an actual need for the purpose of transference to other parties for financial gains and other improper objectives, as well as certain other activities of political parties, the public trust in such political parties has eroded, and therefore, there is a need to restore trust and accountability by strengthening the legal framework for registration and operation of political parties. The President also states in the relevant gazette notification: I am of the view that it is necessary that a Commission of Inquiry be appointed to investigate, inquire into and report on matters hereinafter referred to. Thereby, the members of the aforesaid commission have been authorized and empowered to hold all inquiries and make all other investigations, into the relevant matters as may appear necessary.

        "date": "October 18, 2023 04:04 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday pledging solidarity in its war against Hamas and backing its account that a blast that killed huge numbers of Palestinians at a Gaza hospital had been caused by militants. The fireball that engulfed the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital delivered some of the most harrowing images yet from a 12-day war, and wrecked White House plans for Bidens emergency diplomatic mission to the Middle East, with Arab leaders calling off their planned summit with the U.S. president. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli air strike for the blast, which it said had killed as many as 500 people. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, which denied blame. Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said: I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what Ive seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But theres a lot of people out there not sure, so weve got a lot, weve got to overcome a lot of things, Biden added. The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies, and they are looking to see what we are going to do. Bidens trip to the Middle East was supposed to calm the region, even as he demonstrated U.S. support for its ally Israel, which has vowed to annihilate the Hamas movement whose fighters killed 1,400 Israelis in a rampage on Oct. 7. But after the hospital blast, Jordan cancelled the second half of Bidens itinerary: a planned summit in Amman with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu thanked Biden for his unequivocal support. President Isaac Herzogs office said the head of state had told Biden: God bless you for protecting the nation of Israel. HELP US, HELP US! The scenes of destruction from the hospital were horrific even by the standards of the past 12 days, which have confronted the world with relentless images, first of Israelis slaughtered in their homes and then of Palestinian families buried under rubble from Israels retaliatory strikes. Rescue workers scoured blood-stained debris for survivors. A Gaza civil defence chief gave a death toll of 300, while health ministry sources put it at 500, though Israel disputed those figures. Palestinian ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said rescuers were still recovering bodies. People came running into the surgery department screaming, Help us, help us, there are people killed and wounded inside the hospital! said Dr Fadel Naim, Head of the hospitals Orthopedic Surgery Department. The hospital was full of dead and wounded, dismembered bodies, and dead, he told Reuters. We tried to save whoever can be saved but the number was too big for the hospital team to be able to save... We saw them alive but we couldnt help them and they were martyred. Israel later released drone footage of the scene of the hospital explosion, which it said showed it was not responsible because there was no impact crater from any missile or bomb. The Israeli military published what it said was an audio recording of communication between terrorists talking about rockets misfiring. Palestinians were convinced the explosion was an Israeli attack, with no warning for civilians to leave a hospital that was being used as a shelter by thousands of Gazans already made homeless by Israeli bombing. This place created a safe haven for women and children, those who escaped the Israeli bombing, another doctor at the hospital, Ibrahim Al-Naqa, told Reuters. We dont know what the shell is called but we saw the results of it when it targeted children and ripped their bodies into pieces. COOL HEADS After Biden backed the Israeli account, other Western leaders also called for caution. Last night, too many jumped to conclusions around the tragic loss of life at Al Ahli hospital, Britains Foreign Secretary James Cleverly posted on X. Getting this wrong would put even more lives at risk. Wait for the facts, report them clearly and accurately. Cool heads must prevail. The blast unleashed new fury on streets across the Middle East, even as Biden sought to calm emotions and prevent the conflict from sweeping across borders. Palestinian security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse anti-government protesters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, one of the Arab leaders who cancelled meeting Biden. The U.S. State Department issued a new warning to Americans not to travel to Lebanon, where border clashes between the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and Israel over the past week have been the deadliest since the last all-out war in 2006. Biden has strongly backed Israel following the Oct. 7 attacks. But he is under intense pressure to win a clear Israeli commitment to alleviate the plight of civilians in the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million Palestinians are under total siege, with no access to food, fuel, water or medical supplies. The Israeli military announced on Wednesday that humanitarian aid would be made available in a humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi on the south of the Gaza Strip coast near the Egyptian border. It did not spell out how aid would get there. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 18, 2023 04:24 pm",
        "content": "The 3rd Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) forum commenced today (18) under the auspices of Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking a significant milestone in international cooperation. During the conference, President Xi Jinping unveiled a set of comprehensive policies, aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative, reflecting its commitment to fostering global partnerships. President Xi Jinping emphasized that the Belt and Road Initiative, founded on principles of peace, mutual support and friendship, serves as a contemporary rendition of the ancient Silk Road. He highlighted that the initiatives benefits extend beyond a single nation, benefiting many countries. The opening ceremony of the 3rd Belt and Road Initiative forum took place at the esteemed Great Hall of the People in Beijing. It witnessed the participation of heads of state from approximately 20 nations and representatives from over 130 countries. In a show of solidarity, President Ranil Wickremesinghe attended the opening ceremony, where leaders from various states were accorded military honours and gathered for a group photograph alongside the Chinese President. President Xi Jinping further stressed that cooperation, rather than competition or suppression, is the bedrock of the Belt and Road concept. He reiterated that goodwill and mutual support among nations lead to positive outcomes for all. Notably, since the inception of the Belt and Road program a decade ago, all participating nations have achieved remarkable milestones and forged new avenues for strengthening economic ties. President Xi Jinping introduced a series of eight key policies that will shape the future of the  Belt and Road initiative. These policies include creating an international multilateral network, supporting a global open economy, practical cooperation strategies, promoting green development, fostering opportunities for science and technology innovation, enhancing interpersonal relations and encouraging unbreakable ties among member countries. President Xi Jinping called upon delegates, including state leaders at the summit, to join together in creating a symphony of friendship in line with the  Belt and Road concept. Notable speakers from various continents included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Argentine President Alberto Fernandez and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that adequate infrastructure and information facilities are essential for future world development and noted the invaluable role of the Belt and Road initiative in meeting these needs. He further highlighted its potential in addressing debt relief challenges faced by developing countries. Accompanying President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the event were Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Sabry, Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Presidential Advisor Mr. Saman Athavudahetti, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief Alliance Officer Mr. Senarath Dissanayake, Head of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Beijing Mr. K.K.

        "content": "Vietnam attaches importance to strengthening traditional friendship and multifaceted cooperation with Sri Lanka, in order to take bilateral relations to new heights, President Vo Van Thuong told his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe today (Oct. 18). Meeting on the sidelines of the ongoing third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, Thuong expressed his belief that under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka would make more socio-economic development achievements. The two presidents acknowledged the positive developments in the cooperative relations between Vietnam and Sri Lanka in recent times, especially in the fields of education-training, religion, and people-to-people exchanges, saying the two sides are now completing legal procedures towards signing an agreement on cooperation and mutual support in customs. To rev up bilateral cooperation, Thuong proposed that the two sides increase cooperation in all fields, effectively deploy existing cooperation mechanisms, and create conditions for their businesses to promote trade and investment cooperation. He also proposed that the two sides foster cooperation in potential fields such as education-training, tourism, culture, religion and people-to-people exchanges, while considering opening direct flights and connecting Buddhist destinations between the two countries to develop spiritual tourism. The two leaders agreed to assign the Foreign Ministers of the two countries to soon convene a meeting of the Vietnam  Sri Lanka Joint Committee to enhance cooperation in all fields, including economy, trade and investment. Wickremesinghe for his part affirmed that Sri Lanka always wants to strengthen relations with Vietnam, a very dynamic developing country that shares many similarities with Sri Lanka. He welcomed Thuongs proposals and said Sri Lanka expects to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement. The two sides vowed to further strengthen cooperation and mutual support at multilateral forums, including the United Nations, ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). On this occasion, Thuong respectfully invited Wickremesinghe to visit Vietnam again soon, and the invitation was accepted with pleasure.

        "date": "October 18, 2023 05:20 pm",
        "content": "A few Tamil MPs from Sri Lanka have written a letter to popular Indian actor Vijay asking him not to release his latest movie on October 19 in the island nation as they are holding a protest on October 20. In the letter, the MPs have claimed that the film will sabotage the protest, which is for the rights of Tamil people in the country. The letter requested Vijay to not release Leo as he is a celebrated star in the country. It also noted that releasing the film would be disrespectful to the Tamil people and the protest. Earlier, a City Civil Court in Hyderabad passed an order stalling the release of Leo in Telugu due to a copyright issue. Despite attempts, permission for early morning shows for Leo in Tamil Nadu has been denied by the Madras High Court. The film will now be released only at 9 am across the state. After Kamal Haasans Virumandi and Viswaroopam, Vijays Leo is one Tamil film plagued by issues ahead of its release. While Kamals Virumandi (first named Sandiyar) faced a problem with the title and Viswaroopam for hurting the sentiments of the Muslim community, Leo is facing many problems at once. It started with political outfits calling out Vijay for glorifying smoking, later Lokesh was criticised for romanticising violence, and finally, release problems crept up. Even as many theatres are yet to strike a deal with distributors, Leo is facing another problem from Sri Lanka. A person belonging to the production house Sithara Entertainments claimed the rights for the title Leo and filed a case in the City Civil Court. However, producer Naga Vamsi of Sithara Entertainment spoke to the media and said that the film will be released as per plan and that the problem has been resolved.

The CIABOC attributed the decision due to the lack of evidence, and therefore stated that no measures will be taken in this regard. The money was found by protesters on the 09 July 2022, when they stormed the official presidential residence during mass anti-government protests. The cash was handed over to the Fort Police by the protesters who were at the presidential residence on that day, which was subsequently handed over to the Fort Magistrates Court three weeks later. Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage, however, ordered the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to conduct an investigation into the delay by the police in handing over the money, stating that there was reasonable doubt as to why the Fort Police OIC delayed the matter.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka is close to reaching a vital staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund to get funding, while its also assessing debt restructuring terms from foreign holders of its dollar bonds, according to State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe. There are discussions on revenue and other clarifications are being made, Semasinghe said Bloomberg on Wednesday. We are confident of reaching a staff level agreement soon. The move will help unlock another tranche of a 3 billion package from the multilateral lender, supporting recovery in the island nation after a default last year. Sri Lanka has been pushing to agree terms for restructuring debt owed to China, India, Paris Club and foreign bondholders to bring indebtedness down to levels the IMF finds acceptable. After concluding domestic debt restructuring and agreeing tentative terms with China Exim bank, the focus is now on how much progress the nation can make in talks with other official creditors, as well as bondholders who submitted a proposal that included a 20 haircut and new macro-linked bonds last week. On the bondholder proposal, Sri Lankas adviser Lazard will look at it and evaluate comparability, said Semasinghe. Discussions with China continue, and our principle will be to be transparent and it will be comparable, while negotiations with the official creditor committee are also ongoing, he said.

        "date": "October 18, 2023 09:05 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the worlds most bio-diverse regions are found in tropical countries and he proposed the launch of a dedicated programme to support these nations in addressing future climate change challenges, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He highlighted that 80 of the worlds endemic plants, as well as 50 of all coral reefs and mangroves are located in tropical regions. Sri Lanka, he noted, is actively working towards the establishment of an international university focused on climate change, capitalizing on this unique ecological context. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the high-level conference Green silk road for harmony with nature held at the China International Conference Hall today (18), in conjunction with the 3rd Belt and Road Initiative International forum, the PMD added. The conference was chaired by Mr. Han Zheng, Vice President of the Peoples Republic of China. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres and leaders from other participating countries also shared their insights. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe elaborated on the establishment of an international university dedicated to climate change which aims to lay the groundwork for conducting relevant research and implementing protective measures to address the pressing global crises of climate change, environmental pollution and biodiversity destruction. President Wickremesinghe strongly advocated for immediate action in these areas. Expressing his views further, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; Through this university, we have set three primary objectives. First and foremost, our focus is on researching measures for collective security and the common good. Secondly, we aim to foster knowledge sharing among the global community. Lastly, we are committed to providing practical education. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, this institution delves into a comprehensive array of strategies across diverse fields, encompassing rigorous research, structural reforms within relevant organizations, international cooperation, community engagement and more. It serves as a valuable source of knowledge, research and solutions aimed at limiting global warming to a level of 1.5 degrees C. In this endeavour, the university assumes a pivotal role in the battle against climate change. One significant challenge impeding global efforts to combat climate change is the widespread economic crises afflicting many countries. These crises have rendered participation in climate change mitigation an exceedingly intricate and daunting task. The most effective approach is for the entire global community to unite and collaboratively seek solutions to this pressing issue. In this context, I would like to propose three key suggestions. Firstly, offering debt relief to low-income countries can significantly alleviate their economic burdens and enable them to actively participate in climate change mitigation efforts. Secondly, providing access to concessional loans for high-income countries can facilitate their engagement in sustainable practices. Lastly, we should consider channelling additional funding through multilateral organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to support climate-related initiatives. Its worth noting that there are 150 tropical countries, with 88 of them participating in the Belt and Road initiative. This tropical region encompasses 40 of the worlds total land area and is home to 40 of the global population. In light of this, I would like to express my gratitude to the Republic of China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, for organizing this conference, recognizing environmental concerns as a fundamental aspect of sustainable development. During the Asia-Pacific Belt and Road High-Level Summit in 2021, Sri Lanka wholeheartedly endorsed the Green Silk Road initiative and our commitment to supporting this initiative remains steadfast.",

        "title": "UN experts say Sri Lankas counter-terrorism bill fails to heed their recommendations",
        "date": "October 18, 2023 10:02 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas new proposed counter-terrorism legislation does not go far enough to remedy the defects of the countrys draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), UN experts said today, urging the Government to ensure the new law meets international human rights standards. For many years, UN experts and multilateral organisations have consistently said that the current Prevention of Terrorism legislation in Sri Lanka is in violation of international law with its vague terminology, its lack of protection for fundamental human rights, and a lack of independent oversight, the experts said. It is deeply regrettable that the proposed legislation does not remedy any of these defects, they said. The proposed counter-terrorism bill is currently under consideration in the Sri Lankan Parliament. It is intended to replace the countrys existing Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has long been plagued by structural elements that enable the perpetration of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and other human rights violations. The experts noted long-standing concerns about the misuse of anti-terrorism legislation and sweeping emergency powers, often used to crackdown on political critics, dissidents and human rights defenders in Sri Lanka. Under the PTA, detainees have been held for decades without trial in the country. The UN experts said they had previously laid out a series of benchmarks for counter-terrorism legislation in Sri Lanka to be human rights compliant. These include employing definitions of terrorism that comply with international norms; ensuring precision and legal certainty, especially when this legislation may impact the rights of freedom of expression, opinion, peaceful assembly, association and religion or belief; instituting robust measures to prevent and halt arbitrary deprivation of liberty; ensuring preventive measures are in place to prevent torture and enforced disappearance and adhere to their absolute prohibition; and enabling overarching due process and fair trial guarantees, including judicial oversight and access to legal counsel. Regrettably, only limited changes have been made to the expansive definition of terrorism contained in the legislation, the experts said. It is worrying to observe new categories of terrorism including acts related to a place of public use rather than the much needed pruning of counter-terrorism powers, they said. They also expressed concerns about the considerable expansion of police powers in the new legislation, with less judicial oversight of intercepting telecommunications. They were dismayed by provisions that weaken the legal basis to arrest individuals suspected of or possibly engaged in, any offence under the legislation. The experts said the legislation fails to provide sufficient powers to magistrates to prevent torture by ensuring all detainees are moved from places of detention as soon as allegations of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment emerge. The counter-terrorism bill also limits the right of access to lawyers for persons charged under the law. This is a highly regressive step and it disregards the long-documented violations of human rights occurring in Sri Lanka for persons arrested, detained or convicted of terrorism related offences, the experts said. These provisions run contrary to a rule of law-based approach to countering terrorism in society and is not an improvement on the status quo, they said. They expressed regret that previous proposals for an independent review panel to adjudicate human rights violations while countering terrorism were rejected in the current draft of the legislation. The experts welcomed Sri Lankas recognition that new legislation is necessary and referred to some positive inclusions in the proposed bill, including the express exclusion of opinion, legitimate criticism, satire, parody made in good faith in the definition of encouragement of terrorism. They also welcomed the decision to refrain from making offences under this legalisation punishable by death. Root and branch reform of Sri Lankas counter-terrorism legislation is long overdue. UN human rights experts have provided a roadmap to that end, and we urge the Government to meet the minimum requirements of due process and human rights compliant counter-terrorism legislation they previously identified, the UN experts said. They pledged to strongly support the adoption of legislation that is fully compliant with international human rights standards, as set out by the UN experts, and aligns the EU GSP scheme. The group of UN experts include: Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, Clément Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, Mary Lawlor, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Aua Baldé (Chair-Rapporteur), Gabriella Citroni (Vice-Chair), Angkhana Neelapaijit, Grażyna Baranowska, Ana Lorena Delgadillo Pérez, Working Group on enforced or involuntary disappearances; Margaret Satterthwaite, Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers; Morris Tidball-Binz Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Nazila Ghanea,Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and Irene Khan, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression",

        "title": "US vetoes UNSC resolution calling for humanitarian pause in Hamas-Israel conflict",
        "date": "October 18, 2023 11:58 pm",
        "content": "United Nations: While US President Joe Biden was in Israel on Wednesday, his country stood isolated in the Security Council vetoing a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the conflict between Israel and Hamas but also condemning the terrorist groups attack. The resolution proposed by Council President Brazil received 12 votes, including from Washingtons allies France and Japan, while another ally, Britain, and Russia abstained, but it was negated by the US veto. The vote took place under the shadow of the explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds on Tuesday and the vetoed resolution called for ending attacks on civilians and for sending aid to Gaza. Palestinians, who blamed an Israeli attack, said at least 470 people were killed in the hospital explosion, while Biden asserted that it was done by the other team, meaning Palestinians. Palestinians say more than 3,000 people have been killed in the retaliatory attacks launched by Israel for the destructive incursion by Hamas terrorists who killed at least 1,700 and took about 200 hostages on October 7. Before the resolution was put to vote, two amendments proposed by Russia failed to pass as they did not get the required nine votes and Washingtons sole negative votes did not count as vetoes. One amendment called for a complete ceasefire as distinct from the humanitarian pause suggested in Brazils draft and the other demanded condemnation of attacks on civilians in Gaza. Brazil worked without success for nearly a week to get a consensus reaction to the Hamas attack October 7 attack on Israel and its aftermath. Brazils Permanent Representative Sergio Franca Daneses said: Sadly, very sadly, the Council was yet again unable to adopt a resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Again, silence and inaction prevail to no ones long-term interests. The vetoed resolution explicitly condemned Hamas for the heinous attack on Israel. On Monday, a resolution cosponsored by Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia and 23 countries failed by not getting the minimum nine votes because several countries said that it did not name Hamas in condemning the attack on Israeli civilians. The US sole negative vote that was a veto of the Brazil-sponsored resolution plays into the hands of the Palestinians and Russia by showing Washingtons isolation from even its allies on the broader situation. For the Biden administration, the veto was driven by domestic politics that required him to appear to stand solidly in support of Israel and not even countenance any directive to that ally, even though it also sternly condemned Hamas. Explaining the veto, US Permanent Representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that her country is disappointed this resolution made no mention of Israels rights of self-defence and added that Bidens trip is to demonstrate to the Israeli people that the United States stands with them in their time of sorrow. While we recognise Brazils desire to move this text forward, we believe we need to let that diplomacy play out, she said. She linked the diplomatic efforts to Bidens visit to Israel and said that it showed that Washington is actively engaging at the highest levels to secure the release of hostages to prevent the conflict from spreading, to stress the need to protect civilian lives to address the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians in Gaza. United Arab Emirates Permanent Representative Lana Zaki Nusseibeh said that the Abraham Accord between her country, Israel, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco under US auspices that sought peace and cooperation for the region may be at risk. The indiscriminate damage visited upon the people of Gaza in pursuit of Israels security risks, extinguishing that hope, the region is already contending with the spillover of this crisis and the enemies of peace are unapologetic about their aims, and that does not play into their hands, she said. Russia, long under criticism for the invasion of Ukraine, took advantage of the US veto. Youve made your choice, however, and you are going to have to bear responsibility for it to the people there, to the people in the region and the people who are living under this terrible deadly threat, Moscows Permanent Representative Vassily Nebenzia said addressing the US. Brazils resolution had been scheduled for Monday, but the United States asked for more time to introduce amendments. Even Russia, which had warned that it would vote against the resolution unless it included a call for an immediate cease-fire and an end to all attacks on civilians, ultimately opted to abstain in order to move forward with a minimal resolution, only to face a US veto. Chinas usually cautious representative, Zhang Jun, was unusually angry today at the Councils inability to take action to stop the war: Our reaction is one of surprise and disgust, he said. Zhang accused the United States of having led Council members to believe that the resolution could be adopted by failing to oppose during the negotiations. Some countries, Zhang said, without mentioning the US, say that the Council should act, but the way they voted makes us doubt their willingness to act and their intention to find a solution to the problem. He also used his turn to speak to say he blamed Israel for bombing the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday: China strongly condemns the bombing of the hospital and we demand that Israel abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law, he said. --Agencies",

        "content": "Minister of State for Fisheries Piyal Nishantha, announced the development of a specialized investment zone in the Northern Province, which will be tailored to the fishing industry. This strategic endeavour aims to attract investments related to the fisheries sector, fostering economic growth and generating substantial employment opportunities for the citizens, he said. Furthermore, State Minister underscored the proactive measures that have already been initiated combat the fishing mafia, a network of intermediaries who have profited unjustly at the expense of both the fishing industry and consumers. State Minister Piyal Nishantha made these remarks during a press briefing held on Wednesday (18) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country, He further said that: In the past, the Fishery Corporation procured sailfish through suppliers, subsequently distributing imported fish. However, the corporation later transitioned to direct imports through legitimate channels, yielding considerable profits. This transformation disrupted the monopolistic control exercised by a select group of suppliers and intermediaries to some extent. Nevertheless, it is worth acknowledging that breaking this monopoly presented considerable challenges. Attempts were made to obstruct our efforts, even from within the corporation itself. As a consequence, fishermen, consumers and the corporation incurred substantial losses. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we remain steadfast in our commitment to curbing this exploitative network. For instance, the Fishery Corporation previously procured a kilogram of sailfish from local suppliers at a price of Rs 1750. But when importing sailfish directly, one kilo can be bought for Rs. 1250. With a monthly requirement exceeding 50,000 tons, it is unsurprising that the corporation incurred losses. It is crucial to emphasize that this import of fish is a temporary measure. Our primary objective is to facilitate the Fishery Corporations progress in collaboration with Sri Lankan fishermen, ensuring the delivery of quality and dependable seafood to our valued customers. In parallel, arrangements are underway to establish a dedicated investment zone for the fishing industry in the Northern Province, a move that will welcome investments linked to the fisheries sector into Sri Lanka, while simultaneously generating employment opportunities for a substantial workforce. To coincide with this years World Fisheries Day Dala Rala Pela, a series of programs will be held from November 19 to 21, with a specific focus on the Northern Province, led by the Jaffna district. Within the Jaffna district, various services provided by agencies affiliated with the Ministry of Fisheries, such as mobile fishing services, issuance of fishing ID cards, registration of fishing boats and resolution of communication issues concerning fishing signals, will be the centre of attention. Solutions will be delivered to these challenges directly within the local communities. Additionally, a testing centre affiliated with the NARA Institute is set to be established in the Kilinochchi district. Plans are in place to release small fish into lakes, rivers and reservoirs within the province, particularly the Iranamadu Reservoir. This move aligns with the commitment to expanding fish harvest areas for multi-day fishing vessels through the introduction of a new FAD machine. The promotion of the freshwater fishing industry remains a priority, marked by the distribution of approximately 54 million small fish into freshwater reservoirs nationwide. Significant emphasis is also placed on projects with the potential to enhance foreign exchange earnings, including seaweed cultivation and sea leech breeding. Under the aids of the Chinese government, a program to provide kerosene subsidies for one-day fishing vessels is being implemented for the second time. A total of 4,250,000 litres of kerosene will be distributed among 28,000 fishermen, equating to 153 litres of kerosene per fisherman. To foster cooperation among the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and affiliated institutions, plans are underway to conduct a volleyball tournament and an inter-school drawing competition. --PMD",

This decision has reportedly been taken under the directive of the Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) in charge of the Western Province. Accordingly, the relevant investigation proceedings have been referred to the relevant division, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said. Janaka Ratnayake, the former Chairman of the PUCSL, had reportedly filed a complaint with the Kirulapone Police Station alleging that he received a phone call from an individual, who had claimed to have received a contract to assassinate him, and had demanded Rs. 1.5 million to spare his life.",

        "title": "CPJ calls on Sri Lanka to reconsider bills likely to undermine press freedom",
        "date": "October 19, 2023 10:57 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan authorities should withdraw the proposed Online Safety Bill and Anti-Terrorism Bill or significantly amend them in line with international human rights standards, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said. In parliament on October 3, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles tabled the Online Safety Bill, which would empower a five-member commission appointed by the president to direct internet service providers or social media platforms to block access to an online location which contains a prohibited statement, which could include news websites or accounts of journalists and media outlets. The bill would also allow the proposed commission to prosecute journalists for publishing such content, and potentially order a prison term of up to five years and an unspecified fine. Sri Lankan human rights lawyer Ambika Satkunanathan told CPJ that the term prohibited statement lacks a clear definition in the bill, and would be contingent on subjective interpretation, opening the door for state actors to suppress dissent. Separately, on September 15, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Justice published a revised version of the Anti-Terrorism Bill after public and diplomatic pressure following the first draft in March. The bill would replace and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has been repeatedly used to jail and harass journalists for their work. While the revised bill includes some welcome amendments, including removing the death penalty as punishment, it retains a vague and overbroad definition of terrorism and could potentially criminalize nearly all forms of legitimate expression, according to a statement by a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sri Lankas proposed Online Safety Bill and Anti-Terrorism Bill are ripe for abuse against the media and would allow authorities to continue cracking down on press freedom and freedom of expression, said CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna. We urge the government to reconsider the bills in their entirety or engage in a thorough consultation process with journalists and civil society to ensure the provisions adhere to international human rights law. Satkunanathan, who filed petitions challenging the constitutionality of both bills in the Supreme Court, said that she believes the government should withdraw the legislation and address the relevant offenses within the countrys existent criminal laws. On Wednesday, October 18, the Attorney General told the Supreme Court that the government would make unspecified amendments to the Online Safety Bill. The U.N. statement also expressed concern that the Anti-Terrorism Bill grants wide powers to the police and military to question, search, and arrest people without adequate judicial oversight. Clause 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Bill prohibits supplying confidential information, defined as that which is likely to have an adverse effect on national or public security, to another person while knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that it will be used to commit an offense under the law. Journalists gathering information on activities the government does not wish to be publicized are vulnerable to being targeted through this provision, Satkunanathan said. CPJs calls and messages to Alles did not receive any replies. When reached by phone, Sri Lankan Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told CPJ he was unable to comment immediately. Rajapakshe did not respond to CPJs follow-up messages. --Committee to Protect Journalists--",

The relevant complaint was taken up for hearing before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis this morning (19). Earlier, the police had informed the court that the Attorney General advised that there were insufficient facts to proceed with the case against the former State Minister. Maheswaran had also appeared before the courts today, when the Chief Magistrate ordered for her to be released from the case since the Attorney General has decided not to pursue the case against Maheswaran. Addressing a state event held at Veerasingam Hall in Jaffna on the 2nd of July 2018, the then State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran had allegedly stated that the LTTE should be resurrected for the freedom of the Tamil people. The Organized Crime Prevention Division (OCPD) subsequently commenced investigations into the controversial statement made by the State Minister and she was arrested on October 8th 2018. However, she was granted bail on a personal bond worth Rs 500,000 on the same day. Maheswaran, who is a member of the United National Party (UNP), was also forced to step down as State minister for Child Affairs after her controversial remarks led to an uproar in Parliament.",

        "date": "October 19, 2023 11:47 am",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in Israel where he is expected to press for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Gaza as soon as possible. His visit comes right after President Bidens as world leaders step up efforts to prevent the conflict with Hamas spilling into the wider region. Mr Sunak is due to meet Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu today (19 Oct.), before visiting other regional capitals. He will offer his condolences for the civilians killed so far during the war. Every civilian death is a tragedy, the prime minister said ahead of the trip. And too many lives have been lost following Hamass horrific act of terror. There had been reports earlier this week that Mr Sunak was planning his first trip to Israel, but he would not confirm his travel arrangements until Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will meet leaders in Egypt, Turkey and Qatar in the coming days to seek support for a peaceful resolution in Israel and Gaza. The foreign secretary will push for an agreement on humanitarian access to Gaza, and the release of British hostages held by Hamas. Officials have also pointed out that Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has met his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in Washington to co-ordinate their approach. There will be a determination in government to use whatever diplomatic levers they can as quickly as they can, before Israels widely anticipated ground offensive in Gaza. The trips by senior British ministers follow US President Joe Bidens visit to Israel, which was overshadowed by a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday. Mr Biden said the blast appeared to have been caused by a failed rocket launched by Palestinian militants, backing Israels account of the incident. But Palestinian officials said an Israeli air strike hit the hospital. At Prime Ministers Questions on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said British intelligence services were working to establish who was behind the blast, telling MPs not to rush to judgment. In a later statement, Mr Sunak said: The attack on Al-Ahli Hospital should be a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict. I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this effort. On the eve of Mr Sunaks trip, hundreds of protesters attended a vigil outside Downing Street in London for those killed in the hospital blast. Elsewhere in the capital, King Charles made an impassioned plea for religious tolerance and mutual respect, against the background of international turmoil in Israel and Gaza. The prime ministers trip comes after Israeli warnings of a ground offensive in Gaza, where there is concern over the humanitarian situation. Israeli warplanes and artillery have been bombarding Gaza since 1,400 people were killed in the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. More than 3,000 people have been killed in numerous air strikes against Gaza by the Israeli military. Since Hamass attacks, Israel has blocked fuel, water, food and medical supplies from entering the territory and is demanding the release of scores of hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas. More than a million people have been displaced inside Gaza, which is one of the worlds most densely populated territories, where supplies of essentials are in short supply. President Biden said an agreement had been reached with Israel to allow humanitarian aid to move from Egypt into Gaza. But Israel said it would not allow any aid to pass through its own territory until hostages being held by Hamas are released. Mr Sunak said the UK was working round the clock to free hostages taken by Hamas. At least seven British nationals have been confirmed dead following the attack on Israel. The UK government said nine more UK nationals remained missing. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "October 19, 2023 03:47 pm",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is taking an unfavorable view toward a proposal by foreign dollar bondholders for restructuring its debt, signaling possible complications in negotiations that are key for accessing further funding to support its economic recovery. This proposal has not received a favorable response from Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Finance said in an official statement, referring to a suggested plan released by the bondholder group last week. The proposal included a 20 haircut and new macro-linked bonds which would adjust payout depending on macroeconomic outcomes. The authorities and their advisors intend to take the necessary time to consider the proposal and assess its compatibility with parameters in Sri Lankas IMF-supported program, the statement said. Sri Lankan officials and creditor nations have been batting for the need for comparable and fair treatment in the debt recast process. The authorities have already expressed to the bondholders advisers their serious reservations about the construct of the macro-linked bonds proposed by the group, the statement added. Bondholders have diverging views on growth and exchange-rate trajectories projected under the International Monetary Fund program. Disagreement between the authorities and investors over the terms of restructuring poses a risk to further funding from the IMF, essential to keeping a recovery in the island nations economy on track. Junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said Wednesday that authorities are assessing debt restructuring terms from foreign holders of its dollar bonds. After concluding domestic debt restructuring and agreeing a tentative deal with the Export-Import Bank of China in recent weeks, the focus for Sri Lanka is on securing agreements with dollar bondholders and other official creditors. Sri Lanka has invited bondholders to further engage with the nations debt advisers, while suggesting a value-recovery instrument if structured appropriately, taking into account the position of other creditors. Value recovery instruments would provide larger debt relief upfront but provide higher payouts if the country outperforms stated targets. said Avanti Save, credit strategist at Barclays. Macro-linked bonds on the other hand would increase the amount of debt relief for Sri Lanka if particular macroeconomic targets are not hit, she said, adding that the quick response suggests keenness to move ahead with restructuring. Sri Lankas 7.55 2030 dollar reversed early gains to fall one cent to 49 cents on the dollar , while a 5.75 2023 dollar bond dropped about two cents to 50.8 cents on the dollar, snapping a week of gains, according to indicative pricing compiled by Bloomberg.

        "title": "Netflix demonstrates its resilience during prolonged Hollywood strikes",
        "date": "October 19, 2023 03:48 pm",
        "content": "As most of Hollywood reels from the writers and actors strikes, streaming pioneer Netflix demonstrated resilience, the company said in its earnings report, gaining more subscribers in a single quarter than at any time in the past three years. Netflix capitalized on its global production capabilities, as well as the economic hardships of its media rivals, to amass 247 million subscribers in the third quarter, the company said Wednesday - a gain of nearly 9 million over the last three months. Thats the greatest gain since the COVID-19 outbreak fueled unprecedented growth in early 2020. Media rivals will report their own results in coming weeks, revealing the toll of the industrys months-long work stoppage, which began when Hollywoods writers went on strike in May. Members of the Writers Guild of America settled this month, though actors, who walked off the job in July, remain on strike. U.S. based-broadcast networks during the recent Hollywood strikes were forced to fill their fall lineups with repeats and reality shows. Rival streaming services had to delay new releases and had less foreign-language programming to offer than Netflix, which has production capabilities in more than 50 countries and languages. Due to its large international presence, Netflix is positioned better than most entertainment companies in plugging programming gaps from the writers and actors strikes, said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Ross Benes. With original US productions delayed and other TV and streaming companies no longer holding exclusive titles with vise grips, expect Netflix to revert to its past when many of its biggest shows were licensed, Benes said. A live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga series, One Piece, which represented a collaboration between Netflixs U.S. and Japanese content teams, ranked as the top show in 84 countries - a feat that even the popular sci-fi series Stranger Things didnt accomplish. Meanwhile, the legal drama Suits, which last aired on the USA Network in 2019, set viewing records when it landed on the streaming service in the summer, one of several television shows Netflix licensed from media competitors that are finding fresh audiences on Netflix. Because of our distribution footprint and our recommendation system, we are able to take Suits, which had played on other streaming services, and pop it right into the center of the culture in a huge way, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during Wednesdays investor video. As talks between the SAG-AFTRA actors and performers union and major studios broke down last week, dashing hopes for a quick resolution, Sarandos saw parallels to how Netflix navigated prolonged and pretty unpredictable production interruptions during the pandemic. These are the times that Im glad we have such a rich and deep and broad program selection, Sarandos said. Still, Netflix is not free from strike disruptions. U.S.-based shows such as mega-hit Stranger Things are on hold until actors return to work. Delays for some of its biggest shows are problematic for Netflix because it doesnt have the same back catalog as Disney to fall back on, said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

This feature will save users from carrying around an extra device or continuously logging out of their accounts to switch between accounts. WhatsApp account switching feature also aims to make it easier for users to manage their conversations across multiple accounts. For example, if a user has different WhatsApp accounts for work and for messaging friends and family members, this feature will allow them to switch between these accounts seamlessly on a single device. What users need for WhatsApp account switching The company has said that if users want to set up a second account, they will still need a separate phone number and SIM card (or a phone that accepts multi-SIM or eSIM). This means that the feature will run on dual-SIM phones only. Users will need a secondary device or an alternate SIM card to receive the one-time passcode. WhatsApp sends these codes via SMS to allow users access to their second account on a different device. WhatsApp spokesperson Ellie Heatrick has also explained that the app will continue to work for both accounts without the second device or SIM once the initial verification is done.

        "date": "October 19, 2023 04:31 pm",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak offered Israeli President Isaac Herzog his countrys solidarity on Thursday, saying London supported Israels right to defend itself while also calling for humanitarian access to Gaza after the attack by Hamas. The two leaders underlined the need to avoid an escalation of violence in the region, which has seen angry demonstrations in some Middle Eastern countries over an explosion at a hospital in Gaza which Palestinians blamed on Israel. Israel denies it carried out the attack and U.S. President Joe Biden said U.S. evidence supported the Israeli account that it was caused by a failed rocket launch by Palestinian fighters. We will stand with you in solidarity with your people and your right to defend yourself, to bring security back to your country to your people, to ensure the safe return of the hostages that have been taken, Sunak said in a televised part of the meeting with Herzog. Palestinians are victims of what Hamas has done. Its important that we continue to provide humanitarian access. At least seven British nationals have been killed and at least nine are still missing since the attack on Israel, Sunaks spokesperson said on Wednesday. Herzog thanked Sunak and said his presence offered a kind of support for the fact that we are there to uproot the military capabilities of this enemy, so that we can bring back decent, honest, innocent people to live back on the border and live in peace with our Palestinian neighbours. Sunak is the latest Western leader to visit Jerusalem to not only show support for Israel but to try to negotiate a way to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas and provide those in Gaza with humanitarian aid. The prime minister and President Herzog stressed the imperative need to avoid further escalation of violence in the region. They agreed to continue working together to that end, Sunaks office said in a statement. Sunak was due to visit other regional capitals after Israel - a trip which coincided with one made by his foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who will travel to Egypt, Turkey and Qatar over the next three days. The flurry of diplomacy is a step change from what some commentators say has been a decade of declining British influence in the Middle East, with London being seen as a junior partner of the United States. The last British prime minister to visit Israel and the occupied West Bank was David Cameron in 2014. In 2022, the government quietly axed a ministerial post dedicated to relations with the Middle East, combining that role with North Africa, South Asia and the United Nations. Cleverly, who visited Israel last week, will meet the leaders of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, countries which Britain said were vital to international efforts to uphold regional stability, free hostages and allow humanitarian access to Gaza.

        "date": "October 19, 2023 05:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to make the right calls concerning important investment decisions, one year after Sri Lanka saw its worst, most unprecedented crisis. On the lessons learned during the economic crisis and political turmoil the nation faced over an year ago, the Minister noted that the biggest lesson learned was that on fiscal discipline, and monetary policies that are not only consistent but also pragmatic. You cant continue to maintan a welfare state without having a steady revenue stream. That means fiscal discipline, he said, during an exclusive interview with Channel News Asia (CNA). Meanwhile, speaking on Chinas investments in Sri Lanka thus far, and their role and relationship with the country during its time of crisis, Minister Sabry reasserted that Chinas investments in Sri Lanka remain integral. In 2009, when we defeated LTTE we were in need of massive investments and we didnt only invite the Chinese, we made it open to the whole world, so some of the other countries wanted to wait and see, but China took the risk and invested and we are grateful for that. Speaking further in this regard, he explained that Sri Lankas next phase of development is growth-oriented, which calls for more investments. I think amongst the major players right now in the world, China has a hefty pocket, they are waiting for investments and we are a strategic part of their BRI initiative. So for us, Chinese investments are important and we look forward for that investment, he said in this regard. In response to a query on recent controversies surrounding Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and allegations that it is being used by China as a tool to create debt traps for its recipients, the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister refuted these claims, questioning the logic and practicality behind China intending to create such debt traps. What are they going to achieve out of the debt trap? If you put your money into a country as investments, obviously you want returns. So if you want returns, you want to see that that country succeeds, he argued. The Minister explained, however, that while it is his personal opinion that China does not intend to create such debt traps, the areas in which one should invest in and the priorities in this regard are sometimes overlooked. Thus, he stated that while, in hindsight, certain choices and decisions made by Sri Lanka with regards to investments are regretful in the context that they could have invested elsewhere, where there would have been better returns in the long-run, it is important now for the country to make the right calls in this regard. I think Sri Lanka is very clear right now. We will no longer go and borrow money, what we are asking for is investment, partnership and opportunities to grow together, he assured. Further commenting on Sri Lanka past investments towards infrastructure, Sabry acknowledged that while infrastructure is important, industries, too, must be invested in so as to manufacture the economy. Industries should come up, so that these infrastructures could support this (manufacturing) process, but unfortunately that process did not take place in Sri Lanka, he said. Concluding his interview, the Foreign Minister asserted that while Sri Lanka is content to be in the middle, continuing to refrain from choosing sides, they will not allow anyone to use our backyard to threaten any other country or to build their military bases. He noted, however, despite the countrys strong stance in this regard, Sri Lanka will continue to have strategic and transparent relationships with all countries. All countries are important for us, and our relationship is very transparent, and we have always asked for a peaceful settlement of all disputes, Minister Sabry concluded.",

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike on Thursday killed Jehad Mheisen, the head of Hamas-led national security forces in Palestine. Mheisen was killed along with several other family members at his house, Reuters reported quoting a Hamas-affiliated news agency. A Palestine-affiliated news organisation Jerusalem News Network reported that the attack was levelled in Gazas Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood. The organisation said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Major General Jehad Mheisen, Commander of the Palestinian National Security Forces in the Gaza Strip, and his family were killed by the bombing of his house inside the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. The war, which has entered day 13, has displaced over 1 million Palestinians, which is nearly half of Gazas population. Nearly 5,000 people have died on both sides and thousands have been injured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that limited humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza after a request from United States President Joe Biden. On October 7, Hamas militants entered Israel using motor gliders, boats and trucks and killing civilians and Israeli soldiers. Hamas has taken over 300 people hostages since the war began. Israel vowed to destroy the militant groups and has levelled severe attacks on the group. Biden said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has agreed to open the Rafah crossing into Gaza to allow a first batch of around 20 humanitarian aid trucks through. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have denied their involvement in a devastating explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip which killed at least 500 people. This explosion has triggered a wave of outrage and accusations against Israel, causing tensions to flare across the region. According to reports, the hospital in question, Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, was struck by a powerful blast that resulted in a significant loss of life. Palestinians and numerous countries in the Arab world were quick to point fingers at Israel, accusing them of targeting the medical facility and causing over 500 casualties. Notably, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others swiftly condemned Jerusalem for the alleged attack. Source - Hindustan Times - Agencies",

        "date": "October 19, 2023 08:23 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Technology, Kanaka Herath, highlighted the pressing need to equip high school graduates with the necessary skills to bridge the workforce gap in the Information Technology (IT) sector in Sri Lanka. Every year, there are approximately 20,000 job opportunities within the IT sector, yet a deficit of adequately trained professionals persists, he said while addressing a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (19 Oct.), focusing on the International Education Forum  2023. The Forum is being organized by the Education Division of the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS), and is scheduled to take place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo on 03 November, in conjunction with the INFOTEL ICT exhibition. He further emphasized that while about 10,000 IT graduates emerge from both public and private universities each year, additional efforts are required to equip young individuals who have completed their A-Levels with the skills necessary to meet the remaining labour force requirement. Continuing his remarks, Minister Herath stated: Many believe that our current education system requires reform, making the Sri Lanka Information Technology Industry Federations initiative timely and essential. Professionals well-versed in technology play a critical role in driving our national economy. Simultaneously with adopting new technologies, it is imperative to revamp our existing education system. Annually, the IT industry generates approximately 20,000 job opportunities, while only 10,000 IT professionals are available. This glaring gap in the information technology sector in our nation must be addressed by utilizing high school graduates. Our government is committed to this endeavour. To this end, we have launched the DIGIECON 2030 program, with the primary aim of formulating a national digital economy policy by the year 2030. The International Education Forum forms part of the broader strategy to realize the governments objectives. Empowering the education sector in our country is integral to advancing the national digital economy agenda. We extend an open invitation to all students and youth to actively participate in this initiative. Meanwhile, the President of the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) Mr. Indika De Soysa highlighted that empowering educational institutions to develop a technology-based workforce and address future challenges is critical to achieve the goals set out in the DIGIECON 2030 program. The Chairman of the FITIS, Mr. Amila Bandara, underscored the importance of discussing current trends in the Information and Communication Technology sector and stressed that this dialogue is crucial for training individuals to aligning with President Ranil Wickremesinghes vision of bolstering the countrys economy through a digital economy. Additional Secretary (Digital Education) of the Ministry of Education, Dr. K. P. Munagama and officials from the Ministry of Technology were also present at the event.",

        "date": "October 19, 2023 09:17 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Power and Energy D.V Chanaka has assured that there is no threat prevalent of a fuel shortage. Emphasisng that the necessary tenders for fuel imports required until June 2024 have been completed, Chanaka ensured an uninterrupted fuel supply until then, further highlighting that Sri Lankas fuel imports remain unaffected by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. He also highlighted that by entrusting the supply of fuel to Sinopec Company of China, the government expects to save more than US  500 million in foreign exchange. The State Minister made these statements during a press briefing held today (19 Oct.) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. State Minister D. V. Chanaka further stated, Recently, our country faced a significant fuel crisis, with fuel shortages and long queues at gas stations. However, we successfully resolved this situation within a short period. When considering the month of January 2022, its worth noting that crude oil prices in the world market were relatively low, with a barrel of crude oil priced at 50 USD. In the following months, it increased to 65 USD and later, due to various factors including the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, it reached 100 USD per barrel. Subsequently, it decreased to 80 USD. This year, after a year and a half of gradual increases, the price of crude oil has slightly decreased. Especially, in the first six days of this month, the world market saw a decrease of about 4 in crude oil prices. However, recent events in the Gaza Strip caused a 4 increase in fuel prices globally, nullifying the relief we expected from falling crude oil prices. Though Israel and Palestine arent significant fuel producers or distributors in the world market, Irans potential involvement in the situation adds to the uncertainty in the global market. Despite the conflict in the Gaza Strip, Sri Lankas fuel imports have not been disrupted. Tenders for fuel supply have been awarded up to June of next year, ensuring a steady supply of fuel in the country. Nevertheless, some uncertainties persist. In addition, we have allowed three other suppliers, including Chinas Sinopec, to provide fuel to our country. Sinopec has already commenced operations in Sri Lanka, resulting in savings of approximately 40 million USD in foreign exchange per season. It is anticipated that these measures will contribute to saving over 500 million USD in foreign exchange annually. Furthermore, these actions have helped reduce the risk to the dollar reserves maintained by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and efforts are being made to pass on these benefits to consumers. Notably, we have established a reserve of 200 million USD for oil purchases for the first time.",

        "date": "October 19, 2023 11:53 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) team Sri Lankan authorities have reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of the 48-month EFF-supported program. Accordingly, Sri Lanka will have access to SDR 254 million (about US330 million) in financing once the review is approved by IMF Management and IMF Executive Board. Macroeconomic policy reforms are starting to bear fruit and the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization, the IMF team said in the end-of-mission statement. Sustaining the reform momentum and addressing governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities are critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth. However, it noted that the completion of the review by the IMFs Executive Board requires the implementation by the authorities of all prior actions, and the completion of financing assurances reviews. After constructive discussions with the authorities in Colombo and during the Annual Meetings in Marrakech, IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Mr. Peter Breuer and Deputy Mission Chief Ms. Katsiaryna Svirydzenka issued the following statement: The IMF team reached a staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the first review under an economic reform program supported by a 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement . The arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board for a total amount of SDR 2.3 billion (about US3 billion) on March 20, 2023. The staff-level agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the IMF Executive Board in the period ahead, contingent on: (i) the implementation by the authorities of all prior actions; (ii) the completion of financing assurances reviews, which will include confirming whether adequate progress has been made with debt restructuring to give confidence that the restructuring will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the programs debt targets. Upon approval by the IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka would have access to SDR 254 million (about US330 million), bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement to SDR 508 million (about US660 million). The authorities remain committed to the ambitious reform agenda under the EFF and their reform efforts have been commendable, including rapid disinflation and a significant fiscal adjustment expected by the end of this year. Program performance at end-June was satisfactory, with all quantitative performance criteria for end-June met, except the one on expenditure arrears. All indicative targets were also met except the one on tax revenues. Most structural benchmarks were either met or implemented with delay by end-September 2023. Notably, the authorities published on time the Governance Diagnostic Report . Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia that has undergone the IMF Governance Diagnostic exercise. Progress is still ongoing on the revenue measures to support the fiscal consolidation during 2024 in line with program parameters. The economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization. Inflation is down from a peak of 70 percent in September 2022 to 1.3 percent in September 2023, gross international reserves increased by 1.5 billion during March-June this year, and shortages of essentials have eased. Despite these early signs of stabilization, full economic recovery is not yet assured. Growth momentum remains subdued, with real GDP in the second quarter contracting by 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis and high-frequency economic indicators continuing to provide mixed signals. Sri Lankas external position has weakened as a result of prolonged debt restructuring discussions, and reserve accumulation has slowed in recent months. Agreeing on debt treatments consistent with restoring debt sustainability quickly will be key to resolving uncertainty that is constraining Sri Lankan businesses and external financing. Sustaining the reform momentum is of paramount importance in steering the economy towards a sustained recovery and fostering stable, inclusive economic growth. We welcome the authorities commitment to increase revenues and signal better governance by adopting needed tax measures, strengthening tax administration, and actively eliminating tax evasion. Maintaining cost recovery in fuel and electricity pricing helps mitigate fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises. Further strengthening the social safety net remains critical to protect the poor and the vulnerable. While inflation has decelerated faster than expected, continued monitoring is warranted to help anchor inflationary expectations and support macroeconomic stability. Against continued external uncertainty, it remains important to rebuild external buffers through strong reserves accumulation. Following the authorities domestic debt operation, the critical next step is to secure an agreement with official creditors on a debt treatment consistent with the IMF Executive Board-approved program parameters and debt targets. We have taken note of a tentative agreement between Sri Lanka and the Export-Import Bank of China and look forward to analyzing the details when we receive them. We urge all official creditors to move forward and agree on an appropriate debt treatment in line with the financing assurances they provided. We understand negotiations between commercial creditors and Sri Lanka are ongoing and emphasize the need to restore debt sustainability in a robust manner. Delays risk worsening the economic outlook for Sri Lanka, widening its financing gaps, hindering its return to sustainable growth, and thereby reducing its capacity to repay. The authorities commitment to implement key recommendations of the recently published Governance Diagnostic Report is a welcome step. Concrete steps towards addressing corruption risks and strengthening accountability will be essential for rebuilding economic confidence and making growth more robust and inclusive. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. The team would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration and constructive discussions.",

        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has granted permission for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to increase electricity Tariffs from today (Oct. 20). Revised rates, which are slated to be announced later today, will be in place until June 30, 2024. Last month, the CEB made a request from the PUCSL to increase electricity tariffs once again, citing the need to cover the costs for thermal power generation during the months when arid weather conditions were prevalent across the country. Accordingly, the CEB had sought an electricity tariff hike in October, which was supposed to be made in January. CEB General Manager Eng. Dr. Narendra De Silva had said the state-owned utility had to bear additional costs for power generation as it was unable to generate an adequate amount of hydropower this year. According to him, 4,500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of hydropower was expected to be produced, but only 3,750 GWh of hydropower had been produced. Thereby, an additional 750 GWh of electricity had to be produced from thermal power plants, adding that additional costs had to be borne by the CEB as a result. On October 18, the PUCSL held a consultation on the proposed electricity tariff revision at the BMICH premises to gather inputs of a total of 30 parties including the members of the public and the CEB officials, before deciding on green-lighting the request to increase electricity tariffs. Thus, the PUCSL has given permission to increase the electricity tariffs from today. The revised tariffs will be in place until June 30, 2024.",

        "date": "October 20, 2023 09:02 am",
        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has announced revised electricity charges coming into effect today (Oct. 20). A request made by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to increase electricity tariffs again was green-lighted by the PUCSL in a bid to raise the state-run utilitys revenue. Revised fixed charges, which will be in place until June 30, 2024, are as follows: Domestic category 0-30 kWh  increased from Rs. 150 to Rs. 180 31-60 kWh  increased from Rs. 300 to Rs. 360 61-90 kWh  increased from Rs. 400 to Rs. 480 91-120 kWh  increased from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,180 121-180 kWh  increased from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,770 181 kWh and above  increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,360 Religious and charitable institutions category 0-30 kWh  increased from Rs. 150 to Rs. 180 31-90 kWh  increased from Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 91-120 kWh  increased from Rs. 600 to Rs. 710 121-180 kWh  increased from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,770 181 kWh and above  increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,360 Additionally, the PUCSL has urged the CEB to comply with the conditions, which were set for the tariff approvals granted on February 14 and June 30 this year but have not yet been fulfilled. Last month, the CEB made a request from the PUCSL to increase electricity tariffs once again, citing the need to cover the costs for thermal power generation during the months when arid weather conditions were prevalent across the country. Accordingly, the CEB had sought an electricity tariff hike in October, which was supposed to be made in January. CEB General Manager Eng. Dr. Narendra De Silva had said the state-owned utility had to bear additional costs for power generation as it was unable to generate an adequate amount of hydropower this year. The CEB chief had said 4,500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of hydropower was expected to be produced, but only 3,750 GWh of hydropower had been produced. Thereby, an additional 750 GWh of electricity had to be produced from thermal power plants, adding that additional costs had to be borne by the CEB as a result. On October 18, the PUCSL held a consultation on the proposed electricity tariff revision at the BMICH premises to gather inputs of a total of 30 parties including the members of the public and the CEB officials, before deciding on green-lighting the request to increase electricity tariffs.

        "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping says China is committed to assisting Sri Lanka in achieving economic stability without any political agenda. He expressed his desire to collaborate closely with President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Furthermore, President Xi acknowledged that Sri Lankas speech at the United Nations General Assembly, delivered by President Wickremesinghe, reflected the countrys strategic independence and its neutral stance. Bilateral discussions between President Wickremesinghe, who is on an official visit to China, and President Xi took place on Friday (Oct. 20) at the Great Hall of the People. The Chinese leader warmly welcomed his Sri Lankan counterpart and after a friendly exchange, the two leaders engaged in bilateral talks. President Xi reiterated Chinas commitment to the One China policy and expressed gratitude for Sri Lankas support for the Belt and Road initiative. He highlighted the Port City and Hambantota Port as key projects under this initiative and pledged to promote imports of Sri Lankan products to China and increase investments in Sri Lanka. Additionally, President Xi assured that China would provide friendly, practical and timely support for Sri Lankas debt optimization program. President Xi also mentioned the historical relations between China and Sri Lanka, citing travel notes by the Faxian monk and Zheng He. In response, President Wickremesinghe expressed his appreciation for Chinas longstanding support to Sri Lanka and commended President Xi for his consistently friendly attitude towards Sri Lanka. He briefed President Xi about plans to construct a Sri Lankan Buddhist temple and stupa in commemoration of the visit of Faxian monk to Sri Lanka.

        "title": "US military shoots down missiles and drones as it faces growing threats in volatile Middle East",
        "date": "October 20, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "With tensions spiking in the Middle East, U.S. forces in the region are facing increasing threats as a Navy warship shot down missiles appearing to head toward Israel Thursday and American bases in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by drone attacks. Later, a U.S. official said there had been a rocket attack early Friday morning on U.S. and coalition forces at a diplomatic support center near the Baghdad International Airport. Initial assessments indicated two rockets were fired, the official said, noting that one was intercepted by a counter-rocket system and the other struck an empty storage facility. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public, said no casualties were reported. Earlier, the USS Carney, a Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea, intercepted three land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by Houthi forces in Yemen. The action by the Carney potentially represented the first shots by the U.S. military in the defense of Israel in this conflict. Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, told reporters the missiles were potentially headed toward Israel but said the U.S. hasnt finished its assessment of what they were targeting. A U.S. official said they dont believe the missiles  which were shot down over the water  were aimed at the U.S. warship. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations that had not yet been announced. But an array of other drone attacks over the past three days did target U.S. bases, including one in southern Syria on Thursday that caused minor injuries. The rash of violence comes in the wake of a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital, triggering protests in a number of Muslim nations. The Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in retaliation for the devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel almost two weeks ago, but Israel has denied responsibility for the al-Ahli hospital blast and the U.S. has said its intelligence assessment found that Tel Aviv was not to blame. In recent days, however, a number of militant groups across the region  from Hezbollah to the Houthis  have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Since Tuesday, militants have launched at least four drone attacks on U.S. military installations in Iraq and Syria where U.S. troops train local defense forces and support the mission to counter the Islamic State group. The attacks fuel escalating worries in the U.S. and the West that the war in Israel could expand into a larger regional conflict. Thats exactly what we are trying to prevent, Ryder said. The most recent drone attack was Thursday at al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq posted a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying they had fired a salvo of rockets at the base and they hit their targets directly and precisely. A U.S. official confirmed the latest attack but said it was too early to assess any impact. Also Thursday, the al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria was struck by drones. U.S. troops have maintained a presence at the base for a number of years to train Syrian allies and monitor Islamic State militant activity. The Pentagon said one drone was shot down, but another hit the base and caused minor injuries. The garrison is located on a vital road that often used by Iranian-backed militants to ferry weapons to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon  and Israels doorstep. Syrian opposition activists also said there was a separate drone attack on an oil facility in eastern Syria that houses American troops. Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet, said three drones with explosives struck the Conoco gas field in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, also confirmed explosions at the site. On Tuesday, militants launched three drones against two Iraq bases that the U.S. uses to train forces and conduct operations against the Islamic State. During the spate of launches, one warning turned out to be a false alarm at al-Asad, but it sent personnel rushing into bunkers. During that incident, a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died, Ryder said. He said the Pentagon does not yet have confirmation on who launched the drone attacks but said the U.S. will take all necessary actions to defend U.S. and coalition forces against any threat. He said any military response would come at a time and a manner of our choosing. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have sometimes been used as foot soldiers in regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen, and have in recent days threatened to attack U.S. facilities in Iraq and elsewere because of American support for Israel. Our missiles, drones, and special forces are ready to direct qualitative strikes at the American enemy in its bases and disrupt its interests if it intervenes in this battle, Ahmad Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, head of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, said in a statement last Wednesday. He also threatened to launch missiles at Israeli targets. Following the blast at the hospital in Gaza, the group issued another statement in which it blamed the U.S. and its support for Israel for the catastrophe and called for an end to the U.S. presence in Iraq. These evil people must leave the country. Otherwise, they will taste the fire of hell in this world before the afterlife, the statement said. On the intercepts by the Carney, Ryder said the strikes were done because the Houthi missiles posed a potential threat based on their flight profile. He added that the U.S. is prepared to do whatever is needed to protect our partners and our interests in this important region. He said the U.S. is still assessing what the target was, but said no U.S. forces or civilians on the ground were injured. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Last week, in Yemens Sanaa, which is held by the Houthi rebels still at war with a Saudi-led coalition, demonstrators crowded the streets waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags. The rebels slogan long has been, God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse of the Jews; victory to Islam. Last week, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, the rebel groups leader, warned the United States against intervening in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, threatening that his forces would retaliate by firing drones and missiles. When approached Thursday, two Houthi officials declined to comment on the incident. One said he was unaware of the incident, while the second said he did not have the authority to speak about it.

        "title": "IMF wants strong budget, narrower deficit from Sri Lanka",
        "date": "October 20, 2023 11:07 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is looking for a strong budget and narrower deficit from Sri Lanka as it seeks funding to bridge the gap between government revenue and expenditure, the IMF mission chief for the country said on Friday. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows, but since locking down a 2.9 billion IMF programme in March it has managed to partly stabilise its economy, reducing runway inflation and rebuilding reserves. However, the country has struggled to increase public revenue, with the IMF projecting a 15 shortfall this year. An improved performance for next year is necessary for Sri Lanka to get past the first review of its programme with the global lender. Sri Lanka reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF late on Thursday to release the second tranche of about 330 million but still needs approval from the IMF management and Executive Board. Regarding revenues, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer said the objective is not to let a shortfall happen next year, and ensure revenue exceeding 12 of GDP. Like, approximately 12 months ago, we are of course looking for a strong budget that can achieve that with, of course, the objective being that the gap between expenditure and revenues needs to be narrowed so that Sri Lanka can, once again, find creditors who are willing to finance the remaining gap, Breuer told reporters at an online briefing from Washington. Sri Lanka typically uses borrowings from state banks, taxes and government securities to fund its budget. The power regulator approved an 18 electricity tariff hike for households in the country with effect from Friday, part of efforts by Sri Lanka to improve revenue of its state-run power monopoly, the Ceylon Electricity Board. Sri Lanka increased tariffs by 65 in February before reducing them by 14 in June. The power tariff hike is expected to partly increase the islands inflation from 1.3 in September to about 5 by December, analysts said. Meanwhile, China offered to help Sri Lanka buy more of its exports after leaders of the two countries met in Bejing on Friday, state media said. This comes a week after the island nation said it had reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China on 4.2 billion of debt. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to roll out new investment law to woo FDI, investors",
        "date": "October 20, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Getting into a resilient mode after navigating severe economic turbulence, Sri Lanka is doubling down on its efforts to attract foreign direct investment and investors by rolling out a landmark investment law designed to eliminate the existing complexities. The island nations State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama said the country of 24 million people is back on track after recovering from an economic crisis of unprecedented scale as it continues to make remarkable headway in restructuring its foreign debts as well as the revamping of several public institutions. Speaking to Khaleej Times during his recent visit to the UAE, the minister said the country has successfully walked through the initial phase of the crucial debt restructuring talks with the International Monetary Fund, and is in the process of restructuring public sector institutions including the Department of Petroleum and the Electricity Board and even scrapping some other loss-making entities. We did manage to address the Covid-19 pandemic quite well albeit its economic impact could not be ably addressed, said Amunugama. As a result, the countrys borrowing capability was considerably reduced, leading to spiraling inflation. But post-Covid, Sri Lanka has been quite fast in containing the inflation. It has come down from 67 per cent to four per cent. We have also started to pay back our loan, and are currently holding the second phase of debt restructuring talks with the IMF, said the minister. During the worst economic crisis the country has ever faced, the members of Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as the president directly for the first time in Sri Lankas history. I would like to say that we selected the best pilot to fly us out of the storm, said Amunugama. The new investment law, the minister said, will ensure the rights of foreign investors to make Sri Lanka an investment-friendly destination. To be unveiled by the first quarter of 2024, the game-changing law will feature several incentives for foreign investors. Also on the cards is an initiative to give free land ownership rights to foreign investors, he said. Part of the new measures is the setting up of an Investor Facilitation Centre to provide comprehensive facilities, including addressing investor issues. It will operate in close coordination with various government agencies. The centre would serve as a platform for investors to swiftly address their current challenges. Specific investment zones with the potential to attract investments to Sri Lanka have also been identified, according to the minister. The FDI target set by the countrys Board of Investments (BOI) for 2023 is 1.5 billion and it had already realized in Q1 of 2023  211 million. Going forward, Sri Lanka expects to accelerate the recovery process of its 89 billion economy (2021) by focusing primarily on its agriculture sector, followed by tourism and investment sectors, said the minister. On debt restructuring discussions with the IMF, the minister said he is optimistic of resolving all pending issues although we cannot meet all their (IMF) conditions in the current situation. The debt restructuring is crucial for Sri Lanka to reach a 2.3 per cent primary budget surplus by 2025, the key fiscal target set by the IMF. According to data from the finance ministry, Sri Lankas external debt was 36.09 billion at the end of March this year. Once the debt restructuring is completed, Sri Lanka hopes to reduce its overall debt by 16.9 billion. The country owed about 10 billion to multilateral banks like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank and 11.33 billion to bilateral creditors, including the Paris Club nations and China, Japan, and India. Commercial loans, comprising of sovereign bonds and other time-bound loans, accounted for 14.75 billion. Among bilateral creditors, Sri Lanka owed China 4.7 billion with debt to India standing at 1.74 billion. Japan, a part of the Paris Club group, was owed 2.68 billion. Sri Lanka has debt outstanding of 5.65 billion to the ADB and owed 3.88 billion to the World Bank. An IMF mission team, which last month concluded a visit to the country praised Sri Lankas recovery efforts and said the people have shown remarkable resilience in the face of enormous challenges. Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult but much-needed reforms. These efforts are bearing fruit as the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilisation. Gross international reserves increased by 1.5 billion during March-June this year, and shortages of essentials have eased, said the IMF mission. Source: Khaleej Times --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has concluded deliberation of the petitions filed challenging the much-debated Online Safety Bill, which was tabled in the parliament by the government recently. The relevant hearings were concluded last night (Oct 19), according to Ada Derana reporter. The hearings were held before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, Achala Vengapulli and Shiran Gunaratne. Accordingly, the judge benchs confidential verdict regarding the relevant petitions will be communicated to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. During the October 18 parliamentary session, the Speaker revealed that 45 petitions in total had been filed against the proposed legislation. Petitions were filed by a number of parties including social activist and independent journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara; Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith; the Socialist Youth Union (SYU); General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara; SJBs Rehan Jayawickrama; former BASL presidents Saliya Peiris and Geoffrey Alagaratnam; National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris, challenging various provisions included in the legislation, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. The petitioners had sought an order determining that if the relevant bill were to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament, followed by a referendum. The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns.",

This agreement is set to grant Sri Lanka access to the second tranche, approximately USD330 million in financing, pending approval by the IMFs Management and Executive Board, it said in a statement, adding that another key development is the preliminary debt restructuring agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China, which covers approximately US4.2 billion of Sri Lankas debt. This agreement also serves as an important component of financial assurances for Sri Lanka. While we acknowledge these accomplishments, we urge the Government to maintain the momentum of the current reform agenda to steer the economy toward lasting recovery and stable, inclusive growth. Furthermore, it is imperative to address persistent issues related to governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities, the Ceylon Chamber said adding that the IMFs Governance Diagnostic Assessment resonates with its own call for reforms in these critical areas. We urge Sri Lankan citizens to take ownership of the reform agenda, as collective action is vital to navigate the countrys financial challenges and set Sri Lanka back on a path to growth, it added. In conclusion, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce commended the Government for these significant strides but stressed the need for ongoing reforms, robust governance, and shared responsibility. Adherence to these principles will undoubtedly put Sri Lanka back on a trajectory of economic growth and stability, the statement read further.",

Senior IMF Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer told a media briefing on Friday (Oct. 20) that the global lender has taken note of the tentative agreement. On October 11, the Finance Ministry revealed that Sri Lanka has reached an agreement on the key principles and indicative terms of a debt treatment with the China Exim Bank. A government press release read that the agreement in principle covers approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. The Sri Lankan authorities had said the agreement constitutes a key step towards restoring the islands long-term debt sustainability and would pave the way to a prompt economic recovery. The indicative terms agreed are expected to provide the necessary fiscal space for Sri Lanka to implement its ambitious reform agenda. Speaking further, Mr. Breuer commended Sri Lankan authorities for publishing on time the Governance Diagnostic Report. Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia that has undergone the IMF Governance Diagnostic exercise. He said the island nations economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization but growth momentum remains subdued and economic recovery is not yet assured. On Thursday (Oct. 19), the IMF team and Sri Lankan authorities reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of the 48-month EFF-supported program. Accordingly, Sri Lanka will have access to SDR 254 million (approximately USD 330 million) in financing once the review is approved by IMF Management and IMF Executive Board. The IMF team said Sri Lankan authorities commitment to implement key recommendations of the recently published Governance Diagnostic Report is a welcome step, adding that concrete steps towards addressing corruption risks and strengthening accountability would be essential for rebuilding economic confidence and making growth more robust and inclusive.",

        "date": "October 20, 2023 06:35 pm",
        "content": "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing on Friday and said aid trucks needed to move as quickly as possible from Egypt into the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza to alleviate a humanitarian crisis. The crossing has become a focus of attention since Israel began its mass bombing of Gaza in retaliation for a deadly assault by the Hamas militant group on southern Israel on Oct.7. Gaza is running short of fuel, food, water and medicine but the Egyptian-controlled border has remained shut while various parties wrangle over terms for allowing aid to flow in. Guterres flew to Egypt on Friday in a push to get the trucks moving. These trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza, he said, speaking on the Egyptian side of the crossing. To see them stuck here makes me very clear - what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible. Gutteres, dressed in a dark suit under the desert sun, also called for a swift system of verification of the aid shipments. We are now actively engaging with all the parties, actively engaging with Egypt, with Israel, with the US, in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions...in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed, he said. He was swarmed by Egyptian protesters chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as he spoke. In Geneva, the U.N. humanitarian office said it was in advanced talks with all parties in the Israel-Hamas conflict to ensure an aid operation can soon get underway in Gaza. Earlier, the United States had said details of a deal to send aid through the Rafah crossing were still being hammered out. Agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks, it also said. This would still only be a fraction of what is required. Before the outbreak of conflict, about 450 aid trucks were arriving there daily. Most of Gazas 2.3 million people depend on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007. In Geneva, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies. We are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions, he said. STAY OR EVACUATE? Rafah is the only crossing with Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel. Efforts to get aid into Gaza have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza. Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks. A U.N. official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai to Gaza. During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases the hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack. It has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas. Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gazans into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israels creation. Egypt is also concerned by security in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago, and by the risk of any spillover from Hamas-controlled Gaza.

This order was issued by the two-member bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais when a writ petition filed by Pastor Jerome seeking an order preventing his arrest by the CID was taken up before the court today (20). The self-styled prophet, found himself in hot water after a video of a recent sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony, while several other parties had also lodged complaints with the CID regarding the matter. However, Pastor Jerome flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court issued a foreign travel ban on him. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island nation. On 26 May, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition. In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country.",

A total of 176 specialist doctors had put forward petitions seeking that a court order be issued revoking the Cabinet decision taken in October 2022 to revise the retirement age of doctors. When the petitions were taken up for consideration today, the judge bench ordered the petitioners and the respondents to file their written submissions before the verdict was delivered. At the same time, the interim order, which suspended the inclusion of doctors and specialists in the gazette notification on the compulsory retirement of government sector employees at the age of 60, was extended until November 17. Last year, the Cabinet of Ministers announced the revision of the retirement age for doctors in October, stating that while doctors aged 60, 61 and 62 by the years end will be allowed to serve until 61, 62 and 63 respectively, those aged 59 will be required to retire by the age of 60.",

        "date": "October 20, 2023 11:38 pm",
        "content": "A man of Sri Lankan origins living in Australia has pleaded guilty to obtaining financial advantage by deception in a bid to put on T20 cricket tournaments featuring high-profile international players. Navishta Desilva, 36, had reportedly defrauded his employer of nearly AUD 250,000. He funnelled most of the money into events his personal company Global Talent Entertainment was organising featuring his cricket club Endeavour Hills and a star-studded line-up of international cricketers. There is no suggestion Endeavour Hills or the players were aware of any wrongdoing. Mr Desilva turned to fraud after sponsorship funding for the events fell through, the Victorian County Court heard on Friday. It seems to stem from immaturity and grandiose ideas, Judge Brookes told the court. Dressed in a dark suit with open collar, Mr Desilva spoke softly as he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Over the course of 16 months between March 2021 and July 2022, Desilva arranged for 18 different purchase orders from Omnivision to CCTV master, a legitimate business which supplied his employer with surveillance cameras. By setting up a fake email address pretending to be from CCTV Master, Desilva was able to send fake invoices to Omnivision for inflated amounts which he funnelled into his own bank account. The fraud was noticed when an ex-colleague of Desilvas audited the transactions he had been involved with after he left the company in July 2022. He has since repaid the money by working nights as a labourer in addition to a 9-5 job, and borrowing money from friends and family, defence barrister Sam Norton told the court. The court heard Mr Desilva had enjoyed a promising youth career as a cricketer, representing Sri Lanka at U-15 level and playing for the same club as legend of the game Kumar Sangakarra. When his dreams of a cricket career fell flat, he migrated to Australia at the age of 20, where he worked in a series of jobs including three years in auditing at Deloitte. Judge Brookes warned Mr Desilva he could be jailed for the devious and prolonged offending. This is the sort of offence where ordinarily the community expects a period of jail, Judge Brookes said, noting that Mr Desilvas job at Deloitte would have given him the skills required to pull off the fraud. Toni Stokes, prosecuting, implored the judge to impose a prison term for the very serious offending, noting that Mr Desilva had been convicted of a similar offence a decade earlier. Mr Desilva will return to court for sentencing on October 30. --Agencies",

The police officer in question, named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara, remains at large since September 10. The members of the public can provide any information about this officer via the following contact numbers: 071 8596150 or 071 8591960.

He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  a police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and detained Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date. On 18 September, the mother and brother-in-law of this constable were arrested.

Defending his actions, MP Sujith Perera said he had witnessed Diana Gamage becoming embroiled in a heated argument with his fellow MP Rohana Bandara, and when asked to give it a rest, the state minister had attacked him. The SJB parliamentarian said he only acted in self-defense and urged the Deputy Speaker to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. MP Rohana Bandara accused State Minister Gamage of following him and verbally attacking him near the elevator. We, men, also need to defend ourselves when we are insulted and attacked. Following the conclusion of the parliamentary session, the three parliamentarians were involved in an intense war of words, which was videoed by MP Perera on his mobile phone. Meanwhile, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has appointed a five-member committee headed by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse, and comprising Chamal Rajapaksa, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, MP Gayantha Karunatilleka and MP Imthiaz Bakeer Markar. The panel is tasked with investigating the alleged incident in consideration of the facts and complaints presented by both parties and expeditiously submitting a report to him regarding the matter.",

        "date": "October 21, 2023 11:33 am",
        "content": "State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe says the agreement reached with the IMF and the staff-level agreement reached following the First Review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement will help settle arrears owed to multilateral creditors while expediting the debt restructuring process. The lawmaker has further said that Sri Lanka is poised to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million subsequent to the approval of this Staff-Level Agreement by the IMF Executive Board, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Semasinghe made these remarks at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), on Friday (Oct. 20) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. In his further remarks, the state minister elaborated: Last night, we successfully reached the staff-level agreement, a crucial step in securing the second tranche under our agreement with the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility. Prior to this achievement, a team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an extensive two-week review in Sri Lanka, engaging in detailed discussions on various topics. Given the complexity and scope of the discussions, it was not feasible to reach an agreement instantly. Subsequently, we continued our deliberations during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held in Morocco. There, we engaged in in-depth discussions to clarify various aspects. Even then, we found it necessary to seek further clarifications on various matters, leading to continued discussions through online platform once we returned to Sri Lanka. The agreement, as it stands today, is the result of concerted efforts and dialogues involving officials from the International Monetary Fund, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. Despite the favourable position Sri Lanka held with the International Monetary Fund in March 2023, subsequent disruptions and misinterpretations arose in recent weeks. State Minister Semasinghe emphasized, We categorically stated within and outside of Parliament that there is no reason to fear the approval of the executive committee or the release of the second instalment. As a government, we maintained our confidence. Semasinghe underscored that the staff-level agreement, marking the completion of the first review of the program with the IMF, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the payment of arrears to multilateral creditors and expediting the process of debt restructuring. He reiterated that Sri Lanka is set to receive the second tranche of USD 330 million following the approval of the IMFs Executive Board. Additionally, he has acknowledged the leadership and the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in these endeavours, as well as the contributions of officials, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, in making these achievements possible, the PMD said. He noted that the staff-level agreement will enable the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to make the remaining payments, further expediting debt restructuring efforts with international partners. The state minister expressed optimism that agreements related to debt restructuring may soon be finalized, aligning with the governments objectives of reducing corruption and increasing transparency. He cited the IMFs praise for Sri Lankas economic progress and noted that this reflects international confidence in the countrys economic prospects.",
