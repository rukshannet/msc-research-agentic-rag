        "title": "US Supreme Court temporarily halts deportations of Venezuelan migrants under wartime law",
        "date": "April 19, 2025 01:18 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court early on Saturday paused President Donald Trumps administration from deporting Venezuelan men in immigration custody after their lawyers said they were at imminent risk of removal without the judicial review previously mandated by the justices. The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court, the justices said in a brief, unsigned decision. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented from the decision, issued around 12:55 a.m. (0455 GMT). Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed urgent requests on Friday in multiple courts, including the Supreme Court, urging immediate action after reporting that some of the men had already been loaded onto buses and were told they were to be deported. The ACLU said the rapid developments meant the administration was poised to deport the men using a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime without affording them a realistic opportunity to contest their removal - as the Supreme Court had required. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision. The case raises questions about the Trumps administrations adherence to limits set by the Supreme Court. It carries the risk of a significant clash between the two coequal branches of government and potentially a full-blown constitutional crisis. Elected last year on a promise to crack down on migrants, Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in an attempt to swiftly deport accused members of Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang originating from Venezuelan prisons that his administration labels a terrorist group. The president and his senior aides have asserted their executive power grants them wide authority on immigration matters, testing the balance of power between branches of government. BATTLE IN SEVERAL COURTS During a hearing on Friday, a government lawyer said in a related case that he was unaware of plans by the Department of Homeland Security to deport the men on Friday but there could be deportations on Saturday. Trump scored one victory on Friday when an appeals court put on hold a threat by District Judge James Boasberg of contempt charges. Boasberg also denied an ACLU request to block Trump from deporting suspected members of Tren de Aragua, citing an April 7 Supreme Court ruling that allowed Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act, albeit with certain limits. Boasberg said he was concerned the government would deport additional people as soon as Saturday but that, At this point I just dont think I have the power to do anything about it. Trump previously called for Boasbergs impeachment following an adverse ruling, prompting a rare rebuke from U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. While one hearing played out in Boasbergs court, the ACLU worked on a separate track to halt the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas. ACLU lawyers filed with the Supreme Court after failing to get a rapid response from earlier filings on Friday before U.S. District Judge James Hendrix in Abilene, Texas, and the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to block any such deportations. In Saturdays order, the Supreme Court invited the administration to file a response to the ACLUs request after the 5th Circuit acts. The ACLU said the men had been handed forms indicating they were classified as members of Tren de Aragua. At issue is whether the Trump administration has met the Supreme Courts standard for providing the detainees due process before sending them to another country - possibly to the notorious prison in El Salvador where others are jailed. It was unclear on Friday how many people were potentially to be deported, and where they might be taken. HOW MUCH NOTICE IS ENOUGH? Their deportation would be the first since the Supreme Courts 5-4 ruling that allowed removals under the 1798 law while specifying that the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs. Habeas corpus relief refers to the right of detainees to challenge the legality of their detention. It is considered a bedrock right under U.S. law. The Supreme Court did not indicate how much notice should be provided. Lawyers around the country have asked that the migrants be given 30 days notice to allow them to contest their deportations. The Trump administration has not said publicly how much notice it intends to give the migrants. The ACLU filed a photo of one of the notices with the court. You have been determined to be an Alien Enemy subject to apprehension, restraint, and removal, read the notice. The recipients name was obscured, and it was noted that the migrant refused to sign it on Friday. Asked about the planned deportations on Friday, Trump said he was unfamiliar with the particular case but added: If theyre bad people, I would certainly authorize it. Thats why I was elected. A judge wasnt elected, he told reporters at the White House. Defense lawyers and Democrats in Congress have pressed the administration to demonstrate how it knows the Venezuelans are members of the gang, which is active in human trafficking and other crimes in South America but has a smaller U.S. presence. We are not going to reveal the details of counter terrorism operations, but we are complying with the Supreme Courts ruling, Assistant Secretary for U.S. Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Friday. On March 15, the Trump administration deported more than 130 alleged Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador. Many of the migrants lawyers and family members say they were not gang members and had no chance to dispute the governments assertion that they were. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Ryan Gosling is to star in a new Star Wars film, which is set to be released in two years time. The new Disney project is titled Star Wars: Starfighter, and will be directed by Deadpool  Wolverine director Shawn Levy. The reality is that this script is just so good. It has such a great story with great and original characters, said Barbie actor Gosling at a Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo. Its filled with so much heart and adventure, and there just really is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn. Goslings lifelong passion for the franchise was on display at the event, which showed his childhood Star Wars bedsheets on screen. You can see from the picture, I guess I was probably dreaming about Star Wars before I even saw the film, he said. And its probably framed my idea of what a movie even was, he said. Set to be released on 7 May 2027, the film is a standalone story and wont follow the main plotline of the Skywalker family and recent sequels starring Daisy Ridley. Not many details about the storyline have been revealed yet. According to the Star Wars website, it is set approximately five years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker with Gosling playing a new character. The new space adventure is not a prequel, not sequel, its a new adventure. Its set in a period of time that we havent seen explored yet, added Levy. The next Star Wars film release is set to be The Mandalorian And Grogu, a sequel to The Mandalorian starring Pedro Pascal and directed by Jon Favreau. Gosling was nominated at the Oscars for his portrayal of Ken in 2023s Barbie blockbuster, which also starred Margot Robbie. The Canadian actor, known for roles in La La Land and The Notebook, also starred as a stuntman in last years The Fall Guy. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "A Sri Lankan national stranded in Bahrain for more than 20 years was repatriated along with her son, after suffering from diabetes-related complications. Kadeeja, 47, who was admitted to Salmaniya Medical Complex in January for breathing problems, had been living in Bahrain without valid documentation. Her 18-year-old son Rafik, who was born at Salmaniya Medical Complex in 2007, also lacked proper documentation and did not have a birth certificate or a passport, foreign media reports said. The repatriation was the result of coordinated efforts between the Sri Lankan Embassy in Bahrain, Bahraini immigration authorities, medical staff at Salmaniya Medical Complex, and several civil society organisations. Ms. Kadeeja, who had been battling a serious health condition, was admitted to Salmaniya Medical Complex in January. Her son Rafik, who was born at the same hospital in 2007, had spent his entire life without official identification  lacking both a birth certificate and a passport. The two had been living in extreme hardship after being abandoned by Kadeejas partner shortly after Rafiks birth. To facilitate their return, Salmaniya Medical Complex issued a special certificate confirming Rafiks birth. This enabled the Sri Lankan Embassy to process the necessary travel documentation for both mother and son. On Thursday, the two were flown to Colombo aboard Gulf Air, accompanied by a medical escort due to Ms. Kadeejas ongoing health issues. In an emotional message of gratitude, Ms. Kadeeja thanked the Sri Lankan Ambassador and embassy staff, as well as Mr. Sudheer Thirunilath of Pravasi Legal Cell Bahrain, the medical team, immigration authorities, and volunteers who provided support throughout the ordeal. --Agencies",

Some demonstrators chanted in support of migrants whom the Trump administration has deported or has been attempting to deport while expressing solidarity with people fired by the federal government and with universities whose funding is threatened by Trump. As Trump and his administration mobilize the use of the U.S. deportation machine, we are going to organize networks and systems of resistance to defend our neighbors, a protester said in a rally at Lafayette Square near the White House. Other protesters waved Palestinian flags while wearing keffiyeh scarves, chanting free Palestine and expressing solidarity with Palestinians killed in Israels war in Gaza. Some demonstrators carried symbols expressing support for Ukraine and urging Washington to be more decisive in opposing Russian President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine. Since his January inauguration, Trump and his billionaire ally, Elon Musk, have gutted the federal government, firing over 200,000 workers and attempting to dismantle various agencies. The administration has also detained scores of foreign students and threatened to stop federal funding to universities over diversity, equity and inclusion programs, climate initiatives and pro-Palestinian protests. Rights groups have condemned the policies. Near the Washington Monument, banners from protesters read: hate never made any nation great and equal rights for all does not mean less rights for you.

        "date": "April 20, 2025 11:28 am",
        "content": "A team of scientists claim to have discovered a new colour that no human has ever seen before. The research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. By stimulating specific cells in the retina, the participants claim to have witnessed a blue-green colour that scientists have called olo, but some experts have said the existence of a new colour is open to argument. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, have been described by the studys co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as remarkable. He and his colleagues believe that the results could potentially further research into colour blindness. Prof Ng, who was one of five people to take part in the experiment, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme on Saturday that olo was more saturated than any colour that you can see in the real world. Lets say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, a pastel pink, he said. And then one day you go to the office and someones wearing a shirt, and its the most intense baby pink youve ever seen, and they say its a new colour and we call it red. During the teams experiment, researchers shone a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant. There were five participants in the study - four male and one female - who all had normal colour vision. Three of the participants - including Prof Ng - were co-authors of the research paper. According to the research paper, the participants looked into a device called Oz which consists of mirrors, lasers and optical devices. The equipment was designed previously by some of the involved researchers - a team of scientists from UC Berkeley and the University of Washington, and updated for use in this study. The retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye responsible for receiving and processing visual information. It converts light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, enabling us to see. The retina includes cone cells, which are cells responsible for perceiving colour. There are three types of cone cells in the eye - S, L and M - and each one is sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red and green respectively. According to the research paper, in normal vision, any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighbouring L andor S cones, because its function overlaps with them. However, in the study, the laser only stimulated M cones, which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision, the paper said. This means the colour olo could not been seen by a persons naked eye in the real world without the help of specific stimulation. To verify the colour observed during the experiment, each participant adjusted a controllable colour dial until it matched olo. Some experts, however, say the new perceived colour is a matter of interpretation. Prof John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St Georges, University of London, who was not involved in the study, said that while the research is a technological feat in stimulating selective cone cells, the discovery of a new colour is open to argument. He explained that if, for example, the red cone cells (L) were stimulated in large numbers, people would perceive a deep red, but the perceived brightness may change depending on changes to red cone sensitivity, which is not unlike what happened in this study. But the studys co-author Prof Ng admitted that although olo is certainly very technically difficult to see, the team is studying the findings to see what it could potentially mean for colour blind people, who find it difficult to distinguish between certain colours.

        "title": "Attacks continue despite Putins Easter truce pledge, Zelensky says",
        "date": "April 20, 2025 02:01 pm",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an impression of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine. In the first six hours of the Easter truce - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties. Putin ordered his forces to stop all military activity in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere. The BBC in Ukraine reports that it has been quieter on the front lines. Because Putins ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but it has been quieter. Before Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies. That is very rare. The only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea. In the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscows announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea. On Sunday morning, Zelensky said Moscow was trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine. Accusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation. Late on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russias actions. Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table  the answer to it must come from Moscow, he wrote on X. Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. It seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelenskys offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace. Few Ukrainians think that is remotely possible. Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period, Putin told Gerasimov. We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions. The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was mutually respected by Ukraine. It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. Reacting to Putins truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. The US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. Last month, Moscow rejected a proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine. US President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would take a pass on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress. He was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end, as it had other priorities to focus on. We need to determine very quickly now - and Im talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable, he added. If its not going to happen, then were just going to move on.

        "date": "April 20, 2025 02:15 pm",
        "content": "Americas oldest serving astronaut Don Pettit has returned to Earth on his 70th birthday. The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule carrying Pettit and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner made a parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstans steppe at 06:20 local time (01:20 GMT) on Sunday. They spent 220 days on board the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting the Earth 3,520 times, the US space agency Nasa said. For Pettit - who has now spent a total of 590 days in space - it was his fourth mission. Still, he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit - that record belongs to John Glenn, who aged 77 flew on a Nasa mission in 1998. He died in 2016. Pettit and the two Russian cosmonauts will now spend some time readjusting to gravity. After that, Pettit - who was born in Oregon on 20 April 1955 - will be flown to Houston in Texas, while Ovchinin and Vagner will go to Russias main space training base in Zvyozdniy Gorodok (Star City) near Moscow. Before their departure from the ISS, the crew handed command of the spaceship to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. Last month, two Nasa astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, finally returned to Earth after spending more than nine months on board the ISS - instead of the initially planned just eight days. They flew to the ISS in June 2024 - but technical issues with the spacecraft they used to get to the space station meant they were only able to return to Earth on 18 March this year.

Further commenting on this matter, President Dissanayake said, We have made preparations. We have renovated warehouses with a total capacity of 300,000 metric tons. We have developed a purchasing plan and have allocated funds to restore dilapidated warehouses. He also added that, as a first step, Rs. 500 million had been provided to the Paddy Marketing Board to purchase paddy, and that Lanka Sathosa has also formulated a plan to purchase more. The President further stated that whether paddy is sold to the government or the private sector, it must be sold at the fixed price set by the government. President Dissanayake also stated that the government would purchase every grain of paddy that falls below the fixed price. He explained that they do not want farmers to struggle to sell their crops or be forced to discard them, and that the government is ready to intervene to keep prices steady. If the price of paddy drops, we will buy it. If it increases, the private sector can handle it. Theres no need for the government to hoard stockpiles of rice. Our goal is to maintain a stable and fair price for farmers and that plan has worked. We will never again allow the agricultural products to be sold for a very low price, the President added.",

        "date": "April 20, 2025 07:25 pm",
        "content": "On the sixth anniversary of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, a collective of Sri Lankas Muslim organizations issued a solemn statement of remembrance and renewed calls for justice, truth, and unity. The tragic Easter Sunday attacks of April 21, 2019, marks its 6th year today. We, the Muslims of Sri Lanka, stand in solemn reflection, offering our deepest condolences to the victims, their families, and all communities affected by this heinous act of terror. The joint statement reaffirmed the communitys longstanding position of total rejection of the attacks and those who carried them out: We categorically and unequivocally reiterate our condemnation of these horrific attacks. Those who carried out these crimes neither represent Islam nor the Muslim community. Their actions stand in total violation of the principles of our faith and the values we uphold. It recalled how from the very beginning, under the guidance of religious scholars the Muslim community rejected and denounced the perpetrators, denying them Islamic funeral rites as a firm statement of our revulsion. Tracing a long legacy of coexistence, the statement noted, For over a thousand years, Muslims have lived in this land as loyal, peaceful, enterprising and contributing citizens. Our history in Sri Lanka is one of coexistence, loyal service, and nation-building through times of both peace and hardship. Despite facing significant injustices, discrimination, and vilification, the Muslim community had always chosen the path of patience and peace, never responding with extremism or violence. The signatories warned that the attacks were not only acts of terror but also part of a broader conspiracy aimed at maligning Islam and vilifying and marginalizing the Muslim community, and insisted that those truly responsiblethe masterminds, not scapegoatsbe brought to justice. Justice delayed is justice denied, the statement added, lamenting that six years later, the real culprits remain unidentified and the core questions surrounding the attacks remain unanswered. With urgency, the statement called attention to the ongoing use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act: We further highlight with deep concern the prolonged detention of Muslim individuals under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), often without charge or conviction. Such practices have only deepened mistrust and fear. They urged the government to bring all investigations to a transparent and credible conclusion without further delay. Calling for systemic change, the statement emphasized: We renew our call for meaningful transformation of the institutions, structures and political culture that have repeatedly allowed cycles of violence and impunity to take root in Sri Lanka. The statement connected the need for justice across Sri Lankas many wounded communities. Justice must be delivered not only for the victims of Easter Sunday but for all communities that have suffered injusticeincluding Tamil civilians during the long civil war, Sinhala youth during the insurrections of 1971 and 1989, and Muslim communities who have endured discrimination and violence during incidents such as the Aluthgama attacks, Gintota attacks, Digana attacks, Minuwangoda attacks, and the forced cremations of COVID-19 victims. Gratitude was also extended to Catholic leadership and other communities. We express our heartfelt gratitude to His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Catholic Church, and the many individuals across all religious and ethnic groups who stood against collective blame and punishment and advocated for justice during the difficult times that followed. Their courage and solidarity will never be forgotten. Reaffirming their national belonging, the signatories concluded: As a community, we are committed to moving forwardnot as a marginalized group, but as equal and enlightened citizens of this country. They urged all Sri Lankans to reject division and suspicion to build trust across communities, and to shape a future based on peace, compassion, and true national unity. The memory of the victims must be honoured not with more hate and injustice, but by ensuring that Sri Lanka becomes a land where truth prevails, justice is served, and every citizenregardless of faith or ethnicitycan live with dignity and equality. The statement was endorsed by over 15 prominent organizations, including the All Ceylon Jammiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL), All Ceylon YMMA Conference (YMMA), and Sri Lanka Jamaathe Islami (SLJI), among others.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that individuals entangled in corrupt politics are currently in a state of visible unease, and that the notion that nationalism has become the final refuge of those politically abandoned is being strongly confirmed in recent times. The Prime Minister made these remarks while addressing a public meeting of the NPP movement today (20) at the Nedunkeni Cultural Hall in the Vanni District, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister stated: In the past, the political landscape of our country was fragmented into Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Hill Country politics and treated separately. Politicians upheld their political culture by dividing communities based on region and ethnicity and it is within such framework that corruption in politics took place. It is said that nationalism is the final refuge of the politically orphaned but we are well aware that you elect our government by rejecting ethnic and religious divisions, with the firm intention of transforming that outdated political culture. For the first time in the history, the people cast their votes based on policy and vision, rather than the identity or affiliation. Yesterday, I participated in several public meetings in the Kilinochchi District and visited a number of households in the area. In almost every home, at least one family member has migrated abroad, separated from their loved ones. The fundamental reason for this is the lack of opportunities for economic advancement in rural areas. For far too long, the rural development has been neglected, not due to the lack of fund allocations at the provincial council level, but because those in positions of power failed to show sensitivity to the needs of the people. Provincial councils are intended to facilitate essential community development, including roads, drainage systems, preschools, and bus terminals. These are basic needs that directly impact the daily lives of the citizens. We have endured considerable hardship, and it is time to break this cycle. Our aspiration is to bequeath a prosperous and dignified nation to the generations that follow. The event was attended by Deputy Minister of Co-operative Development Upali Samarasinghe, Member of Parliament M. Jegatheeswaran, provincial council candidates representing the NPP, and a large number of local residents.",

        "title": "Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of breaking Easter ceasefire, no extension seen",
        "date": "April 20, 2025 10:15 pm",
        "content": "Russia and Ukraine blamed each other on Sunday for breaking a one-day Easter ceasefire declared by President Vladimir Putin, with both sides accusing the other of hundreds of attacks and the Kremlin saying there was no order for an extension. Putin, who sent thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, ordered his forces to stop all military activity along the front line in the three-year-old war until midnight Moscow time (2100 GMT) on Sunday. Five hours before that expiry, TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying there was no order from Putin to extend the ceasefire. There were no other commands, Peskov was quoted as saying when asked if it could be prolonged. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia was pretending to observe the Easter ceasefire, but had in fact continued hundreds of artillery attacks on Saturday night, with more assaults on Sunday. Russia launched 46 assaults from midnight until 4 p.m. local time (1300 GMT), including with heavy weapons, Zelenskiy wrote on the X social media platform. Either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favourable PR coverage, Zelenskiy posted. Russias Defence Ministry said Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times, inflicting damage to infrastructure and causing some civilian deaths. The ministry said Ukrainian forces had shot at Russian positions 444 times while it had counted more than 900 Ukrainian drone attacks, including attacks on Crimea and the Russian border areas of the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions. As a result, there are deaths and injuries among the civilian population, as well as damage to civilian facilities, the ministry said. Ukraines military said earlier on Sunday that activity on the front line had decreased. Some Russian military bloggers also said frontline activity had declined substantially. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the battlefield reports from either side. The apparent failure to observe even an Easter ceasefire shows how hard it will be for U.S. President Donald Trump to achieve his aim of clinching a lasting deal to end what he calls the bloodbath of the Ukraine war. The U.S. will walk away from efforts to broker a peace deal unless there are clear signs of progress soon, Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Friday. Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly warned of the escalation risk of the war - which his administration now casts as a proxy conflict between the U.S. and Russia, echoing Moscows stance. Last month, after Ukraine accepted Trumps proposal for a 30-day truce, Putin said crucial issues of verification had not been sorted out. Both Moscow and Kyiv have agreed to a moratorium on attacks on energy targets and at sea, which each accuses the other of breaking. Zelenskiy reiterated that Kyiv was willing to extend the ceasefire for 30 days but said that if Russia kept fighting on Sunday, so would Ukraine. The Ukrainian army is acting  and will continue to act  in a fully symmetrical manner, he wrote on X. Putin told his top general, Valery Gerasimov, to be ready to respond in full if Kyiv broke the truce. Russia controls just under one fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Putin, when announcing the ceasefire before heading to an Orthodox Easter service, said the truce would show whether or not Ukraine was ready or able to implement peace. Putin thanked Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and leaders from the BRICS group of emerging economies for attempts to mediate. The European Union reacted cautiously to Putins ceasefire declaration, saying Moscow could stop the war immediately if it wanted to. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated U.N. support for meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraines sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Easter falls on the same day this year for Orthodox and Western churches, and Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to give up hope that peace will one day return. We know what we are defending. We know what we are fighting for, he said in a social media video, wearing a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt and standing in front of Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv.

        "date": "April 21, 2025 06:45 am",
        "content": "The Israeli military on Sunday said a review into last months killing of emergency responders in Gaza found there had been several professional failures and that a commander would be dismissed over the incident. The 15 paramedics and other rescue workers were shot dead on March 23 in three separate shootings at the same location near the southern Gaza city of Rafah. They were buried in a shallow grave where their bodies were found a week later by officials from the United Nations and the Palestinian Red Crescent. In a statement on Sunday, the military said a commanding officer is to be reprimanded. A deputy commander, a reservist who was the field commander, will be dismissed from his position for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report, it said. The examination identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident, the military said. The fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops, who believed they faced a tangible threat from enemy forces. The third incident involved a breach of orders during a combat setting, it said. The military advocate general was conducting its own investigation and criminal charges could be pursued, according to the military. A video recovered from the mobile phone of one of the dead men and published by the Palestinian Red Crescent showed uniformed emergency responders and clearly marked ambulances and fire trucks, with their lights on, being fired on by soldiers. Major General Yoav Har-Even, who conducted the review, told reporters that soldiers, from a special forces unit, had believed they were under threat after firing on what they initially determined as a Hamas vehicle but was in fact an ambulance. Two occupants were killed and a third was detained and questioned over suspected Hamas links. The man was released the next day after further questioning. The military says Hamas often conceals its activities amongst civilians and that there had been cases in the past where the militant group used ambulances to carry out operations. Still, it says soldiers are told to distinguish between genuine emergency vehicles and those used by Hamas. Military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters the incident took place in a complex combat zone but was clearly a mistake by the soldiers and there had been no attempt to cover up the incident, which was reported immediately. In addition to the two killed in the first incident, Har-Even said 12 people were killed in the second shooting and another person was killed in the third incident. Injuries Red Crescent and U.N. officials have said 17 paramedics and emergency workers from the Red Crescent, the Civil Emergency service and the U.N. had been dispatched to respond to reports of injuries from Israeli air strikes. The military said in its statement that in the second shooting the deputy commander did not initially recognise the vehicles as ambulances due to what they said was poor night visibility and ordered troops to open fire on a group of individuals who emerged from a fire truck and ambulances. In a briefing with reporters, the military presented drone footage of the incident which showed the unit of about 20 soldiers opening fire on a fire truck and ambulances from a distance of around 30 metres. Har-Even said the soldiers had believed they were firing on a group of Hamas fighters and only realized they had shot paramedics when they conducted a scan of the site after the engagement. Paramedic Munther Abed, who was detained by the military and later released, has said soldiers opened fire on clearly marked emergency response vehicles. The Red Cross said on April 13 another Palestinian emergency responder was being held by Israeli authorities. The military said on Sunday that he is still in Israeli custody. The military has said, without providing evidence, that six of the 15 emergency responders killed were later identified as Hamas terrorists. Hamas has rejected the accusation. About 15 minutes after the soldiers opened fire on the group of emergency responders, the military said that soldiers fired at a Palestinian UN vehicle. The military blamed operational errors in breach of regulation for the incident. At dawn, it was decided to gather and cover the bodies to prevent further harm and clear the vehicles from the route in preparation for civilian evacuation, the military said, adding that removing the bodies was reasonable under the circumstances but that crushing the vehicles was wrong. In general, there was no attempt to conceal the event, which was discussed with international organizations and the UN, including coordination for the removal of bodies, it said.

Badulla Magistrate Nujith de Silva issued this order, over the misappropriation of an amount of Rs. 1 million. MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was taken into custody on March 27, over three separate corruption-related cases. The allegations stem from his tenure as Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016. According to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. Earlier, he was granted bail by Colombo Magistrates Court in two separate occasions in relation to the cases, while he was remanded again after being produced before the Badulla Magistrates Court over corruption charges.",

        "date": "April 21, 2025 11:54 am",
        "content": "U.S. Vice President JD Vance began a four-day visit to India on Monday and will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as New Delhi rushes to avoid steep U.S. tariffs with an early trade deal and boost ties with the Trump administration. Their discussions will cover the first day of Vances largely personal visit to the country with his family, which includes visiting the Taj Mahal and attending a wedding in the city of Jaipur, people familiar with the matter said. Vances wife, Usha, is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Vance landed at New Delhis Palam airport on Monday following a visit to Rome, where he held a private meeting with Pope Francis on Easter Sunday. Modi and Vance are expected to review progress made on the bilateral agenda outlined in February when the Indian leader met President Donald Trump in Washington. It includes fairness in their two-way trade and growing their defence partnership. The Indian prime minister was one of the first world leaders to meet Trump after he took office, and Reuters has reported that his government is open to cutting tariffs on more than half of its imports from the U.S., which were worth a total 41.8 billion in 2024, as part of a trade deal. However, the U.S. president has continued to call India a tariff abuser and tariff king. We are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters on Thursday, speaking about Vances engagements in India. The U.S. is Indias largest trading partner and their two-way bilateral trade reached 129 billion in 2024, with a 45.7 billion surplus in favour of India, U.S. government trade data show. Officials in New Delhi are expecting to clinch a trade deal with the U.S. within the 90-day pause on tariff hikes announced by Trump on April 9 for major trading partners, including Delhi. Vances tour in India is also seen as laying the ground for Trumps visit to the country later in the year for the summit of leaders of the Quad grouping that includes India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. Harsh Pant, foreign policy head at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in Delhi, said the timing of Vances visit was critical in the backdrop of trade talks. The fact that the US-China tensions are ramping up, and Vance in particular seems to have taken a very high profile role in American diplomacy, also means that the visit assumes an added layer of significance, he said. Vance is accompanied by U.S. administration officials, but the two sides are unlikely to sign any deals during the visit, people familiar with the matter said. India and the U.S. expect to ink a framework for defence partnership this year, while New Delhi also plans to procure and co-produce arms including Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles, according to a joint statement issued after the February meeting. Discussions on such procurements would be taken forward during U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseths expected visit to India in the next couple of months, people familiar with the matter said.

According to News 18, the elaborate set, built for the film in Andipatti, Theni district, was completely gutted in the blaze. The fire reportedly spread quickly due to strong winds, causing the entire structure to be reduced to ashes. Firefighters rushed to the spot and managed to extinguish the flames after a strenuous effort. Cause under investigation; no injuries reported. Thankfully, no one from the crew was present at the location when the fire occurred. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, though officials have confirmed that it likely began after filming had already shifted to a new location. With no injuries reported, fans of the actor and the film breathed a sigh of relief as updates confirmed everyones safety. The team is currently shooting in Thailand. The cast and crew of Idli Kady are currently stationed in Thailand for a crucial leg of the shoot. Prominent actors including Sathyaraj, Parthiban, and Arun Vijay are part of the ongoing schedule in Bangkok. The team had earlier wrapped up filming in Anupatti and Andipatti before moving overseas. The fire broke out at the unused set that had not yet been dismantled, and it was reportedly left disassembled to complete some patchwork once the team finished their overseas schedule. Dhanushs fans express concern and support. As news of the fire spread, fans took to social media to express concern over the incident but were reassured upon learning that Dhanush and his team were unharmed. While the loss of the set is significant, production is continuing without delay, and the team is expected to resume shooting additional portions in alternate locations.

        "date": "April 21, 2025 12:33 pm",
        "content": "Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith accuses that elements of the previous political leadership are continuing efforts to suppress the truth surrounding the deadly Easter Sunday terror attacks, through certain government institutions even today. The Cardinal made these remarks during the main memorial service held this morning (April 21) at St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade, marking the sixth anniversary of the coordinated bombings that claimed over 250 lives in 2019. He alleged that a para-state is operating within the country, controlled by various government entities influenced by politically defeated forces. He emphasized that this structure continues to obstruct the path to justice. Cardinal Ranjith reaffirmed his hope that those responsible for the attacks would be brought to justice without delay and made a series of direct appeals to the President, outlining the following seven key requests: 1. Presenting the full report pertaining to the Easter Sunday terror attacks to the Parliament and make it public. 2. Establish an independent prosecutors office to oversee investigations and prosecutions related to the attacks. 3. Identify all forces behind the attacks, reveal the full truth to the public, and prosecute those responsible regardless of their rank or position. 4. Fully implement the recommendations of the report provided by the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate the attacks dated September 21, 2019. 5. Investigate the alleged ties between the Military Intelligence Unit and alleged terrorist leader Zahran Hashim, and thoroughly examine the claims made in the UKs Channel 4 program, including statements from key witness Asad Maulana. 6. Enact new laws to dismantle the lawlessness and para-political structures that enabled the conspiracy behind the attacks. 7. Foster a new political culture where those in power serve the people, rather than ruling over them. The Cardinal strongly criticized the former Attorney General Dappula de Liverra for failing to act on indications of a grand conspiracy behind the bombings, and accused subsequent legal authorities of displaying deference toward those in power while undermining public accountability. Despite Presidents sincere commitment to justice and the appointment of a team of high-ranking officials to lead the effort, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith expressed concern that the prevailing legal framework and the inertia of certain officials have created serious obstacles to progress. He noted that the public had granted the current government a two-thirds majority in the hope that it would initiate the constitutional and legal reforms necessary to identify and prosecute those responsible for dark chapters in Sri Lankas history  including human rights violations, enforced disappearances, white van abductions, torture chambers, underworld violence, and the rise of private armed groups. Cardinal Ranjith emphasized that the Easter Sunday terror attacks remain a painful and unresolved tragedy. He stressed that if the existing laws are insufficient to ensure justice, it is the governments duty to change them  boldly and decisively. He further urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to take firm action to eradicate all forms of anti-democratic and politically motivated activity, and to honour the promise he made in Katuwapitiya, Negombo on October 6, 2024  to ensure that the blood of the innocent would not be forgotten, and to uncover the full truth behind the attacks. It is our sincere hope, Mr. President, that you will not allow this national tragedy to be buried by time, Cardinal Ranjith said. Justice must prevail, and all those involved must be held accountable.",

        "title": "Drones can deliver supplies on Mount Everest this year, and it may change climbing forever",
        "date": "April 21, 2025 12:38 pm",
        "content": "At the top of the world amid pristine white glaciers and towering rock, silence reigns. Suddenly it is broken by a ladder falling from the sky. Milan Pandey is sitting back down at Everest Base Camp, looking out over views that few have ever seen  and he got there without having to pull on a crampon or wield an ice ax. He is a drone pilot, and his work may change things on the worlds highest mountain forever. The ladders, ropes and oxygen cylinders that Pandey can transport via drone to aid the Sherpas or icefall doctors at Khumbu Icefall, a glacier located between Base Camp and Camp One, could likely save lives on the mountain. Specialist Sherpas who hail from the nearby hills and mountains have been navigating and setting the trail for climbers on Everest for seven decades. Dozens have lost their lives in the process. Pandey, of Airlift Technology, a local drone-mapping start-up, believes that with his technical expertise in using drones combined with the Sherpas decades of mountaineering knowledge, they can make it safer to be on the roof of the world. Base Camp is located at a height of about 5,364 meters (17,598 ft) above sea level and Camp One at 6,065 meters (19,900 feet). The aerial distance between the two points is roughly 1.8 miles. It takes Sherpas six to seven hours to make this journey, but it takes a drone about six to seven minutes. Mingma G Sherpa of Imagine Nepal, an expedition company thats been guiding climbers for nearly a decade, recognized the need for this kind of assistance when he lost three of his friends and mountain guides in an avalanche in 2023. Their bodies could not be recovered. They had to keep going up and down the mountain twenty times to first figure out the route and then come back for the equipment. I had heard they use drones in China to help with this on another mountain, so I thought why not here? he said. Around the same time, Raj Bikram, CEO of Airlift Nepal, was in touch with the Khumbu municipality for 3D-mapping Mount Everest using drones when the regions mayor asked how much weight the drones could carry. In April 2024, with the help of two drones donated by Chinas DJI, Airlift began experimenting. In the beginning, because it was also our first time at the Everest Base Camp, we were not sure how the drone would perform at that altitude and at that temperature, Bikram said. Visibility and wind speeds are among the main challenges. It took a month for them to learn the terrain. Airlift Nepals first clean-up drive used a drone to bring down about 1100 pounds of trash from Camp One to Base Camp. That took more than 40 flights: The drone can carry about 66 pounds of weight, but they only transport about 44 pounds at a time to be safe. For the 2025 Everest climbing season, Pandey says that Airlift Technology will help Sherpas transport equipment before the season starts, then pick up trash once it begins. The Sherpas tell Pandey which direction they need to go, then Pandey flies a small drone first to navigate the trail. Then, the Sherpas do what theyve always done  climb to the precarious icefalls, or the parts of a glacier that are the hardest to navigate. Once they find out here we need a ladder, here we need a rope, they will send us the coordinates via walkie-talkie and then we fly the equipment there, Pandey explained. The drones are also able to fly in life-saving equipment like oxygen cylinders and medicines. Scaling up Airlift currently has two DJI drones, only one of which is being operated on Everest this year. The second one is a backup, and if theres need for more drone flights, theyll consider deploying both. One challenge is money. Each drone costs 70,000, and thats before they even begin operating. Everything is expensive at Base Camp, Bikram said. Because theres no electricity we need a lot of fuel to charge batteries. The cost of actually getting to the camp, the manpower cost, accommodation, food, theres a lot. For Bikram, an aeronautical engineer, drones have always been a passion. He made a DIY Drone in Nepal over a decade ago at a time when they were almost nonexistent in the country. This proved vital in assisting aid efforts during the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Its not just that we are providing equipment. Search and rescue is one of our main priorities. When people veer off the trail we can help geolocate them, Pandey added. Some in the Sherpa community are turning away from working in the perilous high mountains and instead are moving abroad for better jobs and pay. We hope that our drones will actually make this a safer profession and bring more people back to this climbing tradition. Its what our country is known for, and without the expertise of the Sherpas we would never be able to navigate this terrain, Pandey said. Behind the frontman 28-year-old Dawa Janzu Sherpa has been a frontman on Everest with the icefall doctors for eight years. The team of Sherpas is led by an elder who has developed his expertise in navigation and decides the trail, but it is the frontman with his might and youth who goes to the icefall first. This season there is a lot of dry ice which makes it very hard to fix trails, and there are a lot of ice towers in between, he said. While drones can now be used to determine a tentative path before they set out, inclement weather means that things are constantly changing. Janzu Sherpa says this is a risky job, and with employment hard to come by, for him, this work has been more about the paycheck than the passion. Drones have been reducing time and risk level by half. Our work is time sensitive. If we dont fix the trails quickly upcoming expeditions will be slowed down, so having the drones bring the equipment up means that we dont have to go back down just to bring the ladder up with us. With the bad weather weve seen so far this year we would not have fixed the trail in time if not for that help, he added. Janzu Sherpa is the sole breadwinner for his wife and two daughters. This is an adventurous job and there is a lot of risk, so if theres a way to make it safer I welcome it. The first group of climbers have reached Base Camp for the 2025 climbing season. Its a narrow season, so almost everyone will attempt their ascents in April and May. Drone use is part of the evolution of climbing, says Caroline Ogle of New Zealand-based Adventure Consultants, who has spent five seasons at Base Camp managing expeditions from what she refers to as the amphitheater of Everest. If you compare back to the early years  when there were no satellite phones or the kind of weather forecasting we have available now, all those types of technology have evolved to make climbing safer. I feel the use of drones is part of that natural evolution, particularly in the context of making things safer for the high altitude workers (Sherpas), Ogle said. Lisa Thompson, who has climbed the seven summits  the highest peak on all seven of the traditional continents  and now trains climbers through US based Alpine Athletics, agrees with Ogle and sees drones as a welcome and responsible evolution. I dont believe this innovation takes away from the craft or tradition of climbing. The mountain is still the mountain. The challenge is still real. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "The third unit of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, which had been temporarily shut during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays due to reduced electricity demand, has been successfully restarted at 11:00 a.m. today (April 21). With this development, all three units of the plant are now operational, boosting national capacity to meet the recent surge in electricity demand. In an official statement, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) announced that the renewable energy curtailment program which began on April 10 to maintain grid stability during the holiday period was concluded early due to increased electricity demand. Originally scheduled to continue until 3.00 p.m. on April 21, the curtailment has been lifted a day earlierat 3.00 p.m. on April 20due to a notable increase in electricity demand. CEB wishes to inform the public that renewable energy management which commenced on April 10 ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays due to reduced electricity demand, and need to ensure grid stability has now been concluded earlier than scheduled, CEB Spokesman, Engineer Dhammika Wimalaratne said. We extend our sincere thanks to nearly 100,000 solar suppliers and prosumers, including domestic rooftop owners, net-plus and net-plus-plus commercial producers, whose cooperation during this critical period was instrumental in safeguarding national grid stability, he expressed. Earlier, in response to the drastic drop in power consumption during the festive period, the CEB deactivated all operational thermal power plants. One generator at Norochcholai was taken offline on April 11, followed by the suspension of operations at the Kelanitissa Naphtha Power Plant on April 12. Throughout the holiday season, the CEB prioritized the use of hydroelectric and renewable energy sources. This strategy was informed by a detailed analysis of anticipated electricity demand and renewable energy output, enabling the utility to make targeted operational adjustments. The CEB also implemented temporary disconnections of rooftop solar systems exceeding 100 kilowatts, and on April 13, requested all rooftop solar power unit owners to cease generation during daylight hours. The board emphasized that disconnections should only occur upon receipt of an SMS notification and only until 3:00 p.m. on specified days. Reiterating its gratitude, the CEB acknowledged the crucial role played by the public, particularly solar power users, in ensuring grid stability during this sensitive period.",

        "content": "Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, died on Monday (Apr 21) at the age of 88. The Vatican announced his death on Monday, stating that the pope had died at his residence in the Vaticans Casa Santa Marta. Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis, Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vaticans TV channel. At 7.35am this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. The Argentine pontiff had been recovering at the Santa Marta guesthouse. He was hospitalised for five weeks earlier this year with life-threatening pneumonia. While in hospital, he almost died twice. The double pneumonia damaged his lungs and strained his respiratory muscles, doctors said. After being discharged on Mar 23, he returned to the Vatican for a convalescence of at least two months. In early April, the Vatican said a chest X-ray confirmed a slight improvement in Pope Francis lungs and improvements were also reported in his motor skills, voice and breathing. Although he had continued to use oxygen through a cannula, the pope had been able to remove it for short periods. The pope had issued statements, including one on Mar 16, acknowledging his fragile health. I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: Fragile, at this time, like me, he wrote. Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope. On the day he left the Gemelli, he appeared in a wheelchair on a hospital balcony, waving his hands from his lap to the hundreds of pilgrims gathered below to greet him. He spoke a few words in a weak voice, saying through a microphone: Thank you, everyone. Pope Francis became head of the Catholic Church in March 2013. He is the spiritual leader of 1.3 billion Roman Catholics worldwide. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 to Italian immigrants from Argentina, he was the first Latin American to lead the Catholic Church. Despite several health troubles, he remained an active pontiff, with a busy weekly schedule and regular overseas trips. In September 2024, he completed a four-nation Asia-Pacific tour, including Singapore, the longest of his papacy by duration and distance. Source: Agencies",

The announcement was made by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, from the Popes residence at the Casa Santa Marta.

Pope Francis had been battling a respiratory illness for several weeks, having been hospitalized in February at the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital. Though he returned to the Vatican in March, his condition gradually worsened. Throughout his pontificate, Pope Francis inspired the world with his call for mercy, justice, and care for the poor. His papacy was marked by simplicity, humility, and a renewed focus on synodality and dialogue. In 2024, the Holy Father approved a revised liturgical rite for papal funerals, emphasizing the role of the Pope as a disciple and pastor rather than a worldly figure. His funeral arrangements, following his wishes for simplicity, will be announced soon. The faithful of the Archdiocese of Colombo offer prayers of thanksgiving for his life and ministry and commend his soul to the mercy of the Risen Lord.",

The Prime Minister made these remarks while addressing public gatherings at the Manik Farm Community Development Centre in Settikulam and the Ukkulankulam Ground in the Vanni electoral district. Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya has noted that the current Parliament has the highest number of female representation in Parliament in history however previously, women constituted less than 5 per cent of Parliament despite 52 per cent of the countrys population being women. The Prime Minister said, Women play a significant role in sustaining the economy, maintaining family structures, and upholding society yet their representation in decision-making bodies has been limited. Therefore, we urge you to elect not only male representation to Parliament but also more female representatives from the Vanni district in the upcoming elections. We recognize that education holds significant value for the people of the North. You place great importance on education. However, the countrys education system has deteriorated and weakened. Specifically, the lack of necessary attention to the education sector in the North has made it more challenging compared to other regions. Moreover, I have learned of a more alarming issue that the diminishing value placed on education by young men and women. Clandestine Drug Distribution and alcohol are now readily visible everywhere. There are no avenues for youth to find joy while avoiding these substances. The underdevelopment of fields such as science, arts, and drama has left them without means to find happiness. Therefore, significant interventions must be necessary. If you elect a group that is free from corruption and fraud, we can allocate funds without hesitation, ensuring they reach the appropriate hands. These funds can then be directed towards the development of your village. That is why your choice is important, Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya added further.",

Always known for his progressive thoughts, Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, passed away on Monday (April 21), at the age of 88. He died at 7:35 AM (Rome time) at his residence at the Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City, following a prolonged battle with double pneumonia that began in February 2025. Elected in 2013, he succeeded Pope Benedict XVI and became the first Latin American pope and the first Jesuit to lead the Roman Catholic Church. During his tenure, he advocated for social justice, environmental stewardship and worked for the homeless and several other communities. He is considered one of the most beloved popes due to his work on social justice. Now, following his death, many global leaders are reacting on social media, expressing their admiration and love for Pope Francis. On Easter Sunday, he made his last appearance, on the loggia above St. Peters Square, where he briefly wished pilgrims a happy Easter. He granted a brief audience the same day to U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Reacting to the popes death, Vance wrote on his social media account: I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him. Vance said he would always remember the homily Pope Francis preached in an almost empty St. Peters Square in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world. It was really quite beautiful, Vance commented. May God rest his soul. Among the first heads of state to respond was Frances Emmanuel Macron, who most recently met with Pope Francis in Corsica in December 2024. From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest of the poor. To unite people with each other and with nature. May this hope be resurrected unceasingly beyond him, Macron wrote on twitter.com. My wife and I send our thoughts to all Catholics and to the grieving world. Britains King Charles III was the last head of state to meet with Pope Francis, when he visited the convalescing pope at the Vatican April 9 with Queen Camilla. In a tribute posted on social media, he wrote: My wife and I were most deeply saddened to learn of the death of Pope Francis. Our heavy hearts have been somewhat eased, however, to know that His Holiness was able to share an Easter greeting with the Church and the world he served with such devotion throughout his life and ministry. His Holiness will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith, and to those of goodwill who work for the benefit of others. His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world. Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many. The king added: The Queen and I remember with particular affection our meetings with His Holiness over the years and we were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month. We send our most heartfelt condolences and profound sympathy to the Church he served with such resolve and to the countless people around the world who, inspired by his life, will be mourning the devastating loss of this faithful follower of Jesus Christ. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world as he spoke fondly of his meetings with the late Pontiff and added his affection for the people of India will always be cherished. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said in social media posts a great man has left us as she noted she had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his counsel and his teachings, which never failed, not even in times of trial and suffering. Israels President Isaac Herzog praised Pope Francis commitment to fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue as a path toward greater understanding and mutual respect. I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered, Herzog said. Australias Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote that the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere was close to the people of Australia. For Australian Catholics, he was a devoted champion and loving father, he said. --With input from Agencies",

Accordingly, former President Wickremesinghe has been requested to be present before the Commission at 09.30 a.m. on Thursday (April 25). The former President was previously summoned to the Bribery Commission on April 17. In response to the previous summons, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe had indicated that he is prepared to appear before the Commission but requested a different date citing that his attorneys will not be available in Colombo during the New Year holiday period. In response to a letter directed by CIABOC previously, the Office of the former President had also stated that it was baffling and surprising about the quick reaction by the Bribery Commission to follow up on his media statement, which was given mere 18 hours prior. Earlier, in a letter directed to former President Wickremesinghe, the Assistant Director General of the CIABOC, Asitha Anthony requested him to be present before the Commission on April 17 with regard to a statement the ex-president had made about the case. According to the letter, the Assistant Director General noted that the media statement made by the former President indicates that he has more information regarding the case and by making the statement he has gotten involved in the on-going investigations. Accordingly, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe was requested to present any relevant information to substantiate his recent statements made pertaining to the case filed against MP Dassanayake. According to the letter, if the former President fails to appear before the Commission without a valid reason, the commission is bound to act according to the provisions given in article 126 of the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023. On April 7, former president Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake withdrew the fixed deposits belonging to the Uva provincial council, over which he is now facing corruption charges, in accordance with a circular issued during his tenure as the Prime Minister. The former President questioned whether the MPs arrest over the matter was in response to his vocal criticism of the government in parliament. Parliamentarian Chamara Sampath Dassanayake is currently in remand custody for allegedly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 1 million of the Uva Provincial Council in 2016. MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was taken into custody on March 27, over three separate corruption-related cases. The Colombo Magistrates Court previously granted bail in the cases filed against him but he remains in remand custody due to an order issued by the Badulla Magistrates Court. According to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission filed a case against the MP, citing the government incurred a financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions.",

Deshabandu Tennakoon was granted bail on 10 April by the Matara Magistrates Court. He has been ordered to appear before the Matara Magistrate for allegedly acting in violation of court orders while leaving the court premises. Accordingly, Deshabandu Tennakoon and the owner of the car that was used to transport the suspended IGP out of the court complex on 10 April have been summoned before the Matara Magistrate. The order was issued today after court considered a motion filed by the Attorney General in which it is alleged that the suspended IGP had violated court orders, Ada Derana reporter said. Suspended IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon surrendered to court on March 19 and subsequently remanded. However, he was granted bail on April 10 under two sureties of Rs.1 million each, Ada Derana reporter said. After an arrest warrant was issued in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama in December 2023, he surrendered to court by submitting a motion after absconding for nearly 20 days. The Matara Magistrates Court previously issued an arrest order for eight police officers, including former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, naming them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was instructed to arrest and present the eight individuals, including Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court. On March 17, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ petition filed by Tennakoon, in which he sought an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court in connection with the shooting incident. The Court of Appeal subsequently directed the CID to take immediate steps to arrest Tennakoon and present him before court.",

Starting today (April 21), the relic will be on display for public veneration from 11.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., the Temple of Tooth Relic confirmed. The decision comes in response to the significantly increased number of pilgrims arriving in Kandy from across the country.

The former President therefore urged UNP candidates to forge alliances with other opposition party representatives to defeat the NPP. The post of chairperson is allocated to the group that has a majority in each of the local government bodies and therefore it is imperative that discussions are held to unite different political groups, said the UNP leader. Former President Wickremesinghe added that voters should now have a good understanding about the capabilities of the incumbent government which is led by the NPP. The UNP leader also questioned whether the voters are prepared to give the same group that won the two previous elections another opportunity at the 2025 LG Election.

        "date": "April 21, 2025 08:45 pm",
        "content": "From the Vatican to the Philippines, Catholics around the world are spending Easter Monday mourning the death of Pope Francis. Less than 24 hours before the Vaticans announcement, he had appeared at St Peters Square to greet worshippers on Easter Sunday - one of the most important dates in the calendar for followers of the faith. The timing of Pope Franciss death is not lost on Catholics. He God chose the most beautiful day for the Christian Church - he couldnt have chosen a better day, said Father Sergio Codera, a Salesian priest from Spain. He continued: It Easter is the most important occasion Christians celebrate, when we celebrate that death does not have the final word. And it has been this day that God has chosen for Pope Francis to meet him. In the Vatican, there is shock from those who saw Francis perform his final public duty. It was very shocking - we just saw him yesterday for the Easter celebration and we received a blessing, one man in St Peters Square told the BBC. One woman who heard his address said: He took his duty to the people so seriously - even when he was so unwell yesterday, he still came out, he was still part of the Easter mass, he still got to speak to us. Church bells have been ringing out across Manila, the capital of the Philippines, where worshippers have gathered in churches to pray and reflect on the Popes death. Around 85 of the nations population of 110 million are Roman Catholic, making it the churchs stronghold in Asia. Among them is Jude Aquino, an altar server who reflected on the Popes influence on young Catholics shortly after his death was confirmed. He told Reuters news agency: Its a big hit against the Catholic Church because for the youth like us, hes such a big role model - a role model whom we follow since hes a vicar of Christ. Catholics in rebel-held Bukavu, a city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, have gathered at Notre-Dame de la Paix Cathedral to mourn. Around half of DR Congos population is Catholic, the largest such community in Africa. Pope Francis addressed half a million worshipers in the capital Kinshasa in 2023, becoming the first Pope to visit the conflict-ridden country in more than three decades. During his final address on Easter Sunday, the pope called for an end to violence in the country. Pope Francis was a pope who loved our country, the DRC, very much, Sifa Albertina said outside the cathedral. He even decided to come to DRC despite his health condition, to meet the Congolese people and share their difficulties. I saw him come to Congo. May God welcome his soul, because the pope really cared about us. In Spain, where Catholics make up more than half of the population, three days of national mourning have been declared. Nuria Ortega, a civil servant from Madrid, said: I think he was a person that was accepted by all by Catholic and non Catholics and I think he was a person that was open to dialogue. As the search for a successor to Francis began, student Javier Herratia said the church must become more humble and appeal to a young generation. He continued: We will have faith in the Holy Spirit and hope that the next Pope is as good as the rest. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "After Pope Francis death, focus turns to cardinals who will elect next pontiff",
        "date": "April 21, 2025 09:47 pm",
        "content": "With the death of Pope Francis, announced by the Vatican on Monday, Roman Catholics around the globe will start speculating on who among the red-robed cardinals will succeed him. Given the nature of cardinal appointments Francis made during his papacy, there will inevitably be some expectation that the Argentine pontiffs successor will be another non-European, and that like Francis he could be another progressive, opposed to the Churchs conservative wing. However, the election process that will take place once Francis is buried is highly secretive and nothing will be certain until white smoke pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel tells the world that a new pope has been picked. Cardinals are a pontiffs closest collaborators, running key departments at the Vatican and dioceses around the world. When a pope dies or resigns, those cardinals aged under 80 are eligible to enter a secret conclave to choose the new head of the nearly 1.4 billion-member Roman Catholic Church from among themselves. The complex vote will reveal if the current cardinals, most of them put there by Francis, believe his embrace of liberal social values and his progressive reform agenda have gone too far and whether a period of retrenchment is needed. The cardinals will set the date for the start of the conclave after they start arriving in Rome in the coming days. Only a pope can appoint cardinals and the type of men he chooses can leave his stamp on the Church long after his reign - because of their status as senior clerics and because one of them may end up as pontiff. As of April 21 there were a total of 252 cardinals, 135 of them cardinal electors under 80. 109 of the electors were appointed by Francis, 22 by his predecessor Benedict and five by John Paul II. Cardinals are created at ceremonies called consistories, where they are given their ring, a red biretta - a square cap - and pledge loyalty to the pope, even if it means shedding blood or sacrificing their lives, as signified by the colour red. Pope Francis held 10 consistories and with each of them, he increased the chances that his successor will be another non-European, having beefed up the Church in places where it is either a tiny minority or where it is growing faster than in the mostly stagnant West. For many centuries, most cardinals were Italian, except for a period when the papacy was based in Avignon between 1309-1377, when many were French. The internationalisation of the College of Cardinals began in earnest under Paul VI (1963-1978). It was greatly accelerated by John Paul II (1978-2005), a Pole who was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. While Europe still has the largest share of cardinal electors, with about 39, it is down from 52 in 2013 when Francis became the first Latin American pope. The second largest group of electors is from Asia and Oceania, with about 20. A Less Euro-Centric Group Francis appointed more than 20 cardinals from countries that had never previously had a cardinal, nearly all of them from developing countries such as Rwanda, Cape Verde, Tonga, Myanmar, Mongolia and South Sudan, or countries with very few Catholics such as Sweden. In some cases he repeatedly overlooked vacancies in big European cities that traditionally had cardinals, to stress that the Church could not be so Euro-centric. In other places, such as the United States, he bypassed dioceses such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, apparently because they had conservative archbishops. Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington since March, is seen as a progressive and outspoken ally of Francis pastoral approach to social issues, such as protection of the environment and a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ Catholics. A Popes Legacy The more cardinals that a pope names during his reign also increases the possibility that his successor will be someone who holds similar views on Church and social issues. However, this is not always the case, as the cardinals may choose a person theologically dissimilar to his predecessor but considered the best candidate for internal Church reasons or for the historical times in which the election takes place. Pope Benedict was chosen to succeed Pope John Paul II in part because Benedict had worked with John Paul for two decades and the cardinals wanted continuity. But many of the same cardinals felt an outsider was needed to succeed Benedict, who resigned in 2013, after the Vatileaks scandal exposed a dysfunctional central administration, much of it overseen by Italian prelates. At the same time, many cardinals clearly felt the future of Catholicism lay beyond ageing Europe, so they chose Argentinas Jorge Mario Bergoglio as their pontiff - the first non-European pope in nearly 13 centuries. Although cardinals who have turned 80 cannot enter the conclave, they still can affect its outcome. They are allowed to attend meetings known as General Congregations that take place in the days before a conclave starts and where a profile of the qualities needed for the next pope take shape.

He had nearly died during that time, and the Vatican now confirms he suffered from additional conditions: arterial hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and chronic bronchiectasis  none of which had been disclosed publicly before.

        "date": "April 22, 2025 09:55 am",
        "content": "A set of health and safety guidelines for the protection of devotees participating in the ongoing Siri Dalada Wandanawa exposition at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy has been issued by the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB). The Bureau urges all devotees to strictly adhere to the following recommendations to ensure their well-being during the pilgrimage:  Drink water frequently to prevent dehydration.  Consume only freshly prepared, home-cooked food. Avoid eating food that appears spoiled or has been left unrefrigerated for lengthy periods.  Individuals taking medication daily for conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes are advised to take their medication on time and to carry an extra supply sufficient for several days.  Those suffering from chronic illnesses should carry a photocopy of their diagnosis card or clinic records for reference in case of emergency.  Ensure that children carry a written note with the phone number of the parent or guardian in their pocket or attached to their clothing.  Remain calm and patient while waiting in queues. Panic or agitation can lead to crowd disturbances or stampedes. Maintaining composure is essential for everyones safety.  Carry only essential items and assist in minimizing litter. Dispose of waste in designated bins and contribute to keeping the area clean.  In the event of a health concern, seek immediate assistance from officials stationed along the route or from the established health centers.  While commuting in trains, refrain from leaning out of windows or hanging from doors to prevent accidents, particularly when passing through tunnels or near trackside structures.  If traveling by vehicle, drive within the recommended speed limits and exercise caution to avoid road accidents.  Maintain personal hygiene by carrying a small bar of soap or hand sanitizer.  Use mosquito repellent, such as citronella oil, to protect against mosquito bites. Meanwhile, today marks the fifth day of the Siri Dalada Wandanawa exposition. Devotees will be able to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha from 11:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the Temple of the Tooth Relic has announced.",

        "title": "Who is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the Vatican?",
        "date": "April 22, 2025 10:31 am",
        "content": "When the world learned of Pope Francis death on Monday morning, an Irish-American cardinal, little known in the wider world, was the one to break the news. After announcing that the pope had returned to the home of the Father, Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took on one of his biggest roles yet: the camerlengo, or the person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope. Pope Francis nominated the cardinal for the role in 2019. The cardinal will remain in the position during the Apostolica Sedes Vacans, the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff. He also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis. Born in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican. He held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland. All told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US. Farrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vaticans new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal. Years after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters. How the next Pope is chosen As camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected. Technically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. The cardinal also will preside over the certification of Franciss death, laying his body into the coffin. After that, the cardinal is expected to lead a procession moving the popes body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peters Basilica. The ceremony could take place as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the Vatican. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 22, 2025 11:21 am",
        "content": "Indias Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned Telugu actor Mahesh Babu in connection with a money laundering probe into Hyderabad-based real estate firms, news agency PTI reported on Tuesday. Mahesh Babu, 49, has been asked to appear before the federal probe agencys office in Hyderabad on April 28. The development comes nearly a week after the Enforcement Directorate carried out raids at multiple locations in Hyderabad as part of their investigation against real estate firms Surana Group and Sai Surya Developers. The investigation under the PMLA pertains to the alleged non-delivery of real estate projects on time, according to PTI. The owner of Sai Surya Developers, Kancharla Satish Chandra Gupta, is facing a police probe for alleged delivery default of a project named Green Meadows. Mahesh Babu was the projects brand ambassador. Sources cited by PTI said that the actor is not being investigated as an accused at present and may not be involved in the scam. They said he may have endorsed the realty projects of the accused companies without knowing about the alleged fraud. According to PTI sources, the agency is looking to understand transactions worth 5.9 crore, which the actor received from the companies as endorsement fees via cheques and cash. What is the case about? The ED case stems from a Telangana Police complaint against Sathish Chandra Gupta, proprietor of Sai Surya Developers and Narendra Surana, director of Bhagyanagar Properties Ltd. and others for defrauding and cheating gullible investors of their hard earned money in the name of advance for sale of plots involving huge amounts, according to PTI. The accused orchestrated fraudulent schemes involving unauthorised land layouts, selling same plots to different customers, accepting payments without proper agreements, and false assurances of plot registrations, the agency said in a statement issued post the searches. By cheating the general public with predetermined and dishonest intention, they generated proceeds of crime which was diverted and laundered for wrongful gain to themselves and related entities, the ED had said.

        "date": "April 22, 2025 11:57 am",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to increase the financial assistance provided for a housing unit under the Obata Geyak  Ratata Hetak housing program, which is aimed at addressing the housing needs of low-income and impoverished families. This initiative seeks to alleviate poverty and improve living standards by providing housing support to economically disadvantaged individuals. Under the program, a family is selected from each Grama Niladhari Division, with priority given to those in dire need. Assistance is granted based on the progress of construction, either to build a new house or improve an existing one. Beneficiaries are required to construct a house with a minimum floor area of 550 square feet. Initially, the government provided Rs. 650,000 in financial aid, with the remainder of the construction cost to be borne by the beneficiary. However, since the launch of the program, the estimated cost of constructing a single housing unit has increased from Rs. 1,147,000 to Rs. 1,764,000, placing a significant financial burden on low-income families. In response, the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing submitted a proposal to increase the government contribution from Rs. 650,000 to Rs. 1,000,000 per housing unit. Accordingly, the proposal was approved by the Cabinet, acknowledging the financial difficulties faced by beneficiaries in covering the increased construction costs.",

        "content": "While the opposition views the upcoming Local Government (LG) election as just another attempt to gain power, for the government, it is an opportunity to ensure that the allocations of public funds will reach rural communities without corruption, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has stated. The Prime Minister made these remarks while addressing a public gathering held in Maligawatte, Colombo. Speaking at the public gathering, Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya further noted that the incumbent government has already commenced work which includes the presentation of the 2025 Budget, which covers allocations for the next eight months. The Prime Minister has said their goal is to bring some relief and development to the people who have suffered for years, and to develop the rural economy, according to a statement issued by the Prime Ministers Media Division. PM Dr. Amarasuriya said, We are managing public finances with the utmost prudence and are committed to undertaking development projects in the best interest of the people. To ensure these initiatives are successfully implemented at the grassroots level, we require clean and capable local leadership. Therefore, this election is extremely decisive. This election has been delayed for so long. Our foremost task is to resume and complete development projects that were abandoned by previous administrations, and to rectify the errors they have left behind. The current government considers and is conscious about every rupee it spends. If there are thieves at the local level when sending allocated public funds to villages, how can we develop them? Let us treat the peoples decision to steer the country in the right direction as the third major challenge, and on May 6, achieve a victory similar to past elections. There cannot exist two separate political cultures at the top and another at the grassroots. If we are to operate at the highest levels without waste, corruption, or fraud, the same standard must be upheld locally. Only the National Peoples Power (NPP) has presented candidates who reflect this integrity. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya also urged the public to exercise their vote with careful consideration in order to liberate the nation from corrupt politics and to resolve long standing challenges.",

        "date": "April 22, 2025 01:07 pm",
        "content": "Instagram is beginning to test the use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on the app, parent company Meta Platforms said on Monday. Meta has been using AI to determine peoples ages for some time, the company said, but photo and video-sharing app will now proactively look for teen accounts it suspects belong to teenagers even if they entered an inaccurate birthdate when they signed up. If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become a teen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. Sensitive content, such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a sleep mode will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. Meta says it trains its AI to look for signals, such as the type of content the account interacts, profile information and when the account was created, to determine the owners age. The heightened measures arrive as social media companies face increased scrutiny over how their platform affects the mental health and well-being of younger users. A growing number of states are also trying to pass age verification laws, although they have faced court challenges. Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they dont do enough to make their products safe for children  or verify that no kids under 13 use them. Instagram will also send notifications to parents with information about how they can have conversations with their teens on the importance of providing the correct age online, the company said.

        "date": "April 22, 2025 01:45 pm",
        "content": "The Vatican on Tuesday published the first photo and video of Pope Francis lying in repose, showing the late pontiff in an open coffin dressed in red liturgical vestments, a mitre on his head and a rosary placed in his hands. The images were taken inside the private chapel of the Casa Santa Marta, his Vatican residence where he passed away on Monday at the age of 88. The solemn visuals come just a day after the Holy See confirmed that Pope Francis died of a cerebral stroke which led to a coma and irreversible heart failure. Dr Andrea Arcangeli, director of the directorate of health and hygiene of the Vatican City State, certified the cause of death in an official medical report, which also detailed the pontiffs long-standing health issues, including Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a history of respiratory failure and bilateral pneumonia. His death was officially recorded at 7:35 am (local time) on April 21 through electrocardiographic thanatography, according to the Vatican. Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, was the first pope from Latin America. His papacy began in March 2013 and spanned more than a decade marked by reform, humility, and a global focus on the poor. He made his final public appearance just a day before his passing  briefly greeting crowds from the balcony of St Peters Basilica on Easter Sunday, although he was too frail to deliver the full traditional message. As revealed in his will, Pope Francis had requested a modest burial at the Papal Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome, departing from the long tradition of entombing popes at St Peters Basilica. He had expressed a lifelong devotion to the Salus Populi Romani icon housed in the Pauline Chapel of St Mary Major and asked to be laid to rest nearby in a simple, unadorned tomb marked only Franciscus. I wish my last earthly journey to end at this very ancient Marian shrine, he wrote in the testament dated June 29, 2022. The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration, he added, further stating there should be no reference to his papal office on the gravestone. With lively hope in eternal life, I offer the suffering of the last part of my life for peace in the world and brotherhood among peoples, he wrote. This makes Francis the first pope in nearly 150 years not to be buried at St Peters, with the last being Pope Pius IX. The tomb will be placed near the Queen of Peace statue inside the basilica, fulfilling his personal wish. His request also reflects his aversion to traditional papal funeral customs. In his autobiography Hope, Francis wrote, The Vatican is the home of my final service, not my eternity. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "date": "April 22, 2025 01:55 pm",
        "content": "The funeral of Pope Francis will be held on Saturday, 27 April, the Vatican has announced. The Argentine pontiff, 88, died on Monday from a stroke, less than a month after returning home from five weeks in hospital battling double pneumonia. His funeral, which is expected to draw huge crowds, will take place at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday in the square in front of St Peters Basilica at the Vatican. Franciss coffin -- which he previously ordered should be of wood and zinc -- will then be taken inside the church and from there to the Rome basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore for burial. The date was set by the first so-called general congregation of cardinals this morning, which kicked off a centuries-old process that culminates in the election of a new pontiff within three weeks. Cardinals of all ages are invited to the congregations, although only those under the age of 80 are eligible to vote for a new pope in the conclave. Earlier, the Vatican published the first images of the pontiff in his open coffin, ahead of its transfer to St Peters Basilica on Wednesday at 9:00 am, to lie in state. The Popes body was photographed during a service Monday evening in the chapel of Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican residence where he lived during his 12-year papacy, and where he died. The Popes body was moved into the Santa Marta chapel on Monday evening, and his apartment formally sealed, the Vatican said. Francis, who wore plain robes and eschewed the luxury of his predecessors, has opted for a simple tomb, unadorned except for his name in Latin, Franciscus, according to his will released Monday. In chosing to be buried in Romes Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, he will become the first pope in more than 100 years to be laid to rest outside the Vatican. His death certificate released by the Vatican said Francis died of a stroke, causing a coma and irreversible heart failure. He had been discharged from Romes Gemelli hospital on March 23 and ordered to spend at least two months resting. But Francis, who never took a holiday and delighted in being among his flock, made numerous public appearances in recent days. He appeared exhausted on Sunday during the Easter celebrations, but nevertheless greeted the crowds in his popemobile in St Peters Square. Meanwhile, tributes have poured in from around the globe for Pope Francis, a liberal reformer who took over following the resignation of German theologian Benedict XVI in 2013. His home country, Argentina, prepared for a week of national mourning. Heads of state and royalty are expected for his funeral, with US President Donald Trump and Frances Emmanuel Macron the first to announce they would attend even before a date was confirmed. The Church is also now preparing for a conclave, expected to begin after May 6, where 135 cardinal electors, nearly 80 percent of whom were appointed by Francis, will vote in secret to choose his successor. With no clear favourite emerging, cardinals will use General Congregations in the coming days to reflect on the Churchs future direction. --With Inputs from Agencies",
