        "date": "November 17, 2024 09:44 am",
        "content": "A former student went on a stabbing rampage at a vocational college in eastern China on Saturday, killing eight people and injuring 17 others, police said, just days after the deadliest mass killing in the country in a decade shocked Chinese society. Saturdays knife attack took place at the Wuxi Vocational College of Arts and Technology in Yixing, part of Wuxi city in the eastern province of Jiangsu. The suspect was apprehended at the scene and confessed to his actions, police added. Later on Saturday, authorities in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai said they had charged a 62-year-old man after a driver on Monday rammed his car into a crowd killing 35 people and injuring 43 others. That incident touched off a rare online discussion over the mental health of Chinese society and whether a string of recent high-profile attacks in other major cities could reflect deeper stresses as the worlds second-largest economy slows. At least six other high-profile knife attacks have been recorded this year across China. Police in Wuxi said it appeared the stabbing suspect was angry over not getting his graduation certificate and failing an exam. According to preliminary investigations, the suspect, surname Xu - male, 21 years old, a 2024 graduate of the college - attacked others after failing an exam and not receiving his graduation certificate, as well as being dissatisfied with his internship compensation, a statement by the Yixing Public Security Bureau said. It added that efforts were underway to treat the injured and investigate the case. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Xi says he will work with Trump in last meeting with Biden",
        "date": "November 17, 2024 12:53 pm",
        "content": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged to work with incoming President Donald Trump in his final meeting with current US leader Joe Biden. The two met on Saturday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru where they acknowledged ups and downs in relations over Bidens four years in office. But both highlighted progress in lowering tensions on issues such as trade and Taiwan. Analysts say US-China relations could become more volatile when Trump returns to office in two months, driven by factors including a promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. The president-elect has pledged 60 tariffs on all imports from China. He has also appointed prominent China hawks to top foreign and defence positions. During his first term, Trump labelled China a strategic competitor. Relations worsened when the former president labelled Covid a Chinese virus during the pandemic. Speaking on Saturday at the meeting held at his hotel in Lima, the Chinese president said Beijings goal of a stable relationship with Washington would remain unchanged. China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences, Xi said. Biden said strategic competition between the two global powers should not escalate into war. Our two countries cannot let any of this competition veer into conflict. That is our responsibility and over the last four years I think weve proven its possible to have this relationship, he said. Bidens time in office did see flare-ups in relations with China, including a spy balloon saga and displays of Chinese military firepower around Taiwan triggered by the visit of a senior US official. China says its claim to the self-ruling island is a red line. However, the Biden administration aimed to responsibly manage rivalry with Beijing after Trumps first term. Beijing is likely to be most concerned about the president-elects unpredictability, analysts say. The Chinese are ready to negotiate and deal, and probably hope for early engagement with the Trump team to discuss potential transactions, said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Funds Indo-Pacific Program. At the same time, however, they are ready to retaliate if Trump insists on imposing higher tariffs on China. She added that China may also be likely worried that they lack reliable back channels to influence Trumps policy. Biden on Saturday acknowledged there had always been disagreements with Xi but added that discussions between him and the Chinese leader had been frank and candid. The pair held three face-to-face meetings during Bidens time in the White House, including a key summit last year in San Francisco where both sides came to agreements on combatting narcotics and climate change. But Bidens White House also continued Trump-era tariffs. His government imposed duties in May targeting Chinas electric cars, solar panels and steels. He also strengthened defence alliances across Asia and the Pacific to counter Chinas increasing assertiveness in the region. The outgoing president has also said the US would defend Taiwan if it were invaded by China. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "November 17, 2024 05:57 pm",
        "content": "Indias Tata Electronics has agreed to buy a majority stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatrons only iPhone plant in India, forming a new joint venture that strengthens Tatas position as an Apple supplier, two sources told Reuters. Under the deal announced internally last week, Tata will hold 60 and run daily operations under the joint venture, while Pegatron will hold the rest and provide technical support, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the details are not yet public. The sources did not elaborate on the financials of the deal. Tata declined to comment, while Apple and Pegatron did not respond to Reuters queries on Sunday. Reuters was first to report in April that Pegatron had the backing of Apple and was holding advanced talks to sell its only iPhone plant in India to Tata, marking the Taiwanese firms latest scale back of its Apple partnership. Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. For Indias Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans. Tata is one of the largest conglomerates in India and has been fast expanding into iPhone manufacturing, rivaling the only other iPhone contract manufacturer operating in India, Foxconn. The announcement for the deals closure was made internally at the iPhone plant on Friday, said the first source. The second source said the two companies plan to file for an approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in the coming days. Tata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwans Wistron last year. It is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where it also has an iPhone component plant which was involved in a fire incident in September. Analysts estimate India will contribute 20-25 of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14 last year. The Tata-Pegatron plant, which has around 10,000 employees and makes 5 million iPhones annually, will be Tatas third iPhone factory in India. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied long-range missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia",
        "date": "November 18, 2024 08:39 am",
        "content": "President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraines northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Bidens move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys reaction Sunday was notably restrained. Strikes are not made with words, he said during his nightly video address. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves. Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyys statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscows intentions to devastate Ukraines power generation capacity before the winter. And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement, Zelenskyy said. The comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraines NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Putin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory. News of Bidens decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine. We want peace, we want fair peace, Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didnt elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Koreas decision to support Putins invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few long-range strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russias war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraines international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraines most valuable ally in the war, providing more than 56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russias response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyys pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "In his inaugural address to the newly-appointed Cabinet of Ministers, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake underscored the immense responsibility shouldered by the new government and emphasized the importance of using power with accountability, integrity, and respect for the publics trust. Speaking after the new 21-member Cabinet was sworn in at the Presidential Secretariat this morning (18), Dissanayake highlighted that it is the responsibility of everyone to protect the continuity of the democratic process and elevate it to a new level. Highlighting the historic nature of the victory that brought the incumbent administration to power, the President noted the decades-long struggle of countless individuals who dedicated their time, labor, and even lives to achieve it. We know that the general publics intervention is higher in our victory... A large number of people, whose names or addresses we dont even know, contributed to this success. Many here have struggled for this dream since childhood or from a young age, he stated. Furthermore, the Head of the State said: So, now we have two types of responsibilities  one is for the aims and expectations of the public, the other is for our movement. We trust that the power is a special thing. Power generates power, power expands power, power develops power again and again. We saw that people are now saying that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Yes, thats true. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Acknowledging the concerns surrounding the potential misuse of power, the President reassured both the public and his movement that their administration is aware of its limits, noting, Therefore, suspicions can be created in the country of where we will go with this unlimited power. For those who have at least a little bit of doubt Im saying that, its true we have power. Similarly, we know the limitations we can go with that power. We have an aim with this power. Addressing fears of corruption, he added, Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It has been proven. In our country, such unlimited powers have often led to results unfavorable to the public. We must be vigilant to avoid such outcomes. This power we gained is accountable. To whom? On one hand, it is accountable to the public, and on the other hand, to the movement, he said, calling on the new Cabinet Ministers to uphold the principles of responsibility, limitations, and integrity in their roles. Responding to discussions about the inexperience of most of the Cabinet members and the newly elected MPs, the President defended their appointments, noting that while they may be new to Parliament, they are seasoned in political activism and professional spheres. They are freshers to the Cabinet, to the Parliament, but they are neither freshers to politics nor to working, he affirmed. Urging the new Cabinet to deliver on the promises made to the nation, President Dissanayake described them as the drivers of victories the country expects and expressed confidence in their dedication and honesty. We had a lot of good aims. We worked to gain power for that. We struggled a lot The huge the victory we achieved, the heavier our responsibility. We had to struggle for the victory and were the drivers of the struggle to achieve the results now. You Cabinet Ministers are the centre of all this, he said. The President concluded by rallying the Cabinet of Ministers to work collectively for the nations progress, asserting, Your proportion is huge in our success. Lets work together to achieve the results our people deserve.",

This order was issued when a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an order preventing the release of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination results and the cut-off marks was taken up for consideration today (18). The petition was taken up for consideration before the three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Achala Vengappuli and Mahinda Samayawardena. The petitions were filed by the parents of several students who sat for the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which was held on September 15, 2024. The Commissioner General of Examinations, Minister of Education and Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, DIG in charge of the Criminal Investigations Department and 11 others have been named as respondents of the relevant petition. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. However on Monday (Oct. 14), the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked.",

        "title": "Sheeran wishes he wasnt on the new Band Aid song",
        "date": "November 18, 2024 06:00 pm",
        "content": "Ed Sheeran says that Band Aid did not ask for permission to re-use his vocals on a new 40th anniversary version of Do They Know Its Christmas? Writing on Instagram, the star said he would have respectfully declined the request, citing a post by British-Ghanian rapper Fuse ODG that criticised foreign aid in Africa. Sheeran sang alongside Coldplay, Sinead OConnor, Sam Smith, One Direction and Rita Ora on Band Aid 30 in 2014. A new mix, released next week, blends his vocals with those of Sting from the original 1984 version of the charity song. My approval wasnt sought on this new Band Aid 40 release, Sheeran said. Had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. He continued: A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed, eloquently explained by fuseodg. This is just my personal stance, Im hoping its a forward-looking one. Love to all x. In his post, Fuse ODG said he had turned down the invitation to take part in Band Aid 30 alongside Sheeran, 10 years ago. I refused to participate in Band Aid because I recognised the harm initiatives like it inflict on Africa, he wrote. While they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africas economic growth, tourism, and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. The rapper said he believed that charity efforts like Band Aid fuel pity rather than partnership, and that he wanted to reclaim the narrative by empowering Africans to tell their own stories, redefine their identity, and position Africa as a thriving hub for investment and tourism. The BBC has asked Band Aid for a response to Sheeran and Fuse ODGs comments. Colonial tropes The latest version of Do They Know Its Christmas? was announced last week. It will combine different versions of the charity single that have been recorded over the years, featuring stars such as Boy George, Harry Styles, George Michael, Sam Smith, the Sugababes, Bono, Bananarama, Robbie Williams, Thom Yorke, Rita Ora, Dizzee Rascal and Paul McCartney. The new ultimate mix will premiere on British radio stations on the morning of 25 November, the 40th anniversary of the original song being recorded. The charity single was conceived as a way to tackle the famine that devastated Ethiopia in 1984. Over the years, the songs lyrics have been criticised for their patronising portrayal of Africa as a barren land that needed rescuing by Western intervention. This ignorant and colonial attitude, wrote Indrajit Samarajiva in 2023, was more about making white people feel good than helping anyone. Over the weekend, Sir Bob Geldof - who organised and co-wrote Do They Know Its Christmas with Midge Ure - defended the song in response to an article by New Zealands 1 News. This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive, he wrote. In fact, just today Band Aid has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to help those running from the mass slaughter in Sudan and enough cash to feed a further 8,000 children in the same affected areas of Ethiopia as 1984. Those exhausted women who werent raped and killed and their panicked children and any male over 10 who survived the massacres and those 8,000 Tigrayan children will sleep safer, warmer and cared for tonight because of that miraculous little record. We wish that it were other but it isnt. Colonial tropes, my arse. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has officially assumed duties in the office as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, after she was re-appointed to the position by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo this morning (18). Days after new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took oaths, Amarasuriya was appointed as the new Prime Minister of the interim government, as she became the first female to hold the position since Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 2000. During the 2024 General Election, which was held on November 14, Dr. Amarasuriya, who contested from the Colombo District, polled the highest number of preference votes and placed first in the district. She had received an unprecedented 655,289 votes in total and in doing so momentarily set a new record for the most preference votes received by a candidate in Sri Lankas parliamentary election history, before she was surpassed by fellow NPP candidate Vijitha Herath who broke her record after receiving 716,715 preference votes from the Gampaha District. 54-year-old Amarasuriya, a national executive committee member of the National Peoples Power (NPP), is an academic, rights activist, and university lecturer and is known for her work in education and social justice. She has served as a senior lecturer in Sociology and Social Anthropology in the Department of Social Sciences of Open University, Sri Lanka and has made significant contributions to social justice and education in the country. Daughter of a homemaker mother and a tea plantation father, Amarasuriya is the first one to enter politics from her family, while she is also the first academic-turned-politician to take charge of the prime minister of Sri Lanka. Born on March 6, 1970, the NPP parliamentarian is the 16th prime minister of Sri Lanka, and the third woman to reach that office after Sirimavo Bandarnaike (1994-2000) and Chandrika Kumartunga (1994). Amarasuriya is the first female Prime Minister of Sri Lanka since Sirimavo Bandaranaike took office in 1994 and the third woman to serve in this capacity in Sri Lankas history. Amarasuriya first entered Parliament through the NPP national list in 2020.",

        "date": "November 19, 2024 10:22 am",
        "content": "The inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament is scheduled to commence on November 21. The first day of Parliaments inaugural session holds particular significance due to the series of special proceedings expected to take place on that day. On the first day of the Parliament, the primary responsibilities within the Chamber are entrusted to the Secretary-General of Parliament. Members of Parliament are not assigned specific seating arrangements on this day and are allowed to sit in any seat of their choice. Following the placement of the mace in the Chamber, the Secretary-General will present to Parliament, as the first business of the day, the Extraordinary Gazette Notification issued by the President, which specifies the date and time for the convening of Parliament. Subsequently, in accordance with Article 64(1) of the Constitution and Standing Orders 4, 5, and 6 of Parliament, the Speaker is elected by vote, followed by the administration of the official affirmation or oath of office by the Speaker. Thereafter, Members of Parliament take their official affirmation or oath, and the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are elected by vote. Electing the Speaker Any Member of Parliament may be appointed as the Speaker. However, prior to nominating a member for the position, it is essential to confirm that the Member is willing to accept the appointment. The election of the Speaker must proceed based solely on the nominations made by Members, without allowing any debate on the matter, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. At this stage, the Secretary-General informs the House that the Speaker must be appointed first. When a member rises to propose a name, the Secretary-General directs the Houses attention to that Members nomination. After one name has been proposed, the Secretary-General must ask if there are any other nominations. If no other nominations are presented, that Member is duly elected as Speaker. It is a long-standing tradition for the two Members who formally proposed and seconded the name of the Speaker to escort the elected Member to the Speakers chair, holding them by the arms. The Speaker then takes their official affirmation or oath of office before the Secretary-General. Before taking their seat, it is customary for the newly appointed Speaker to briefly thank the House for the appointment. Congratulatory remarks are then offered by both the government and opposition representatives, after which the Speaker delivers a statement of thanks. Following this, the remaining Members proceed to take their official affirmation or oath before the Speaker. When the names of two Members are proposed for the position of Speaker, a secret ballot is conducted. There are two instances in parliamentary procedure when a secret ballot is held: during the election of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Chairperson of Committees, and also when Parliament elects a President. During the ballot, a continuous five-minute Quorum Bell shall signal Members to prepare. The Secretary-General then distributes ballot papers to each Member, who must write the name of their chosen candidate and sign the paper. Members then fold the ballot paper discreetly and place it in the ballot box. The authority to determine the voting method and to conduct the count rests solely with the Secretary-General, who tallies the votes at the Table of Parliament. After counting, the Secretary-General announces the result to the House. If a ballot paper lacks the Members signature, it is deemed invalid. If three Members are proposed for the position of Speaker and no candidate secures an absolute majority in the vote, the candidate with the least number of votes shall be eliminated, and a new round of voting is conducted. The candidate who then receives the majority of votes is elected as Speaker. Similarly, in instances where multiple Members are proposed, successive rounds of voting are held, eliminating the candidate with the least votes each time, until one candidate secures an absolute majority. At any point, if a candidate achieves an absolute majority, they are immediately elected as Speaker. In cases where three Members stand for election and two of them receive an equal number of votes, the Secretary-General has the authority to eliminate one of the tied candidates by drawing lots. Following this, a vote is held between the remaining candidate and the candidate with the highest votes, and the Speaker is selected based on the results. If there is a vote between two candidates and both receive an equal number of votes, a re-vote is conducted. Should there still be a tie after this second vote, the Secretary-General has the authority to select the Speaker by drawing lots. The Secretary-General has full discretion to determine the procedure for drawing lots. Following the conclusion of a vote, the corresponding ballot papers must be kept under the custody of the Secretary-General for a period of one month. After this period, they should be destroyed in accordance with the directive from Parliament, and a report of this destruction must be submitted to Parliament. All Members of Parliament elected must sign the Member roll after taking their oath or affirmation on the first day. The Speaker signs first, followed by the Prime Minister as a tradition, after which the other Members affix their signatures. This signed record is maintained as a highly secure document in accordance with established protocols. When the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are to be elected, the Speaker, having already been appointed, conducts all notifications and voting procedures. After nominations for the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson are made, the Speaker will ask the House if there are any further nominations. If none are forthcoming, the nominated Members are elected to their respective positions. Should a vote be necessary, the procedure followed will mirror that of the election of the Speaker, with the notable difference that the voting will be conducted by the Speaker instead of the Secretary-General. After these activities are completed, Parliament will be adjourned. Typically, the adjournment will be until the next scheduled parliamentary day, according to the Sri Lanka Parliament. However, according to Article 33 of the Constitution, if the President addresses Parliament on that day to present government policy statement, the House will be temporarily suspended at the end of these initial proceedings. When Parliament reconvenes, the President will preside over the House and present the government policy statement. Following the policy statement the President will then adjourn Parliament until the next scheduled day.",

        "date": "November 19, 2024 10:53 am",
        "content": "The United States has returned more than 1,400 looted artifacts worth 10 million to India as part of an ongoing initiative to repatriate stolen art from countries across South and Southeast Asia, the Manhattan District Attorneys office announced Wednesday. The trafficked goods recovered include items that, until recently, were on view at New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among them is a sandstone sculpture of a celestial dancer that was smuggled from central India to London, before being illegally sold to one of the Mets patrons and donated to the museum. The repatriations resulted from several ongoing investigations into looting networks, including those operated by convicted art traffickers Nancy Wiener and Subhash Kapoor, an American antiquities dealer who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for running a multimillion-dollar looting network through his New York gallery, the Manhattan District Attorneys Office said in press release. Kapoor was sent to face charges in Indias Tamil Nadu state following his arrest in Germany in 2011. The DAs office obtained an arrest warrant for him in 2012though he remains in custody in India, pending his extradition to the US. Todays repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multiyear international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of historys most prolific offenders, William Walker, the federal Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge, said in a press statement. The items were formally returned at a ceremony at the Indian consulate in New York Wednesday. Since its creation over a decade ago, the Manhattan District Attorneys Antiquities Trafficking Unit  a task force of lawyers, investigators and art experts  has recovered 5,800 antiquities valued at almost 460 million. The unit has also convicted 16 people of trafficking offenses and filed for the extradition of six others linked to stolen cultural property. In July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamlining the process of returning stolen antiquities back to India.

        "content": "Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will visit India at the invitation of the Indian government in mid-December, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said on Monday. He will call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who became the first foreign dignitary to call on Dissanayake when he was elected President in September had extended the invitation. Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka in October since the National Peoples Power (NPP) government led by Dissanayake came to power on September 23. Herath who retained his foreign ministry portfolio in the first Cabinet of Dissanayake after his landslide victory in the parliamentary election held last week said the new government was intent on improving Sri Lankas relations with the world in their bid to effect a renaissance in the islands governance. In April 2022, the island nation declared its first-ever sovereign default since gaining Independence from Britain in 1948. The unprecedented financial crisis led the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to quit office in 2022 amid civil unrest. India had then pitched in with about USD 4 billion in assistance to enable the island nation to recover from a deep economic crisis after it announced the default on over USD 51 billion in foreign loans. Sri Lanka is Indias key maritime neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and occupies a special place in its initiatives such as SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the Neighbourhood First Policy. While in Opposition, Dissanayake had expressed his reservations about some of the Indian projects, especially the sustainable energy projects run by the Adani Group. In the run-up to the election, Dissanayake had pledged to annul those projects if voted to power, claiming that the projects were inimical to Sri Lankan interests. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "November 19, 2024 11:46 am",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of New Zealanders rallied in front of parliament on Tuesday in one of the countrys largest ever protests to oppose a bill, which opponents say seeks to dilute the rights of Maori and threatens to set race relations back decades. Massive crowds estimated by police at 42,000 gathered at parliament where the Treaty Principles Bill was introduced earlier this month by legislators who want to reinterpret a 184-year-old treaty signed between the British and Indigenous Maori. The libertarian ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the ruling centre-right coalition government, is seeking to enshrine a narrower interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi that it says discriminates against non-Indigenous citizens. While the bill lacks enough support to pass, critics see in it a desire to reverse decades of policies that aimed to empower Maori, who make up around 20 of the 5.3 million population but have higher levels of deprivation and incarceration and worse health outcomes than the broader population. Im here for my grandchildren, my children and for their children, said Hoana Hadfield from Wellington, who was marching in a protest for the first time. I think its important that we keep our kaupapa which is our values as Maori and our culture and its a real big thing for us to have cultural identity. Some people in the crowd were dressed in traditional attire with feathered headgear and cloaks and carried traditional Maori weapons, while others wore t-shirts emblazoned with Toitu te Tiriti (Honour the Treaty). Hundreds carried the Maori national flag. The protest was preceded by a nine-day march, or hikoi, that began in the countrys far north, with thousands joining rallies in towns and cities as marchers travelled south on foot and in cars to Wellington. Unity and solidarity was spoken about a lot in the rally. Helmut Modlik, a leader in the Ngati Toa tribe, told the crowd that it was too late to divide the country. To those who will divide us, whanau, it is too late. We are already one people, Modlik said to cheers from those gathered on the lawns of parliament. First signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Indigenous Maori chiefs, the Treaty lays down how the two parties agreed to govern. The interpretation of clauses in the document still guides legislation and policy today, with rulings by the courts and a separate Maori tribunal expanding Maori rights and privileges over the decades. ACTs coalition partners, the National Party and New Zealand First, agreed to support the legislation through the first of three readings, which happened last week. However, both have said they will not support it to become legislation. A small number of politicians including ACT leader David Seymour came onto the forecourt of parliament to listen to the protesters speak. A petition opposing the bill of 203,653 signatures was also presented to parliament. When Seymour emerged thousands started chanting kill the bill which was followed by a haka, or Maori war dance. Abby Collier, 42, had travelled six hours from her home in Tairawhiti to participate in Tuesdays protest. She said she was supporting the movement because she believed unity was important. We are coming from across the country and showing our babies we can have a positive impact through kindness, Collier said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Joining the Ada Deranas current affairs programme BIG FOCUS, she explained that currently an MP is entitled to an allowance of almost Rs. 54,000. Apart from this, they are also entitled to an attendance allowance of Rs 2,500 for the days when parliamentary sessions are held and an allowance of Rs 2,500 for attending committee meetings held on days when the parliamentary sessions are not held. She mentioned that the fuel allowance is based on the distance, which is calculated according to a formula. Mrs. Rohanadheera also noted that MPs who do not have a house within 40 kilometers from the Parliament are eligible to apply for accommodations in the parliamentary housing complex in Madiwela. The housing complex includes only a total of 108 houses, which are allocated based on the order of requests submitted by the ruling party and the opposition. Secretary General of the Parliament added that the MPs residing in these houses pay a monthly rent of Rs. 2,000, with electricity and water bills borne by the MPs themselves. Furthermore, she highlighted that the Parliament and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs have facilitated the reduction of the amount from allowances by providing them the medical facilities from the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital, and mentioned that the relevant ministry will also bear the necessary allowances for the personal staff of the MPs.",

        "content": "The nomination process for National List MP positions within the New Democratic Front (NDF) and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has escalated into internal turmoil, with fierce competition for limited seats. The NDF only secured two seats and the SJB five seats through the National List in the recent general election. The crisis deepened following the nomination of Ravi Karunanayakes name in the Gazette last night (18) as a National List MP for the NDF. The nomination was reportedly made to the Election Commission by the NDF General Secretary without the approval of the member parties, sparking dissent within the alliance. The Leader of the NDF, Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed dissatisfaction over the decision on Monday, stating that the nomination was made arbitrarily without his or the member parties consent. He has convened a meeting in Colombo today with NDF stakeholders to address the issue. Adding to the controversy, a protest erupted outside Karunanayakes residence this morning, with heightened security observed in the area. In the midst of this, a proposal has been made to nominate Kanchana Wijesekera, who unsuccessfully contested the election from the Matara district, for the second National List MP seat allocated to the NDF. Meanwhile, the SJB has yet to nominate representatives for its five National List MP positions. The delay is attributed to disputes among allied parties that contested under the SJB banner. These groups are vying for representation, creating a stalemate within the alliance.",

However, reports indicate that despite more than 20 days having passed since the start of paddy cultivation in the eastern region, including Ampara, farmers are yet to receive the fertilizer subsidy. The government has completed the first phase of the fertilizer subsidy, covering 86,162 hectares across 23 districts. However, due to the delay in the release of water in the Polonnaruwa, Girithale and Kaudulla irrigation reservoirs, the fertilizer subsidy has been delayed in those areas, as per the Ministry of Agriculture. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of Agriculture has reiterated that corrective measures are underway, and that the efforts are being made to ensure the timely disbursement of funds to farmers.",

        "date": "November 19, 2024 04:50 pm",
        "content": "Ukraine has said it will never give in to Russias aggression as it marks 1,000 days since the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of the country. Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Zelensky will later address a special session of the European Parliament as the country marks the milestone. It comes as eight people, including a child, were killed in a drone attack on Ukraines northeastern region of Sumy overnight, where 89 were also killed in a separate strike on Sunday. The drone attack on a residential building in the small town of Hlukhiv injured 12 people including two children, Ukraines national police force said. President Zelensky wrote on X that the building was a dormitory at a local school. Russia continues to terrorize our border regions, Zelensky wrote. In a video shared by the president, emergency workers could be seen sifting through the rubble as they continued to search for victims on Tuesday morning. Zelensky said the attack confirmed that Putin wants the war to continue, he is not interested in talking about peace. He will address members of the European Parliament via videolink from Kyiv on Tuesday, 1,000 days on from Russias full-scale invasion of the country on 24 February 2022. It follows US President Joe Bidens decision to give Ukraine the green light to use long-range missiles supplied by the US to strike Russia on Monday. Local media earlier reported Zelensky would also unveil an internal resilience plan to Ukraines parliament on Tuesday. The countrys military commander in chief wrote on Telegram that the country had faced 1,000 days of extremely complex, fierce battle for our existence and destroying the enemy. In the frozen trenches of Donetsk region and in the burning steppes of Kherson region under shells, hail, and anti-aircraft guns - we are fighting for the right to life. He added: Every dark night, even if there are a thousand of them, always ends with dawn. On Tuesday, the Kremlin approved its updated nuclear doctrine - which says that any aggression from a non-nuclear state, if backed by a nuclear power, will be regarded as a joint attack on Russia. It says Russia can use nuclear weapons in the case of a critical threat to its sovereignty, even if only with conventional weapons, an attack on Belarus, or a massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, or other airborne vehicles crossing Russian borders. Eleven children were among those killed by a separate Russian strike on Sumy late on Sunday, which saw the regions power cut off and over 400 people evacuated. Russian missiles and drones also targeted power structure across Ukraine on Sunday, killing at least 10 people and causing blackouts. The EUs foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell Fontelles also said on Tuesday the EU continued to stand with Ukraine, but that it needed to do more and quicker. The European Union will continue to advance support to help achieve victory for Ukraine and to bring peace to our continent, he said in a video shared on X. History will judge us based on our actions and reactions, read the caption. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated his countrys ironclad support for Ukraine amid speculation he could give Kyiv permission to use British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to hit targets deep inside Russian territory. The presenter of Ukraines United News TV stream, launched at the beginning of the invasion to provide information on the war, said the country was holding firm - despite the pressure on the front line, the damage to the energy system and the constant bombardment. Bidens move to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with US-made long-range missiles was welcomed as a step that could redress the balance between both countries forces. It is thought that Ukraine was only given permission to use the missiles to defend its forces inside Russias Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise incursion in August and an assault from Russian and Korean troops was expected within days.

        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today approved a 200 million policy-based loan to further help the Government of Sri Lanka strengthen its financial sector. This second subprogram of ADBs Financial Sector Stability and Reforms Program builds on the stabilization and crisis management measures put in place under the first subprogram approved in 2023, a statement said. Sri Lanka has made good progress in stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and improving the fiscal situation. ADB is helping the country establish long-term growth by introducing and institutionalizing structural reforms in its financial sector, said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. This subprogram reinforces ADBs support in strengthening the governance of the banking sector and expanding financial inclusion in Sri Lanka to achieve sustainable recovery from economic crisis, resilience, and poverty alleviation. Policy reforms under subprogram 2 will improve the Central Bank of Sri Lankas (CBSL) regulatory supervision of banks to ensure financial stability. This includes an improved early warning system that will identify weakening processes of banks and introduce corrective actions. The CBSL will implement a new stress testing model to monitor solvency issues and liquidity stresses. Subprogram 2 will continue to strengthen the banking sectors asset quality. The CBSL will provide guidance on credit concentration risk limits and give incentives to banks to accept guarantees and limit collateral requirements to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). In addition, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, Policy Formulation, Planning and Tourism (MOF) will provide MSMEs, especially women-led businesses, incentive packages such as special loans to expand their business. Financial inclusion of women and vulnerable groups will be further expanded through the digitization of personal information to enhance electronic transactions. The MOF will formulate a policy framework for women-led MSMEs to improve their access to finance, with the CBSL helping financial institutions identify eligible women entrepreneurs, the statement added. ADB said it is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

        "content": "Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia, officials said Tuesday, marking the first time Kyiv used the weapons that way in 1,000 days of war. The use of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, came as Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons, opening the door to a potential nuclear response by Moscow to even a conventional attack by any nation supported by a nuclear power. That could include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S. A Telegram channel affiliated with the Ukrainian military posted a video Tuesday that it says shows U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles being fired from an undisclosed location in Ukraine. The Associated Press could not independently verify the date and location the video was filmed. According to a U.S. official, Ukraine fired about eight of the missiles, and just two were intercepted by the Russians. The official said that the U.S. was still assessing battle damage, but that the missiles struck an ammunition supply location in Karachev, a city of about 18,000 people in Russias Bryansk region. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The developments marked a worrying escalation in the conflict that has repeatedly ratcheted up international tensions. U.S. officials recently expressed dismay at Russias deployment of North Korean troops to help it fight Ukraine, while Moscow seethed when Washington eased restrictions on the ATACMS in recent days.

However, a discussion has taken place between the representatives of the relevant trade unions and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya last evening (19). Speaking to the media following the discussion, Co-Chairman of the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) Dhammika S. Priyantha stated since assuming the role of Vice-Chancellor, he has imposed significant pressure on the academic staff, non-academic staff, and students, allegedly pursuing personal vendettas. Notably, the studentship of several students has been revoked, and many have been barred from participating in graduation ceremonies. Similarly, non-academic staff have faced undue penalties, while faculty promotions appear to be influenced by favoritism rather than merit. These actions are reportedly enabled by the political protection he enjoys, he added. Commenting further, Media Spokesman of the UTUJC Senior Prof. Charudaththa Ilangasinghe said: As soon as our strike was announced, the government responded promptly, with the Prime Minister initiating discussions on the matter.

        "content": "Sri Lanka has been recognized as an Advancing country in the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), which highlights its commitment to enhancing cybersecurity practices across multiple pillars. The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) that published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) serves as a trusted benchmark for assessing countries commitment to cybersecurity on a global scale. The fifth edition of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 provides a comprehensive assessment of countries commitment to cybersecurity across five key pillars namely (a) Legal, (b) Technical, (c) Organizational, (d) Capacity Development, and (e) Cooperation. The fifth edition of the 2024 Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) assesses countries cybersecurity commitment across five key pillars. The Legal pillar evaluates the strength of laws related to cybercrime and cybersecurity, while the Technical pillar focuses on the capabilities of national and sector-specific agencies. The Organizational pillar examines national strategies and organizations dedicated to cybersecurity governance, and the Capacity Development pillar looks at efforts to build cybersecurity knowledge through training, education, and awareness campaigns. Lastly, the Cooperation pillar measures partnerships between government, private sector, and international organizations. In the 2024 report, 193 countries have been categorized into 5 tiers as Tier 1 (T1)  Role-modelling, Tier 2 (T2)  Advancing, Tier 3 (T3)  Establishing, Tier 4 (T4)  Evolving, and Tier 5 (T5)  Building based on their efforts to safeguard the cyberspace. Sri Lanka has been classified as a Tier 2 - Advancing country, achieving a score of 85-95 out of 100. A T2 Advancing country shows a strong commitment to cybersecurity through coordinated, government-led actions. This includes assessing, setting up, or implementing widely recognized cybersecurity measures across at least four pillars or many key indicators. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the implementation of National cybersecurity strategy by Sri Lanka CERT during the past several years. Sri Lanka was ranked 83rd in 2020 GCI report and in 84th in 2018 report prior to the implementation of the nations first cyber security strategy. The report further highlights that Sri Lankas strength lies in its Legal Measures, Technical measures, and Capacity Development, where it scored highest. However, the Organizational and Cooperation measures are identified as areas for potential growth. Notably, Sri Lankas performance surpasses the average score for the Asia-Pacific region, indicating a robust commitment to advancing cybersecurity initiatives. The report encourages continued efforts in enhancing organizational frameworks and fostering international cooperation to further strengthen the countrys cybersecurity landscape. Sri Lanka CERT is actively working to enhance the countrys cybersecurity standing and position itself to a T1: role modelling in the future. To achieve this, Sri Lanka CERT has launched several key initiatives, including the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (20252028), the establishment of the National Certification Authority, and the operationalization of the National Cybersecurity Operations Center. Additionally, the country is advancing the implementation of a national information and cybersecurity policy, alongside various capacity-building activities aimed at strengthening the nations overall cybersecurity framework.",

The Vice Chancellors refusal of allegations came after the academic and non-academic staff together with the students unions launched a strike action on November 19, demanding his removal. The strike has escalated tensions within the university community, with protestors accusing the Vice Chancellor of misconduct and calling for his immediate resignation. In response to the situation, a high-level meeting between Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and the University Trade Union Joint Committee was held yesterday. Despite the discussions, the trade unions expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome and pledged to continue their strike until their demands are met. When inquired by Ada Derana, Senior Prof. Amarasena maintained his innocence, stating, I have informed the Minister of Education, the Secretary, and the University Grants Commission that I categorically deny all allegations against me and have no intention of stepping down. Multiple investigations have been conducted regarding these claims, and I believe that sufficient evidence has not been come out to confirm the allegations. If the allegations had merit, I believe the government would have already taken action against me. He further dismissed the impact of the ongoing strike, saying, I do not consider this strike successful. There are five faculties within the university that do not support these protests, and I attribute the lack of momentum to the weak and ineffective slogans of the protestors. However, the strike action launched by all academic and non-academic trade unions and Students Unions affiliated with the University of Ruhuna yesterday, demanding the immediate removal of the universitys Vice Chancellor, continued second consecutive day today (Nov. 20).",

The master of the ship has not been able to leave the Asian island for the past 1,280 days. Splash reported late last month the new Sri Lankan government will reopen investigations into the X-Press Pearl disaster and seek multi-billion dollar payouts from insurers. X-Press Feeders pointed out in a statement sent to Splash today that the company has already paid out nearly 160m, and the company is keen to get the case concluded and see one of its staff released. If the new Sri Lankan government is going to review these proceedings, then we appeal to them to also consider the ongoing legal action against the former captain of the X-Press Pearl, Vitaly Tyutkalo, X-Press Feeders stated, adding: Vitaly remains trapped in Sri Lanka under a court travel ban, unable to return home after more than three and a half years because of ongoing lengthy delays in the tabling of evidence in the governments case against him. He has missed a daughters wedding and his other daughters graduation and, like many others, continues to suffer because of unreasonable delays. The then three-month-old, 2,700 teu X-Press Pearl containership suffered a fire in May 2021, spilling tonnes of hazardous substances such as nitric acid and microplastic granules into the Indian Ocean with much debris washing up along the islands western coastline.

The X-Press Pearl was carrying nearly 1,680 metric tonnes of plastic nurdles and around 200 women are still separating and collecting the nurdles washed ashore by hand. Each woman earns around 10 a day separating the nurdles. Plastic nurdles are microplastic beads around 5 mm in size which are melted down to produce plastic items. In the wake of this disaster, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has agreed on draft recommendations for transporting plastic pellets on ships. Source: Splash247 --Agencies",

        "content": "Former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan has left the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a short while ago, after providing a statement for around 5 hours. Pilleyan arrived at the CID this morning (20) to provide a statement pertaining to an investigation regarding the controversial documentary aired by British television network Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka. On November 12, the former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province had been summoned to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in order to record a statement related to the allegations in the documentary aired by British television network Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka. However, Pilleyan did not arrive at the CID on the scheduled date instead requested a new date to provide his statement through his attorneys. He was then informed to appear at the CID today and Pilleyan had arrived at the CID at around 9.30 a.m. today. He had left after around 5 hours after recording his statement, Ada Derana reporter said. On 06 September 2023, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s new Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long videos with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by former MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. Speaking at a press conference held on November 11, Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the CID has launched a probe into the relevant incident as per a complaint lodged by an organization with the Ministry of Public Security against the statement made by Azad Maulana to Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. He said that, an investigation was launched by the CID into the controversial statements made by several individuals regarding the Easter attacks.",

        "date": "November 20, 2024 07:20 pm",
        "content": "Palestinians are facing diminishing conditions for survival in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days, the UN has warned. The UN said all its attempts to support the estimated 65,000 to 75,000 people in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalia this month had been denied or impeded, forcing bakeries and kitchens to shut down. Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza. The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals. Hundreds of people have been killed and between 100,000 and 130,000 others have been displaced to Gaza City, where the UN has said essential resources like shelter, water and healthcare are severely limited. UN agencies had planned 31 missions to the besieged areas of North Gaza governorate between 1 and 18 November, according to the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Twenty-seven were rejected by Israeli authorities and the other four were severely impeded, meaning they were prevented from accomplishing all the work they set out to do. This is happening when the IPC Famine Review Committee said just 11 days ago that parts of northern Gaza face an imminent risk of famine - and that immediate action is needed in days, not weeks, UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York. The result is that bakeries and kitchens in North Gaza governorate have shut down, nutrition support for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women has been suspended, and the refuelling of water and sanitation facilities has been completely blocked. Mr Dujarric said access to the three barely functional hospitals there also remained severely restricted, amid what he called desperate shortages of medical supplies and fuel. On Sunday, a World Health Organisation-led mission to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia was able to deliver 10,000 litres of fuel and transfer 17 patients, three unaccompanied children and 22 caregivers to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. However, Mr Dujarric said the aid workers were forced to offload all the food supplies and some of the medical supplies they were transporting at an Israeli military checkpoint before reaching the hospital. The director of Kamal Adwan, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, warned on Wednesday that the situation there was becoming even more catastrophic. Gazas Hamas-run health ministry cited him as saying that the hospital had 85 patients receiving the minimum level of healthcare and that it needed childrens food and infant formula to treat an increasing number of malnutrition cases. Since Tuesday, 17 children had arrived at the emergency room showing signs of malnutrition and an elderly man had died due to severe dehydration, he added. There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). But data from the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, Cogat, said 472 aid lorries had entered northern Gaza via the Erez West crossing as of 17 November, without specifying whether any of that aid was allowed into the besieged areas. Cogat also said it was continuing to work with international partners to facilitate broad humanitarian responses for the civilian population in Gaza. On Monday, a boy from Beit Lahia told BBC Arabics Gaza Today programme that he and his family had fled to Gaza City after the Israeli military dropped leaflets from a quadcopter, ordering their immediate evacuation. The road from Beit Lahia to Gaza City was rough and bumpy with no transport available for us. When we arrived, we didnt find anything... neither food nor drink. We headed to the schools, but there was no space left because the number of displaced... was huge, he said. As a result, we were thrown into the streets and didnt know where to go. We are six families living in the streets, sitting on sand, dirt and debris. The IDF said in a statement on Monday that its forces had killed dozens of terrorists in close-quarters encounters and through targeted strikes in the Beit Lahia area over the past week. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told AFP news agency that a drone had killed two people, including a 15-year-old girl, at a school sheltering displaced families in Beit Lahia. The agencys first responders had also recovered the bodies of seven people killed in an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia, he added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the groups unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 43,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "NPP sweep is earthquake in Sri Lankan politics - Erik Solheim",
        "date": "November 20, 2024 10:15 pm",
        "content": "The stunning electoral sweep of the National Peoples Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is an earthquake in Sri Lankan politics, says Erik Solheim, the former Norwegian peace facilitator in the island nation. The former diplomat also feels that the strong showing by the NPP in areas populated by Tamils, particularly in the north, marked a very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations in Sri Lanka. Solheim, who has interacted closely with many Sri Lankan leaders, however, warned that while the NPPs inner core is for sure non-corrupt, eradicating corruption is a huge task. Voters angry over corruption Solheim, now a committed green activist, piloted the Western-backed peace process which led to a historic pact between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in early 2002. But the process collapsed, triggering a renewed war four years later that led to the decimation in 2009 of the LTTE and the annihilation of virtually its entire leadership including founder-leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. A former leader of the Socialist Left Party in Norway, Solheim remains a keen follower of developments in Sri Lanka, where he once came under attack from sections of the majority Sinhalese community for allegedly being pro-LTTE, a charge he has repeatedly denied. In an email interview with The Federal from China which he frequently visits, Solheim said he did expect the NPP to be very successful in the November 14 elections but their sweeping victory was even bigger than I (expected). He added: It is an earthquake in Sri Lankan politics. For the first time, Sri Lankans elected a president and a party from outside the Colombo establishment, the son of a labourer in Anuradhapura. He said the voters, particularly the less privileged, were angry over corruption, felt that the traditional elite had not represented them well, and were upset they had to cut meals following the economic collapse of 2022. Solheim said that while individually many traditional Sri Lankan leaders were very nice, as a class they have failed Sri Lanka and made the nation underperform compared to say Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia or Tamil Nadu. Is Tamil voting for NPP a rejection of Tamil nationalist politics? For this, he blamed narrow ethnic appeals that led to a prolonged war  and no country marches forward in the midst of a civil war. There was also little ability to formulate a winning economic policy for growth and poverty alleviation. Solheim said the unexpected scale of electoral support to the NPP  a party otherwise rooted in Sinhalese regions  in Tamil areas was an astonishing vote of confidence from many Tamils in the Left-of-Centre party. I believe it represents a strong desire for peace and normalcy in the north and east. It also comes from a trust that the current NPP is not the same as the JVP (Janatha Vimukti Peramuna, Peoples Liberation Front) of the past. The NPP, whose core strength comes from the leftist JVP, won a whopping 159 seats in the 225-seat parliament, decimating a divided Opposition. It also picked up seats in the Tamil-majority north and the multi-racial eastern province. Asked if the Tamil voting for the NPP was a rejection of the Tamil nationalist politics, Solheim said: It is a very strong call for a new start in ethnic relations. If the NPP is able to deliver for Tamils and keep their support, it represents a historic shift. The NPP victory in Tamil areas is considered significant as the JVP, the partys dominant constituent, opposed devolution of power to the Tamil region, stood for a unitary state, and got the once united north-eastern province de-merged into two  all to the chagrin of traditional Tamil politicians. The Norwegian, a former Undersecretary General in the United Nations (UN), said the new governments priority would be to negotiate a better deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to formulate a winning strategy for economic growth with a fairer deal for the poor. Left-wing parties with old-fashioned ideas dont win elections Solheim added that the NPPs performance  it also won the presidency in September  showed that the Left can win elections if they put Left-wing sectarianism aside and come up with a policy with a broad mass appeal. (Dissanayake) embodied this with his inclusive approach. Left-wing parties with old-fashioned ideas dont win elections, he said, pointing to the electoral rout of the once powerful Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. If AKD (Dissanayake) like (President) Lula (da Silva) of Brazil introduces policies for the poor while at the same time working closely with business, the NPP can stay in power for long. Its too early to tell whether we have experienced a new epoch in Sri Lankan politics or just a change of government for five years. This is the chance for the NPP to establish themselves as a long-term ruling entity with the capacity for a big shift in Sri Lanka, he said. Solheim, who often met LTTE leaders including Prabhakaran, reiterated his view that a peace deal could have been found in Sri Lanka in 2002-04. Unfortunately, we didnt succeed... The result was the loss of tens of thousands of lives, mainly Tamils but also many Sinhalese. The war of course also brought huge economic hardship to all communities. Sri Lanka was once the shining star in Asia which nearly every other nation wanted to emulate. Now Sri Lanka needs sustained green economic growth for a number of years to catch up with many neighbours. Does he, as a Sri Lanka watcher, have a message for President Dissanayake? My advice is to focus on economic and ethnic inclusivity. Uplifting the poor is important for all ethnic groups. Added, AKD should respond favourably to the call from Tamils and Muslims for equal rights and self-government, he said. Source: The Federal --Agencies",

The Secretary of the Ministry stated that they expect to prepare the proposal for the electricity tariff revision after obtaining the opinions of the representatives of the IMF as well. Accordingly, the related proposal is expected to be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) in the coming days. On October 24, the CEB had submitted a proposal to the PUCSL regarding the electricity tariff revision. Although the proposal suggested an overall reduction of 6.6 in electricity tariffs, the PUCSL had later informed that the tariff reduction was insufficient. Due to this, the PUCSL had informed the CEB to prepare a new proposal and resubmit it to the commission.",
