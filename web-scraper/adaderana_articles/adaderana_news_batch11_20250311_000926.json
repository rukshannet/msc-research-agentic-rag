        "title": "IMF programme to be reviewed in June",
        "date": "March 22, 2023 03:38 pm",
        "content": "During his speech in Parliament this morning (22 March), after tabling the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the programme will be reviewed every six months. He made these remarks in view of the hardships currently faced by society owing to the recent increase in tax rates, electricity tariffs and other unpopular decisions that were taken in order to fulfill the prerequisites of the IMF programme. We are currently going through a difficult period. We are well aware that a certain section of the society is facing immense hardships due to the tax burden. We also know the entire society is suffering due to inflation. However, we cannot distance ourselves from the policies that have been implemented at this crucial juncture, he said in this regard. The Head of State noted, however, that both the Government and the IMF will review the programme every six months, with the first review scheduled to take place in June this year. We have already focused our attention on amending the existing tax mechanism. The Treasury is already in the process of preparing amended proposals. Further, intellectuals and economic experts have already submitted their views in this regard, which we hope to discuss, and reach an agreement, the President assured. He further noted that despite the efforts of certain individuals to portray ideals that these prevalent issues can be solved through beliefs and confrontations, they can only be solved through caution, care and wisdom. Below is the full speech made by the President: I wish to officially inform this august Assembly that we have been able to secure the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Full control over public finance has been vested in Parliament through the Constitution. Therefore, while tabling the IMF Agreement today, I wish to make my first official statement before Parliament regarding the EFF Sri Lanka has received. On the 9th of July last year, I took over a country that was on fire. A country that was in chaos. A country that seemed to be without an iota of hope for the future. A country that had officially declared itself bankrupt. A country where inflation had risen to 73.7. A country where people suffered for days in queues for fuel and gas. A country with schools closed. A country where ten or twelve hour power cuts were imposed. A country without fertilizer hampering cultivation by farmers. A country where anarchy prevailed in place of law and order. A country where outsiders had forcefully entered public buildings and were in occupation. A country where mob attacks were widespread. A country where homes of opponents were set ablaze. A country where people were assassinated on roads in broad daylight. No one was willing to accept responsibilities in such an environment. Some were reluctant. Some asked for time to check their horoscopes. Some sneaked away. Some panicked. I was requested to take over the country at a time when nobody came forward to shoulder that responsibility. I unconditionally accepted the challenge. I had no power in Parliament. I had no Members of Parliament from my Party to call my own. Even though I had none of these, I had just one strength. This was only my own conviction that I am capable of rebuilding my country. I had numerous experiences to support this conviction of mine. In 2001 the economy of the country experienced a minus growth rate. However, I was able to shift the economy of the country to the right track, within a period of less than two years from the time I took over governance. At that juncture, I was able to secure aid worth 4 billion US through the Tokyo aid summit. Unfortunately, that aid was not properly utilized by those who took over governance subsequently. In the same manner, when I took over the economy in 2015, it was in a weak state. But we were able to achieve a surplus in the budget primary balance by 2018. We also took action to increase salaries by approximately 106 while extending various other relief measures. I only had the confidence gained from previous experiences when I accepted this serious challenge. I accepted the challenge with the conviction that even if I failed, the country would not. Honuorable Speaker, With the receipt of the IMF Facility, it has paved the way for us to build the future of our youth. We have the opportunity to uplift our motherland again. Under this credit facility, we will receive approximately three billion US Dollars within a period of 4 years. We have now received its first tranche of 333 million US Dollars. We expect about 7 billion dollars more of rapid credit support from the World Bank, ADB and other parties that extend credit facilities. There are people who interpret the EFF of the IMF as simply another loan. There are also those who clamor saying that the total debt of the country cannot be paid off with this amount we are to receive. Such statements show either their ignorance, or that they are ready to betray even the country to earn political mileage. With the grant of the EFF from the IMF, we regain recognition in the international arena. We get an assurance that Sri Lanka would no longer be a bankrupt country. Our banks will return to the status with international recognition. International financial institutions will respect our banks letters of credit. The basis for obtaining credit from other international financial institutions at low interest rates will be created. Foreign investors confidence in Sri Lanka will be regained. Numerous comprehensive opportunities in the international arena will come available. The foundation to build a strong new economy will be laid. Further, because of this Agreement, financial discipline in our country will become legislated. Stringent new laws for the prevention of corruption will be introduced. A new financial culture and environment that had not prevailed previously in Sri Lanka will be created through this Facility. Honuorable Speaker, Some tried to make the country totally disfunctional before the IMF took the decision regarding our country. There were plans to create a continuous wave of strikes, to destroy the economy and create anarchy in the country. They expected to prevent the receipt of IMF assistance through such sabotage. Certain political parties, some trade unions and some media labored to cause disruption. They claimed that we will not receive IMF support because the country was unstable. They said IMF support will not be forthcoming because local government elections were not being held. They tried their best to make the people of the country to take to the streets with various false propaganda of this nature. But the majority of the public did not support such acts of subversion. The majority of the public were not willing to disrupt the progress of the country for misplaced initiatives of various power hungry political parties. The people acted with sheer responsibility for the country. Amidst numerous hardships, bearing all kinds of pressure, and undergoing suffering with equanimity, the people of this country remained calm and patient. Their commitment was a great strength in achieving the IMF Facility. Therefore, I firstly wish to extend my gratitude to my people of this country. In this effort, our officials labored day and night. The Ministers worked with unstinted commitment. Most of the Members of this august Assembly extended their support. Some in public. Some in private. I am extremely thankful to all of them for their support. Concomitantly, our key creditors from foreign countries and international organizations championed obtaining of this EFF. I extend the appreciation of Sri Lanka to them all. Honuorable Speaker, We are now starting a new journey. We have to introduce many economic reforms throughout the process. The foundation for our success will be through this path. Some of these reforms have already been proposed and implemented through the interim budget of 2022 and the budget for 2023. We will introduce numerous other reforms. I wish to emphasize some important related matters, including the reforms process that we are implementing and plan to do so in the future. Increasing Public Revenue  We hope to reduce the primary deficit to 2.3 of the GDP by 2025.  The Sri Lankan governments revenue is currently 8.3 of the GDP, making it the country with the lowest revenue collection compared to other countries in the world. We expect to increase the governments revenue up to 15 of the GDP by 2026 through our measures.  We have now raised the standard corporate income tax rate to 30 without sectoral tax holidays.  The PAYE tax rate was increased from 8 to 15.  The measures required to reduce the existing tax exemptions on Value Added Tax (VAT) will come into effect by 2025. Further, necessary measures will be taken to remove the simplified VAT system and expedite its reimbursement.  Steps have also been taken to introduce tax on awards  substitutes and to introduce Estate Duty as a property tax by 2025, while providing an appropriate tax exemption allowance at a minimum. Managing Expenditure  We hope to increase the allocations provided to cover the expenses through proper management of expenditure.  It would also pave the way for adjustments in certain salary scales and pension schemes as part of the impact of inflation within the primary deficit targets. State Enterprises and Energy Cost  Fuel prices will be determined based on the 2018 Price Formula. The adjustment will take place once a month to cover the cost. Therefore, determination of fuel prices will be bereft of politicization.  Measures will also be taken to adjust the tariff on electricity every six months to cover the cost after considering the estimated future cost.  Key loss making state ventures of the balance sheet namely the Road Development Authority, Sri Lankan Airlines, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Ceylon Electricty Board will be restructured. Measures will also be taken to exchange the foreign loans obtained on overdue sovereign guarantees mentioned in the balance sheets of the state-owned enterprises, as payable debt of the Government of Sri Lanka. Price Stability and Fiscal Policies  Inflation rate will be brought back between 4  6. We were able to reduce the inflation that had skyrocketed, to a considerable level. Further, we hope to bring back the inflation rate to a single digit by mid-2023.  When these measures are in progress the country would have to gradually refrain from printing money (Financing the Government by borrowing from the Central Bank to cover the budget deficit). Therefore, the Treasury will have to reduce the budget deficit by a significant amount and utilize various market instruments for this purpose.  While allowing activities of the forex market to be determined on market criterions the existing thresholds and guidelines of that market will be relaxed.  In order to build the foreign reserves according to the set targets the Central Bank intends to purchase foreign currency. Good Governance  The IMF is engaged in the process of preparing a Governance Assessment Report in consultation with local experts. This would allow identifying the loopholes that exist in the frameworks of Sri Lankan administration and the institutions that combat corruption.  Laws will be drafted against corruption in line with UN conventions.  It is also expected to include the provisions with regard to the acquisition of assets to the legislative framework by March 2024.  A new Public Finance Management bill that includes strong fiscal policies, laws, thresholds with regard to obtaining foreign loans and government securities will also be drafted.  The individuals who had obtained permits to import vehicles on concessionary tax basis along with the institutions that enjoy tax concessions  tax holidays of the Board of Investment will be made public. Further, large scale government procurement contracts will also be made public. Progress  Reforms in the IMF-related program also include improving medium and long-term economic growth. Measures with regard to trade reforms, steps to improve participation of women in work force, skills development, minimizing inefficiency and cost in the energy sector through reforms and changes that take place as a result of climate change will be taken into consideration in this regard. Future Measures  During this period the Government intends to submit a comprehensive report on liberalizing the economy and digitalization, sustainable recovery as well as multiple aspects, that go beyond the IMF programs to achieve medium and long-term high growth paths.  Concurrently, talks with our bilateral creditors will begin. We will continue our discussions with them in an open and transparent manner, using the same methods we have used in the past.  Before making final decisions on loan repayment terms, we use an open system that informs all bilateral creditors. The same procedure is followed by other foreign creditors. We hope to carry out the restructuring in a way that is fair to all creditors.  As I stated in an open letter to our official shareholders, we are unconcerned about any creditor. They are fair to everyone. So far, weve been open and friendly with all of them. I will continue to do so.  Reports are published on our pro-Grayas on a regular basis. There is no information about the countrys debt hidden. Honorable Speaker, We are currently going through a difficult period. We are well aware that a certain section of the society is facing immense hardships due to the tax burden. We also know the entire society is suffering due to inflation. However, we cannot distance ourselves from the policies that have been implemented at this crucial juncture. The Government and the IMF will review the programme every six months. The first review will take place in June. We have already focused our attention on amending the existing tax mechanism. The Treasury is already in the process of preparing amended proposals. Further, intellectuals and economic experts have already submitted their views in this regard, which we hope to discuss, and reach an agreement. We are discussing with the IMF to include these tax reforms in our plans at the review in June. In addition, we are discussing the other policy reforms which we think are necessary at present. Some people try to portray that these issues can be solved through beliefs and confrontations. However, these problems have to be solved through caution, care and wisdom. Hon.Speaker, We are at a difficult period of time. However, our difficulties and hardships will be short lived. We can reap the benefits of the commitments and toil within a short period of time. We have to make these sacrifices for the young people of the country, the future generation who are to inherit this nation tomorrow. Therefore the onus is on all of us to build our country. We have to work together towards this end by setting aside criticism of the past. If we implement the economic reforms with proper financial discipline throughout the next four years in accordance with this Agreement, a strong economic foundation will emerge for the future of the country. If we deviate from this path, the entire country will find itself in a worse situation in April, than it was in, sometime back. We hope to schedule the Parliamentary debate on this Agreement in the third week of March. I request the support of all of you in this House in this regard. I also wish to draw the attention of this House to another important matter. We cannot simply be satisfied with only the IMF agreement. This is not the end. This is just the beginning of yet another long journey. We have to traverse that path with vigour. Discussing with our creditors and restructuring the loans as well as recommencing the process of repayment, is a massive challenge. Increasing the income of the country too should happen simultaneously. The local production should be increased. More avenues of foreign income should be explored. We should not only expand our share in the world market but also in our region. A colossal economic reform process should be implemented fearlessly and continuously. All these are not easy goals. However, we have to move forward by making sacrifices for the country. This difficult journey should be made with care. Our primary goal should be building the country. Firstly, secondly and thirdly our sole target should be to build the country. If we follow that line of thinking we can make this journey a success, expeditiously. Honourable Speaker, The IMF-approved plan should be implemented and completed in four years. However, depending on our strength and determination, we should be able to finish it in three to three and a half years. Lets give it a try. Let us put in the effort. We need to emphasize a few points here. First, we must prioritize the establishment of a robust social security system for the most vulnerable individuals in our society. Second, we are currently executing plans and strategies to enhance the value of the rupee. Strategies and a formal plan to strengthen the rupee are being implemented. Third, anti-corruption legislation must be passed and implemented immediately. Fourth, we should focus on implementing necessary structural reforms in our society. These reforms should be identified and carried out accordingly. Honourable Speaker, Our country received no foreign aid during D. S. Senanayakes premiership. Later, instead of working with our countrys income, a tradition of running the country on foreign borrowings was adopted. It became a cancer that led to our current suffering. We cant keep borrowing money all the time. We should strive to be a debt-free country. Therefore, we must all unite to get out of this difficult period. We must pay off all of our previous debts over the next ten years. I am confident that if we stay on the right track, we will be able to achieve that goal. After we pay off the debt, we should build our capacity to generate enough income to meet the countrys expenses. If we continue on this path, we can make our country one of the most developed in the world by 2048, when we will celebrate 100 years of independence. Here I would like to draw your attention to another point. Recently, an opinion was published. Theravada Buddhist countries are always economically poor. Thailand is now working hard to change this perception. We, as the Theravada centre of the world, should work to change that perception. We can change that opinion as children of one mother if we work together. We can re-establish Sri Lanka as a global economic powerhouse. Honourable Speaker, When I became the Prime Minister I wasted no time in requesting the support of the Opposition towards the effort of rebuilding the economy of the country. However I did not receive that support. Subsequently, at the occasion of opening of Parliament as the President I once again requested their support but it was to no avail. During the Budget debate too I requested the same of the Opposition, but they did not come forward. Yet again, at the occasion of the opening of this Parliament Session too I sought their support. But that request too frittered away. They refused to extend their support citing various reasons. They said that my appointment was unconstitutional. They opined that Prime Ministers cannot be appointed from the National List. They even went to the extent of saying that my ambition was not to salvage the country from the economic crisis but to save the Rajapakses. They said that it was not Sri Lanka that I was trying to take across the obstacle course, but Namal Rajapaksa. However, now the international community has endorsed that I strove to reconstruct the Sri Lankan economy. It has now been proved beyond doubt that accusations of the Opposition are baseless. I do not intend to respond to those unfounded accusations. My task is not to criticize the past. My task is to build the future of the country. I am committed to building the nation by formulating laws to ensure that past errors would not recur. Even today, I request the Opposition to join this effort of building the country. Leave your personal political aspirations aside. Think of empowering the country before gaining power for yourself. You can follow your own agenda on other political matters. However, it is imperative that you act out of the box politically with regard to building the economy of the country. Help me in the process of strengthening the economy. I make that request again, and seek your valuable support in the implementation of IMF Agreement, and building the economy of our motherland.",

        "title": "UN: 26 of world lacks clean drinking water, 46 sanitation",
        "date": "March 22, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "A report launched on the eve of the first major U.N. conference on water in over 45 years says 26 of the worlds population doesnt have access to safe drinking water and 46 lacks access to basic sanitation. The U.N. World Water Development Report 2023, issued Tuesday, painted a stark picture of the huge gap that needs to be filled to meet U.N. goals to ensure all people have access to clean water and sanitation by 2030. Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told a news conference that the estimated cost of meeting the goals is between 600 billion and 1 trillion a year. But equally important, Connor said, is forging partnerships with investors, financiers, governments and climate change communities to ensure that money is invested in ways to sustain the environment and provide potable water to the 2 billion people who dont have it and sanitation to the 3.6 million in need. According to the report, water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1 per year over the last 40 years and is expected to grow at a similar rate through to 2050, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns. Connor said that actual increase in demand is happening in developing countries and emerging economies where it is driven by industrial growth and especially the rapid increase in the population of cities. It is in these urban areas that youre having a real big increase in demand, he said. With agriculture using 70 of all water globally, Connor said, irrigation for crops has to be more efficient  as it is in some countries that now use drip irrigation, which saves water. That allows water to be available to cities, he said. As a result of climate change, the report said, seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant  such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America  and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply, such as the Middle East and the Sahara in Africa. On average, 10 of the global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress  and up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year, said the report issued by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Since 2000, floods in the tropics have quadrupled while floods in the north mid-latitudes have increased 2.5-fold, the report said. Trends in droughts are more difficult to establish, it said, although an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts and heat extremes can be expected in most regions as a direct result of climate change. As for water pollution, Connor said, the biggest source of pollution is untreated wastewater. Globally, 80 of wastewater is released to the environment without any treatment, he said, and in many developing countries its pretty much 99. These and other issues including protecting aquatic ecosystems, improving management of water resources, increasing water reuse and promoting cooperation across borders on water use will be discussed during the three-day U.N. Water Conference co-chaired by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Tajikistans President Emomali Rahmon opening Wednesday. There are 171 countries, including over 100 ministers, on the speakers list along with more than 20 organizations. The meeting will also include five interactive dialogues and dozens of side events.

        "content": "A recent research conducted by ECA International has revealed that Sri Lanka , amongst a few other countries, saw the largest increase in expense for travellers. The research conducted by ECA International ranked countries based on costs for short trip expenses: four-star hotel rooms, meals, laundry, alcoholic and soft drinks, journeys by taxi and incidental costs, with the aim of helping organizations anticipate the cost of business trips and short-term assignments. Accordingly, Sri Lanka, Laos and Pakistan saw the largest increase in expenses for travellers, the report revealed, adding that soaring inflation rates were likely contributory factors. As per the report, business travel expenses in Colombo were 75, in terms of local currency, than they were in 2022. This primarily stemmed from high inflation and currency depreciation, since some costs associated with business travel  are typically incurred in US dollars by foreign business travelers here, it said in this regard. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Singapore sat at the top of the list for most expensive locations for business travel in Asia, with the daily costs in each country amounting to USD 520 and USD 515, respectively.",

        "title": "No risk of Listeria outbreak yet - Health authorities",
        "date": "March 22, 2023 08:30 pm",
        "content": "The bacteria-born disease Listeriosis can cause complications for individuals with weakened immunity, says the Health Promotion Bureau. Addressing a press conference today (March 22), Dr. Samitha Ginige, Head of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry, stated that no outbreak of Listeriosis has been identified within Sri Lanka as of yet. However, the chief epidemiologist also highlighted that it is very much important for the general public to be aware of the disease in order to avoid contracting the disease. Dr. Samitha Ginige mentioned that although exaggerated facts were reported recently on various media reports and on social media regarding this disease, Listeriosis is not a disease that will turn into a large-scale epidemic. The disease is spread through contaminated food, especially dairy food products. No symptoms will appear in healthy individuals, but complications can occur in rare instances. Especially, complications may rarely occur in pregnant women, individuals diagnosed with cancers, renal failures and people with long-term disease conditions. This is the condition of Listeriosis, he emphasized. Commenting further, the chief epidemiologist expressed that the disease initially appears only as a minor stomachache condition for most of the healthy individuals, whereas it can rarely cause death if the complications in an individual with weakened immunity may develop into Encephalitis (Brain Fever). The global spread of Listeriosis is at a minimum level, Dr. Ginige said, mentioning that only 0.1 to 0.10 cases are reported globally per million. Therefore, this is not a medical condition that should cause undue fear of an epidemic situation, he added. Dr. Samitha Ginige also commented on the current situation of the Listeria figures reported within Sri Lanka; The first patient was reported from Sri Lanka in the last week of February. He is middle-aged. Due to complications, he died of a developed Encephalitis condition. We have confirmed that it was caused by Listeria. He was the only confirmed Listeriosis case which was reported in Sri Lanka recently, no other patients were reported. Few others, who had gone to Sri Pada and became ill, had been hospitalized. Among them, two deaths were also reported. We could not find any link between those two deaths and Listeria, based on the data we have. But their tissue cultures are still being tested. Also, another person who fell ill after going on a pilgrimage to Sri Pada has now recovered. No evidence that he suffered Listeriosis. Besides, there are no reports of any other patients in Sri Lanka. From the samples tested so far, there are no reports of patients with suspected listeriosis. That is why it is said that there is no outbreak of the disease, there is no risk. The food and water samples that we tested were not reported to be contaminated with Listeria. Furthermore, Dr. Ginige highlighted that in case of Listeriosis, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain and body pains appear as symptoms, adding that an abdominal pain is not in fact, Listeriosis. However, he requested the general public to be vigilant of the food and water consumed by them.",

        "title": "Uganda faces calls to reject appalling anti-LGBTQ bill",
        "date": "March 22, 2023 09:27 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations and the United States led calls Wednesday for Ugandas President Yoweri Museveni to reject what has been labelled an appalling anti-gay bill. Ugandan lawmakers approved the Anti-Homosexuality Act late on Tuesday after a chaotic near seven-hour session, ordering harsh penalties for anyone who engages in same-sex activity. Homosexuality was already illegal in the conservative East African nation and it was not immediately clear what new penalties had been agreed, with reports some offenders could face life in prison or even the death penalty. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged Museveni not to promulgate the bill into law. The passing of this discriminatory bill - probably among the worst of its kind in the world - is a deeply troubling development, he said in a statement. If signed into law by the president, it will render lesbian, gay and bisexual people in Uganda criminals simply for existing, for being who they are. It could provide carte blanche for the systematic violation of nearly all of their human rights and serve to incite people against each other. Grave assault Amnesty International also appealed to Museveni to reject the appalling legislation, describing it as a grave assault on LGBTQ people. This ambiguous, vaguely worded law even criminalises those who promote homosexuality, said Amnestys east and southern Africa director, Tigere Chagutah. Lawmakers amended significant portions of the original draft legislation with all but one speaking in favour of the bill. MP Fox Odoi-Oywelowo, a member of Musevenis National Resistance Movement party who spoke against the bill, told AFP that offenders would face life imprisonment or even the death penalty for aggravated offences. Amnesty said Museveni must urgently veto this appalling legislation, saying it would institutionalise discrimination, hatred, and prejudice against the LGBTQ community. The discussion about the bill in parliament has been laced with homophobic language and Museveni himself last week referred to gay people as deviants. Nevertheless, the 78-year-old veteran leader has consistently signalled he does not view the issue as a priority, and would prefer to maintain good relations with Western donors and investors. Deeply troubling US Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined calls for the government to reconsider the legislation, saying on Twitter it would undermine fundamental human rights of all Ugandans and could reverse gains in the fight against HIVAIDS. Britains Africa minister Andrew Mitchell said he was deeply disappointed with the passage of the bill while Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks special envoy on LGBTQ rights, Nicholas Herbert, warned it risked increasing discrimination and persecution of people across Uganda. While many countries, including a number on the African continent, are moving towards decriminalisation this is a deeply troubling step in the opposite direction, Herbert said on Twitter. Gay sex is allowed or has been decriminalised in Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Rwanda, and the Seychelles. Uganda is notorious for its intolerance of homosexuality, and the passage of the bill was welcomed by some. We are very happy as citizens of Uganda. Culturally we do not... accept homosexuality, lesbianism, LGBTQ. We cannot, said one local resident, 54-year-old Abdu Mukasa. We were created by God. God created man and woman. And we cannot accept one sex to go on the same sex. Homosexuality was criminalised in Uganda under colonial-era laws but since independence from Britain in 1962 there has never been a conviction for consensual same-sex activity. A court later struck down the law on a technicality, but it had already sparked international condemnation, with some Western nations freezing or redirecting millions of dollars of government aid in response. Last week, police said they had arrested six men for practising homosexuality in the southern lakeside town of Jinja. Another six men were arrested on the same charge on Sunday, according to police.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that due to the public sector engaging in business activities, the money that was available for the construction of 100 projects similar to the Mahaweli during the past decades, has been destroyed. He noted that in the future, the public sector will stop engaging in business and open it to the private sector to create a free and productive economy, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. President Wickremesinghe mentioned this at the 71st commemoration ceremony of the late Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake at Independence Square today (March 22), the PMD reported. Recalling that Mr. D.S. Senanayakes vision was to create a free economy, the President said that business should be done by the private sector and that the country could be developed with the tax revenue obtained from them. However, due to the nationalization in 1956, the Government started engaging in business and that is why the tax revenue was inadequate for the development of the country, the President pointed out. He stated that the country has distanced itself from Mr. D.S. Senanayakes vision, but following his vision, Singapore has become a developed country today and said that despite our politicians dreaming of making Sri Lanka a Singapore, the destruction caused to Sri Lanka in the last 75 years due to the decisions of certain political movements is immense, it added. Therefore, the President further mentioned that Senanayakes legacy should be carried forward to build a strong and powerful Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe also laid floral tributes at the statue of the late D. S. Senanayake. The Chief Incumbent of the Kollupitiya Polwatta Sri Dharmakeerthi Monastery Venerable Dr. Bandarawela Wimaladharma Thera delivered a special sermon, according to the PMD.

        "content": "The long-awaited first batch of imported eggs arrived in Sri Lanka early this morning (March 23), Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation chairperson T.A.D. Ranjith says. The shipment, which was initially scheduled to arrive in late February but was delayed several times due to certification matters, contains a total of 2 million eggs imported from India. The eggs consignment will be released following the necessary tests planned to be conducted by the Health Ministry. The Sri Lankan government decided to import eggs in a bid to control the soaring prices of eggs and to address the shortage in the local market. The imported eggs will not be sold at stores for general consumption, as it is decided that these eggs be sold at Rs. 40 or less for food manufacturers. Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera recently gave directives to the relevant officials to expeditiously prepare a series of guidelines on how imported eggs should be handled in the bakery industry. It is recommended that gloves are used when handling imported eggs in the bakery industry and eggshells are safely discarded, ensuring that the remaining eggshells are not dumped on the environment under any circumstances. Meanwhile, ahead of the arrival of the first batch, the special commodity levy imposed on imported eggs was also slashed from Rs. 50 to Rs. 1 for a period of three months, effective from February 21.",

        "date": "March 23, 2023 10:26 am",
        "content": "Canada saw record population growth in 2022, with immigration accounting for the vast majority of the 1.05 million new residents. This is the first time in the countrys history that its population has grown by more than one million people in a 12-month period, according to a press release from Statistics Canada published Wednesday. The total population reached 39,566,248 million on January 1  2.7 higher than a year prior, with immigration accounting for 95.9 of that growth, according to the countrys statistics agency. While other developed nations grapple with slowing population growth, Canada has the fastest-growing population of any G7 nation, and a 2.7 growth rate ranks in the top 20 globally. If the countrys population were to continue growing at the same rate, it would double in around 26 years, said Statistics Canada. The number of immigrants arriving in Canada reached a record 437,180 in 2022, and increased immigration is related to efforts by the Government of Canada to ease labour shortages in key sectors of the economy, said Statistics Canada. High job vacancies and labour shortages are occurring in a context where population aging has accelerated in Canada and the unemployment rate remains near record low, added the agency. In late 2022 the Canadian government announced that it wants to bring in 1.5 million immigrants by 2025, to bolster the gap in its economy created by an aging population. Canada ranks highest on Gallups Migrant Acceptance Index, and Gallup data released December 7 last year found that Canadians are consistently among the most likely in the world to see their communities as good places for migrants to live. However Statistics Canada raises some potential future challenges should the 2022 trend continue. A rise in the number of permanent and temporary immigrants could also represent additional challenges for some regions of the country related to housing, infrastructure and transportation, and service delivery to the population, said the agency. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meanwhile is facing pressure from political opponents over migration levels, due to a sharp increase of people crossing into Canada from the US. In January, Canadian authorities encountered nearly 5,000 asylum seekers crossing unlawfully, according to government data. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok and its CEO are fighting to save the app in the US",
        "date": "March 23, 2023 04:13 pm",
        "content": "At a Harvard Business Review conference earlier this month, where executives, professors and artists appeared for talks on corporate leadership and emotional intelligence, Shou Chew attempted to save his company. In his talk, Chew, the CEO of TikTok, said the social network would not provide US user data to the Chinese government and has never been asked to do so. Chew stressed the steps TikTok has taken to protect US user data. And four separate times, Chew told the audience that the platforms mission was to inspire creativity and bring joy to users. The Harvard event is just one of several media appearances Chew has made in recent weeks amid mounting scrutiny of TikTok and of himself. Chew is set to testify on Thursday for the first time before a Congressional committee about TikToks consumer privacy and data security practices, the platforms impact on kids, and its relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, according to a statement last week from the committee. Meanwhile, federal officials are now demanding the apps Chinese owners sell their stake in the social media platform, or risk facing a US ban of the app. Chew, a Singaporean who has largely stayed out of the spotlight since taking over TikTok in 2021, recently sat for interviews with multiple US newspapers and this week showed up in a video on the corporate TikTok account to highlight the vast reach of the app, which he revealed now has more than 150 million users in the United States. Thats almost half the US coming to TikTok to connect, to create, to share, to learn, or just to have some fun, said Chew, wearing in a hoodie and t-shirt like any other American tech executive in the clip. This comes at a pivotal moment for us. Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok, now this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you. Chews heightened visibility appears to be part of a larger messaging campaign by TikTok to bolster its reputation in the US and remind voters  and their representatives  how essential the social network is to American culture. A press conference is planned for Wednesday with dozens of social media creators on the steps of the Capitol, some of whom have been flown out there by TikTok. The company is paying for a blitz of advertisements for a Beltway audience. And last week it put out a docuseries highlighting American small business owners who rely on the platform for their livelihoods. Behind the scenes, Chew has also met with members of Congress and TikTok recently invited researchers and academics to its Washington, D.C., offices to learn more about how it is working to address lawmakers concerns over its ties to China through its parent company, ByteDance. Its parent company has also ramped up federal lobbying, spending more than 5 million last year, according to data tracked by OpenSecrets. Its life or death for TikTok, from their perspective, said Justin Sherman, the CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, D.C.-based research and advisory firm, who was among the researchers TikTok invited to be briefed on Project Texas, the companys 1.5 billion initiative to address lawmakers security concerns. They are throwing everything they can at the problem. In a statement, TikTok spokesman Jamal Brown said: A U.S. ban on TikTok could have a direct impact on the livelihoods of millions of Americans. Lawmakers in Washington debating TikTok should hear firsthand from people whose lives would be directly affected by their decisions. TikToks messaging campaign For much of the past year, TikTok has been rolling out new features and policies to address privacy and security concerns that the Chinese government could gain access to US user data, as well as broader fears that its app, like other social platforms, can be harmful to some younger users. TikTok recently set a default one-hour daily screen time limit on every account for users under 18 in one of the most aggressive moves yet by a social media company to prevent teens from endlessly scrolling. It rolled out a feature that aimed to offer more information to users about why its powerful algorithm recommends certain videos. And the company pledged more transparency to researchers. Facing concerns about its parent companys ties to China, TikTok has also taken a number of steps to more clearly separate its US operations and user data from other parts of the organization. That includes moving all its US user data to Oracles cloud platform, where it says it hosts 100 of US user traffic. The messaging campaign has only ramped up this week ahead of the hearing. TikTok rolled out refreshed Community Guidelines for content, which the company framed as being based on our commitment to uphold human rights and aligned with international legal frameworks. And Chew once again stressed TikToks independence from China. I understand that there are concerns stemming from the inaccurate belief that TikToks corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, Chew said in prepared remarks ahead of his testimony before Congress. This is emphatically untrue. At the same time, TikTok is now betting on a strategy from American tech companies who have faced scrutiny for other reasons, playing up the impact it has on small businesses in the United States, including with the CEOs prepared remarks and a mini docuseries it released last week titled TikTok Sparks Good. The series spotlighted inspiring stories of American small business owners and creators. The first of the 60-second clips features a Mississippi soap maker with a deep Southern accent who built her company on the app, and the second features an educator who quit his job to focus on sharing informational videos on TikTok aimed at teaching toddlers how to read. Because of TikTok, Im reaching millions of families who want to teach their toddlers how to read, the educator says. Dozens of TikTok creators who oppose a ban will also be holding a press conference on Capitol grounds on Wednesday evening with Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York. TikTok flew out some of the creators, the company confirmed to CNN. (The Information was first to report the move.) The list of expected attendees includes a disabled Asian American creator using her platform to combat ableism, a small business owner from South Carolina who launched a greeting card company via TikTok, and an Ohio-based chef who built her bakery business via the app. Some of the creators have hundreds of thousand or even millions of followers on TikTok. Too little too late Even with these efforts, Sherman expressed some skepticism about how persuasive the PR push will be, mostly because of how divided Washington is right now. Not everyone wants a ban, he said. For some lawmakers, it will matter that TikTok is taking all these steps to address security concerns. But for others, it wont move the needle. Some lawmakers, frankly, do not care what ads TikTok is taking out, what pledges its making on its blog about independence, data privacy  They see an unmitigable risk of Chinese government access to data andor influence over content, and so are going to push for a complete ban. Lindsay Gorman, a senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Funds Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former Biden administration adviser, said that by and large, TikToks lobbying efforts so far have been pretty ineffective. The problem, she said, is two-fold. First, even if TikTok takes steps to bolster its safeguards today, as it has been doing with Project Texas, concerns remain that its always one update away from becoming a vulnerability. And second, TikToks PR efforts in Washington wont undo previous moments when the company shot itself in the foot by making what she said were inaccurate statements to Congress, and then having revelations come out showing that those were inaccurate. After the initial, Trump-era calls for a TikTok ban appeared to fade in Washington, BuzzFeed reported in 2021 that US user data was repeatedly accessed from China and that everything is seen in China. The details in the report were seemingly at odds with remarks a TikTok executive gave before a Senate panel earlier that year, claiming that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China. Following the report, TikTok once again became a hot button issue in the nations capital. But even as suspicion among US lawmakers grew, so did the apps popularity in the country. I do think TikToks strongest argument to date is drawing on its creator user base, Gorman said. But for some lawmakers with security concerns, the latest push may be too little too late. In his TikTok video on Tuesday, Chew appealed directly to users of the app. The CEO asked them to write in the comments section to share what you want your elected representatives to know about what you love about TikTok. The top comment on the clip, which has received upwards of 50,000 likes, simply reads: You know something went wrong when the boss has to show up. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "March 23, 2023 04:28 pm",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan national prisoner Riyaz Khan Razak (39) allegedly escaped from police custody while being escorted back to Puzhal prison from Madurai at Perani in Villupuram district in India on March 21, 2023 night. An alert has been issued to apprehend the suspect who was arrested on charges of theft and offences punishable under the Foreigners Act, 1946, and Passport Act, 1950. Special teams mounted vigil at Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camps and settlements across the State to look for the escapee, police sources said. Razak, lodged in Puzhal central prison, was taken to Madurai and produced in a Judicial Magistrate court in connection with a case registered against him by the South Gate police in 2019. While being escorted back to Chennai in a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation air-conditioned bus by a three-member escort team, the suspect gave the slip to the police and escaped. The bus had stopped at a restaurant near Perani for dinner when the incident took place, the sources said. A fresh case was registered by the Vikravandi police against Razak, a native of Trincomalee in Sri Lanka, for pushing the escort police personnel while boarding the bus and making good his escape. Besides the case pending in Madurai, he was involved in crimes in Ramanathapuram and Coimbatore. On information that Razak was in the habit of staying in the vicinity of major railway stations to commit crimes, the Government Railway Police were alerted to keep a close watch in and around railway stations in Chennai, Villupuram, Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Salem, Madurai and Tirunelveli. Razaks photograph was shared to all citydistrict police, the Coastal Security Group and other law-enforcing agencies, the sources added. Police were investigating the antecedents of the suspect and his connections with other Sri Lankan nationals already arrested and lodged in prisonsSpecial Camp in other cases.

        "date": "March 23, 2023 04:37 pm",
        "content": "The Election Commission says the postal voting of the 2023 Local Government polls, scheduled to be held from March 28 to March 31, will not go ahead as planned. The decision was reached at a meeting held earlier today (March 23) with the secretaries of the political parties vying for the LG polls. In a press release, the Commissioner General of Elections, Saman Sri Ratnayake said the election body is expected to reach a decision on the LG poll date after studying the relevant legal matters and the suggestions made by the political party secretaries. After being repeatedly postponed, the LG election was eventually rescheduled for April 25, however, it is most likely to be deferred as the printing of ballot papers is put on hold due to a lack of funds. The Department of Government Printing has made repeated requests from the Finance Ministry seeking the funds it needs to go ahead with the printing of ballot papers. The Government Printer recently warned that the already-printed ballot papers would not be delivered to the Election Commission unless the Treasury provides the requested sum of money for the Printing Department to cover the costs incurred thus far. During the meeting, several political party secretaries had proposed that a new election date be decided on as the LG polls, under the prevailing circumstances, cannot be held on April 25, as planned. Meanwhile, some deemed it best to declare a new election date after making sure all necessary facilities are available and the environment is conducive to holding the LG polls. However, several political party secretaries have stressed that the election should not be postponed under any circumstances due to the interim orders issued by the court. The Supreme Court recently issued an interim order directing the Finance Secretary to refrain from withholding the budgetary allocations for the LG election. Meanwhile, the tenure of 340 local government bodies, except that of Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, expired at midnight on March 19. Thereby, the authority of 29 municipal councils has been transferred to municipal commissioners while the authority of 275 local councils was transferred to the secretaries of relevant institutions.",

The decision was taken in view of the fact that the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector has been a severe burden on the countrys economy for several years. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved, in principle, the divestiture of various companies, including SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering, Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), Canwill Holdings (Grand Hyatt Colombo), Hotel Developers Lanka (Hilton Hotel Colombo), Litro Gas Lanka, Litro Gas Terminals and Lanka Hospitals. The SRU will appoint reputed, qualified and experienced consultancy firms and development financial institutions to provide transaction advisory services to assist with the divestitures, while the process of selecting such transaction advisors is due to commence shortly. The transaction advisors will, inter-alia, assist the SRU with sell-side due diligence, valuation, data room creation, transaction strategy and marketing of the entities to be divested. The divestiture program will be carried out by the SRU in a transparent and credible manner and investor selection will commence with an EOI  RFP process to be published in the local and international press.

        "date": "March 23, 2023 10:47 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Japan provided USD 1.6 million to UN Women in support of humanitarian assistance for women most affected by the socio-economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The funding is part of a new project Empowering women in crisis, running from February 2023 to December 2023, which will support at least 1,200 women, including their children who have faced sexual and gender-based violence. It will further support 500 women-led micro-enterprises at risk of collapse and over 2,000 individuals at risk of poverty and malnutrition. Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hidaki stressed: Our goal is to ensure that women and girls who are most vulnerable to the ongoing crisis are not left behind in response and recovery efforts, and to ensure that their safety and security are prioritized during this time. As reports on the ground reflect a continuing increase in cases of sexual and gender-based violence, the ongoing crisis and economic instability have hindered access to state services such as safe houses and shelters resulting in devastating implications for women and girls. Through this project, UN Women will provide safe houses with continued access to commodities including food and other essential items. Additionally, it will ensure that shelters and safe houses where facilities were improved and refurbished continue to function rather than face closure due to inadequate funding and support. This will ensure that more safe houses are available for women and girls fleeing abusive circumstances. Moreover, due to a lack of access to viable employment opportunities and soaring food inflation, there is an urgent need to ensure that households  particularly those already vulnerable and marginalized  have access to basic food and necessities to support their survival. We are grateful for the contribution provided by the Government of Japan to address the urgent needs of women and girls, said Prashani Dias, Head of Office a.i. at UN Women Sri Lanka. This will provide income-generating resources and life-saving support to vulnerable women, and ensure that the status of women and girls in the country does not regress further. To support these efforts, this project will work with women-led enterprises to strengthen their business resilience and livelihoods through the provision of in-kind support and business development trainings, in the districts of Ampara, Colombo, Monaragala, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu.",

        "date": "March 23, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "Chinas Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on all related parties, in particular Western commercial creditors and multilateral financial institutions, to make contributions to alleviating the debt pressure of developing countries amid the tightening international financial environment. The remarks were made by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, after outgoing World Bank chief David Malpass reportedly called on China to be more active in restructuring discussions for developing countries in debt crises. The US has raised interest rates at an unprecedented pace since last year, leading to a tightening international financial environment, and has made the debt problem of some countries even worse, Wang said at a press conference, when asked about the World Bank chiefs remarks. The truth is China has been attaching great importance to the debt issue of certain developing countries and has made contributions to easing their burdens and promoting sustainable development, Wang said, noting that China was the largest contributor to the implementation of the G20s Debt Service Suspension Initiative, Wang noted. The Export-Import Bank of China has provided financing support documents to Sri Lanka to help it address debt issues swiftly and effectively, which fully speaks to Chinas sincerity and effort to support Sri Lanka in achieving debt sustainability, Wang said. The spokesperson called on commercial and multilateral creditors to take part in Sri Lankas debt restructuring under the principle of fair burden-sharing. Over 80 percent of the sovereign debt of 121 developing countries comes from multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors, making them the main lenders who bring repayment pressures to developing countries, Wang said, citing World Bank statistics. African governments owe three times more debt to Western banks, asset managers and oil traders than to China, and are charged double the interest, according to research released by British NGO Debt Justice in July 2022. Western creditors, on the pretext of protecting their credit ratings, have consistently refused to participate in debt reduction efforts, Wang said. Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that China has taken a responsible attitude over the debt issue of developing countries and regions, and it has never attached any political strings to its loans, unlike Western developed countries. Some Western financial institutions have been lending to developing countries based on their own interests instead of the actual needs and situations of the borrowers, Dong said, urging them to redress the unreasonable patterns of lending so as to help the people of the developing countries.

        "title": "With IMF bailout, Sri Lanka will have healthy dollar reserves in 4 years: CBSL governor",
        "date": "March 24, 2023 10:13 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout will help bring Sri Lankas depleted foreign exchange reserve to pre-crisis levels in four years, said the countrys central bank governor. On Tuesday, the IMF extended a long-awaited US3 billion (S4 billion) loan to the island nation, which has been reeling since 2021 from its worst economic crisis since independence. The bailout comes with a structured four-year programme that requires Sri Lanka to achieve debt sustainability, shore up more foreign exchange to create a healthy reserve, and improve state revenue by raising taxes and slashing utility subsidies. Sri Lanka owes around US51 billion to external lenders, the repayment of which was suspended when its government declared bankruptcy in July 2022. During the programme period of four years, we are committed to bringing foreign exchange reserves back to levels we had before the crisis, which is about US8 billion to US9 billion  this is not comfortable, but it will be sufficient, Central Bank of Sri Lanka governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told The Straits Times on Thursday. The most Sri Lanka has ever had in reserve is US10 billion, he said. Among the sources of US dollars will be concessional loans of up to US7 billion from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and other financial institutions, private investments, and export earnings, the governor added. We will also engage in good faith with our foreign creditors through a debt-restructuring process to reduce our annual debt service payments, which is now a significant US6 billion per year, said Mr Weerasinghe. The import-dependent countrys reserves had dipped dangerously to US500 million in 2021, but improved to US2.2 billion in February 2023 after Sri Lanka stopped interest payouts and some countries such as India extended fuel on credit. Blaming previous governments for borrowing excessively from the global markets at commercial interest rates to finance fiscal deficit, Mr Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka would have access to borrow from the international market only after the four-year programme. I would advise the government that even if we have access to the commercial market, our borrowings will have to be much more carefully evaluated, and properly invested in areas that can generate enough foreign exchange to service the debt, he added. From 2010 to 2021, the share of such commercial borrowings  called sovereign bonds  in Sri Lankas external debt tripled, from 12 per cent to 36 per cent. In 2021, they accounted for 70 per cent of the governments annual interest payments. Mr Weerasinghe took over the central bank in April 2022 from his much-criticised predecessor, Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal. Mr Cabraal was known to be close to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, and had served as his economic adviser when the latter was prime minister. Mr Cabraal had opposed an IMF bailout in favour of a domestic solution to the economic crisis. But as dollar reserves dipped, the island could not afford to import food, medicine, fertiliser and fuel, triggering grave shortages. Struggling Sri Lankans launched massive protests across the nation in April 2022, forcing then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to resign. The Parliament then appointed Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe as president and he is now leading the economic recovery. Source: Strait Times -Agencies",

He made this comment addressing an event held at the Meteorology Department on Thursday (March 23) to mark the 2023 World Meteorological Day. The event was themed Future of Weather, Climate and Water Across Generation. Speaking further, the state minister stressed the importance of adopting new technology for providing up-to-date weather forecasts based on advanced data which would be of immense use to other sectors such as agriculture, power, fisheries, and tourism. He added that its contributions would be invaluable in financial terms. He highlighted the timely importance of standardizing and maintaining stringent building standards on the fast-emerging high-rise and high-occupancy buildings for ensuring safety in a changing climatic and geological environment. Addressing the event, Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne said the Meteorology Department has effectively evolved to take up new challenges while maintaining traditional roles. Disaster management authorities and armed forces are ever prepared to face any disasters or emergency situations, he added. The Defence Secretary went on to note that Sri Lanka should continue to work in cooperation and commit to taking measures to minimize damages caused by such disasters, although it is difficult to forecast geological disturbances. Director-Generals of the Meteorology Department, DMC and NBRO, officers of the Defence Ministry and senior state officials were also present at the occasion. World Meteorological Day is celebrated on March 23 every year commemorating the coming into force on 23 March 1950 of the Convention establishing the World Meteorological Organization.",

        "date": "March 24, 2023 11:28 am",
        "content": "Holders of Sri Lankas international sovereign bonds face a 20 principal haircut in the countrys debt restructuring as well as maturity extensions and a reduction in coupons, according to a Barclays report. Investors focus has shifted to the restructuring of Sri Lankas 13.4 billion sovereign dollar bonds after Colombo got final sign-off on a 3 billion programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this week, a financial lifeline in its bid to recover from its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades. Barclays estimates investors holding the countrys sovereign bonds could see a recovery value - the percentage they recoup on their investment - in the mid-40s while exit yields could range from 12 to 15. An inclusion of instruments such as GDP-warrants which link payout to a countrys economic performance in the debt restructuring could potentially improve the recovery value to the mid-50s. Board approval of the IMF facility paves the way for bondholder talks and start of a debt-restructuring process, Avanti Save at Barclays wrote in the note to clients. The island nation of 22 million people defaulted on its external debt with private creditors last year, and still needs to negotiate a debt restructuring with bilateral creditors such as India, China and the Paris Club. Analysts at investment firm Tellimer put together three baseline restructuring scenarios with six-year maturity extension for all of them and nominal haircuts raging between 15 to 30, with higher coupons corresponding to lower haircuts. Each scenario results in public debt falling to around 111 of GDP this year and below 95 by 2032, the firm added, in line with the IMFs debt to GDP targets. Each of the three baseline scenarios also implies roughly equal net present value relief of 23-28 at the IMFs preferred 5 discount rate, the Tellimer report added. The firm added that its using higher exit yields -ranging from 12 to 14- to calculate the debt restructuring scenarios amid a sharp rise in risk-free rates over the past couple of years combined with a rise in emerging market spreads in recent weeks. Barclays also noted that the IMFs restructuring scenario assumed that certain domestic debts will be reprofiled. The IMF itself said in the programme published this week that Sri Lankas authorities are weighing different options on how to treat local currency debt under local law. However, the nations state finance minister Shehan Semasinghe told Reuters that it was too premature to comment on a domestic debt overhaul as a final decision on whether such a restructuring would take place had not been taken. The countrys international bonds have been trading at deeply distressed levels for months, with most between 37 to 39 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

People are saying CPC is better, now that we have both a profit and an income. But what is the point of having profits and incomes if we cant provide a certain extent of relief to the public? This is why we need competitors within the market, the Minister said in this regard. Once the National Energy committee gives its approvals it will be presented to the Cabinet for its consent.

The chairperson of the Colombo Commercial Fertilizers Ltd., Jagath Perera mentioned this while handing over the daily report on fertilizer distribution to Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera this morning. Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), a shipment of 36,000 metric tons of TSP fertilizer reached the island on March 16 following a hiatus of three cultivation seasons. The consignment was officially handed over to the Agriculture Ministry by the US Embassy in Colombo on Sunday (March 19). The TSP fertilizer shipment, procured by the Food  Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to be distributed free of charge to farmers, was delivered on a promise made by USAID Administrator Samantha Power last September in response to Sri Lankas food security challenges. Colombo Commercial Colombo Commercial Fertilizers Ltd. is overseeing the distribution of 15,000 MT of TSP fertilizer. The company is expected to wind up the distribution process by tomorrow (March 25) as it has already distributed 14,000 MT of fertilizer.

        "content": "Indias parliament disqualified the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, on Friday, a day after a magistrates court jailed him for two years in a defamation case linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modis surname. Gandhi stands disqualified from the membership of Lok Sabha, a parliament notice said, referring to the lower house of parliament. Gandhi, 52, was found guilty for a 2019 speech in which he referred to thieves as having the surname Modi. He made the comment while campaigning ahead of the last general election. Gandhi was convicted by a court in the western state of Gujarat, which also granted him bail and suspended the sentence for one month. A close aide to Gandhi said the leader had already adhered to the court order and did not enter parliament on Friday during house proceedings. Leaders of the Congress party said they were gearing up to file an appeal in a higher court. This battle will be fought both legally and politically, said Pawan Khera, the national spokesperson of the party. Rahul Gandhi will not stop from asking difficult questions and exposing crony capitalism and this governments active role in promoting and protecting it, he said. Earlier in the day, Congress party members held protests in some parts of the country against Gandhis conviction and two-year-old jail sentence. Congress party officials have described the judgment as politically motivated and blamed the government of Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP is fearful about the rise of Rahul Gandhi and he poses a direct threat to the Modi government, said Pradip Bhattacharya, a Congress party lawmaker from West Bengal state. BJP president J.P. Nadda dismissed the charges, and said that Gandhi had insulted a section of Indians who happen to share the same surname as Prime Minister Modi. It is one thing to question government regarding the policies, that would be considered a healthy debate, but clearly the Congress has never followed such rules, he told Reuters.

The protesters claimed that notorious crime lord Nadun Chinthaka, alias Harak Kata, had murdered their relatives, and they, the families of the victims, are yet to receive justice from both the police and the courts. Thus, they protested that in such a background, it is unjustifiable for the PC, who also serves as the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), to represent him in court. Harak Kata was brought back to the island with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika, alias Kudu Salindu after defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka, on 08 March, of the arrest of eight suspects including Kudu Salindu, Harak Kata, a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father. They had been arrested in Madagascar on 01 March, in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The INTERPOL had previously issued Red Notices against Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata had posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others pretended to be his bodyguards. The extradition process was coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. The Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on 03 October 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, six robberies and transnational drug trafficking. He has reportedly smuggled in nearly 670kg of heroin to Sri Lanka via sea routes.",

The investor and creditor presentation will commence at 8.30 a.m. on March 30, chaired by Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and Finance Ministrys Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana. The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on March 20 green-lighted a 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. The EFF program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. After receiving the IMFs board approval, Sri Lanka immediately received an initial disbursement of USD 333 million (amounting to SDR 254 million) from the EFF arrangement. The first tranche of the IMF bailout package is expected to catalyze new external financing including from the ADB and the World Bank. The planned presentation will outline the EFF-supported programs objectives, as well as the next steps with regard to engagement with creditors, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies explained in a press release. The ministry reiterated that Sri Lanka is fully committed to successfully completing its IMF program, adding that the government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to ensure fiscal consolidation, boost tax revenues, rebuild its foreign reserves, improve economic governance, and strengthen the Central Banks independence. Sri Lanka will continue to engage with all its creditors in good faith with full transparency and looks forward to constructive discussions for a swift resolution of the public debt situation, the statement read further. Speaking in this regard, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said: The IMF Executive Board approval is an important milestone towards Sri Lankas debt sustainability and economic recovery, unlocking up to 7 billion in funding from the IMF and other IFIs. These funds will help address Sri Lankas macroeconomic challenges, reconstitute financial buffers, and restart the countrys economic growth engines. Moving onto the next phase, we remain committed to progressing engagement with all our creditors to achieve an efficient, transparent, and equitable implementation of the debt treatment required to restore debt sustainability. Meanwhile, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said: The IMF program is crucial to stabilise our economy and we are strongly committed to successfully complete the IMF program by implementing ambitious reforms. We can already see positive signs of recovery; the headline inflation rate has eased for five consecutive months and our foreign currency reserves have increased to 2.2 billion in February 2023. We are on the right path, but we still have a long way to go. I am confident that we will successfully complete the IMF program and restore Sri Lankas economy.",

        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has responded to the protest staged outside the residence of BASL President Saliya Pieris, PC this morning (24 March). The BASL deemed the protest staged against PC Saliya Pieiriss decision to represent infamous underworld figure Harak Kata a serious hindrance to his right to represent a client, a professional right which has been safeguarded by law. In an attempt to support their argument, the Bar Association cited the Supreme Court verdict of the landmark case Wjiesundara Mudiyanselage Naveen Nayantha Bandara Wijesundara v Siriwardena and others, and Section 41 of the Judicature Act (Rights of Representation). Thus, in a letter addressed to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), C. D. Wickramaratne, the BASL ordered the IGP to ensure the safety of PC Pieris, and that his duties as an Attorney-at-Law remain unhindered. Earlier today, a group of persons staged a protest before the residence of PC Pieriss residence against his decision to represent underworld kingpin Harak Kata. The protesters claimed that notorious crime lord Nadun Chinthaka, alias Harak Kata, had murdered their relatives, and they, the families of the victims, are yet to receive justice from both the police and the courts. Thus, they protested that in such a background, it is unjustifiable for the PC, who also serves as the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), to represent him in court.",

        "content": "Transgender women will no longer be allowed to compete in female track and field events regardless of their levels of testosterone, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe says. No female transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions from March 31, Coe said. Speaking after a meeting of the global track and field federations decision-making body on Thursday, Coe said World Athletics had consulted with stakeholders, including 40 national federations, the International Olympic Committee and trans groups about the issue of transgender athletes. The majority of those consulted stated that transgender athletes should not be competing in the female category, he said. Many believe there is insufficient evidence that transwomen do not retain advantage over biological women and want more evidence that any physical advantages have been ameliorated before they are willing to consider an option for inclusion into the female category. He added: The judgement we took  was, I believe, in the best interests of our sport. Not saying no forever Coe said a working group headed by a transgender person would be created to further monitor scientific developments. Were not saying no forever, Coe said. We continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations, he said. We will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage, which will inevitably develop over the coming years. As more evidence becomes available, we will review our position, but we believe the integrity of the female category in athletics is paramount. World Athletics said it became apparent that there is little support within the sport for an option that was presented to stakeholders that required transgender athletes to maintain their testosterone levels below 2.5 nanomoles per litre of blood for 24 months to be eligible to compete internationally in the female category.

Presenting his argument in court, Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne highlighted that through the Bill in question, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will be allowed to implement its monetary policy more independently, improving its accountability and also permitting the CBSL Governor to act on his own accord, without being influenced by any external parties. The petitioners countered, however, that the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill would allow for the Central Bank to deviate from the powers of the Executive, thereby posing an issue. The Additional Solicitor General argued, however, that this was not the case, and even under the proposed Bill, the CBSL will still be answerable to the Parliament. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered both parties to file their written submissions, if any, by Monday (27 March). CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe was also present at todays hearings, for which the court expressed its gratitude.

The meeting took place in New Delhi, and centered on a range of matters pertaining to the collaboration and partnership between the two countries in the transport sector. High Commissioner Moragoda requested the assistance of Minister Gadkari in sharing Indias experience in public-private partnerships in the highways sector with Sri Lanka, and proposed to set up a platform through which this experience could be shared with the relevant stakeholders in Sri Lanka. Moragoda also suggested that Indian investors be encouraged to look at investment opportunities in Sri Lankas infrastructure sector. Minister Gadkari expressed his support to these proposals, explaining that as India aims to become a developed economy by 2047, its government has focused on boosting infrastructure, including highways and road networks. Indias spending on infrastructure has increased significantly over the last decade, and is expected to hit a record Rs. 10 trillion for the next financial year. Meanwhile, cooperation in the electric mobility sector was also discussed, exploring the possibility of India sharing its experience, expertise and best practices of the electrical vehicle industry with Sri Lanka.

Climate change is going to play a major role in our future. if we do not pay attention to it, if you dont make a conscious effort to come out of it. Economic development or resurgence is going to be temporary. Its going to be very difficult. Its not going to be sustainable. Theres not going to be anything for the future generations. So it is very important. Climate change also means economic support. There are a lot of people out there in the world who are very committed to climate change and they encourage it and they supported financially.

        "date": "March 25, 2023 11:06 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is keen to expand ties with the Yunnan province in China which shares many similarities with Sri Lanka, especially in the areas of trade, economy, and tourism, says State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya. He made this remark in his address at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce  Industry of Sri Lanka on Thursday (March 23) to mark the arrival of a delegation from the Yunnan province. Addressing the gathering on strengthening economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and China, especially with the Yunnan province, the lawmaker traced Sri Lankas ties to the Yunnan Province to the 15th Century AD when Admiral Zheng He, who was born in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, visited Sri Lanka as part of his voyages to South Asia and the Middle East. He also stated that there was a plaque with an inscription recording Admiral Zheng Hes voyage to Galle in the 15th century AD at the Galle Fort. Speaking further, State Minister Balasuriya observed that Sri Lankas commercial ties with China were important, and that China was the 8th largest export market for Sri Lanka. He stated that in 2022 Sri Lankas exports to China amounted to USD 253.11 million, with tea in bulk, activated carbon, apparel items, coco-peat and fibre pith becoming the dominant export items while China was Sri Lankas number one import destination with total imports from China amounting to USD 3,523 million in 2022 and called for an increase in Sri Lankas exports to Yunnan. The State Minister referred to the enthusiasm of Sri Lankan exporters representing the various sectors of gem and jewellery, handicrafts, FMCG, organic products, and the leisure sector to attend the Kunming International Expo in Yunnan province. He further stated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lankas Export Development Board had organized Sri Lankas participation in virtual mode with the participation of over 50 exporters with the assistance of the Yunnan province representatives. Balasuriya recalled the recent visit to Sri Lanka by two groups of tourists from China and invited tourists from the Yunnan province to visit Sri Lanka as the geographical distance between Beijing, the capital of China and the Yunnan Province was approximately the same as the distance between Yunnan Province and Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "March 25, 2023 11:46 am",
        "content": "A long-awaited loan agreement between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be signed once a few remaining points, including a proposed fuel pricing scheme, are settled, an IMF official said on Friday. Pakistan and the IMF have been negotiating since early February on an agreement that would release USD 1.1 billion to the cash-strapped, nuclear-armed country of 220 million people. The latest issue is a plan, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week, to charge affluent consumers more for fuel, with the money raised used to subsidise prices for the poor, who have been hit hard by inflation. In February it was running at its highest in 50 years. The plan involves a difference of around 100 rupees (35 U.S. cents) a litre between the prices paid by the rich and poor, according to the petroleum ministry. Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik told Reuters on Friday that his ministry was working out details. It was not a subsidy but a relief programme, he said. People with larger cars will pay more than people with smaller cars. Smaller cars are more fuel efficient, so people will move towards more fuel-efficient cars, Malik said. IMF NEEDS EXPLANATION But the IMFs resident representative in Pakistan, Esther Perez Ruiz, said the government had not consulted the fund about the scheme. Ruiz, in a message to Reuters, confirmed a media report that a staff-level agreement would be signed once a few remaining points, including the fuel scheme, were settled. She has said that the IMF would ask the government for more details, including how it would be implemented and what protections would be put in place to prevent abuse. The minister said the scheme wouldnt cost the government anything extra. We can explain all this to the IMF when they ask, he said, adding that the lender was in touch with the finance ministry not his. The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. With USD 4.6 billion in foreign exchange reserves held by Pakistans central bank in the week ending March 17, enough to cover only about four weeks of necessary imports, Pakistan is desperate for the IMF agreement to disperse a USD 1.1 billion tranche from a USD 6.5 billion bailout agreed in 2019. Islamabad has implemented several measures, including devaluing the rupee, lifting subsidies and raising energy prices, as preconditions for the agreement, which the finance minister said this month was very close.

The findings contain the committees main concerns and recommendations on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as positive aspects. The committee went on to denounce the extensive use of prolonged pre-trial detention, inconsistent bail provisions and ineffective access to non-custodian alternatives in Sri Lanka. It also called for prompt and effective investigations of allegations of arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as the respect of fundamental legal safeguards for detainees. The human rights body further expressed concern about the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) which allows for extended pre-trial detention for up to 12 months, contains a broad definition of terrorism and is used to target minorities, particularly Muslims and Tamils, government critics and LGBT people and to extract confessions through torture. It recommended that Sri Lanka repeal the Act and adopt new legislation compatible with the Covenant, as well as the principles of legal certainty, predictability and proportionality while ensuring that the legislative process of the new law is inclusive and transparent. The Human Rights Committee is the UN body of independent experts that monitors State compliance with and enforces the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs, Roshan Ranasinghe, to establish an expert committee to assess the development of Sri Lankas sports sector and its future strategies. In addition, the President instructed that the committee should comprise ministers in charge of sports and education, industry experts, as well as representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties in parliament. President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, gave these instructions during his visit to the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex this morning (25 March) as part of his observation tour. Additionally, the President highlighted that consistent implementation of this program each year can yield a cohort of athletes in Sri Lanka capable of achieving international success within a few years. The President emphasized the significance of identifying childrens sporting talents between the ages of 10-12 years and providing them with appropriate opportunities for growth and development. He also recommended that 100 schools across the island, headed by the leading schools in Colombo, should take steps to promote baseball within the year and aim to establish Sri Lanka as a prominent country for baseball in Asia. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also emphasized the significance of offering retirement options to athletes who have represented the country in various sports events and enabling them to obtain a degree, recognizing it as a fundamental qualification. This morning, the President visited the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Diyagama, inspecting the main sports track, baseball field, and training track. He engaged with the athletes training there and engaged in friendly conversation with them and inquiring about their well-being. During the inspection, it was noted that several facilities, such as the swimming pool, cricket ground, and sports training tracks, were inadequate for effective training of athletes. Consequently, the President compiled a list of priorities and instructed officials to take measures to enhance the infrastructure. He also suggested the potential for private sector support in achieving these goals. According to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Government has set aside sufficient funds to refurbish the Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex in Diyagama. He urged officials to refrain from submitting misleading reports and identifying unnecessary expenditures. Furthermore, he noted that the government cannot allocate additional funds for this project presently. The President stressed that the Ministry of Sports had neglected to maintain the stadium adequately in the past and highlighted the governments accountability for every penny spent. The President proposed that the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Diyagama be transformed into a comprehensive sports complex where female athletes from schools across the island can participate in sporting activities. He also suggested that in the future, it should function as a sports university where athletes can complete a degree in sports. The Director General of Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa International Sports Complex, Major General Lal Chandrasiri, provided an overview of the current state of the sports complex and its requirements. Minister of Irrigation, Sports and Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe, Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena, Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Member of Parliament Premanath C.

        "content": "A Sri Lanka national based in the United Kingdom was apprehended at Rameshwaram of Tamil Nadu in India, while he was trying to return to his homeland on a mystery vessel, the Indian Coast Guard said on Saturday. The man was handed over to the Lankan authorities while his boat was impounded, the Indian Coast Guard informed further. According to further details shared by the Indian Coast Guard, the UK-based Lanka national, identified as 39-year-old Jagan Fernando Manokaran, was handed over to the Coastal Security Group police of Sri Lanka for due legal process. Four other persons -- identified as Arogya Jagadish (36) and Anandhapalan (40) from Marutubandyar Nagar, Rameswaram; and Arthanas (38) and Sachin (24) from Tsunami Nagar Colony next to Natarajapuram -- were also arrested in this connection. According to sources, Manokaran left his homeland as a refugee and had been living in London on a permanent visa on the condition that he will not return to Sri Lanka. Since Manokaran could not directly go to Sri Lanka, he came to India and planned to visit Sri Lanka illegally by boat, sources said, adding that he contacted several boat agents in Rameswaram. Jagan, who arrived in Rameswaram on Friday, was taken by the agents in a boat and dropped at the third sandbar in the Adams bridge area between Dhanushkodi and Thalaimannar. Jagan was standing alone on the third sandbar in the middle of the sea, as the boat that was supposed to take him did not come from Sri Lanka. Following information from the Q Branch police, the Air Cushion Ship (H-195) of the Indian Coast Guard left for the spot with personnel of its Eastern Seaboard Command. He was handed over to the Mandapam Coastal security Group police for legal action. After a joint probe by Central and state intelligence agencies, Q Branch police and local police, the four boat agents, who arranged for Jagans travel from London to Rameswaram, were arrested and questioned.

        "title": "23 dead, dozens injured after tornadoes in Mississippi",
        "date": "March 26, 2023 10:05 am",
        "content": "A powerful tornado cut a devastating path through Mississippi Friday night, killing more than two dozen people and obliterating dozens of buildings, as it stayed on the ground for more than an hour. The tornado flattened entire blocks of the small Mississippi Delta town of Rolling Fork, reducing homes to piles of rubble, flipping cars on their sides and toppling the water tower. Residents hunkered down in bathtubs and broke into a John Deere store that they converted into a triage center for the wounded. On Saturday, the National Weather Service said the Rolling ForkSilver City, Mississippi, tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency announced late Saturday afternoon in a tweet that the death toll had risen to 26 from 23. Four who were missing have been found but dozens also were injured. Meanwhile, other parts of the Deep South were digging out from damage caused by other suspected twisters. One man also died in Morgan County, Alabama, the sheriffs department there said in a tweet. Theres nothing left, said Wonder Bolden, holding her granddaughter, Journey, while standing outside the remnants of her mothers now-leveled mobile home in Rolling Fork. Theres just the breeze thats running, going through -- just nothing. Throughout Saturday, she and others walked around dazed and in shock as they broke through debris and fallen trees with chain saws, searching for survivors. Power lines were pinned under decades-old oaks, their roots torn from the ground. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a State of Emergency and vowed to help rebuild as he headed to view the damage in an area speckled with wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields and catfish farming ponds. President Joe Biden also promised federal help, describing the damage as heartbreaking. The damage in Rolling Fork was so widespread that several storm chasers  who follow severe weather and often put up livestreams showing dramatic funnel clouds  pleaded for search and rescue help. Others abandoned the chase to drive injured people to the hospital. But it didnt help that the community hospital on the west side of town was damaged, forcing patients to be transferred. Sheddrick Bell, his partner and two daughters crouched in a closet of their Rolling Fork home for 15 minutes as the tornado barreled through. His daughters wouldnt stop crying. He could hear his partner praying out loud beside him. I was just thinking, If I can still open my eyes and move around, Im good, he said. Rodney Porter, who lives about 20 miles south of Rolling Fork and belongs to a local fire department, said he didnt know how anyone survived as he delivered water and fuel to families there. Its like a bomb went off, he said, describing houses stacked on top of houses. Crews even cut gas lines to the town to keep residents and first responders safe. The warning the National Weather Service issued as the storm hit didnt mince words: To protect your life, TAKE COVER NOW! Preliminary information based on estimates from storm reports and radar data indicate that it was on the ground for more than an hour and traversed at least 170 miles (274 kilometers), said Lance Perrilloux, a meteorologist with the weather services Jackson, Mississippi, office. Thats rare  very, very rare, he said, attributing the long path to widespread atmospheric instability. All the ingredients were there. Perrilloux said preliminary findings are that the tornado began its path of destruction just southwest of Rolling Fork before continuing northeast toward the rural communities of Midnight and Silver City before moving toward Tchula, Black Hawk and Winona. The supercell that produced the deadly twister also appeared to produce tornadoes that caused damage in northwest and north-central Alabama, said Brian Squitieri, a severe storms forecaster with Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. In northern Alabamas Morgan County, a 67-year-old man who became trapped beneath a trailer that flipped over during severe overnight storms was rescued by first responders, but he died later at a hospital, AL.com reported. Even as survey teams work to assess how many tornadoes struck and their severity, the Storm Prediction Center is warning of the potential for hail, wind and possibly a few tornadoes Sunday in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Cornel Knight told The Associated Press that he, his wife and their 3-year-old daughter were at a relatives home in Rolling Fork when the tornado struck. He said the sky was dark but you could see the direction from every transformer that blew. He said the tornado struck another relatives home across a wide cornfield from where he was. A wall in that home collapsed and trapped several people inside. Royce Steed, the emergency manager in Humphreys County where Silver City is located, likened the damage to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It is almost complete devastation, he said after crews finished searching buildings and switched to damage assessments. This little old town, I dont know what the population is, it is more or less wiped off the map. In the town, the roof had torn off Noel Crooks home, where he lives there with his wife. Yesterday was yesterday and thats gone  theres nothing I can do about it, Crook said. Tomorrow is not here yet. You dont have any control over it, so here I am today. The tornado looked so powerful on radar as it neared the town of Amory, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Tupelo, that one Mississippi meteorologist paused to say a prayer after new radar information came in. Oh man, WTVAs Matt Laubhan said on the live broadcast. Dear Jesus, please help them. Amen. Now that town is boiling its water, a curfew in effect. More than a half-dozen shelters were opened in the state to house the displaced. Its a priceless feeling to see the gratitude on peoples faces to know theyre getting a hot meal, said William Trueblood, emergency disaster services director for the Salvation Armys Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi Division, as he headed to the area, picking up supplies along the way. He said theyre hearing at least 19,000 homes were impacted by the severe weather. Still, there were signs of improvement. Power outages, which at one point were affecting more than 75,000 customers in Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, had been cut by a third by midafternoon Saturday, according to poweroutage.us. Meteorologists saw a big tornado risk coming for the general region as much as a week in advance, said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Walker Ashley. Tornado experts like Ashley have been warning about increased risk exposure in the region because of people building more. You mix a particularly socioeconomically vulnerable landscape with a fast-moving, long-track nocturnal tornado, and, disaster will happen, Ashley said in an email.

        "date": "March 26, 2023 11:37 am",
        "content": "Gordon E Moore, the co-founder of American multinational corporation and technology company, Intel Corporation died on Saturday at his home in Hawaii, New York Times reported. Intel and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation both acknowledged his passing, however, they didnt give details of his demise. Moores foresight concerning the exponential growth of computer chip technology in the 1960s set the stage for the high-tech era. The California semiconductor chip maker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, attained vast industrial domination formerly held by the enormous American railroad or steel industries of bygone eras, according to the report of the New York Times. Moore always called himself an accidental entrepreneur as he always wanted to be a teacher but could not become one. Due to his original USD 500 investment in the budding microchip industry, which helped make electronics one of the largest industries in the world, he became a billionaire. In addition, he is credited with making laptop computers accessible to hundreds of millions of people and with putting microprocessors inside of everything from toaster ovens, bathroom scales, and toy fire trucks to telephones, automobiles, and aircraft, New York Times reported. Moore, along with his wife Betty Moore contributed immensely to philanthropy. The duo founded the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in 2001 and donated 175 million Intel shares in the process. They made the greatest single gift to a university at the time in 2001, giving USD 600 million to the California Institute of Technology. Moore and his longtime colleague Robert Noyce founded Intel in July 1968. Prior to taking office as president in 1975, Moore was executive vice president. Moore was appointed board chairman and CEO in 1979, positions he maintained until 1987 when he resigned from the CEO role but retained the chairmanship, the Intel newsroom informed. Significantly, by the 1990s, Intel had microprocessors in 80 per cent of the computers produced globally, making it the most prosperous semiconductor business in history. Source - ANI -Agencies",

For example, for the month of March, government employees salaries, pensions, allowances and other day-to-day maintenance expenses have been estimated at Rs. 196 billion. The expected total revenue is only Rs. 173 billion. Then it lacks Rs. 23 billion to sustain for March, he added. Meanwhile, more than Rs. 500 billion worth of multi-party debt needs to be paid, the minister emphasized, adding that they will be short of around Rs. 500 billion to pay salaries for the months of March and April. The treasury has mentioned that it will use a part of the first tranche received from the IMF to pay these two salaries, the minister claimed.",

        "title": "At least 19 African migrants killed in latest boat disaster off Tunisia",
        "date": "March 26, 2023 04:22 pm",
        "content": "At least 19 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa died when their boat sank off Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy, a human rights group said on Sunday, the latest migrant boat disaster off Tunisia. In the last four days, five migrant boats have sunk off the southern city of Sfax, leaving 67 missing and nine dead, after a significant increase in boats heading towards Italy. The Tunisian coast guard rescued five people from the boat off the coast of Mahdia after a journey that started from Sfax beaches, Romadan ben Omar, an official at the Forum for Social and Economic Rights (FTDES) told Reuters. Tunisian authorities were not immediately available for comment. The coast guard said it had stopped about 80 boats heading for Italy in the past four days and detained more than 3,000 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan African countries. The coast near Sfax has become a major departure point for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East in the hope of a better life in Europe. The latest disaster comes in the midst of a campaign of arrests by the Tunisian authorities of undocumented sub-Saharan Africans. According to U.N. data, at least 12,000 migrants who reached Italy this year set sail from Tunisia, compared with 1,300 in the same period of 2022. Previously, Libya was the main departure point for migrants. According to FTDES statistics, Tunisias coast guard prevented more than 14,000 migrants setting off in boats during the first three months of this year, compared with 2,900 during the same period last year. The Italian coast guard said on Thursday it had rescued about 750 migrants in two operations off the southern Italian coast. Europe risks seeing a huge wave of migrants arriving on its shores from North Africa if financial stability in Tunisia is not safeguarded, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday. Meloni called on the IMF and some countries to help Tunisia quickly to avoid its collapse. Source - Reuters -Agencies",
