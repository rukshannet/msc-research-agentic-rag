        "title": "Indias Modi meets Zelensky on historic Ukraine visit, pushes for end to war",
        "date": "August 23, 2024 04:51 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Ukraines leader Volodymyr Zelensky on a historic visit to Kyiv on Friday, where he is pushing for a solution to end more than two years of war with Russia. Modi embraced Zelensky  who looked visibly emotional  at the Mariinsky palace in Kyiv, in the first ever visit by an Indian premier to Ukraine. The Indian leader is casting himself as a possible peacemaker between Moscow and Kyiv. But his visit comes at a dramatic moment in the two-and-a-half year war, with a diplomatic settlement appearing more elusive than ever. Kyivs forces are mounting a major incursion into Russias Kursk region while Moscows army is advancing in eastern Ukraine, claiming to have seized a swathe of towns and villages in recent weeks. No problem can be resolved on a battlefield, Modi said in Poland on Wednesday before heading to Ukraine. India, he said, supports dialogue and diplomacy for restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible. But it is unclear if Modi could be an effective deal maker. The 73-year-old has good relations with Russia, and met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month. He was criticised for hugging Putin during that visit, hours after a Russian strike on a Kyiv childrens hospital. At the time, Zelensky called it a devastating blow to peace efforts. The Ukrainian leader on Friday said he and Modi had together honoured the memory of children whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. Children of every country deserve to be safe. We must make it possible, Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. During his visit to Moscow last month, Modi had told Putin that war cannot solve problems and that seeing innocent children murdered  is pain that is unbearable. Ahead of his arrival in Kyiv, Modi said he planned to share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict with Zelensky. While India has historically warm ties with Russia, it also courts closer security partnerships with Western nations as a bulwark against its regional rival China. New Delhi has avoided explicit condemnation of Russias 2022 invasion and has abstained on UN resolutions that criticise the Kremlin, instead urging both sides to resolve their differences through direct dialogue. Moscow also remains a key supplier of oil and weapons to India. But Russias Ukraine invasion has also had a human cost for India, with several reports of Indian citizens being killed fighting for Russia. In February, New Delhi said it was pushing the Kremlin to send back some of its citizens. In the first year of the invasion in 2022, Putin publicly acknowledged that Modi had concerns over Moscows actions in Ukraine. Western powers have in recent years pressured New Delhi to distance itself from Russia. Ukraine has said that one of its aims of launching the surprise Kursk incursion on August 6 was to force Moscow into fair negotiations. While there was no sign of any serious talks to end the war before then, Russia has said the counteroffensive now makes them impossible. Putin earlier this year said Kyiv would have to abandon territory in four of its regions which Moscow claims to have annexed as a precondition to opening talks  a hardline demand that drew scorn in Kyiv and the West. Zelensky has also ruled out direct negotiations with Putin. Even as Moscow scrambles to fight off the Ukrainian attack into its Western Kursk region, its forces are still advancing in the eastern Donetsk region, capturing several towns and villages in recent days. Kyiv has ordered some evacuations from Pokrovsk  a key strategic and logistics hub in the region  amid fears it could fall to Russia. As Modi arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine said a Russian strike killed two people in the north-eastern Sumy region and that two other people were pulled out of rubble caused by another strike on the Kharkiv region, further south, a day earlier. The United Nations has verified more than 10,000 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022, but says the true figure is likely much higher. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "No decision made to cancel un-updated driving licenses  Transport Ministry",
        "date": "August 23, 2024 06:56 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Highways, Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe, clarified that reports claiming a decision has been made to cancel all un-updated driving licenses are entirely false and that no such decision has been taken. He also revealed that a new system will be introduced to update the information of nearly 02 million driving license holders who have not yet updated their licenses. The entire update processes are expected to be completed by the end of this year. Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Highways, Ranjith Rubasinghe, shared these remarks during a press conference held today (23) at the Presidential Media Centre, under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Rubasinghe also noted that since the issuance of the first driving license in Sri Lanka in the 1960s, approximately 12.3 million driving licenses have been issued. The Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Highways further explained: The first driving license in Sri Lanka was issued in the 1960s. Since then, approximately 12.3 million licenses have been issued. Licenses from the 1960s do not have an expiry date, allowing them to be used indefinitely without renewal. As a result, the information for about 02 million license holders remains out-dated. The digitization of all transport sector services is currently underway. Procurement for the digitization of black marks and on-the-spot fines is nearing completion. Starting January 1, 2025, fines and on-the-spot penalties will be managed through this new system, which will require updated information for all driving licenses. We will soon implement a new method to update the information of nearly 02 million driving license holders who have not yet updated their details. This process will not require new medical records or a visit to the Department of Motor Traffic. We aim to complete this update for all license holders by the end of this year. It is important to note that no new driving licenses will be issued, nor will existing licenses be cancelled. Reports suggesting otherwise are entirely false. Additionally, we plan to introduce the e-Driving License within the first six months of 2025. Recently, due to a shortage of cards, we issued temporary driving licenses to approximately 800,000 individuals. To date, only 91,000 of these have received their cards. We anticipate issuing the remaining cards within the next two months. Since last year, about 200,000 new driving licenses have been issued, and all of these will be processed before the end of this year. Normal card issuance for new licenses will resume as usual next year. In the meanwhile, the issuance of train tickets online has been effective since yesterday (22). Passengers can now purchase digital train tickets through the website www.pravesha.lk eliminating the need to wait in queue. Tickets will still be available at counters for those who prefer to purchase them in person. We plan to introduce this online system for season tickets before the end of this year. Additionally, new methods for train seat reservations and goods transportation will be rolled out over the next three months. Commissioner General of the Department of Motor Traffic, Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasinghe also attended this event. --PMD",

        "date": "August 24, 2024 08:50 am",
        "content": "An attacker with a knife killed three people and seriously wounded at least five late Friday at a festival in the western German city of Solingen, authorities said. Witnesses alerted police shortly after 9:30 p.m. to an unknown attacker having wounded several people indiscriminately with a knife on a central square, the Fronhof. Police said the perpetrator was on the run, and they had only very little information on the man so far. They said they believe the stabbings were carried out by a lone attacker. One of the festival organizers, Philipp Müller, appeared on stage and asked festivalgoers to go calmly; please keep your eyes open, because unfortunately the perpetrator hasnt been caught. He said many people had been wounded by a knifeman. At least one helicopter was seen in the air, while many police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights were on the road and several streets were closed off. Police put the number of seriously injured at five. The regions top security official, Herbert Reul, gave a figure of six as he visited the scene in the early hours of Saturday. None of us knows why the attack took place, said Reul, who is the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state. I cant say anything about the motive now and it isnt clear who the assailant was, he said, but the attacker left the scene relatively quickly. Mayor Tim Kurzbach said in a Facebook post, This evening, we in Solingen are all in shock. We all wanted to celebrate our citys anniversary together and now have dead and wounded to lament. It breaks my heart that an attack on our city happened, he added. Local newspaper Solinger Tageblatt quoted Celine Derikartz, its reporter covering the festival, as saying that the atmosphere is spooky. She said a party atmosphere had turned to shock within minutes and she saw festivalgoers weeping. The Festival of Diversity, marking the citys 650th anniversary, began Friday and was supposed to run through Sunday, with several stages in central streets offering attractions such as live music, cabaret and acrobatics. The city canceled the rest of the festival after the attack. Solingen has about 160,000 residents and is located near the bigger cities of Cologne and Duesseldorf. There has been concern about an increase in knife violence in Germany recently. In May, a knife attack by an Afghan immigrant on members of a group that describes itself as opposing political Islam left a police officer dead. Germanys top security official, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, proposed toughening weapons laws to allow only knives with a blade measuring up to 6 centimeters (nearly 2.4 inches) to be carried in public, rather than the length of 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) that is allowed now.

        "content": "The Deputy Minister of Education and Training of Vietnam Prof. Nguyen Van Phuc, along with the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Vietnam, Dr. A. Saj U. Mendis has signed the Education Cooperation Agreement between the two countries for the period of 2024 to 2026. The Agreement was initially signed in 1999 and was periodically extended as it served as a predominant framework focused on advancement of collaboration in the sphere of education and training, mostly for Sri Lankan students, researchers and academics, amongst others. The Agreement was inked at the Ministry of Education and Training in Hanoi, Vietnam, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Vietnam said in a statement. The Agreement is all-encompassing since it facilitates exchange of information relating to the development and innovation, cooperation between universities and academic institutions between the two countries, exchanges of academics, collaborative research and scholarships for students on long-term basis. During the signing ceremony at the Ministry of Education, Minister Nguyen Van Phuc emphasized the seminal and pivotal role education plays in socio-economic development in any given country, be it a developing country or an advanced country, it added. The Minister accentuated the significance Vietnam places on education since it has contributed to the meteoric economic transformation and rise of Vietnam during the last two decades. He further added that today Vietnam attracts and woos FDIs in excess of USD 30 billion and exports over USD 360 billion in a given year, primarily due to the highly competitive, competent, and adaptable human resource base of the country, the statement highlighted. Dr. Mendis, during his opening remarks, placed on record that the economic and commercial transmogrification of Vietnam was, fundamentally, attained within a relatively short period of time, which few countries could match. Ambassador Mendis further enunciated that the GDP per capita in 1990 was only USD 90 and today it has risen 50 folds to reach a GDP per capita of USD 4,500. He also added that he was much impressed of the proficiency of English language, mostly, of the younger generation, which in turn, would be a positive attribute for the future of Vietnam. Dr. Mendis, whilst expressing deep appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended by Vietnam to Sri Lanka over the years, stated that over 2,500 years ago the sagacious philosopher, Confucius, encapsulated the intrinsic value of education as Education breeds confidence, confidence breeds hope and hope breeds peace. The delegation of Sri Lanka consisted of Minister Counsellor, Kethma Rajapaksa Yapa and officials of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Hanoi whilst the delegation of Vietnam consisted of Director General, Nguyen Thi Thanh Minh, and senior most officials from the Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam.",

        "content": "Indian Navys frontline warship INS Mumbai will arrive in Colombo on 26 August 2024 on a three-day visit, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said in a statement. The ship is set to be received in a ceremonial manner by the Sri Lanka Navy. INS Mumbai is the third of the Delhi class destroyers, indigenously built and commissioned into the Indian Navy on 22 January 2001. The Ship was built at Mazagon Dock Limited in her namesake city Mumbai, according to the Indian High Commission. The ship completed its mid-life upgrade and joined Eastern Naval Command in Visakhapatnam on 08 December 2023. This is INS Mumbais first visit to any port in Sri Lanka and will be the eighth port call by Indian Ships this year. INS Kabra, Karanj, Kamorta and Shalki visited this year in addition to Indian Coast Guard ships Samarth, Abhinav and Sachet, it added. INS Mumbai will be bringing essential spares for the Dornier maritime patrol aircraft operated by Sri Lanka Airforce. The Dornier aircraft provides a unique and critical capability of surveillance over the Sea Area of Responsibility (AOR) of Sri Lanka since induction two years ago. This has also greatly enhanced the Search and Rescue capability in Sri Lankas vast EEZ. In addition to training the SLAF Pilots, Flight Navigators, Indian Navy is supporting the maintenance of this aircraft with a Technical team and spares. Indian Ship visited earlier this year, also brought in material assistance. INS Kabra and later ICGS Sachet had brought spares parts for Sri Lanka Coast Guard ship Suraksha, the statement highlighted. During the stay in Colombo, INS Mumbai will conduct familiarization tour onboard for Sri Lanka Navy personnel aimed at sharing best practices between both the Navies. It can be recalled that visit for Long specialization course student officers and Cadets of Naval and Maritime Academy, Trincomalee was organized onboard the submarine Shalki, during port call earlier this month, adding value to their training.

        "title": "German police arrest suspect in stabbing rampage",
        "date": "August 25, 2024 09:53 am",
        "content": "A man suspected of a stabbing rampage in the western German town of Solingen has been taken into police custody, a state official told German television on Saturday, some 24 hours after the attack that killed three people. North Rhine-Westphalias interior minister Herbert Reul told the ARD broadcaster that he was a bit relieved after authorities spent the day following a hot lead that lead to the arrest. The Islamic State group earlier claimed responsibility for Fridays knife attack that also wounded eight people. Police spent the day conducting a manhunt, making two arrests that were likely not the perpetrator, Reul said. The real suspect is the one that weve arrested just now, he said. The individual is being questioned and evidence was seized, he said. Reul said the man was affiliated with a home for refugees that had been searched earlier in the day. Police declined to immediately comment. Describing the man who carried out the attack as a soldier of the Islamic State, the militant group said in a statement on its Telegram account: He carried out the attack in revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere. It did not immediately provide any evidence for its assertion and it was not clear how close any relationship between the attacker and Islamic State was. Hendrik Wuest, premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, described Friday evenings attack during a festival in the city as an act of terror. This attack has struck at the heart of our country, Wuest told reporters. The attack took place in the Fronhof, a market square in the western German city where live bands were playing as part of a festival marking the its 650th anniversary. Markus Caspers, an official with the public prosecutors office in Duesseldorf, said authorities were treating the attack as a possible terrorist incident because there was no other known motive and the victims seemed unrelated. A police official, Thorsten Fleiss, said the assailant appeared to aim for his victims throats. The perpetrator must be quickly caught and punished to the fullest extent of the law, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a post on X. Police cordoned off the square on Saturday and passers-by placed candles and flowers outside the barriers. We are full of shock and grief, Solingen Mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach told journalists. A German musician who goes by the name Topic said he was playing on a nearby stage when the incident occurred. He was told about what had happened but was asked to keep playing to avoid causing a mass panic attack, he posted on Instagram. He was eventually told to stop, and since the attacker was still on the run, we hid in a nearby store while police helicopters circled above us, Topic wrote. Authorities cancelled the remainder of the weekend festival. Fatal stabbings and shootings are relatively rare in Germany. The government said earlier this month it wanted to toughen rules on knives that can be carried in public by reducing the maximum length allowed. In June, a 29-year-old policeman was fatally stabbed in Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration. A stabbing attack on a train in 2021 injured several people. Solingen, well known for its knife manufacturing industry, is a city of some 165,000 people. The episode comes ahead of three state elections next month in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg, in which the anti-immigrant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has a chance of winning. Though the motive and identity of the assailant were not known, a top AfD candidate for one of the state elections, Bjoern Hoecke, seized on Fridays attack, posting on X: Do you really want to get used to this? Free yourselves and end this insanity of forced multiculturalism. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "SpaceX to return Boeings Starliner astronauts from space next year",
        "date": "August 25, 2024 10:42 am",
        "content": "Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeings faulty Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA officials said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliners propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home as planned. Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But Starliners propulsion system suffered a series of glitches in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS that has so far kept the astronauts on the station for 79 days as Boeing scrambled to investigate the issues. NASA officials told reporters during a news conference in Houston that Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, are safe and prepared to stay even longer. They will use their extra time to conduct science experiments alongside the stations other seven astronauts, NASA said. In a rare reshuffling of NASAs astronaut operations, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragons four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams. The agencys decision, tapping Boeings top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASAs most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped its Starliner test mission would redeem the troubled program after years of development problems and over 1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016. Five of Starliners 28 thrusters failed during flight and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters. It was still able to dock with the station, a football field-sized laboratory that has housed rotating crews of astronauts for over two decades. NASA said in a statement Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew in early September. The spacecraft will attempt to return to Earth autonomously, forgoing a core test objective of having a crew present and in control for the return trip. I know this is not the decision we had hoped for, but we stand ready to carry out the actions necessary to support NASAs decision, Boeings Starliner chief Mark Nappi told employees in an email. The focus remains first and foremost on ensuring the safety of the crew and spacecraft, Nappi said. Several senior NASA officials and Boeing representatives made the decision during a Saturday morning meeting in Houston. NASAs space operations chief Ken Bowersox said agency officials unanimously voted for Crew Dragon to bring the astronauts home. Boeing voted for Starliner, which it said was safe. Nelson told reporters at a news conference in Houston that he discussed the agencys decision with Boeings new CEO Kelly Ortberg and was confident Boeing would continue its Starliner program. Nelson said he was 100 percent certain the spacecraft would fly another crew in the future. He expressed to me an intention that they will continue to work the problems once Starliner is back safely, Nelson said of Ortberg. Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second U.S. option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earths orbit. The company is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products. Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliners crew certification path is uncertain. The drawn-out mission has cost Boeing 125 million, securities filings show. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home. But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials concerns about Starliners thrusters and its ability to make a crewed return trip, the most daunting and complex part of the test mission. There was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters, NASAs commercial crew program chief Steve Stich told reporters. Starliners now-uncertain path to receiving a long-sought NASA certification will add to the crises faced by Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemakers reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.

Speaking at a public rally held in Divulapitiya to support the SLPPs presidential candidate, MP Fernando stated that during the Aragalaya protest movement, the activists demanded a leader who represents the youth and that the SLPP has now given them the opportunity to elect Namal Rajapaksa, who will become the countrys youngest leader. Commenting further, he said: Our candidate is not the same person who has been in the past. Over the years, Namal Rajapaksa has matured to become a more responsible person. Meanwhile, SLPP MP Thissa Kuttiarachchi, who spoke during the rally, mentioned that since certain people claim that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot govern the country as he is old, they nominated a 38-year-old as their presidential candidate. Now these people complain that he is too young for the role. Namal Rajapaksa is the only candidate and the leader who can recommence the development of the country initiated by his father, he assured. Addressing the rally, SLPP presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa reiterated that the SLPP prevented the country from collapsing in the aftermath of the Aragalaya protest movement in 2022, by letting Ranil Wickremesinghe take over the power. Many developed nations collapsed during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, we could have let the people die and taken measures to develop the country. Like some nations, we could have also taken the decision to refuse the import of COVID vaccines. However, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksas government decided not to let people die because of the pandemic, Rajapaksa stated. In this backdrop, a conspiracy was in place against the Buddhist political camp of the country, which ultimately led to the collapse of our government. We had to decide whether to let the country collapse or the government to collapse. What has happened in Bangladesh today? Their country has collapsed. Regardless of who comes into power, the Bangladesh state has already collapsed. We formed a government with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and did not let the country collapse, said Rajapaksa.",

        "content": "Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a 48-hour nationwide state of emergency from 06:00 am (0300 GMT) Sunday after the Israeli military launched what it called pre-emptive strikes in Lebanon. The declaration on the state of emergency enables the IDF (Israeli military) to issue instructions to the citizens of Israel, including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant, Gallant said, in a statement issued by his office. Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced on Sunday large-scale rocket and drone launches towards Israel in an initial response to a top commanders killing, after Israels military said it was carrying out a series of pre-emptive strikes against the group. In the context of the initial response to the killing of its commander Fuad Shukr last month, Hezbollah said it began an air attack with a large number of drones targeting deep into Israel, a statement from the group said. Fighters also targeted a number of enemy positions and barracks and Iron Dome platforms... with a large number of rockets, it said, adding that military operations will take some time to complete. The Middle East has been on edge for weeks after Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a senior commander of the group as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamass political leader, also blamed on Israel. In a message addressed to the residents of southern Lebanon early Sunday morning, the Israeli military said: We are monitoring Hezbollahs preparations to carry out large-scale attacks on Israeli territory near your homes. You are in danger. We are attacking and eliminating Hezbollah threats. Anyone who is near areas where Hezbollah operates should leave immediately to protect themselves and their families, the message posted on Telegram said. In a separate statement released shortly before 5:00 am (0100 GMT), the military said its jets were striking targets in Lebanon that posed an imminent threat to Israelis. Announcing the strikes in a video released at the same time, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that Hezbollah will soon fire rockets, and possibly missiles and UAVs, towards Israeli territory. From right next to the homes of Lebanese civilians in the south of Lebanon, we can see that Hezbollah is preparing to launch an extensive attack on Israel, while endangering the Lebanese civilians he added, urging civilians there to move out of harms way. Hezbollahs ongoing aggression risks dragging the people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, and the whole region into a wider escalation. Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would hold a security cabinet meeting at 0400 GMT, his office said. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel and Hezbollah trade heavy fire before pulling back, jolting a region braced for war",
        "date": "August 25, 2024 05:08 pm",
        "content": "Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon early Sunday in what it said was a preemptive strike on Hezbollah. The militant group responded that it had launched hundreds of rockets and drones to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders last month. The heavy exchange of fire does not appear to have ignited a long-feared war, but the situation remains tense. Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday is hosting high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which diplomats hope will tamp down regional tensions. The Israeli military said it struck because Hezbollah was planning to launch a heavy barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had launched an attack on Israeli military positions as an initial response to the killing of Fouad Shukur, one of its founding members, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month. By mid-morning, it appeared that the exchange had ended, with both sides saying they had only aimed at military targets. At least three people were killed in the strikes on Lebanon, while there were no reports of casualties in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at the start of a Cabinet meeting, said the military had eliminated thousands of rockets that were aimed at northern Israel and urged citizens to adhere to directives from the Home Front Command. We are determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us  we will harm them, he said. Air raid sirens and flight diversions Air raid sirens were reported throughout northern Israel, and Israels Ben-Gurion international airport closed and diverted flights for approximately an hour due to the threat of attack. Israels Home Front Command raised the alert level in northern Israel and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said Hezbollah had intended to hit targets in northern and central Israel. He said initial assessments found very little damage in Israel, but that the military remained on high alert. He said around 100 Israeli aircraft took part in Sundays strikes. Lebanons Health Ministry reported that two people were killed and another two wounded in the strikes in southern Lebanon. Separately, a fighter for the Amal group, which is allied with Hezbollah, was killed in a strike on a car, Amal said. Hezbollah said its attack involved more than 320 Katyusha rockets aimed at multiple sites in Israel and a large number of drones. It said the operation was targeting a qualitative Israeli military target that will be announced later as well as enemy sites and barracks and Iron Dome (missile defense) platforms. Hezbollah later announced the end of what it said was the first stage of retaliatory strikes, which it said would allow it to launch more attacks deeper into Israel. But a later statement said military operations for today have been completed. The group said all the exploding drones it launched hit their targets, without saying how many. It listed 11 bases, barracks and military positions that it said it targeted in northern Israel and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. It also dismissed Israels claim to have thwarted a stronger Hezbollah attack. Hezbollah did not provide evidence for its claims. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said Sunday mornings exchange was still within the rules of engagement and unlikely at this point to lead to an all out war. In the U.S., a spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean Savett, said President Joe Biden was closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon. At his direction, senior U.S. officials have been communicating continuously with their Israeli counterparts, Savett added. We will keep supporting Israels right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability. The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, about Israels defenses. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown, is on a visit to the region that is expected to take him to Israel, Egypt and Jordan. Rising fears of an all-out war In recent weeks, diplomats from the U.S. and European countries have made a flurry of visits to Israel and Lebanon in an attempt to tamp down the escalation that they fear could spiral into a regional war. Hezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the start of the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas Oct. 7 attack into Israel. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire almost daily, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. Until Sunday, both sides had been careful to avoid all-out war. Hezbollah, which fought Israel to a stalemate in the summer of 2006, is believed to be far more powerful than it was during that conflict. The United States and Israel estimate it has some 150,000 rockets and is capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel. The group has also developed drones capable of evading Israels defenses, as well as precision-guided munitions. Israel has one of the worlds best militaries and an extensive multi-tiered missile defense system, and it is backed by a U.S.-led coalition that helped it shoot down hundreds of missiles and drones fired from Iran earlier this year. The U.S. military has been building up its forces across the region in recent weeks. Israel has vowed a crushing response in the case of all-out war, one that would likely demolish critical civilian infrastructure, especially in south Beirut and southern Lebanon, where Hezbollahs main strongholds are located. A war would likely displace hundreds of thousands of people on both sides. Hezbollah is a close ally of Iran, which has also threatened to retaliate for the killing of a senior Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Tehran last month that was widely blamed on Israel, which has not said whether it was involved. Egypt hosts high-level Gaza talks The U.S. and other mediators see a cease-fire in Gaza as key to heading off a wider Mideast conflagration. Hezbollah has said it will halt its strikes on Israel if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and Hezbollah and Iran might delay or scale back any retaliatory strikes over Shukur and Haniyeh. Egypt is hosting high-level talks in Cairo on Sunday aimed at bridging the gaps in an evolving proposal for a truce and the release of scores of hostages held by Hamas. The talks were to be attended by CIA director William Burns, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypts chief intelligence official, Abbas Kamel, according to two Egyptian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. The head of Israels Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea, is also expected to attend, they said. Hamas sent a delegation to the Egyptian capital to be briefed by Egyptian and Qatari mediators but is not directly taking part in the negotiations. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 25, 2024 05:45 pm",
        "content": "A new report claims that the iPhone 16 Pro Max will be the most popular device from the lineup this year, as Apple has shifted its focus from the standard to the Pro models. Overall, both Pro models will beat the standard models in sales, despite their higher price tag and we have Apple Intelligence and the new sizes to thank for it. The iPhone 16 Pro Max will be Apples most popular model this year, but the Plus variant will sit at last According to a new report from The Elec, Apple is expecting higher shipments of the iPhone 16 Pro models compared to the standard variants, which will also come with a slew of new changes. Typically, the Pro models always do well against their budget counterparts, and this year could host the same results as well. As per the stats, Apple will produce a total of 90.1 million units of the iPhone 16 lineup, and needless to say, the Plus variant will sit at the lowest with only 5.8 million units. The standard 6.1-inch iPhone 16 will comprise 24.5 million units, and the smaller 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro will feature 26.5 million units out of the total production. This leaves us with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is speculated to take the most significant production chunk from Apple, with 33.2 million units produced. This means Apple is emphasizing the iPhone 16 Pro Maxs production, which will feature 37 percent of the total production. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Plus will only take 6 percent of the total share. Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be the most popular models in the entire lineup, with a 67 percent production ratio against the entire lineup. The ratio is slightly higher for the Pro models this year, as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro sat at 60 percent last year. The results are based on the companys production of tetraprism lenses for the Pro models. There is no doubt that the Pro models will feature all the latest additions that the company has to offer, including new Apple Intelligence features. The release of dedicated Apple Intelligence features could also impact Apples total iPhone 16 sales. However, these new additions will not be available at launch as the company has released iOS 18.1 to developers for testing, which will possibly be released in October, a few weeks after the launch. However, we have to consider that there are no radical design changes part of the iPhone 16 and the Pro lineup, which means that sales have generalized over the years. The company is working on an ultra-thin version of the iPhone 17, but it will be released next year with a higher price tag. It remains to be seen how the market will respond to the iPhone 16 lineup in terms of sales. Source: Wccftech --Agencies",

        "date": "August 25, 2024 07:07 pm",
        "content": "The UN mission in Afghanistan said on Sunday it was concerned about a morality law recently ratified by the Taliban authorities, criticising in particular restrictions on women. The Taliban authorities on Wednesday announced the codification of a law with 35 articles detailing wide-ranging behaviour and lifestyle restrictions based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law. The law sets out graduated punishments for non-compliance  from verbal warnings to threats, fines and detentions of varying lengths  imposed by the morality police under the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. It is a distressing vision for Afghanistans future, where moral inspectors have discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions, said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama). After decades of war and in the midst of a terrible humanitarian crisis, the Afghan people deserve much better than being threatened or jailed if they happen to be late for prayers, glance at a member of the opposite sex who is not a family member, or possess a photo of a loved one, Otunbayeva said. Many components of the law have already been informally in place since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, and it remained unclear if their formal codification would lead to stricter enforcement. Women have borne the brunt of restrictions the UN has labelled gender apartheid, which have pushed them from public life. Otunbayeva said the law extends the already intolerable restrictions on the rights of Afghan women and girls, with even the sound of a female voice outside the home apparently deemed a moral violation. The law says women must cover their faces and bodies if they leave the house, as well as ensure their voices are not heard. The UN also expressed concern over restrictions on religious and press freedoms in the law, which stipulates media must not publish content hostile to Shariah law and religion or that shows living beings. However, it said there were positive articles in the law, including those banning mistreatment of orphans and bacha bazi, or boy play, where older men force boys to dress up as girls and sexually exploit them.

        "content": "Minister and Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara invited the National Peoples Power (NPP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to a debate on their energy polices, the governments energy policy and allegations of corruption in the energy sector. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Wijesekara pointed out NPPs presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayakes recent statement that he will reduce the fuel prices by removing the Rs 50 per liter tax on fuel which was imposed in 2022, to recover the debt taken over by the Treasury. The Energy Minister, who highlighted that Dissanayake had said the debt has been recovered by now and the said tax could be removed, expressed his displeasure stating, Im not sure how they come up with these numbers and claims to mislead the public and the voters. Furthermore, Wijesekara wrote: The President had to take unpopular but correct decisions to stabilize the economy and the energy sector. Due to those decisions we have an uninterrupted supply of fuel in the country. The Treasury took over Rs. 1,200 billion (USD 3,400 million) worth of CPCs (Ceylon Petroleum Corporation) debt in 2022 and imposed a Rs. 25 per liter tax initially and increased it in 2023 to Rs. 50 per liter tax to recover the debt by 2029. At the beginning of 2025 the estimated debt remaining will be Rs. 656 Billion. It will take the CPC another 4 years to repay the entire debt that was transferred to the Treasury, Minister Wijesekara clarified. Additionally, the minister stated that he would like to know how AKD will reduce the Rs. 50 tax and bridge the gap of Rs. 656 billion remaining. Is he going to print money, obtain more loans to repay, increase other taxes or any other way?, the Minister questioned. I extend an invitation to NPP  SJB to debate on their energy polices, the governments energy policy and allegations of corruption in the energy sector, he added.",

This will allow the entire nation to assess the truthfulness of their public promises and statements, he said. The President also highlighted that altering the agreement with the IMF is not feasible. He emphasized that such changes could lead to another economic collapse, with Premadasa and Dissanayakes misleading promises of reduced prices and taxes potentially worsening the countrys situation. He stressed the need to prevent such deceptions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that while he wishes to reduce the prices of goods and lower taxes, such actions can only be achieved by strengthening the rupee and adhering to the agreements with the IMF. He also urged Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to immediately present any alternative solutions and seek their opinion during the discussion with the IMF. The President made these remarks during the Special Convention of the United National Party (UNP), held yesterday (25) at the Party Headquarters Sirikotha, Pitakotte. Recalling on D.S. Senanayake, the founder of the UNP, President Wickremesinghe said that he was dedicated to preserving Sri Lankan identity. President Wickremesinghe, following the example of Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayawardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa, stated that his inspiration from working with these legends is to prioritize the countrys welfare above all else. A large number of UNP members attended the special convention, expressing their support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe. They endorsed his candidacy as an independent for the upcoming Presidential Election on September 21, with the aim of advancing Sri Lanka toward development. The proposal to express the partys agreement was presented to the conference by UNP General Secretary, Palitha Range Bandara. The UNP National Organizer Sagala Ratnayaka confirmed the resolution; it was passed unanimously with all attendees raising their hands in agreement.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon. On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an M90 rocket at Tel Aviv. Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollahs backer Iran and Israels main ally the United States. With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian-backed groups barrage, a reprisal for the assassination of senior commander Fuad Shukr last month, had been completed as planned. However, the group would assess the impact of its strikes and if the result is not enough, then we retain the right to respond another time, he said. Israels foreign minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned: This is not the end of the story. Earlier, Netanyahu had said: We are determined to do everything we can to defend our country ... whoever harms us - we harm him. The two sides have exchanged messages that neither wants to escalate further, with the main gist being that the exchange was done, two diplomats told Reuters. Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youths and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response. Hezbollah had delayed its retaliation to give time for ceasefire talks, and had calibrated its attack to avoid triggering a full-scale war, a Hezbollah official said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the presence of two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Middle East, bolstering the U.S. military presence. Earlier, top U.S. General C.Q. Brown arrived in Israel for talks with military leaders. Meanwhile in Gaza, the Israeli offensive continued, with air strikes killing at least five Palestinians in Gaza City early on Monday, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa. There was no agreement in the Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Cairo, with neither Hamas nor Israel agreeing to several compromises presented by mediators, although a senior U.S. official, described the talks as constructive and said the process would continue in the coming days. DENSE BOMBARDMENT Israels air strikes started before Hezbollah began its barrage, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said these pre-emptive strikes had foiled a much larger Hezbollah barrage but Nasrallah said they had had little impact. Hezbollahs own rocket and drone strikes were focused on an intelligence base near Tel Aviv, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said all the drones targeting what he called a strategic location in central Israel were intercepted. A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the countrys south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October. Hezbollah said the strikes killed two of its fighters in al-Tiri. The Hezbollah-allied Shiite Muslim group Amal said a strike on Khiam killed one of its fighters. Israels military said a naval soldier was killed and two wounded. Lebanons caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, met cabinet ministers at a session of the national emergency committee. Flights to and from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv were suspended for around 90 minutes. Some flights to and from Beirut were also halted, stranding passengers. WARNING SIRENS In northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and explosions were heard in several areas as Israels Iron Dome aerial defence system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon. Israel should, as it did this morning, deliver a pre-emptive strike. But if Hezbollah continues, Israel should strike very hard to remove the threat from Hezbollah once and for all, said Yuval Peleg, 73, from Haifa. A resident of the southern Lebanese town of Zibqeen told Reuters he had awakened to the sound of planes and the loud explosions of rockets - even before the dawn prayer. It felt like the apocalypse. The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden was following events. We will keep supporting Israels right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability, National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply concerned by the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and called on both parties to immediately return to a cessation of hostilities, his spokesperson said. Egypt and Jordan also warned against escalation. The United States was not involved in Israels strikes on Sunday, but provided some intelligence about incoming Hezbollah attacks, a U.S. official said. Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south. That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollahs most senior military commanders. Shukrs death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisals against Israel by Iran.

        "date": "August 26, 2024 10:39 am",
        "content": "Humans and dogs have always been best friends. Dogs have the power to brighten our terrible days with their incessant tail wagging and rolling around on the floor begging for belly rubs. There is no doubt that they make for loyal companions and in this age of social media, an adorable video of a puppy is all you need to watch at the end of a long day. Dogs are said to be able to perceive emotions even though they may not be able to communicate with us through language. International Dog Day, observed across the world on August 26, is a special day to celebrate our canine friends and raise awareness about their needs. History International Dog Day was first celebrated in 2004 by animal welfare activist and pet lifestyle expert Colleen Paige. Ms Paige chose the date of August 26 in particular as it was on this date that the activists family adopted their first dog Sheltie from the local animal shelter. Ms Colleen was 10 when the family welcomed Sheltie into their fold. Significance The day was officially adopted in 2013 into the New York State Legislation. It aims to draw attention to the fact that dogs must be rescued from unsustainable living situations. In addition to promoting dog adoption, International Dog Day honours all indigenous and pedigree dog breeds. Emphasis is also laid on discouraging the purchase of dogs from unethical backyard breeders and puppy mills, focussing instead on adoption from rescue homes. The official website of the event said, Our mission is to help galvanize the public to recognize the number of dogs that need to be rescued each year and acknowledges family dogs and dogs that work selflessly each day to save lives, keep us safe and bring comfort. Dogs put their lives on the line every day - protecting our families and homes, for their law enforcement partner, for their blind companion, for the disabled, for our freedom and safety by detecting bombs and drugs and helping to locate and rescue victims of accidents and tragedy, it added.

        "date": "August 26, 2024 10:43 am",
        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watched as new suicide drones took off and destroyed test targets including a mock tank, and urged researchers to develop artificial intelligence for the unmanned vehicles, state media reported on Monday. Kim visited the Drone Institute of North Koreas Academy of Defence Sciences on Saturday and viewed a successful test of drones correctly identifying and destroying designated targets after flying along different preset routes, state news agency KCNA said. Kim called for the production of more suicide drones to be used in tactical infantry and special operation units, such as underwater suicide attack drones, as well as strategic reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones, KCNA said. Also known as loitering munitions, such weapons been widely used in the war in Ukraine as well as in the Middle East. Loitering munitions can typically be aloft and ready to strike before a specific target is located, then attack by crashing into the target with a built-in warhead. Photos released by state media showed at least four different types of drones, some of which were launched with the aid of small rocket engines before their propellers took over. When asked about visual similarities between some of the North Korean drones and Russias ZALA Lancet and the Iranian-designed Shahed, which is also used by Russia, South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff said more analysis is necessary. We understand that some gifts (drones) were given in an exchange between North Korea and Russia in the past... We need to analyse various measures to see if those have improved performance, a spokesperson for the JCS said in a briefing. Nuclear-armed North Korea has close ties to Russia and Iran and a history of military cooperation with both. Seouls Unification Ministry said it was the first time Pyongyang had unveiled suicide drones. Several North Korean drones crossed the border into the South in 2022 and even briefly entered a no-fly zone surrounding Seouls presidential office, before turning back. South Korea has said it will deploy laser weapons to shoot down North Korean drones this year, becoming the worlds first country to deploy and operate such weapons in the military, and some skyscrapers in Seoul host anti-aircraft guns on their roofs. South Korea and the U.S. kicked off annual summertime military exercises last week, including practising responses to North Korean drones. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Addressing a public rally held in Anuradhapura, Jayaweera said that all of the candidates have failed to present a plan to explain how they are going to repay the debt they have taken on. Speaking at the rally, the Saravajana Balaya Presidential Candidate said: we have presented a proper strategic plan. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we have explained when and how we are going to implement that. We have also mentioned how we are going to source the necessary funds for that. We would like to ask the people who borrowed huge amounts of money how they are going to repay them by 2028, he questioned. None of the three candidates have explained how they are going to source the income that is sufficient to repay these debts. Do they talk about what happens if people die in a famine? They do not. I invite all of them to debate our strategic plan, Jayaweera added. Furthermore, he mentioned that everyone talk about tackling corruption while engaging in corrupt practices. I saw the monthly income of the presidential candidates in their assets and liabilities statements. I was so sad to see that they are living a month on a salary ranging between Rs 100,000 and Rs 200,000, which means their standard of living is worse than yours, he said. The Saravajana Balaya Presidential Candidate also mentioned that none of the other presidential candidates have paid taxes on their income. No matter where they reside, all of them are thieves.

Addressing a media briefing, the Investment Promotion State Minister also said that the cannabis investment plan of the government has so far received 30 applications, which are currently at the committee stage. We have received 30 applications so far for the cannabis investment plan. They are being processed by a committee in which all Ayurvedic Department and Ministry of Investment Promotion officials are present. No one has come up to the growing stage yet, but land allocations are being done. In future, they will come to the stage of growing. 3BD extraction or oil extraction will be the minimum value addition. If they go beyond that, whatever the final product is, they can also produce that within the dedicated source, the State Minister added. In response to a question raised by a journalist, Amunugama mentioned that the cannabis projects will be located within Mirigama and Kandy. The State Minister, who also commented on the Kappalthurai Industrial Zone, stated that it will be connected to ports, railways and airways.

The killings occurred overnight in Musakhail, a district in Baluchistan province, senior police official Ayub Achakzai said. The attackers burned at least 10 vehicles before fleeing the scene.

The attack came hours after the outlawed Baluch Liberation Army separatist group warned people to stay away from the highways, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility. The separatists in Baluchistan have often killed workers and others from the countrys eastern Punjab region as part of a campaign to force them to leave the province, which for years has experienced a low-level insurgency. Most such previous killings have been blamed on the outlawed group and others demanding independence from the central government in Islamabad. Islamic militants also have a presence in the province.

        "date": "August 26, 2024 12:14 pm",
        "content": "As China seeks to race ahead in humanoid robot development, its supply chains showcased cheaper and innovative parts at the world robot conference in Beijing, but some executives warn the industry has yet to improve product reliability. Wisson Technology (Shenzhen), known for its flexible robotic manipulators, doesnt depend on motors and reducers - transmission devices commonly used in robotics - but instead uses 3D-printed plastics and relies on pneumatic artificial muscles to power its robots. This less expensive form of production allows it to price its flexible arms at about one-tenth that of traditional robotic arms, said Cao Wei, an investor in Wisson through venture capital firm Lanchi Ventures, in which he is a partner. Pliable technology will usher in robotic arms at a cost of around 10,000 yuan (1,404), Wisson said on its website. (Wissons) pliable arms could be used in humanoids, said Cao, adding that the company has already provided samples to overseas companies that make humanoid robots, without elaborating. Yi Gang, founder of Shanghai-based Ti5 Robot, a company specialising in integrated joints, highlighted some of the problems he sees in the robotics supply chain. The whole supply chain still needs to address issues with product reliability, said Yi, adding that due to defect rates his company can only make products in volumes of up to 1,000. Harmonic gear, which refers to machinery that plays a key role in motion-control, was a key issue, he said. Chinas robotics effort is backed by President Xi Jinpings policy of developing new productive forces in technology  a point made in brochures for last weeks event. Across China, the worlds largest market for industrial robots, the increasingly sophisticated technology is changing the face of traditional industries such as manufacturing, autos, agriculture, education as well as health and home services. Gao Jiyang, previously an executive director at Chinese autonomous driving start-up Momenta before founding Galaxea AI, a start-up focused on robot hardware and embodied AI, said the ramp-up in smart driving was leading to advances in robotics. Autonomous driving means AI-plus cars, which are also a type of robot, Gao said. As the conference wrapped up on Sunday, Premier Li Qiang said it was crucial to implement President Xis guidelines on the importance of the robot industry. The robot industry has broad prospects and huge market potential, Li said, according to Chinas official Xinhua news agency. Describing robots as an important yardstick for technical innovation and high-end manufacturing strength, Li called for efforts to maintain supply chain stability and progress on the international stage. It is necessary ... to promote the expansion and popularisation of robots in various fields such as industry, agriculture and service industry, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 26, 2024 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new right to disconnect law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives. The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours. Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work. Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day, said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology. Now, globally its the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday. Australians worked on average 281 hours of unpaid overtime in 2023, according to a survey, last year by the Australia Institute, which estimated the monetary value of the labour at A130 billion (88 billion). The changes add Australia to a group of roughly two dozen countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, which have similar laws. Pioneer France introduced the rules in 2017 and a year later fined pest control firm Rentokil Initial 60,000 euros (66,700) for requiring an employee to always have his phone on. Rachel Abdelnour, who works in advertising, said the changes would help her disconnect in an industry where clients often have different working hours. I think its actually really important that we have laws like this, she told Reuters. We spend so much of our time connected to our phones, connected to our emails all day, and I think that its really hard to switch off as it is. REFUSALS MUST BE REASONABLE To cater for emergencies and jobs with irregular hours, the rule still allows employers to contact their workers, who can only refuse to respond where it is reasonable to do so. Determining whether a refusal is reasonable will be up to Australias industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission (FWC), which must take into account an employees role, personal circumstances and how and why the contact was made. It has the power to issue a cease and desist order and, failing that, levy fines of up A19,000 for an employee or up to A94,000 for a company. But the Australian Industry Group, an employer group, says ambiguity about how the rule applies will create confusion for bosses and workers. Jobs will become less flexible and in doing so slow the economy, it added. The laws came literally and figuratively out of left field, were introduced with minimal consultation about their practical effect and have left little time for employers to prepare, the group said on Thursday. The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele ONeil said the caveat built into the law meant it wont interfere with reasonable requests. Instead, it will stop workers paying the price for poor planning by management, she said. She cited an unidentified worker who finished a shift at midnight, only to be texted four hours later and told to be back at work by 6 a.m. Its so easy to make contact, common sense doesnt get applied anymore, she said. We think this will cause bosses to pause and think about whether they really need to send that text or that email. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Kuala Lumpur has hosted a fruitful engagement with the Malaysian Indian Tour  Travel Association (MITTA), in order to explore avenues for promoting the Ramayana Trail tourism in Malaysia. MITTA, which encompasses over 200 Indian-Malaysian travel and tour agencies, plays a pivotal role in advancing outbound and inbound tourism, with a particular focus on Tamil-speaking travelers, the Sri Lankan High Commission in Kuala Lumpur said in a statement. Accordingly, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka Air Chief Marshal (Rtd.) Sumangala Dias met with MITTA representatives and built upon discussions previously initiated with the Kuala Lumpur Selangor Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KLSICCI) in July 2024, the statement mentioned. High Commissioner Dias highlighted the growing potential for tourism between Sri Lanka and Malaysia, noting that approximately 10,000 Malaysians visited Sri Lanka last year, while around 60,000 Sri Lankans traveled to Malaysia. This provides a unique opportunity to project Sri Lanka as an appealing tourist destination especially for Malaysian travelers of Indian origin, who have historical connections through the Ramayana epic. During the meeting, a video documentary on the Ramayana Trail was screened, showcasing Sri Lankas historical monuments and Hindu deities linked to the Ramayana. High Commissioner Dias requested MITTAs support in promoting these tourism opportunities among Malaysian agencies and outbound travelers, it added. The President of MITTA, Dato Aruldas expressed appreciation for the opportunity offered to explore the Ramayana Trail and affirmed MITTAs commitment to disseminating necessary information within the Indian-Malaysian travel community. The High Commission of Sri Lanka is dedicated to fostering the ongoing development of trade, investments, and tourism between Sri Lanka and Malaysia and looks forward to strengthening its collaboration with MITTA to achieve these objectives, according to the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Kuala Lumpur.",

        "date": "August 26, 2024 03:32 pm",
        "content": "The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka states that the nation needs a wise and courageous leader to make the long awaited system-change to eradicate corruption and its related ills. Issuing a statement on Monday (26) pertaining to the 2024 Presidential Election, the Catholic Bishops Conference expressed that the presidential election candidates are solicited to desist from deceiving the voter by offering allurements, favours and making false promises, and to check on the organizers and supporters of their campaigns in this regard. Those who violate election laws cannot be trusted to govern the country with integrity and justice, the statement mentioned. Thus, the Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka calls on all registered voters to cast their vote to elect the leader who would govern the country according to the democratic and moral principles based on the values of the four main religions in the Island, respecting also the cultural ethos of the people. As religious leaders, we invite the candidates vying for the Presidency to find inspiration in the sacred axiom of Jesus: not to be served but to serve (Mk.10:45). It is an invitation to put power into practice as service, the statement added. We kindly appeal to all concerned to conduct a free and fair Presidential election and thereafter work towards a united Sri Lanka as we invoke Gods blessings upon our beloved motherland. We call upon our dear faithful to pray intensely for the Nation and its well-being and for the wisdom needed for all our citizens to choose wisely, Sri Lankas next leader, the statement added. Meanwhile, the Catholic Bishops Conference also said in the statement that the voter must display the desire to see that justice is meted out to the citizens after proper investigations into the robbery of the countrys assets, the politically motivated abductions, disappearances and killings of persons, the crimes committed during the protracted war in the North and East, the civil-unrest in the South and the senseless massacre that took place on Easter Sunday 2019 with a most horrendous bomb attack. The Catholic Bishops Conference said all those culpable must be found and dealt with according to the laws of the country and no one should be allowed to interfere in the process of seeking justice for the 274 victims killed and the 500 or so persons injured, some very seriously.",

        "date": "August 26, 2024 03:44 pm",
        "content": "A female actor in Malayalam cinema levelled sexual abuse allegations against four prominent male actors, including M Mukesh, on Monday, causing further upheaval in the film industry already reeling from the Justice K Hema Committees explosive findings of harassment and abuse of women professionals. Hours after the actress levelled the allegations against Mukesh, a CPI(M) MLA, in interviews with news channels, workers from Yuva Morcha and Mahila Congress organised separate marches towards his residence in Kollam, demanding that a case be registered against him and that he resign as a legislator. The Kollam MLA has not responded to the allegations. The female actor also levelled sexual abuse allegations against three other prominent actors in the Malayalam film industry. Meanwhile, actor Maniyanpilla Raju has called for an investigation into the allegations surfacing in the Malayalam film industry. He told reporters that many more revelations will come out, and there will be multiple interests behind them. Some people will try to capitalise on the situation. Among those accused, there will be both innocent and guilty parties. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is necessary, Raju said. This development comes a day after director Ranjith and actor Siddique stepped down from their leadership roles in a state-run film academy and the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA), respectively, following sexual abuse allegations against them. Amid mounting pressure on the government to take action against alleged predators in the film industry, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan held a high-level meeting with senior police officials on Sunday and announced the establishment of a seven-member special team to investigate the atrocities faced by women actors. The report by the Justice Hema Committee, constituted by the Kerala government post the 2017 actress assault case, has revealed instances of harassment and exploitation of women in the Malayalam cinema industry, prompting calls for action against the guilty.

        "date": "August 26, 2024 07:26 pm",
        "content": "Separatist militant attacks on police stations, railway lines and highways in Pakistans restive province of Balochistan, coupled with retaliatory operations by security forces, killed more than 60 people, officials said on Monday. The most widespread assault by ethnic insurgents in years forms part of a decades-long effort to win secession of the resource-rich southwestern province, home to major China-led projects such as a strategic port and a gold and copper mine. These attacks are a well thought out plan to create anarchy in Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement, adding that security forces had killed 12 militants in operations after the attacks on Sunday and Monday. Pakistans military said 14 soldiers and police, and 21 militants, were killed in fighting after the largest of the attacks, which targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks on a major highway. It was not immediately clear whether that included the 12 militants the interior ministry confirmed dead. Local officials said at least 23 passengers were killed in the attack, with 35 vehicles set ablaze. Rail traffic with Quetta was suspended following blasts on a rail bridge linking the provincial capital to the rest of Pakistan, as well as on a rail link to neighbouring Iran, railways official Muhammad Kashif said. Police said they had found six as yet unidentified bodies near the site of the attack on the railway bridge. Officials said militants also targeted police and security stations in Balochistan, which is Pakistans largest province by area, killing at least 10 people in one attack. Militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) took responsibility in a statement to journalists that claimed many more attacks, including one on a major paramilitary base, though Pakistani authorities have yet to confirm these. The BLA is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the central government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistans gas and mineral resources. It seeks the expulsion of China and independence for the province. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed that security forces would retaliate and bring those responsible to justice. General Li Qiaoming, commander of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army Ground Forces and Pakistans army chief Asim Munir met on Monday, though a Pakistani military statement made no mention of the attacks. The meeting afforded an opportunity for in-depth discussions on matters of mutual interest, regional security, military training, and measures to further augment bilateral defence cooperation, it said. PASSENGERS KILLED On Sunday night, armed men blocked a highway in Balochistan, marched passengers off vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told Reuters. As many as 35 vehicles, including trucks, were set on fire on the highway in the area of Musakhail. The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal, said Hameed Zahir, deputy commissioner of the area. Militants have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources. In the past, they have also attacked Chinese interests and citizens in the province, where China runs the strategic southern deepwater port of Gawadar, as well as a gold and copper mine in its west. The BLA said its fighters targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified. Pakistans interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens. Six security personnel, three civilians and one tribal elder made up the ten killed in clashes with armed militants who stormed a station of the Balochistan Levies in the central district of Kalat, police official Dostain Khan Dashti said. Officials said police stations had also been attacked in two southern coastal towns, but the toll had yet to be confirmed. Balochistan, which borders both Iran and Afghanistan, is Pakistans largest province by size, but the least populated and remains largely underdeveloped, with high levels of poverty.

        "date": "August 26, 2024 10:06 pm",
        "content": "The Commissioner General of the Excise Department M.J. Gunasiri has dismissed claims of significant arrears in three major government revenue sources namely the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department as myths. Speaking at the press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), today (26), he clarified that the outstanding tax amount for these three institutions totals only Rs.90 billion. He also noted that it is typical for any country to have 3-5 of its total tax revenue in outstanding taxes. Commissioner General Gunasiri further highlighted that these three institutions achieved record revenue in 2023, surpassing Rs.3 trillion. Additionally, after 25 years, they succeeded in creating a surplus in the primary account. Addressing the media personnel, Commissioner General of Excise further explained; The three institutions under the Ministry of Finance the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department work within a legal framework to collect state revenue. Despite some groups spreading misinformation about large tax arrears, the actual total unpaid taxes for these institutions are under Rs.90 billion. Most of these arrears are from government entities, and legal actions are underway to recover the funds, meaning these amounts should be considered deferred taxes. Once the judicial process is completed, recovery is possible. Additionally, a tax deficit of 3-5 of total tax revenue is typical for any country. Nevertheless, overall state tax revenue has seen a significant increase over the past two years. In 2023, the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs Department, and Excise Department collectively achieved the highest revenue in history, surpassing Rs.3 trillion. Notably, after 25 years, they managed to create a surplus in the primary account. Focusing on the Excise Department, it generated an income of Rs.179 billion in 2023, with a target set at Rs.232 billion for 2024. By August 22, 2023, the department had earned Rs.106.5 billion, whereas by August 2024, it had earned Rs.132.7 billion. This represents a growth of 24.6 compared to the previous year. The Excise Department generates revenue through license fees: Rs. 15 million for a municipal council, Rs. 12.5 million for another municipal council, and Rs. 10 million for a Pradeshiya Sabha. Licenses for manufacturing plants are set at Rs. 25 million each. As of August 20 this year, the department has earned Rs. 132.4 billion. In 2023, the department had an outstanding tax amount of Rs. 1.04 billion, with Rs. 609 million collected by February of this year. The remaining tax arrears are currently under court proceedings. Deputy Commissioner General (Tax Policy, International Affairs and Legal) of the Inland Revenue Department B.K.S. Shantha; With the countrys recovery, tax revenue targets were surpassed last year. The Inland Revenue Departments revenue target for 2024 is set at Rs.2, 024 billion, with plans to collect 40 of this amount in the first four months and the remaining 60 over the last six months. To enhance efficiency, a Risk Management Unit has been established to streamline the tax revenue process. Currently, Rs.1, 066 billion in tax revenue is suspended due to on-going court cases. The department also had Rs.188 billion in tax arrears, of which Rs.104 billion are being recovered thanks to the dedicated efforts of the Excise Departments employees. The remaining Rs.84 billion in outstanding taxes are in the process of being recovered through legal actions. The Inland Revenue Department had Rs.188 billion in tax arrears, of which Rs.104 billion are being recovered thanks to the dedication of the Excise Departments employees. Another Rs.84 billion in outstanding taxes remains, and the necessary legal processes to recover this amount have already been initiated. In 2023, the number of tax files increased from 450,000 to 1.15 million. Additionally, 4.7 million new TIN numbers were issued this year. Recently, social media has been spreading rumours that Inland Revenue Department officers are visiting institutions in disguise to collect taxes. However, department officials do not visit institutions to collect taxes; they only go for awareness purposes. Therefore, it is important to note that no one should give money to individuals claiming to be tax collectors in disguise. The police have been alerted to investigate any complaints related to this issue, and security forces have been notified. Finance Officer of Sri Lanka Customs Department, Anura Muthukude; The Sri Lanka Customs Department is expected to generate Rs.1, 533 billion in revenue for 2024. By August 25 this year, the department had already collected Rs.963.7 billion. Media reports indicate that the department has Rs.58.6 billion in outstanding taxes, with Rs.57.6 billion owed by government institutions, effectively rendering that amount non-recoverable. The department has taken legal steps to recover the remaining taxes, some of which have been pending for over a decade. To enhance transparency, the Sri Lanka Customs Department has established a new Smat Unit, where the public can submit complaints. It is important to note that despite a workforce shortage of 940 employees, the departments staffs have ensured that no tax revenue has been evaded. --PMD--",

        "content": "Surging waters have burst through a dam, wiped out at least 20 villages and left at least 30 people dead but probably many more in eastern Sudan, the United Nations said on Monday, devastating a region already reeling from months of civil war. Torrential rains caused floods that overwhelmed the Arbaat Dam on Sunday just 40 km (25 miles) north of Port Sudan, the de facto national capital and base for the government, diplomats, aid agencies and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The area is unrecognisable. The electricity and water pipes are destroyed, Omar Eissa Haroun, head of the water authority for Red Sea state, said in a WhatsApp message to staff. One first responder said that between 150 and 200 people were missing. He said he had seen the bodies of gold miners and pieces of their equipment wrecked in the deluge, and likened the disaster to the devastation in the eastern Libyan city of Derna in September last year when storm waters burst dams, swept away buildings and killed thousands. On the road to Arbaat on Monday a Reuters reporter saw people burying a man and covering his grave with driftwood to try to prevent it from being washed away in mudslides. The homes of about 50,000 people were impacted by the flooding, the United Nations said, citing local authorities, adding that the number only accounted for the area west of the dam as the area east was inaccessible. The dam was the main source of water for Port Sudan, which is home to the countrys main Red Sea port and working airport, and receives most of the countrys much-needed aid deliveries. The city is threatened with thirst in the coming days, the Sudanese Environmentalists Association said in a statement. Crumbling Infrastructure Officials said the dam had started crumbling and silt had been building during days of heavy rain that had come much earlier than usual. Sudans dams, roads and bridges were already in disrepair before the war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Forces began in April 2023. Both sides have since funnelled the bulk of their resources into the conflict, leaving infrastructure badly neglected. Some people had fled their flooded homes and headed to the mountains where they were now stranded, the health ministry said. On Monday, the governments rainy season taskforce said 132 people had been killed in floods across the country, up from 68 two weeks ago. At least 118,000 people have been displaced by the rains this year, according to United Nations agencies. The conflict in Sudan began when competition between the army and the RSF, who had previously shared power after staging a coup, flared into open warfare. The two sides had been seeking to protect their power and extensive economic interests as the international community promoted a plan for a transition towards civilian rule. Overlapping efforts in pursuit of a ceasefire, including Saudi- and U.S.-led talks in Jeddah, have not eased the fighting and half of the 50 million population lack sufficient food.

        "content": "Rear Admiral Kanchana Banagoda has been appointed as the new Chief of Staff of the Sri Lanka Navy.

        "title": "Australia introduces cap on international students",
        "date": "August 27, 2024 11:02 am",
        "content": "Australia will introduce a cap on the number of new international students it accepts, as it tries to reduce overall migration to pre-pandemic levels. The nation has one of the biggest international student markets in the world, but the number of new enrolments will be limited to 270,000 for 2025. Each higher education institution will be given an individual restriction, the government announced on Tuesday, with the biggest cuts to be borne by vocational education and training providers. The change has angered the tertiary education industry, with some universities calling it economic vandalism, but Canberra says it will improve the quality and longevity of the sector. Australia is host to about 717,500 international students, according to the latest government figures from early 2024. Education Minister Jason Clare acknowledged that higher education was hard-hit during the pandemic, when Australia sent foreign students home and introduced strict border controls. He also noted, however, that the number of international students at universities is now 10 higher than before Covid-19, while the number at private vocational and training providers is up 50. Students are back but so are the shonks - people are seeking to exploit this industry to make a quick buck, Mr Clare said. The government has previously accused some providers of unethical behaviour - including accepting students who dont have the language skills to succeed, offering a poor standard of education or training, and enrolling people who intend to work instead of study. These reforms are designed to make it better and fairer, and set it up on a more sustainable footing going forward, Mr Clare said. The restrictions will also help address Australias record migration levels, he said, which have added pressure to existing housing and infrastructure woes. The government has already announced tougher minimum English-language requirements for international students and more scrutiny of those applying for a second study visa, while punishing hundreds of dodgy providers. Enrolments at public universities will be pared back to 145,000 in 2025, which is around their 2023 levels, Mr Clare said. Private universities and non-university higher education providers will be able to enrol 30,000 new international students, while vocational education and training institutions will be limited to 95,000. The policy would also include incentives for universities to build more housing for international students, Mr Clare added. But higher education providers say the industry is being made a fall guy for housing and migration issues, and that a cap would decimate the sector. International education was worth A36.4bn (18.7bn, 24.7) to the Australian economy in 2022-23, making it the countrys fourth largest export that year. According to economic modelling commissioned earlier this year by Sydney University  where foreign students make up about half of enrolments  the proposed cuts could cost the Australian economy 4.1bn and result in about 22,000 job losses in 2025. Vicki Thomson, chief executive of a body which represents some of Australias most prestigious universities, described the proposed laws as draconian and interventionist, saying they amounted to economic vandalism in comments made earlier this year. Mr Clare accepted that some service providers may have to make difficult budget decisions, but denied the cap would cripple the industry. To create the impression that this is somehow tearing down international education is absolutely and fundamentally wrong, he said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 27, 2024 11:29 am",
        "content": "The Colombo High Court has sentenced former Minister A. H. M. Fowzie for two years of rigorous imprisonment and suspended it for 10 years after he pleaded guilty over the charge of misusing a vehicle belonging to the Ministry of Disaster Management. The court also imposed a fine of Rs.400,000 on the former Minister, when the case was taken up today (27), Ada Derana reporter said. Former Minister Fowzie was charged over the possession and personal use of a luxury vehicle worth nearly Rs. 20 million received from the Netherlands to the Disaster Management Ministry, while serving as the Minister of Disaster Management in 2010. Furthermore, he was found guilty of persuading the officials including the Ministry Secretary and spending nearly Rs 1 million from the Finance Ministrys funds for the maintenance of the vehicle. However, Fowzie had pleaded guilty for the charges through his attorney, when the case was taken up for hearing today. Later, the High Court Judge pointed out that such actions by a senior politician with 62 years of political experience cannot be taken for granted, but considering the fact that he pleaded guilty at the initial stage and that he is now an elderly person of 86 years of age, the former Minister will be given a lenient sentence.",

        "title": "Nostalgic Indians flock to cinemas to watch old hits",
        "date": "August 27, 2024 11:42 am",
        "content": "When Zakia Rafiqi, 26, heard that Laila Majnu, a 2018 Bollywood film, was being re-released in cinemas this month, she knew she had to watch it again. In 2018, I was among a handful of people in the cinema. This time, there were many more people. A lot of them were laughing and crying, says Ms Rafiqi, who went with her sister to a cinema in Delhi. Ms Rafiqi says she has an emotional connect with the film, a tragic love story set in Indian-administered Kashmir, where she is from. Its good to see a piece of home on the big screen. When they are driving through the streets of Kashmir, you feel you are there, she says. Laila Majnu, written by popular filmmaker Imtiaz Ali, barely made a mark at the box office when it was first released, but did good business on its second run. It is one among dozens of Indian films - some made more than two decades ago - which are getting a new lease of life as people flock to watch them on the big screen. Indias film industry, like others across the world, has seen ups and downs since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered cinemas for months and led many to turn to streaming services. It is yet to return to its former glory. This year has been particularly bad for new Bollywood releases, says trade analyst Komal Nahta. The industry - dominated by Hindi-language Bollywood - is now churning out films more regularly, but its common to hear people say they will wait for a film to stream on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video instead of going to cinemas. Some films do break through - Stree 2, a Hindi horror-comedy currently playing in cinemas, has earned close to four billion rupees (47.6m; 36.1m) domestically so far to become the years biggest Bollywood hit. In terms of overall earnings, it is second only to Kalki 2898 AD, a pan-Indian film which featured some of the countrys biggest stars. But these are rare bright spots for an industry which has seen highly anticipated films with big stars fare miserably at the box office this year. Theres no doubt that Indias film industry is continuing to see a churn as viewing habits shift - the top 10 films so far this year include three from the southern state of Kerala, where budgets are comparatively small. So its not surprising that both film distributors and viewers are turning to the comfort of the familiar. A look at the list of films being released again shows theres no clear formula behind the choices. Bollywood re-releases this year are across a range of genres. The 1990s seem to be a favourite decade with much-loved rom-coms Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Hum Aapke Hain Koun and action thrillers Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Baazigar getting a second outing. More recent hits - musical Rockstar (2011), buddy film Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) and rom-com Jab We Met (2007) - have also brought people back to cinemas. Analysts say the biggest surprise was the success of Laila Majnu. The films makers have said they were particularly happy that viewers in Kashmir could watch it as cinema halls reopened there in 2022 after more than two decades. The film has finally recovered its cost or at least minimised its losses, says Mr Nahta, who adds that this will spur others to see if their films could also benefit from a re-release. Taran Adarsh, a Bollywood analyst, says these re-releases are making up for a lack of new films and lacklustre box-office performances. The re-releases have little to no promotion, with posters simply popping up on ticket booking sites or circulating on social media. Its driven purely by nostalgia or an audiences love for a film that already has a cult following, says Mr Adarsh. In Tamil and Telugu, the re-releases have been more star-driven. Recent videos show fans of Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi dancing to a hit song from his 2002 hit Indra in cinemas. Pawan Kalyans Gabbar Singh (2012) is set to release next week. In Tamil, Vijays Ghilli (2004) ran to packed halls in April. Its usually the film of a superstar whose star may have just been rising 20 years ago or a film that was already a hit, says Sreedhar Pillai, an analyst who tracks the southern film industries. It has to be driven by nostalgia and have a connection with an actor who is a big star today. Malayalam superstar Mohanlal has two such films - Devadoothan (2000) and Manichithrathazhu (1993) - currently running in cinemas in Kerala. Coincidentally, both are horror films. Devadoothan, an eerie film with beautiful songs which flopped when it first released, has been running to packed cinemas for more than a month. Mr Pillai says that Manichithrathazhu, a cult classic which broke box-office records when it first released, is probably the biggest success story among re-releases in southern India. Its an iconic film. A huge blockbuster when it was released, and now its also getting the young audience, he says. Sometimes, the prospect of a sequel can drive interest in the first film. Last year, the 2001 film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha had another successful run in cinemas after its sequel Gadar 2 became a massive hit, says Mr Nahta. But the re-release of Kamal Haasans Indian this year did not see similar success because its sequel Indian 2 did not perform well, he adds. So why are people paying to watch older films that are easily available on streaming platforms? You simply cant compare the experience of watching a film online with watching it in theatres and that is what audiences are turning out for, Mr Adarsh says. Shruti Zende agrees. The 30-year-old from Pune city in Maharashtra state has watched a couple of re-releases since last year. Instead of watching the film for its storyline, it becomes a group experience where youre watching with people who really like the movie, she says, adding that people start reacting before a scene or dialogue because they know whats coming up. She is now looking forward to watching Telugu superstar Nagarjunas 2004 film Mass on the big screen this week. But her final verdict on re-releases will give hope to beleaguered filmmakers. I may watch one or two re-releases a year, she says. But after that Id still want to watch a new film. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 27, 2024 12:33 pm",
        "content": "Apple has announced the date of its next major event, where the iPhone 16 is expected to launch. On Monday, September 9 the tech giant is hosting a special event with the tag line Its Glowtime. The event will take place at 10 am PT at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park and will be streamed online. Though its not quite clear yet what glowtime is referring to, embedded artificial intelligence is expected to be a key feature of the latest iPhone. In June, Apple announced a slew of generative AI features for the iPhone its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by Apple Intelligence, from personalized Genmoji  Apples AI-generated emoji  to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, whats in your email and what time your loved ones flight is landing. Though iPhone 15 Pro Max users will likely be able to access at least some of the AI features, the upcoming iPhone 16 is expected to be the first device designed fully with AI in mind. At the conference, Apple also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which is facing its own scrutiny and challenges. Artificial intelligence has been integrated in some iPhone features for years now, such as Live Text and an improved autocorrect function over the original. But enhanced generative AI could build on those features aimed at enhancing interaction and personalization, potentially making a new iPhone the first specifically built with some of those features in mind. But Angelo Zino, a CFRA Research technology analyst, said the outlook for the iPhone 16 is muted, since the new AI features will be rolled out over the next few years  enhanced Siri may even come as late as 2025, for example, Zino said. This is going to be more of an evolutionary process, rather than some big cyclical, iPhone cycle, Zino said. Generative AI enables tools to create written work, images and even audio in response to prompts from users. Apples segway into artificial intelligence would most likely be through Siri, the companys virtual assistant, analysts said. Combining Siri with OpenAIs latest ChatGPT-4o model could allow the assistant to recall a picture taken years ago, provide more specific information, and even possibly learn the users preferences and personality over time. The launch could change Apples trajectory for the iPhone. iPhone sales in China have tumbled due to uncertain economic conditions and growing competition. One of the biggest questions about the device launch is how much it will cost. Apple enthusiasts have debated for years whether iPhone models should be cheaper, while investors would prefer maximum profit. CFRA isnt modeling a huge price spike for the iPhone 16, but the inclusion of AI capabilities could potentially see them increase prices across the board Zino said. Apples competitors have already dipped into the generative AI space, such as Samsungs circle to search feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a devices screen with a finger gesture.

        "date": "August 27, 2024 12:59 pm",
        "content": "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka has issued an announcement regarding the legal provisions for voters with disabilities to be accompanied by a person to assist in marking the ballot paper at the polling station. Accordingly, the election regulatory body stated that the provisions in Section 38(2) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 as amended by Elections (Special Provisions) Act, No. 28 of 2011 for a person who is totally or partially visually handicapped or physically disabled can be accompanied by another person to assist in marking the ballot paper at the upcoming elections. The person who accompanies the disabled person should be more than 18 years of age and not a candidate contesting for that election. Similarly, he should not be as an authorized agent, divisional agent or an election agent of a candidate, the Election Commission said in a statement. In addition, the person who accompanies the disabled person should not be a person subject to any disability. In order to be accompanied by a person to assist as stated above, a certificate of eligibility prescribed in the Fifth Schedule to the Presidential Elections Act should be handed over to the officers at the polling station, the statement added. The form to be used to obtain the certificate of eligibility can be collected from District Election Office, Divisional Secretariat, Grama Niladhari Office or the Election Commissions website (www.elections.gov.lk). Individuals with visual impairments or other physical disabilities should obtain and complete the application form as described above and submit it to the Grama Niladhari to receive a certificate. Once the certificate is obtained, it should be presented to a Government Medical Practitioner. The Medical Practitioner will then examine the elector and record their findings, certifying the electors eligibility on the form, according to the Election Commission. The election regulatory body further mentioned in its statement that the disabled elector should proceed to the polling station with his official poll card, National Identity Card or any other identity document acceptable at the polling station and this certificate of eligibility accompanied by the assistant. After the polling station staff verify the electors identity, a ballot paper will be issued following the standard procedures. The elector, accompanied by hisher assistant, will then be directed to the Senior Presiding Officer to mark the ballot paper. It is crucial that the assistant carries their National Identity Card or any other identification accepted at the polling station. At the polling station, the Senior Presiding Officer obtains the eligibility certificate of the elector and the declaration related to Part III of the certificate of eligibility will be recorded from the accompanying person. The elector and assistant will then be escorted to the voting cubicle along with a member of the polling station staff and will be made to mark the ballot paper and place it in the ballot box before the Senior Presiding Officer and staff member, it added. The Election Commission further emphasized that an assistant cannot accompany an elector to the polling station without the above certificate of eligibility. After voting, the Senior Presiding Officer will retain the relevant certificate of eligibility. Additionally, if an elector with disability is unable to bring an assistant, heshe may have hisher ballot paper marked by the Senior Presiding Officer in the presence of another officer, as was the practice in previous elections, according to the Election Commission.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the strength and talent of his team, asserting that they are well-equipped to overcome any challenge facing the country. Speaking at the 37th Annual Conference of the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA) at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo this evening (26), the President highlighted the critical role of public support in ensuring the success of the governments economic recovery program. President Wickremesinghe outlined his objective of achieving a swift economic recovery for Sri Lanka, noting that substantial progress has been made towards this goal. The President stressed that sustaining this recovery and fostering long-term economic growth require adherence to the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), describing it as the only viable path to overcoming the crisis. He also acknowledged the significant relief Sri Lanka has received through this agreement. The annual conference, held under the theme Towards Sri Lankas Sustained Economic Growth, brought together professionals from various sectors. The OPA, which consists of 52 member associations representing 34 sectors, boasts a membership of over 60,000 professionals. During the event, President Wickremesinghe was presented with a commemorative gift, and the annual journal of the OPA was also handed over to him. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; Weve been discussing the current situation and the challenges we face with the government. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Governor of the Central Bank, has already detailed the circumstances, so I wont repeat them. His explanation alone highlights the magnitude of the issue. Fortunately, we managed a swift turnaround for two key reasons: first, I had a strong team, including Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, that helped stabilize the economy; second, we avoided unnecessary delays and made decisive actions. I was determined not to let us fall into the trap Greece did, where after reaching an agreement, they held an election and a referendum that rejected the deal, leading to another economic collapse. It took Greece a decade to recover. My goal was a quick recovery, and thats what weve achieved. To sustain economic growth, its vital to adhere to our agreement with the IMF, which wasnt easy to secure. We negotiated with numerous parties, including the IMF, World Bank, ADB, and a diverse group of creditors. Among them were countries in the Paris Club, as well as India and China, who took different approaches. We had to navigate these complex negotiations. Despite the challenges, the agreement we reached has led us out of crisis and brought hope for growth and relief to the people. For instance, energy prices have stabilized, and were seeing positive results in other areas. Some argue we should change or discard the agreement, but thats unrealistic. The path we agreed upon with the IMF is the only viable one, and it has provided us significant relief, stretching payments and giving us time until 2042 to adjust. Transforming our economy from being import-dependent to export-oriented is essential. Weve passed key laws to support this transition, including the Public Debt Management Act, the Public Finance Act, the Central Bank Act, and the Economic Transformation Act. For the first time, policy is enshrined in law, meaning it cannot be easily changed by shifts in leadership. We must now focus on transforming our economy from being import-dependent to export-oriented and competitive. Achieving this requires increased productivity, particularly in sectors like apparel, where we must move towards high-end markets and backward integration. Additionally, we need to modernize agriculture, capitalizing on the growing global demand for food. With 300,000 acres available for cultivation and plans to increase paddy productivity, we can free up land for other crops, driving value addition in agriculture and dairy products. Tourism is another key area, with plans to double tourist arrivals and increase revenue per night. Expanding logistics, advancing technology-intensive manufacturing, and fostering digitalization, including AI, are also critical. We are establishing four new universities focused on technology to build the necessary human resources. Ultimately, the challenge lies in making a start. We have the talent, and with the right environment, we can succeed. The decision on which path to take is in your hands, and I trust you will make the right choice. --PMD--",

        "title": "Former Malaysian PM charged with sedition for allegedly mocking former king",
        "date": "August 27, 2024 03:07 pm",
        "content": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the countrys previous king. Muhyiddin, who led Malaysia from March 2020 until August 2021, pleaded not guilty in a court in northeast Kelantan state. According to the charge sheet, Muhyiddin made the seditious remarks last month during a by-election campaign in Kelantan. Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysias king for five-year terms under the countrys rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nations majority Muslims. In his speech on Aug. 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didnt invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022. Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers. Muhyiddins Islamic nationalistic bloc received stronger-than-expected support from Malays, who account for two-thirds of Malaysias 34 million people. Sultan Abdullah appointed then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister after Anwar cobbled up support from rival parties to form a unity government. Sultan Abdullah from central Pahang state, who ended his reign on Jan. 30 this year, didnt comment on the case. But his son issued a strong rebuke to Muhyiddin, saying his remarks were dangerous and could divide the people and undermine the royal institution. Muhyiddin was questioned by police following complaints against him. He had denied insulting the royalty, saying his remarks were factual and that he had handed in sworn oath of support by 115 lawmakers in the 222-member parliament. Zaid Malek from Lawyers for Liberty, a human rights and law reform group, slammed the use of the colonial-era Sedition Act against Muhyiddin. He said questioning or criticizing the exercise of constitutional power by the king wasnt seditious. The law, introduced by the British in 1948, criminalizes speech or actions with an undefined seditious tendency, including that which promotes hatred against the government and monarchy or incites racial discord. The king is a constitutional monarch, and not a feudal ruler. His exercise of his power can thus be debated, questioned or criticized. This is the very bedrock of our system of constitutional monarchy, Zaid said. Anwar had backtracked on his pledge to repeal the Sedition Act, which has long been used to suppress dissenting voices, he added. Muhyiddin, 77, faces up to three years in prison or a fine or both if found guilty. He is also still battling corruption and money-laundering charges that he claims are politically motivated. Muhyiddin was the second former leader charged with crimes after ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak, who received multiple charges after losing a 2018 general election. Najib began a 12-year prison term in 2022, with several more graft trials underway. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

SLPP media spokesperson Sanjeeva Edirimanna said that the party is currently in the final phase of preparing the policy statement. Meanwhile, the Presidential Candidate of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa has emphasized the importance of strengthening the Samurdhi programme. Speaking at a rally in Nawalapitiya, Rajapaksa criticized the negative perception some leaders have about the programme, which he argues has been crucial in alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka. The SLPPs Presidential Candidate stated that certain leaders think that the Samurdhi movement has failed and that however, it was the same movement that saved the people of this country from poverty. Rajapaksa further proposed that efforts should be made to help beneficiaries children find suitable employment in various sectors, including technology and agriculture, to take them out of poverty. He pledged to implement policies aimed at transforming Samurdhi recipients into entrepreneurs, beyond simply strengthening the Samurdhi programme, if elected.",

        "date": "August 27, 2024 03:37 pm",
        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has met with the presidential candidate of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera today (27), in order to discuss the current issues in the health sector. During the discussion, the representatives of the GMOA pointed out that one of the major issues prevailing in the health sector is the rising brain drain in the country. They emphasized that despite repeated warnings, no effective solutions have been provided by the relevant authorities to address the problem. Commenting regarding the issue, presidential candidate Dilith Jayaweera highlighted that this is a critical issue concerning Sri Lankas human capital and human resources management, adding that the country lacks a comprehensive government strategy for managing human resources. It is essential for Sri Lanka to develop such a strategy. Combined services should be separated based on their unique characteristics. The public service is a combination of dissimilarities brought together by considering a very few similarities, he added. Furthermore, Jayaweera said: The top priority to create a Happy Nation is to ensure the health and well-being of the people. Therefore, we suggest that we should invest more on the health sector and the doctors in order to keep the nation healthy. We hope to submit the necessary proposals to our National Strategic Program to address this on the 31st. Speaking to the media following the discussion, the Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Prabhath Sugathapala stated that compared to other presidential candidates, Dilith Jayaweera has a proper vision and understanding of the problems in the health sector. We actually met about 7 presidential candidates. The discussions with them were prolonged. When compared with the other discussions, scientifically speaking, Mr. Dilith Jayaweera has some knowledge on the matters we are talking about. That means he had recognized the solution we are proposing as the solution. That is the uniqueness. Thats something were happy about, he added.",

Speaking at a rally in Trincomalee, Premadasa outlined his vision for governance, which includes holding an international donor conference aimed at advancing development in the North and East. We will hold an international donor conference that will help develop the Northern and Eastern regions, said the opposition leader. At the same time, especially through the devolution of power within one state and giving the power to the people, we will make the implementation of that devolution of maximum power our policy, he said. He also vowed to end the era where the central government arbitrarily seizes the responsibility which has been provided to the provincial councils. Premadasa also pledged that the SJB will hold provincial council elections shortly after winning the presidential election and assured to enhance the efficiency of the provincial council system to ensure development in the North and East.",

        "title": "We cant come out from the existing IMF program  AKD",
        "date": "August 27, 2024 04:42 pm",
        "content": "Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leader of National Peoples Power alliance and its presidential candidate, says hes serving those who were part of public protests that ousted then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022. The people of our country have a great expectation for a change Dissanayake told The Associated Press. They wanted a change and we are the agents of that change. All the other candidates are the agents of the old, failed, traditional system. Dissanayake says the peoples wishes for a change were not realized because the protesters did not have a plan beyond ousting the president and werent equipped to take charge. Dissanayake says his administration can be the change people want: a sound economy in a corruption-free society. NPP is a political movement made up of 21 different groups including political parties, youth groups, womens groups, trade unions and other civil society groups. Dissanayakes original party is the Peoples Liberation Front (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), which is the key force behind the NPP coalition. Dissanayake says despite his partys long-held policy of nationalizing the countrys resources, they accept economic freedom and foreign trade. He plans to uphold the agreement with the IMF while his administration negotiates changes to ease the burden on the public. We cant come out from the existing IMF program because we entered into the IMF program only after the country was financially collapsed. We believe there could have been another alternative. But now all the bilateral and multi-lateral agreements have been placed inside the IMF basket, Dissanayake said. More attention should be paid to the hardships faced by the people when moving forward with the IMF program, he said. Dissanayake said that his administration will not seek to punish anyone accused of human rights violations and war crimes during Sri Lankas brutal 26-year civil war. He said he would instead focus on investigating alleged human rights violations and seeking an agreement with the victims families, he said. Both government troops and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of grave human rights violations during the war that led to the United Nations human rights council calling for investigations and prosecutions. On the question of accountability, it should not be in a way to take revenge, not in a way to accuse someone, but only to find out the truth, Dissanayake said. Even the victims do not expect anyone to be punished. They only want to know what happened. Whichever candidate wins the presidency will have an intricate geopolitical balance to maintain between China and India, both of which hold Sri Lankan debt and are vying for control in the region. While China is economically secure, Sri Lanka is physically closer to India. Dissanayake says his government will handle the geopolitical rivalry with utmost care. Sri Lankas presidential election will take place Sept. 21. A record 39 candidates were approved to run, though one candidate died since. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is also running, largely on public approval for his economic reform plan. The more reliable opinion polls have, until recently, put Dissanayake at a significant lead over his main rivals, said political analyst Jehan Perera. Regardless of their accuracy, AKD is a viable candidate to win the presidency, he said, referring to Dissanayake by his initials. Those who want change above all will prefer to vote for AKD as he has the least connections with the business and political elites who have been running the country, he added.

Dr. Jayasinghe also highlighted that the most pressing infectious disease threat in Kandy is not dengue, but tuberculosis. While dengue cases are typically identified within six days and the treatment can be commenced, tuberculosis presents a much greater challenge, as diagnosis of the disease can take up to six months, according to Dr. Jayasinghe. Meanwhile, he highlighted that symptoms such as persistent coughing, weakness in body and the loss of appetite is significant in TB patients, but they often go untreated, as many individuals seek short-term remedies for these symptoms instead of undergoing proper screening for TB. With tuberculosis cases on the rise in Kandy, Dr. Jayasinghe urged the public to be vigilant and prioritize their health.",

        "date": "August 27, 2024 07:00 pm",
        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, says any political or social uncertainties or reversals of hard earned achievements that exerts significant pressure on the economic reforms agenda could lead to a deviation from the intended policy trajectory. He said this could potentially result in adverse and irreversible impacts on the economy and the recurrence of the economic and social crisis that Sri Lanka experience in the past two years. He expressed these views while attending the 37th Annual Conference of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka held on Monday (26) at the Shangri-La Hotel in 5Colombo, under the theme of Towards Sri Lankas Sustained Economic Growth. As you all know the ongoing reform agenda comprises measures that are expected to augment the resilience and stability of the economy, which is what is needed for the medium-long-term growth, he said. The Central Bank Governor said maintaining macro-economic stability is a prerequisite to ensure sustained growth trajectory in the medium to long term. He further said, although these reforms are painful in the short term, it is crucial for all stakeholders to remain committed and ensure the swift implementation of this long-overdue reforms to set the economy on the path towards sustain, inclusive and sustainable growth. Despite all such efforts any political or social uncertainties or reversals of hard earned achievements that exerts significant pressure on the reforms agenda could lead to a deviation from the intended policy trajectory, potentially resulting in adverse and irreversible impacts on the economy and recurrence of the economic and social crisis that we experience in the past two years. At the same time, policies of macroeconomic stability itself could not be sufficient to propel the economy to a high-growth path that would take Sri Lanka to an advanced country status within a short time, Dr. Weerasinghe said. He stated that with the current sovereign debt crisis, the government does not have any physical space to drive the economic growth through higher spending or lower taxes as in the past since reinstating fiscal and debt sustainability is the need of the hour at present and also for the future.",

        "date": "August 27, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "For a short period last Thursday, first-class round-trip airline tickets from Australia to the US that normally cost up to 28,000 Australian dollars (about 19,000) were available from Qantas for a whopping 85 off. Due to a coding error, about 300 lucky people were able to buy them on the airlines website for as little as 3,400 each before the mistake was corrected. Unfortunately, this is a case where the fare was actually too good to be true, Qantas said in a statement Thursday. However, not all hope is lost. Instead of canceling the tickets, Qantas said it would rebook the customers in business class as a gesture of goodwill at no extra cost. Alternatively, passengers who arent satisfied with business class can get full refunds. Flying business class on Qantas between Australia and the United States typically costs about 11,000. Qantas goodwill gesture follows a similar blunder that was handled differently by the airline last year. Last August, Australian regulators accused Qantas in a lawsuit of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that the airline had already canceled  affecting more than 86,000 passengers. Qantas agreed in May to pay nearly 80 million to settle the suit, with more than 13 million of that sum awarded to the affected customers. Its CEO Vanessa Hudson told CNN in June that the company had let our customers down, as well as its staff. Airlines regularly make errors, selling premium tickets at a flagrantly mispriced price, though some have chosen to honor them. In 2019, Cathay Pacific offered first- and business-class seats from Vietnam to North American cities for as low as 675 round-trip. The Hong Kong flag carrier honored the deal, tweeting promisemadepromisekept and lessonlearnt on its X account. But its not always the case. In 2010, American Airlines refused to honor first-class return tickets from the US to Australia, worth up to 20,000, that it sold for the economy-class price of 1,100. Instead, it offered 200 vouchers as compensation. A year earlier, British Airways also failed to honor mistakenly sold 40 flights from North America to India, offering 300 vouchers instead.
