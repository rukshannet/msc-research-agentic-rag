        "date": "January 26, 2024 08:04 pm",
        "content": "The saffron-robed person claiming to be Vishwa Buddha has been referred for psychiatric treatment under the recommendation of the Judicial Medical Officer, Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris revealed before the court today (26). Appearing on behalf of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), the Senior Deputy Solicitor General stated that accordingly, the suspect, who has been remanded in custody, is currently receiving psychiatric treatment at the Prison Hospital. This was revealed when the case pertaining to the breaching of bail conditions by the self-styled monk was recalled before the Nugegoda Magistrates Court this afternoon. However, the Nugegoda Additional Magistrate Sanjaya Lakmal Wijesinghe, ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody until February 02, after considering a request made by the Senior Deputy Solicitor General to further remand the suspect in custody since a public disturbance will be created if he is granted bail, ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody until February 02, 2024. The suspect, who was out on bail, was re-arrested on January 23 by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over breach of bail conditions and was presented before the Gangodawila Magistrates Court. However, later he was presented before the Colombo Magistrates Court as per the orders of the Gangodawila Magistrate. According to police, the saffron-robed monk had allegedly issued statements demeaning Buddhism. Earlier, the monk was arrested on December 12 at a private establishment in Kalagedihena by the cybercrimes unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), acting on a complaint received against the self-styled monk who was residing in Ratnapura. Meanwhile, the Sangha Sabha Committee of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya recently unanimously decided to expel the controversial monk Ven. Ratnapure Wimalabuddha over allegedly issuing statements demeaning Buddhism. In January, this decision was communicated to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs by the Chief Prelate (Mahanayaka Thero) of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimalabhidhana Thero. On Wednesday (24), the self-proclaimed Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, Mahinda Kodituwakku, who is charged with committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings, was also ordered to be referred to psychiatric treatment through the prison.",

        "date": "January 26, 2024 08:42 pm",
        "content": "The controversial Online Safety Bill has sparked a geopolitical debate with the Russian Ambassador in Colombo Levan Dzhagaryan stating that regulations of the online sphere are solely a domestic issue of Sri Lanka, and that any interference in this internal issue by foreign powers is absolutely irrelevant and unacceptable. In a statement issued by the Russian Embassy in Colombo this morning (26), the Russian Ambassador in Colombo highlighted that Russia is currently following the developments pertaining to Sri Lankas Online Safety Bill, which was passed in the Parliament on Wednesday (24). Dzhagaryan added that Russia also takes notice of all comments and reactions both from the domestic political sphere and among the foreign powers accredited in Sri Lanka. The Russian Ambassadors statement came hours after U.S. Ambassador in Colombo Julie Chungs reaction to the Online Safety Bill yesterday (Jan. 25). Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Julie Chung noted that the U.S. remains concerned about the potential impact of the bill, which was passed without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies, who mention that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy. She added that, in addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs. Ms. Chung further noted that the U.S. urges Sri Lanka to prioritise transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.",

        "content": "The driver of late State Minister Sanath Nishantha, who was arrested over crash that claimed the politicians life, has been remanded by the Welisara Magistrates Court. The state ministers driver, who is still undergoing treatment at the Ragama Hospital, has been ordered to be remanded in custody until 05 February by the magistrate. Earlier today, the police recorded a statement from the driver in question, who drove the vehicle belonging to late State Minister which was involved in the accident that killed the lawmaker and his security guard on Thursday morning (Jan.25). He had reportedly detailed the moment when the fatal collision had occurred, to the police officers. During interrogation, the driver, Prabhath Eranga, told the police: We were trying to reach Colombo as soon as possible. The state minister was asleep at the time. I overtook the car in front of us, from the left side. And when I tried to get the jeep back to the lane on the right side, I hit the container truck traveling in front of us. The driver, who is currently receiving medical care at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama, further stated that he ended up crashing into the roadside barrier as he lost control of the vehicle after rear-ending the container truck. Certain media reports, citing the findings of ongoing investigations, had mentioned that the vehicle had been speeding at 160kmph at the time of the incident. According to hospital sources, the state minister had sustained serious injuries to his head and right leg. Meanwhile, the remains of the late State Minister were taken to his residence in Puttalam this afternoon. Many politicians representing both ruling party and the opposition including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, former Presidents Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa paid their final respects to the late State Minister at the Jayaratne Funeral Parlour in Borella last night and this morning, and offered their condolences to the bereaved family members.",

        "date": "January 26, 2024 10:12 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations and European Union condemned the United States on Friday after the countrys first execution of an inmate using nitrogen asphyxiation, an untested method that has reignited a debate about capital punishment, saying the method could amount to torture. The southern state of Alabama put convicted murderer Kenneth Smith to death on Thursday by pumping nitrogen hypoxia into a facemask, causing him to suffocate. It was the first use of the execution method, rather than the usual lethal injection. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said justice has been served with Smiths execution but UN human rights chief Volker Turk, the EU and US civil liberties groups expressed horror and concern. I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said. The death penalty is inconsistent with the fundamental right to life. I urge all states to put in place a moratorium on its use, as a step towards universal abolition. Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN human rights office in Geneva, said Smith was clearly suffering as he was put to death. Rather than using such untried methods to conduct executions, lets just bring an end to the death penalty, Shamdasani said. This is an anachronism that doesnt belong in the 21st century. A spokesperson for the 27-member EU, which opposes the death penalty, denounced the method of execution as a particularly cruel and unusual punishment. Yasmin Cader of the American Civil Liberties Union said Smith should have never been killed, let alone in such a gruesome manner. Its past time for our country to put an end to the death penalty instead of inventing new and more heinous ways of carrying it out, Cader said. Smith, 58, was sentenced to death for the 1988 murder-for-hire of Elizabeth Sennett, a pastors wife. After the nitrogen gas was administered, Smith began writhing and thrashing for approximately two to four minutes, followed by around five minutes of heavy breathing, local news outlet AL.com reported. Smith appeared to be holding his breath as long as he could and there was involuntary movement and gasping, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm told reporters. Smith was pronounced dead at 8:25 pm (0225 GMT Friday). Smith had survived one execution attempt. In November 2022, Alabama officials aborted his execution by lethal injection after struggling for hours to insert an intravenous lines needle in his body. --With inputs from agencies",

        "date": "January 27, 2024 10:50 am",
        "content": "The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday it had opened an investigation into several employees suspected of involvement in the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel by Hamas and that it had severed ties with those staff members. The Israeli authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on October 7, said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General. To protect the agencys ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay. Lazzarini did not disclose the number of employees allegedly involved in the attacks, nor the nature of their alleged involvement. He said, however, that any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy accused UNRWA of announcing the news while the worlds attention was focused on the World Court ordering Israel to prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians and do more to help civilians in Gaza. Any other day, this would have been a major headline: Israel submits evidence of UN employees complicity with Hamas, Levy wrote on X. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has been briefed about the allegations, his spokesperson said. The Secretary-General is horrified by this news, said spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Dujarric added that the U.N. chief had asked Lazzarini to conduct a probe to ensure that any UNRWA employee shown to have participated or abetted the Oct. 7 attacks be terminated immediately and referred for potential criminal prosecution. An urgent and comprehensive independent review of UNRWA will be conducted, Dujarric added. U.S. HALTS ADDITIONAL FUNDING UNRWA, whose biggest donors in 2022 included the United States, Germany and the European Union, has repeatedly said its capacity to render humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza is on the verge of collapse. The U.S. State Department said it was extremely troubled by the allegations, which it said pertained to 12 UNRWA employees. It said it would provide no additional funding to the agency until the allegations were addressed. The Department of State has temporarily paused additional funding for UNRWA while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them, spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the U.S. decision was an important step toward holding UNRWA accountable. Major changes need to take place so that international efforts, funds, and humanitarian initiatives dont fuel Hamas terrorism and the murder of Israelis, he wrote on X. The U.S. State Department had recently praised UNRWAs work, and the administration of Joe Biden restored funding that was halted during Donald Trumps tenure. In response to the allegations against UNRWA employees, U.S. Senate Republicans were critical of Bidens move to fund the agency. For years I have warned the Biden administration about resuming funding to UNRWA, which has a history of employing people connected to terrorist movements like Hamas, Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Friday. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it would assess further steps and draw lessons based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation. UNRWA, established in 1949 following the first Arab-Israeli war, provides services including schooling, primary healthcare and humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israeli authorities, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have accused the agency of fuelling anti-Israeli incitement, allegations it denies. UNRWA has provided aid and used its facilities to shelter people fleeing bombardment and a ground offensive launched by Israel in Gaza following the Oct. 7 attacks, in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. Israels offensive has laid waste to much of the densely populated Gaza Strip and killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the territory. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 27, 2024 12:47 pm",
        "content": "A New York jury has decided Donald Trump should pay 83.3m (65m) for defaming columnist E Jean Carroll in 2019 while he was US president. The penalty in the civil trial is made up of 18.3m for compensatory damages and 65m in punitive damages. Mr Trump was found in a previous civil case to have defamed Ms Carroll and sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. He vowed to appeal the latest ruling, calling the case a witch hunt and the verdict Absolutely ridiculous! The compensatory damages are meant to account for the harm that the jury found his comments had done to her reputation and emotional wellbeing. The panel also had to come up with a punitive penalty intended to stop Mr Trump from continuing to speak out against her. It took the jury of seven men and two women less than three hours to reach a verdict on Friday afternoon. This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when shes been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down, Ms Carroll said in a statement. Her attorney, Robbie Kaplan, said in a statement: Todays verdict proves that the law applies to everyone in our country, even the rich, even the famous, even former presidents. Earlier in the trial Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation of the plaintiffs lawyer) advised jurors not to use their real names with each other due to the sensitive nature of the case. As it concluded, he advised them that they were free to discuss their experience. But he added that in his opinion they should not tell anyone they worked on this case. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, or even that he has ever met Ms Carroll, including on Friday morning. But following the verdict he refrained from attacking her directly when he slammed the outcome of the case in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. I fully disagree with both verdicts, he wrote, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA! A civil trial last year found he sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the 1990s. That jury also found him liable of defamation for calling her accusations a lie - and he was ordered to pay her about 5m in damages. The case that ended on Friday focused on different defamatory comments by Mr Trump in 2019. Mr Trump, who abruptly left court earlier in the day with his Secret Service security detail, was not present to hear the verdict. His departure came moments after Judge Kaplan threatened to jail Mr Trumps lawyer, Alina Habba, for continuing to speak after he had told her to be quiet. You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down, he told Ms Habba. The judge had threatened to eject Mr Trump earlier after he muttered about the case being a con job and a witch hunt in court. Before the verdict was read, the judge warned: We will have no outbursts. During closing arguments earlier on Friday, a lawyer for Ms Carroll told the court her reputation had been severely harmed by the former presidents comments denying he sexually assaulted her. This case is also about punishing Donald Trump... This trial is about getting him to stop once and for all, she said. Ms Carrolls attorneys previously told the court that Mr Trumps statements unleashed a torrent of death threats, rape threats, and online vitriol towards her. Mr Trumps lawyer had argued that he should pay no further damages to Ms Carroll as her claims have more holes than Swiss cheese. Ms Habba said that her client was not to blame for the threats that Ms Carroll received. Mr Trump faces four criminal cases for a total of 91 felony counts, and is the first president in US history to be charged with a crime. He has repeatedly claimed the various legal cases he faces are being orchestrated by allies of US President Joe Biden, a Democrat. As the Republican partys White House frontrunner, Mr Trump looks set for a rematch against Mr Biden in the November 2024 general election. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The laws promulgation comes after Frances Constitutional Council censured 35 of its 86 articles, including contentious additions insisted on by the right, such as measures restricting access to social benefits and the introduction of immigration quotas. While the bill was seen as one of the signature reforms of Macrons second term, some in his camp had baulked at the stricter version, with about a quarter of his allies in parliament voting against it or abstaining. The final text upheld by the council retains key elements initially desired by the government, with a large part of it dedicated to simplifying procedures for expelling delinquent foreigners -- one of the objectives of Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin. An article on the regularisation of undocumented workers in industries facing shortages was also kept in the text. After the Constitutional Councils decision, Macron had called on Darmanin to do everything in his power to implement the immigration law as quickly as possible, a member of the presidents team told AFP. Darmanin, who had previously said some measures were clearly contrary to the constitution, described the councils ruling as a win for the government. Anger on the right The decision, however, sparked condemnation from the right, with Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, criticising what he called a coup by the judges, with the backing of the president in a post on social media platform X. He called for a referendum on immigration as the only solution. The president of the conservative Republicans, Eric Ciotti, accused the council of colluding with Macron against the will of the French people, who want less immigration. Only three of the articles censured by the council were rejected based on their content, with the rest tossed out because they were deemed to be outside the scope of the law. As such, nothing is stopping parliament from voting on them again later as part of different legislation. The Republican head of the Senate, Gerard Larcher, urged the administration to resubmit a text that conforms to the agreement reached with the right. The head of the far-left LFI party, Manuel Bompard, also called for the law to be withdrawn, saying the text validated by the Constitutional Council corresponds to the text rejected by the Assembly and therefore has no legitimacy. But Interior Minister Darmanin poured cold water on the possibility of further legislation, saying the executive will not present a bill on the subject. Source: AFP -Agencies",

The sisters, who grew up mere miles from each other in Georgia, had no idea of the others existence until fate intervened through a TikTok video and a television talent show. The story began when Amy watched Georgias Got Talent and noticed a contestant who bore an uncanny resemblance to herself. Meanwhile, Ano encountered a TikTok video featuring a woman with blue hair who looked strikingly similar to her. This digital encounter set the stage for a real-life reunion that would uncover a past shrouded in secrecy. According to a report by the BBC, their mother, Aza Shoni, had fallen into a coma due to complications during their birth in 2002. During this vulnerable time, their father, Gocha Gakharia, made the decision to sell the newborns. Consequently, Amy was raised in Zugdidi while Ano grew up in Tbilisi, both unaware of the others existence. Neither adoptive family knew they were raising one of a pair of twins, and despite the significant sums paid, they were oblivious to the illegality of their adoptions. It wasnt until Amy discovered a Facebook group aimed at reconnecting families with children suspected of being illegally adopted that the pieces began to fall into place. A woman from Germany responded to Amys post, revealing that her mother had given birth to twins in 2002. Despite initial hesitations, especially from Ano, the sisters decided to meet their biological mother. Their mother explained that she had been told her babies died after she awoke from her coma.

        "date": "January 27, 2024 05:20 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is aiming to negotiate a debt restructuring with holders of its defaulted US dollar bonds within a couple of months, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) told the Financial Times, despite complaints by private creditors that they are being left in the dark. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe further mentioned that Sri Lanka needs to reach an agreement within a couple of months on restructuring the USD 13bn of debt, but he went on to dismiss worries that negotiations have become bogged down, the Financial Times reported. Theres a lot of interest from private creditors to finish this as soon as possible. But because of the procedure it takes a certain time . . . We also want to do that fast, the CBSL governor has said. He noted that Sri Lanka must ensure whatever proposals we have exchanged are consistent with the IMFs debt sustainability analysis and also comparable with we have been discussing with other creditors. Thats a bit of a complicated process. Financial Times says Sri Lanka will need to show it is still talking to bondholders in good faith in order to secure the next 330mn tranche of the IMF programme, which is up for review in March. The island also faces the risk that it will be meeting some creditors in the courts rather than around a negotiating table. Hamilton Reserve Bank, a St Kitts and Nevis-based creditor that is not part of the bondholder committee, has been seeking immediate repayment on about 250mn of Sri Lanka debt through the US courts, the Financial Times said. In November, a judge stayed the case until February 29 in order to allow negotiations with other bondholders to proceed. In response to a question on how the lawsuit might affect the debt negotiations, Dr. Weerasinghe has said that those are two parallel processes running independently. He has ensured that Sri Lanka is taking into consideration and being mindful about any implications of delay or not delay in judgment. Citing people familiar with bolndholdrs thinking, Financial Times said a ruling in Hamilton Reserve Banks favour would complicate talks even if its claim would be difficult to enforce, and might lead other frustrated creditors to turn to the courts. If Sri Lanka does not secure a deal soon, youre going to see pressure building on bondholders to abandon the consensual process and start looking after themselves, a person familiar with discussions was quoted as saying. Under its IMF programme, Sri Lanka is undergoing a series of economic reforms including raising taxes and privatising state companies such as its national carrier SriLankan Airlines. Yet some of these measures have proven controversial ahead of the elections for a new president and parliament due later this year, with some opposition parties vowing to renegotiate the deal. Dr. Weerasinghe has expressed hopes that debt restructuring would be finalised before the elections so we have space. He has further commented that Theres a great understanding by the people of Sri Lanka on the need for these kinds of reforms, and continuation of these reforms. They know that if theres a deviation, well go into a worse situation. --With inputs from agencies",

        "content": "India has expressed hopes for the early conclusion of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which seeks to add to the existing free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, to pave the way to boost the islands export potential. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Mr. Santosh Jha, addressing an event held in Colombo, said: We hope to enhance our economic partnership and enhance Sri Lankas export potential through early conclusion of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement, just as the FTA opened new export opportunities for Sri Lanka to India, which now stands at more than 1 billion dollars. The remarks came during an evening reception hosted by Mr. Jha at India House in Colombo on the occasion of 75th Republic Day of India on Friday (Jan.26). He said Indias Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy is at the heart of its approach towards Sri Lanka. The India-Sri Lanka partnership has been built on civilizational ties, geographical proximity, cultural connect, strong sense of solidarity and age-old goodwill. Recalling the measures taken by the two nations to build a stronger economic partnership with connectivity as the central theme, Mr. Jha said since July 2023, India and Sri Lanka have launched daily flights between Jaffna and Chennai, as well as a ferry service. Commenting on advancing multiple energy initiatives, the Indian high commissioner said the two nations are now working on power grid connectivity to enable Sri Lanka to export power to India, the multi-product petroleum pipeline to develop Trincomalee as an economic hub and the virtual LNG pipeline from Kochi to Colombo to bring to electricity costs in Sri Lanka. There are other clean energy projects in the private sector as well as the one by the NTPC in Sampur. Mr. Jha went on to emphasize that India is also Sri Lankas largest trading partner, adding that in 2022, bilateral trade stood at USD 6 billion. He said in recent years, India has also been the largest foreign investor in Sri Lanka and that it continues to be the largest source of foreign tourists in Sri Lanka. Speaking further, Mr. Jha said: Till date, we have contributed over 5 billion US dollars towards our development partnership, which has touched every single district of Sri Lanka. We are working on projects for solar electrification of religious places across Sri Lanka, assisting in modernization of Sri Lanka railways, constructing houses for the poor, enhancing Sri Lankas health and education infrastructure, and engaging in ports and airports development. We are working on the Sri Lanka-Unique Digital Identity project and seeking to soon roll out UPI in Sri Lanka. In all of this, Indias priorities are determined by Sri Lankas needs and aspirations and that too principally of its citizens. India and Sri Lanka are natural partners - we are, if I may say, irreplaceable, indispensable, and inseparable as partners. Our interests in matters of security or development are intertwined and interlinked. The huge potential our partnership holds and the tangible impact it can have on the lives of the common people drives me to work harder to further deepen and strengthen it. I look forward to your support and cooperation in this regard.",

        "content": "A 30-year-old was arrested on Friday (Jan.27) on suspicion of taking possession of the firearms after they were used in the mass shooting in Beliatta. According to the police, the arrest was made in the area of Rathgama, Galle. On Jan.22, a group of persons who had arrived in an SUV had opened fire at a white Defender near the Beliatta Interchange of the Southern Expressway. In the shooting, which took place between 8:30 a.m. and 8:40 a.m., four persons were killed at the scene. The other person who was inside the Defender was rushed to the Tangalle Hospital with critical gunshot wounds, however, he succumbed to injuries shortly after. Among the deceased was the leader of Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya (Our Power of People Party or OPPP) Saman Perera. The other four victims were identified as Sameera Madhusanka, Hasitha Chinsuka, Buddhika Rajapaksha, and Nalin Champika. Thus far, three suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident. One suspect was identified as the driver of the SUV used by the assailants. He is suspected to have been complicit in orchestrating the murders. The investigating officers also have found the SUV used by the assailants while parked near the Vidyaloka Pirivena in Galle. On Thursday (Jan.25), the Deiyandara Magistrate ordered that the 55-year-old named Saman Kumara be detained until tomorrow for further interrogations. Based on the information divulged by the suspect during questioning, the investigating officers managed to locate a motorcycle and a van linked to the perpetrators. The police believe that they had used the motorcycle to dispose of the two T56 firearms used in the shooting and that the van had been arranged for them to move under the radar. On Friday (Jan.25), two more suspects were arrested for allegedly aiding and abetting the mass shooting. STF officers have seized 9 grams and 300 milligrams of heroin, a knife, 3 mobile phones and a motorcycle from the possession of the suspects. The duo, aged 25 and 35 years, was subsequently handed over to the Galle Harbour police station for onward investigations.",

He assumed the charge of the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka on December 22. Earlier in September, Santosh Jha was appointed as Indias next High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has adverseky affected food security, agriculture, livelihoods, and access to health services. Ahead of Sri Lankas presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled this year, Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman affirmed support for sitting premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and backed him to be re-elected, saying that he stabilised the country and lifted the economy from dire straits. On the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for securing the third tranche of loans for the economic bailout and recovery, the Lankan leader said the President was working with the world body to obtain the necessary funding and support and the country was well and truly on the road to recovery. Sri Lanka has been reeling under a severe economic crisis in the recent past, with COVID-induced lockdowns wrecking the countrys economic backbonetourism. Mounting bad loans also added to nations woes, putting the economy under severe stress and on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, a foreign exchange crisis, heavy Chinese debts, and a failed move to shift the countrys agriculture to 100 per cent organic had intensified the countrys troubles. However, at a time when the country, also known as the Emerald Isle, was staring at an economic abyss, with riots breaking out and the previous Rajapaksa government collapsing in the face of mounting public anger, India came out in its support and extended a helping hand to its southern neighbour. New Delhi not only opened a line of credit for the embattled nation but also extended timely assistance on various fronts to help the island nation recover from the crippling economic crisis.

        "date": "January 28, 2024 08:26 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The worlds largest cruise ship is set for its maiden voyage on Saturday, but environmental groups are concerned that the liquefied natural gas-powered vessel - and other giant cruise liners to follow - will leak harmful methane into the atmosphere. Royal Caribbean Internationals Icon of the Seas sets sail from Miami with capacity for 8,000 passengers across 20 decks, taking advantage of the surging popularity of cruises. The ship is built to run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), which burns more cleanly than traditional marine fuel but poses greater risks for methane emissions. Environmental groups say methane leakage from the ships engines is an unacceptable risk to the climate because of its short-term harmful effects. Its a step in the wrong direction, said Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Program at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an environmental policy think tank. We would estimate that using LNG as a marine fuel emits over 120 more life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than marine gas oil, he said. In terms of warming effects, methane is 80 times worse over 20 years than carbon dioxide, making cutting those emissions key to holding down global temperature warming. Cruise ships like Icon of the Seas use low-pressure, dual-fuel engines that leak methane into the atmosphere during the combustion process, known as methane slip, according to industry experts. There are two other engines used on bulk carriers or container ships that emit less methane but they are too tall to fit in a cruise ship. Royal Caribbean says its new ship is 24 more efficient when it comes to carbon emissions than required by global shipping regulator the International Maritime Organization (IMO). LNG emits fewer greenhouse gases than very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) that powers most of the global shipping fleet, said Steve Esau, chief operating officer of Sea-LNG, a industry advocacy organization. Cruise engines convert natural gas into power in a cylinder, where it is important to make sure that all the natural gas is converted to energy, said Juha Kytölä, director of RD and Engineering at Wärtsilä, which developed the cruise ships engines. What is not converted can escape during the combustion process into the atmosphere, he said, adding that Wärtsiläs natural gas engine technology emits 90 less methane than it did 20 to 30 years ago. Cruise ship engines have an estimated methane slip of 6.4 on average, according to 2024 research funded by the ICCT and other partners. The IMO assumes methane slip at 3.5. Methane is coming under more scrutiny, said Anna Barford, Canada shipping campaigner at Stand Earth, a nonprofit organization, noting that the IMO last summer said its efforts to cut greenhouse gases includes addressing methane emissions. Of the 54 ships on order from January 2024 to December 2028, 63 are expected to be powered by LNG, according to the Cruise Line International Association. Currently, about 6 of the 300 cruise ships sailing are fueled by LNG. Newer cruise ships are being designed to run on traditional marine gas oil, LNG or alternatives like bio-LNG that only account for a fraction of U.S. fuel consumption. Royal Caribbean will use different fuels as the market evolves, said Nick Rose, the companys vice president of environmental, social, and governance. LNG is one piece of our actual strategy, he said.

        "content": "Six European countries paused funding for the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) on Saturday, following allegations that some of its staff were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Finland on Saturday joined the United States, Australia and Canada in pausing funding to the aid agency, a critical source of support for people in Gaza, after the allegations by Israel. Palestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment, Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said on X. This stains all of us. The agency said on Friday it had opened an investigation into several employees and severed ties with those people. Encouraging more donor suspensions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said UNRWA should be replaced once fighting in the enclave dies down and accused it of ties to Islamist militants in Gaza. In Gazas rebuilding, UNRWA must be replaced with agencies dedicated to genuine peace and development, he added on X. Deputy U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq, asked about Katzs remarks, said: We are not responding to rhetoric. UNRWA overall had had a strong record, which we have repeatedly underscored. Lazzarini said the decision by the nine countries threatened its humanitarian work across the region, especially in Gaza. It is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation, he said in a statement. The Palestinian foreign ministry criticised what it described as an Israeli campaign against UNRWA, and Hamas condemned the termination of employee contracts based on information derived from the Zionist enemy. AGENCY PLAYS BIG ROLE IN GAZA AID UNRWA was set up to help refugees of the 1948 war at Israels founding and provides education, health and aid services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. It helps about two thirds of Gazas 2.3 million population and has played a pivotal aid role during the war that Israel launched to eliminate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks Announcing the investigation, Lazzarini said on Friday that he had decided to terminate the contracts of some staff members to protect the agencys ability to deliver humanitarian assistance. Lazzarini did not disclose the number of employees allegedly involved in the attacks, nor the nature of their alleged involvement. He said, however, that any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. During weeks of Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, UNRWA has repeatedly said its capacity to render humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza is on the verge of collapse. Hussein al-Sheikh, head of the Palestinians umbrella political body the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said cutting support to the agency brought major political and relief risks. We call on countries that announced the cessation of their support for UNRWA to immediately reverse their decision, he said on X. The Foreign Ministry in Germany, a major donor to UNRWA, welcomed UNRWAs investigation, saying it was deeply concerned about the allegations raised against agency employees. We expect Lazzarini to make it clear within UNRWAs workforce that all forms of hatred and violence are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated, it said on X. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

I have decided to resign from my executive chairmanship and the TKO board of directors, effective immediately, McMahon said in a statement released by TKO. The suit by a former employee, filed on Thursday in federal court in Connecticut, accuses McMahon, WWE and another executive of physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault and trafficking at WWE, and seeks unspecified costs and damages. McMahon denied the allegations in the statement, saying, I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name. WWE President Nick Khan wrote in a memo to employees that McMahon will no longer have a role with TKO Group Holdings or WWE. McMahon had retired from WWE in 2022 amid allegations of misconduct and paid 17.4 million to the company to cover costs related to an investigation into that case. He returned in January 2023. The powerhouse behind the wrestling entertainment company, McMahon transformed it from a regional player in a highly fragmented industry of the 1980s to a global giant, with about 1 billion in revenue in 2021. He used scripted matches, celebrity wrestlers and glitz to make the brand more acceptable to television audiences, and created the concept of pay-per-view matches for bigger events such as WrestleMania to build its revenue base. TKO was formed last year when McMahon forged a deal between WWE and Endeavor Group-owned (EDR.N), opens new tab mixed martial arts franchise UFC. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "January 28, 2024 02:07 pm",
        "content": "U.S. negotiators are making progress on a potential agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against Hamas in Gaza for two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages who were captured in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said Saturday that emerging terms of the yet-to-be sealed deal would play out over two phases. In the first phase, fighting would stop to allow for the remaining women, elderly and wounded hostages to be released by Hamas. Israel and Hamas would then aim to work out details during the first 30 days of the pause for a second phase in which Israeli soldiers and civilian men would be released. The emerging deal also calls for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. While the proposed deal would not end the war, U.S. officials are hopeful that such an agreement could lay the groundwork for a durable resolution to the conflict. The New York Times first reported on Saturday that progress has been made towards an agreement for a pause in fighting in exchange for the remaining hostages. CIA director Bill Burns is expected to discuss the contours of the emerging agreement when he meets on Sunday in France with David Barnea, the head of Israels Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel for talks centered on the hostage negotiations, according to three people familiar with the scheduled meeting who were not authorized to comment publicly. President Joe Biden on Friday spoke by phone with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatars ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani. Calls with both leaders focused on the hostage situation. Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza, the White House said in a statement about Bidens call with the Qatari leader. They underscored the urgency of the situation, and welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent discussions. Burns heads to France for the high-level talks after White House senior adviser Brett McGurk traveled to the Mideast this week for talks on the hostage situation. If Burns sees progress in his talks in France, Biden may dispatch McGurk back to the Mideast quickly to try to complete an agreement. McGurk during his talks this week was also laying the groundwork for another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The White House and CIA have yet to publicly confirm Burns meeting in France and administration officials have been guarded that a deal can quickly be brokered. We should not expect any imminent developments, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday. Biden and his aides are keenly aware that the mounting Palestinian death toll, and widespread suffering in Gaza, is frustrating some in his Democratic base, who want to see him put more pressure on Israel to end the war. Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Bidens handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could cost him enough support within the states sizable Arab American community to sway the outcome of the 2024 election in a state that could be key to whether he wins a second term. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to continue the offensive until complete victory over Hamas is achieved. Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure from the families of many hostages who are demanding a deal to win their loved ones release. The Oct. 7 attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, and Hamas and other militants abducted around 250 people. Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been confirmed dead. Hamas has previously said it will free more captives only in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "January 28, 2024 04:32 pm",
        "content": "The estate of George Carlin is suing the media company behind a fake hourlong comedy special that purportedly uses artificial intelligence to recreate the late standup comics style and material. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday asks that a judge order the podcast outlet Dudesy to immediately take down the audio special, George Carlin: Im Glad Im Dead, in which a synthesis of Carlin delivers commentary on current events. Carlin died in 2008. Carlins daughter, Kelly Carlin, said in a statement that the work is a poorly-executed facsimile cobbled together by unscrupulous individuals to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill my father established with his adoring fanbase. The Carlin estate and its executor, Jerold Hamza, are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges violations of Carlins right of publicity and copyright. The named defendants are Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen. None of the Defendants had permission to use Carlins likeness for the AI-generated George Carlin Special, nor did they have a license to use any of the late comedians copyrighted materials, the lawsuit says. The defendants have not filed a response to the lawsuit and it was not clear whether they have retained an attorney. They could not immediately be reached for comment. At the beginning of the special posted on YouTube on Jan. 9, a voiceover identifying itself as the AI engine used by Dudesy says it listened to the comics 50 years of material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. The plaintiffs say if that was in fact how it was created  and some listeners have doubted its stated origins  it means Carlins copyright was violated. The company, as it often does on similar projects, also released a podcast episode with Sasso and Kultgen introducing and commenting on the mock Carlin. What we just listened to, was that passable? Kultgen says in a section of the episode cited in the lawsuit. Yeah, that sounded exactly like George Carlin, Sasso responds. The lawsuit is among the first in what is likely to be an increasing number of major legal moves made to fight the regenerated use of celebrity images and likenesses. The AI issue was a major sticking point in the resolution of last years Hollywood writers and actors strikes. Josh Schiller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the case is not just about AI, its about the humans that use AI to violate the law, infringe on intellectual property rights, and flout common decency.

        "date": "January 28, 2024 10:08 pm",
        "content": "U.N. officials implored countries to reconsider a pause in funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinians on Sunday, vowing that any staff found to be involved in Hamas attack on Israel would be punished and warning that aid for some two million people in Gaza was at stake. At least nine countries, including top donors the U.S. and Germany, have paused funding for the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) following allegations by Israel that a dozen of its 13,000 staff in Gaza were involved in the Oct. 7 rampage. While I understand their concerns  I was myself horrified by these accusations - I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWAs operations, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday, vowing to hold to account any U.N. employee involved in acts of terror. He said this could include criminal prosecution - a rare move within the global body since most staff enjoy functional immunity, although Guterres has the power to waive it. Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, also urged countries to reconsider their decisions before UNRWA is forced to suspend its humanitarian response. A U.N. investigation into the Israeli allegations is currently underway. More than 26,000 people have been killed in Israels military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, the enclaves health ministry said. With flows of aid like food and medicine into the territory just a trickle of pre-conflict levels, deaths from preventable diseases as well as the risk of famine are growing, aid officials say. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel, most of Gazas 2.3 million people have become reliant on the aid UNRWA provides, including about one million who have fled Israeli bombardments sheltering in its facilities. Observers and aid workers said the move by donors would exacerbate hunger. Donors, do not starve children for the sins of a few individual aid workers, said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council. A U.N. appointed expert on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, warned that the funding cuts meant that famine was now inevitable in Gaza. Palestinians expressed anger at the funding cuts. We used to say Israel was launching a war of famine against us in parallel to its war of destruction, now those countries who suspended the aid to UNRWA declared themselves partners in this war, and collective punishment, said Yamen Hamad, who lives at an UNRWA-run school in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza Strip, after fleeing northern Gaza. LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said he was surprised by the move to pause UNRWA funding and said it would lead to more suffering for Palestinians. Is this action linked to the policy of collective punishment used against civilians in Gaza? These are questions we can continue to ask, he told a press conference. The Turkish Foreign Ministry also urged countries that had paused funding to reconsider their move. UNRWAs role has long been criticised by Israel which alleges it has supported Hamas for years - an allegation the agency denies. Israels Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Saturday called for agency to be replaced and urged more countries to cut funding. Deputy U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq declined to respond directly to Katzs remarks but said UNRWA overall had a strong record. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of leading an oppressive campaign against the agency. The campaign aims to liquidate the issue of Palestinian refugees..., he said in a statement. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the Israeli accusations against UNRWA were a challenge to the International Court of Justices decision on Friday that ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. Israel has not yet publicly given details of UNRWA staff members alleged involvement in the attack on Israel. Guterres said 12 staff members had been implicated and that nine had been terminated, one was dead and the identities of the other two were being clarified. There was no immediate sign of countries heeding the U.N. call to reinstate aid. However, Norway and Ireland said they would continue funding the agency. Israel has been strongly critical of the United Nations and in particular Guterres since early in the war. Israels then foreign minister Eli Cohen said on Nov. 14 that Guterres was not fit to head the organisation, saying he had not done enough to condemn Hamas and was too close to Iran. UNRWA was set up to help refugees of the 1948 war at Israels founding and provides education, health and aid services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Even before the conflict, UNRWA was struggling to secure funding and warned that it was on the verge of collapse. Many of its 13,000 staff members are refugees themselves and at least 150 have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "January 29, 2024 07:55 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Three U.S. service members were killed and dozens may be wounded after an unmanned aerial drone attack on U.S. forces stationed in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border, President Joe Biden and U.S. officials said on Sunday. Biden blamed Iran-backed groups for the attack, the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October and sent shock waves throughout the Middle East. While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq, Biden said in a statement. Have no doubt - we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing, he said. Biden later asked for a moment of silence for the three killed service members during a campaign event in South Carolina, adding, We shall respond. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin echoed that threat. He and other senior officials briefed Biden earlier in the day on the attack. At least 34 personnel were injured in the attack, but that number is expected to change as more people seek care, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. Eight personnel were evacuated from Jordan for higher level care, but are in stable condition. Two U.S. officials said the drone struck near the barracks early in the morning, which could explain the high number of casualties. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization of hardline Iran-backed militant groups, claimed attacks on three bases, including one on the Jordan-Syria border. The attack is a major escalation of the already tense situation in the Middle East, where war broke out in Gaza after Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 which killed 1,200. Israels subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 26,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. Since then, U.S. forces have come under attack more than 150 times by Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, causing at least 70 casualties prior to Sundays attack, most of them traumatic brain injuries. U.S. warships have also been fired at by Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, who are regularly attacking commercial ships passing through Red Sea waters off Yemens coast. While the United States has thus far maintained an official line that Washington is not at war in the region, it has been retaliating against the Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria and carrying out strikes against Yemens Houthi military capabilities. BIDEN PRESSURED ON IRAN Republican opponents of Biden seized on the attack as evidence of the Democratic presidents failure to confront Iran as its proxies strike against U.S. forces across the region. The only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation against Irans terrorist forces ... Anything less will confirm Joe Biden as a coward, said Republican Senator Tom Cotton in a statement. U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Bidens inaction was emboldening enemies of the United States in the Middle East. The time to start taking this aggression seriously was long before more brave Americans lost their lives, McConnell said. A senior official with the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, directly tied the attack to Israels campaign in Gaza. The killing of three American soldiers is a message to the U.S. administration that unless the killing of innocents in Gaza stops, it must confront the entire nation, he told Reuters. The continued American-Zionist aggression on Gaza is capable of exploding the situation in the region. The U.S. military said the attack occurred at a base in northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It did not name the base, but a person familiar with the matter identified it as Tower 22 in Jordan. U.S. military activity in Jordan can be a sensitive issue, particularly at a time of heightened tensions due to the Israel-Hamas conflict, because of increasing concern in Jordan about the war spreading. The Jordanian government said only that the attack occurred at an advanced post along its border with Syria. Late last year, Amman asked Washington to deploy Patriot air defense systems to bolster its border defense. It has requested more aid to tackle drones used in a raging multibillion-dollar drug war along the border with Syria, which Amman blames on pro-Iranian militias who hold sway in southern Syria. The kingdom has hundreds of U.S. trainers in the country and holds extensive exercises with U.S. troops throughout the year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 29, 2024 10:25 am",
        "content": "President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. shall respond after three American troops were killed and dozens more were injured in an overnight drone strike in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the first U.S. fatalities after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist churchs banquet hall. We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases, he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, and we shall respond. With an increasing risk of military escalation in the region, U.S. officials were working to conclusively identify the precise group responsible for the attack, but they have assessed that one of several Iranian-backed groups was behind it. Biden said in a written statement that the United States will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner (of) our choosing. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests. Iran-backed fighters in east Syria began evacuating their posts, fearing U.S. airstrikes, according to Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet. He told The Associated Press that the areas are the strongholds of Mayadeen and Boukamal. U.S. Central Command said at least 34 troops were injured by the one-way attack drone, with eight flown out of Jordan for follow-up care. It described the eight as being in stable condition. The large drone struck a logistics support base in Jordan known as Tower 22. It is along the Syrian border and is used largely by troops involved in the advise-and-assist mission for Jordanian forces. Central Command said approximately 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel were deployed to the base. The three who were killed and most of the wounded were Army soldiers, according to several U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to give details not yet made public. The small installation, which Jordan does not publicly disclose, includes U.S. engineering, aviation, logistics and security troops. Austin said the troops were deployed there to work for the lasting defeat of ISIS. Three officials said the drone struck near the troops sleeping quarters, which they said explained the high casualty count. The U.S. military base at al-Tanf in Syria is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Tower 22. The Jordanian installation provides a critical logistical hub for U.S. forces in Syria, including those at al-Tanf, which is near where the borders of Iraq, Syria and Jordan intersect. In a statement on Jordans state-run Petra news agency, the country condemned the terrorist attack that targeted the U.S. troops. That report described the drone strike as targeting an outpost on the border with Syria and said it did not wound any Jordanian troops. Jordan will continue to counter terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and weapons across the Syrian border into Jordan, and will confront with firmness and determination anyone who attempts to attack the security of the kingdom, the statement attributed to Muhannad Mubaidin, a government spokesman, said. U.S. troops long have used Jordan, a kingdom bordering Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian territory of the West Bank, Saudi Arabia and Syria, as a basing point. Some 3,000 American troops typically are stationed across Jordan. Since the war in Gaza began Oct. 7, Iranian-backed militias have struck American military installations in Iraq more than 60 times and in Syria more than 90 times, with a mix of drones, rockets, mortars and ballistic missiles. The attack Sunday was the first targeting American troops in Jordan during the Israel-Hamas war and the first to result in the loss of American lives. Scores of U.S. personnel have been wounded, including some with traumatic brain injuries, during the attacks. The militias have said that their strikes are in retaliation for Washingtons support for Israel in the war in Gaza and that they aim to push U.S. forces out of the region. The U.S. in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iran-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea. I am confident the Biden Administration will respond in a deliberate and proportional manner, said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. Republicans in Congress said the administrations approach had failed to deter Americas adversaries in the region. We need a major reset of our Middle East policy to protect our national security interests, said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., went further, urging the administration to strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces, but as deterrence against future aggression. The only thing the Iranian regime understands is force. Biden, who was in Columbia, South Carolina, on Sunday, was briefed in the morning by Austin, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. In the afternoon, he met virtually with Vice President Kamala Harris and his national security team for an update. The president, in the written statement, called it a despicable and wholly unjust attack and said the service members were risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism. It is a fight we will not cease. Syria is still in the midst of a civil war and long has been a launch pad for Iranian-backed forces there, including the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Iraq has multiple Iranian-backed Shiite militias operating there as well. Jordan, a staunch Western ally and a crucial power in Jerusalem for its oversight of holy sites there, is suspected of launching airstrikes in Syria to disrupt drug smugglers, including one that killed nine people earlier this month. An umbrella group for Iran-backed factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq earlier claimed launching explosive drone attacks targeting three areas in Syria, as well as one inside of occupied Palestine. The group has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks against bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began. Three officials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with journalists, said the drone attack against the base in Jordan was launched by one of the Iraqi groups. No faction has yet officially claimed responsibility. Officials said the U.S. military is not tracking any other attacks on its forces Sunday in the region. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "January 29, 2024 02:04 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas diplomats are talking with Somali authorities trying to ascertain the whereabouts of a fishing vessel and its six crewmembers suspected of being abducted by Somali pirates two days ago, officials said on January 29. The apparent abduction came two weeks after Sri Lanka said it would join a U.S.-led operation to protect merchant vessels sailing in the Red Sea against attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels. Other suspected hijackings in waters off Somalia have raised concern that Somali pirates have resumed activity, a decade after they caused chaos in international shipping. The hijacking of the Sri Lankan vessel occurred in international waters about 840 nautical miles (1,555 km) east of Somalia, 1,100 nautical miles (2,040 km) from Sri Lanka and north of Seychelles, according to Sri Lankan navy spokesman Capt. Gayan Wickramasuriya. So far, we have no communication with them or no details on the whereabout of them, he said. The Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said it was working to obtain the release of the fishermen. Sri Lanka ambassadors in the African region have already established contacts with Somalian authorities to get the fishermen and trawler released as soon as possible, Ministry spokesman Niluka Kadurugamuwa said. On Saturday, an armed group arrived in an area where about 30 Sri Lankan vessels were fishing. Two to three armed men who had arrived in a 23-metre (75-foot) vessel boarded the fishing trawler, fired shots apparently to warn away the other fishing boats and took away the fishing trawler and the fishermen, said Susantha Kahawatta, a top official in the Fisheries Department, adding that all the details of the abduction were provided by fishermen in the other trawlers. The other fishermen identified the attackers as Somali. Sri Lankas navy said two weeks ago it would provide a ship to protect merchant ship traffic, but the date hasnt been set and the area Sri Lanka will patrol isnt finalised.

        "content": "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has stated that the government has no intentions to implement any new indirect taxes that would escalate the prices of goods. Speaking to the media in Kegalle on Monday (29 Jan.), Siyambalapitiya further assured that the state has no intention to further increase the current tax percentages, and is instead focused on increasing state revenue. Commenting further in this regard, the State Minister explained that the cost of goods will not increase as a result of a hike in indirect taxes any longer, and instead, will likely be affected by factors such as the demand and supply of goods. We are working in a manner to increase state revenue, and resultantly reduce the percentage of indirect taxes, so that we can reduce the burden on the people, Siyambalapitiya said. The State Minister also noted that a new property tax is slated to be introduced in 2025. While the relevant tax is being imposed in accordance with the recommendations made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Siyamabalapitiya assured that the tax would be a progressive tax, expected to be levied on those who own large amounts of property.",

        "date": "January 29, 2024 07:20 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations highest court will rule on Friday whether it will hear a case in which Ukraine has accused Russia of violating international law by saying its invasion was launched to stop an alleged genocide. Ukraine brought the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. In hearings in September, lawyers for Moscow urged judges to throw out the case, saying Kyivs legal arguments were flawed. The ICJ on Monday said a ruling on Russias objections to the courts jurisdiction will be handed down on Friday. Kyiv says Russia is breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention by saying the invasion was justified to stop an alleged genocide of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine says there was no risk of genocide in eastern Ukraine, where it had been fighting Russian-backed forces since 2014. Moscow has said Ukraine is using the case as a roundabout way to get a ruling on the overall legality of Russias military action. The same court on Friday ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide as it wages war against Hamas militants in Gaza, and do more to help civilians. It stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire as requested by South Africa. The court did not rule on the core of the case - whether genocide has occurred in Gaza. But it recognised the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide. If the ICJ does decide the Ukraine-Russia case can move forward, it could take many months before hearings on the merits are scheduled. On Wednesday, the ICJ will rule in another case brought by Ukraine against Russia in which it accused Moscow of violating U.N. anti-terrorism and anti-discrimination treaties in relation to the downing of flight MH17 in July 2014. Russian has denied involvement in the incident. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "Country is self-sufficient in rice, no rice imports expected in 2024  Minister",
        "date": "January 29, 2024 09:00 pm",
        "content": "In a significant milestone for Sri Lankas agricultural sector, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera has announced that the country is now self-sufficient in rice production. This means that Sri Lanka is not expected to import any rice in 2024, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. This achievement is the result of years of dedicated efforts by farmers and government initiatives to boost domestic rice production. It not only bodes well for the nations food security but also represents a critical step towards reducing reliance on foreign imports and strengthening the agricultural sector. The Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry, Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera mentioned this while joining a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country today (29). Minister Amaraweera announced a renewed focus on supporting Sri Lankas agricultural and plantation sectors in 2023. His ministry implemented targeted programs aimed at boosting both industries. One key initiative was a substantial financial investment in fertilizer subsidies. During the Yala and Maha seasons, Rs. 22 billion were allocated to ensure access and affordability for farmers. Additionally, the government committed Rs. 13 billion to directly purchase paddy from farmers, providing valuable income and market stability. This dedication paid off. Unlike 2022, when 08 metric tons of rice was imported, Sri Lanka achieved self-sufficiency in 2023. The people of the country consumed rice grown entirely by Sri Lankan farmers throughout the year. This remarkable achievement, against the backdrop of economic challenges, underscores the resilience and success of the governments agricultural development efforts. Minister Amaraweera highlighted the significant investments made in 2023 to revitalize Sri Lankas agricultural and plantation sectors. The success of these programs, particularly in achieving rice self-sufficiency, demonstrates the importance of targeted support for farmers and the potential for further growth in these vital industries. Echoing the devastation of the previous year, paddy cultivation once again fell victim to both drought and torrential downpours. A staggering 65,000 acres succumbed to the parched earth, while another 100,000 acres drowned under relentless floods. Recognizing the farmers plight, the government allocated Rs. One billion to compensate for drought-related losses, with 700 million already distributed. However, the fate of flood-damaged farmers remains uncertain, casting a shadow over their livelihoods and raising concerns about the future of this vital crop. The recent surge in vegetable prices has been a major concern for Sri Lankans. This increase was primarily driven by the destruction of large-scale vegetable crops due to heavy rains. Farmers faced the unfortunate situation of replanting their seeds multiple times, only to see them washed away by the downpours. However, there is a glimmer of hope. By providing farmers with net houses, the government has enabled them to cultivate vegetables in a more protected environment, ensuring some level of supply to the market. This initiative, while not a complete solution, has certainly helped mitigate the impact of the heavy rains. Looking ahead, the next two months offer some promise of relief. With the rainy season expected to subside, vegetable prices are anticipated to return to normal levels. This will undoubtedly bring much-needed respite to both consumers and farmers. Meanwhile, the government has set its sights on boosting national food security through targeted crop production. In 2024, four key crops  paddy, maize, potato, and chilli  have been prioritized to meet specific national goals. This focus on these crops does not, however, signify neglect of other crops. One interesting development is the renewed focus on red onion cultivation. The popularity of this variety had waned in recent years, partly due to the rise of B onions. To address this, the government is implementing initiatives to promote red onion production in specific regions such as Monaragala Thelulla, Jaffna, and Kurunegala Moragollagama and Niandagama. This renewed focus on red onions aims to diversify Sri Lankas agricultural landscape and ensure a more balanced supply of essential vegetables. The Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has embarked on a series of crucial initiatives this year, aiming to bolster the quality and yield of the countrys key plantation crops  tea, rubber, and coconut. These efforts mark a significant departure from past approaches and hold immense promise for the future of Sri Lankas plantation sector. Spearheading these endeavours is the B60 policy, implemented on 01st of January 2024. This targeted initiative focuses on enhancing the quality of tea leaves, a vital aspect of ensuring Sri Lankas tea maintains its global reputation for excellence. Furthermore, the Ministry has launched a program to provide subsidized fertilizers to tea, rubber, and coconut plantations. This program leverages the expertise of Sri Lankas two government-owned fertilizer companies, the Commercial Fertilizer Company and Lanka Fertilizer Company. Notably, a special subsidized fertilizer blend specifically formulated for tea cultivation was also introduced today, marking a dedication to tailoring solutions to the unique needs of each crop. Finally, recognizing the critical role of fertilizer in maximizing tea yields, the Ministry has taken decisive steps to ensure domestic production of all tea fertilizers. This move empowers Sri Lanka to control the quality and availability of these essential inputs, paving the way for greater stability and growth in the tea cultivation sector. In an effort to revitalize Sri Lankas tea industry, the government is making premium tea fertilizer more accessible to growers. Both the Colombo Commercial Fertilizer Company and the Ceylon Fertilizer Company, owned by the government, are producing high-quality fertilizers specifically for tea cultivation. To support growers, these fertilizers are being offered at a significantly reduced price  nearly 50 less than the market price, or at least Rs. 2000 less than the price with VAT. This price reduction applies to both T-200 and T-750 fertilizers, available for Rs. 5500 per bundle, and U-709 and U-834 fertilizers, priced at Rs. 7735 per bundle. This initiative goes beyond just making fertilizer more affordable. The government is also actively promoting new cultivation technologies alongside proper fertilizer application. One such technology is the high-density cultivation system. With 59 successful projects already implemented, this approach has proven demonstrably effective, yielding an impressive 1350 kg of tea leaves per acre per month. The government remains committed to supporting tea growers, allocating Rs. 1000 million this year to further bolster the high-density cultivation initiative. Through these combined efforts, Sri Lankas tea industry is poised for renewed growth and success. A significant step towards boosting Sri Lankas tea production was taken today with the signing of a tripartite agreement. The Sri Lanka Tea Board and Small Tea Estate Development Authority joined hands with two state-owned fertilizer companies to provide subsidized tea fertilizer. This initiative is expected to be a major boon for tea growers, lowering their input costs and facilitating increased yields. Credit for this crucial program goes to the visionary leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The strategic merger of the Ministry of Plantation Industries with the Ministry of Agriculture in 2023 paved the way for this collaborative effort, demonstrating the power of unified action in driving national progress. This agreement marks a promising chapter in Sri Lankas journey to enhance its tea cultivation and secure a stronger position in the global market.",

        "title": "Document spells out allegations against 12 UN employees Israel says participated in Hamas attack",
        "date": "January 29, 2024 09:03 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli document obtained Monday spelled out allegations against a dozen U.N. employees the country says participated in Hamas Oct. 7 assault  claiming seven stormed into Israeli territory, including two who participated in kidnappings. The allegations against staffers with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees prompted Western countries to freeze funds vital for the body, which is a lifeline for desperate Palestinians in Gaza. The U.N. fired nine of the 12 accused workers and condemned the abhorrent alleged acts of staff members. The accusations come after years of tensions between Israel and the agency known as UNRWA over its work in Gaza, where it employs roughly 13,000 people. Despite the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the besieged territory  where Israels war against Hamas has displaced the vast majority of the population and officials say a quarter of Palestinians are starving  major donors, including the U.S. and Britain, have cut funding. On Monday, Japan and Austria joined them in pausing assistance. With the majority of its budget in doubt, UNRWA says it will be forced to halt operations within weeks if funding isnt restored. The threat to the U.N. agency came as Israel said cease-fire talks held Sunday were constructive but that significant gaps remained in any potential agreement. The talks are meant to bring about some respite to war-torn Gaza and secure the release of more than 100 hostages still held in the territory. Fighting continued, further complicating assistance to war-weary people in Gaza. Israel issued an evacuation order to residents in the western part of Gaza City, urging them to head south. The order indicated that battles are still being waged in northern Gaza, an area Israel pummeled in the first weeks of the war and where it had previously said it held military control. The war was sparked with Hamas Oct. 7 attack which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people taken captive, according to Israeli authorities. The attack set off an intense air, sea and ground offensive that has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, most of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The war has also threatened to set off a wider regional conflict, with the U.S. announcing three of its troops killed in a strike blamed on Iran-backed militias in Jordan. UNRWA WORKERS The Israeli document, which has been shared with U.S. officials and was obtained by The Associated Press, lists 12 people, their alleged roles in the attack, job descriptions and photos. The document said intelligence gathered showed that at least 190 UNRWA workers were Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing evidence. It said of the 12 workers, nine were teachers and one a social worker. Seven of the employees were accused of crossing into Israel on Oct. 7. Of those, two were alleged to have kidnapped or assisted in the abduction of Israelis and another two were said to have participated in raids on communal farming villages, according to the document. One was accused of arming himself with an anti-tank missile the night before the attack, while the document claimed another took photos of a female hostage. Some were accused of participating in a terror activity or coordinating the movement of trucks or weapons used in the attack. Ten were listed as having ties to Hamas and one to the Islamic Jihad militant group. The names and photos of the accused workers could not immediately be verified. Two of the 12 have been killed, according to the document. The U.N. previously said one was still being identified. The allegations have stoked longstanding tensions between Israel and UNRWA. Israel says Hamas uses the agencys facilities to store weapons or launch attacks from. UNRWA says it does not knowingly tolerate such behavior and has internal safeguards to prevent abuses and discipline any wrongdoing. The agencys commissioner, Philippe Lazzarini, recently announced that he was ordering an external review of the agencys operations and its safeguards. Israel has long been critical of the agency and accuses it of helping to perpetuate the 76-year-old Palestinian refugee crisis. UNRWA says it cares for the vast needs of millions of Palestinians across the Middle East that have been sharply exacerbated by the latest war. CALL TO RESUME FUNDING The U.N. says the entire agency should not be penalized by the alleged actions of the dozen workers, who it says will be held accountable if true. It has called for the donors to resume funding. The United States, the agencys largest donor, cut funding over the weekend, followed by several other countries. Together, they provided more than 60 of UNRWAs budget in 2022. UNRWA provides basic services for Palestinian families who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding the countrys creation. The refugees and their descendants are the majority of Gazas population. Since the war began, most of the territorys 2.3 million people depend on the agencys programs for sheer survival, including food and shelter, Lazzarini said. A quarter of Gazas population is facing starvation as fighting and Israeli restrictions hinder the delivery of aid, which has been well below the daily average of 500 trucks before the war. Communications Director Juliette Touma warned that the agency would be forced to stop its support in Gaza by the end of February. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas new transitional justice process lacks credibility  HRW",
        "date": "January 29, 2024 10:22 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments proposed law to create another body to investigate wartime abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lankas international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday (29 Jan.). In a statement, the Human Rights Watch claimed that Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended. The Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill was published on January 1, 2024, following limited consultations in 2023 and government pledges to investigate human rights violations and war crimes committed during the 1983-2009 civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and in its aftermath. It excludes widespread abuses committed during the left-wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprising of 1988-1990. Instead of providing truth, justice and redress, the proposed law appears designed to deflect international pressure over the lack of accountability for atrocity crimes and to persuade the United Nations Human Rights Council to end its scrutiny of Sri Lanka. A credible truth and justice process is desperately needed in Sri Lanka, where wartime abuses resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and enforced disappearances, said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. However, the governments continuing repression of victim communities and its protection of alleged perpetrators shows a lack of will to deliver justice, ensuring that this commission will fare no better than previous ones. The bill states that the new commission would produce a truthful record of violations committed during the war, make recommendations on reparations, and propose measures to prevent a recurrence. While the commission would also be able to refer matters to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities  for further investigation and necessary action, those authorities are already supposed to take up such cases, but routinely fail to do so. Successive Sri Lankan governments have blocked investigations, stalled trials, and silenced victims, in violation of international legal obligations to prosecute or extradite people responsible for serious crimes. Since the 1990s, the government has created at least 10 similar commissions, at leave five of which have concluded reports. Many victims say they have commission fatigue and see no use in testifying again, risking re-traumatization and possible threats from the security forces with no expectation of justice and redress. In 2023, after the government announced its plans to establish a new commission, numerous organizations representing conflict victims and civil society groupsespecially in the most conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provincesjoined four separate joint statements rejecting the governments approach and instead said it should act upon the work of previous commissions, while building confidence by ending ongoing abuses. The current government, like its predecessors, has a record of making human rights pledges to deflect international pressure while continuing abuses and blocking meaningful reform and accountability. Many victims see the proposed commission as an attempt to persuade UN Human Rights Council member countries to end the councils scrutiny, a view supported by statements from President Ranil Wickremesinghes office. The proposed commission resembles the 2010-2011 Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. After this commission failed to achieve its stated objectives, the Human Rights Council in 2015 passed the first of a series of important resolutions to advance accountability for atrocity crimes committed in Sri Lanka. From 2015 to 2020, when Wickremesinghe was prime minister, the Human Rights Council adopted resolutions with the endorsement of Sri Lanka that envisaged a hybrid justice mechanism including both foreign and Sri Lankan staff. In 2021, after a new Sri Lankan government repudiated this process, the council established an international evidence-gathering project to support possible future prosecutions abroad. Meanwhile, the current government has continued to repress fundamental rights. In January 2024, the government presented two bills in parliament that threaten the right to freedom of expression. According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Anti-Terrorism Bill, to replace a law that has long been used to target minorities and perceived government opponents, grants wide powers to the police  and to the military  to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight. The Online Safety Bill, adopted by parliament on January 24, will give authorities unfettered discretion to label and restrict expressions they disagree with as false statements, the high commissioners office said. New speech-related offenses carry lengthy prison terms. The government has also continued to target those campaigning for truth and accountability. On January 5, the authorities arrested and detained Sivananthan Jenita and Meera Jasmine Charlesnise, who have campaigned for years seeking answers after the enforced disappearance of their relatives for protesting against President Wickremesinghe during his visit to the north. In December, nine ethnic Tamils were held under anti-terrorism legislation for commemorating war dead. Government agencies continue to appropriate Hindu and Muslim religious sites and lands occupied by Tamil and Muslim communities on a variety of pretexts, in some cases to convert the sites into Buddhist temples or transfer them to members of the majority community. These actions violate the right to freedom of religion or belief and are in direct opposition to the governments purported goals of promoting reconciliation and addressing the causes of conflict, Human Rights Watch said. The new commissions proposed mandate would overlap in ill-defined ways with existing but nonperforming agencies, including the Office of Reparations, established in 2018, and the Office of Missing Persons, established in 2017. On January 9, Sri Lankas parliament passed legislation to formalize yet another institution with an ostensibly similar purpose, the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, which was created in 2015. Concerned governments should decline to fund or endorse the new Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, because it would not uphold Sri Lankas international obligations to address impunity or provide redress and does not have the support of victims and affected communities. Instead, they should work to ensure that the Human Rights Council mandate is renewed and enhanced to pursue accountability for past crimes and help end ongoing abuses. The actions of President Wickremesinghes government to silence dissent, protect and promote alleged rights abusers, and discriminate against minority communities give no grounds to believe that the latest reconciliation plan will turn out differently from past commissions, Ganguly said. The government should start dealing with the past in good faith, by using the evidence already collected to advance accountability and stop persecuting victims and their families who demand justice.",

Although the President had promised to hold talks with them regarding the allowances, soon after returning from his recent official overseas tour, the health workers said they have yet to meet with the Head of State for discussions. Meanwhile, a series of protests is planned to be staged in front of hospitals in and around Colombo today. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers approved President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Since then, the trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers have launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the governments decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees. On January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. This prompted the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, the planned trade union action was later called off after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.",

Attorney-at-Law Chamari Priyanka made these remarks while speaking to the media after visiting the bereaved family of the late lawmakers security officer who died in the fatal expressway accident on January 25. State Minister Sanath Nishantha and Constable Anuradha Jayakody suffered tragic deaths in a crash which took place in the early hours of January 25 on the Colombo - Katunayake expressway. Although the duo had been rushed to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama, both were pronounced dead shortly after. The driver of the vehicle, however, survived the accident. Speaking further, Priyanka said: My husband did a great service to the Puttalam District as well as to the people of the country. No one, who sought help from him, was ever sent away empty-handed. Neither I nor my children can wrap our heads around the fact that he is no longer here. It feels like a dream. Referring to certain media reports, Priyanka said she still has not made any official statement about entering politics. She said despite serving as her late husbands personal secretary and managing his political affairs, she had no intention of embarking on politics back then. I still have no such intention. However, if the people of the Puttalam District, the people of the country and the party leadership request me to fill the void left by my husband and take charge in his place, I might consider it. I now have a huge responsibility regarding the future of my four children. Addressing the criticisms, the widowed wife of the State Minister said he was a politician in the truest sense of the word and a person who dedicated himself to the well-being of the people.",

It said the party would challenge the decision and called it a sham case. We dont accept this illegal decision, Khans lawyer Naeem Panjutha posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. It is the second conviction for the embattled former cricket star in recent months. He was previously sentenced to three years in a corruption case. While his jail term was suspended as he challenged the corruption conviction, it had already ruled him out of the countrys general elections next week. Despite being ruled out of the election, Khans legal team was hoping to get him released from jail, where he has been since August last year away from the public eye. The latest conviction means that is unlikely even as the charges are contested in a higher court. Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no confidence in 2022. Khan says the cable was proof of a conspiracy by the Pakistani military and U.S. government to topple his government in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russias invasion of Ukraine. Washington and the Pakistan military deny the accusations. The former prime minister has previously said the contents of the cable appeared in the media from other sources.

        "title": "Elon Musks Neuralink implants brain chip in first human",
        "date": "January 30, 2024 02:13 pm",
        "content": "The first human patient has received an implant from brain-chip startup Neuralink on Sunday and is recovering well, the companys billionaire founder Elon Musk said. Initial results show promising neuron spike detection, Musk said in a post on the social media platform X on Monday. Spikes are activity by neurons, which the National Institute of Health describes as cells that use electrical and chemical signals to send information around the brain and to the body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had given the company clearance last year to conduct its first trial to test its implant on humans, a critical milestone in the startups ambitions to help patients overcome paralysis and a host of neurological conditions. In September, Neuralink said it received approval for recruitment for the human trial. The study uses a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface (BCI) implant in a region of the brain that controls the intention to move, Neuralink said previously, adding that its initial goal is to enable people to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone. The implants ultra-fine threads help transmit signals in participants brains, Neuralink has said. The first product from Neuralink would be called Telepathy, Musk said in a separate post on X. The startups PRIME Study is a trial for its wireless brain-computer interface to evaluate the safety of the implant and surgical robot. Neuralink did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details. The company has faced calls for scrutiny regarding its safety protocols. Reuters reported earlier this month that the company was fined for violating U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) rules regarding the movement of hazardous materials. The company was valued at about 5 billion last June, but four lawmakers in late November asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Musk had misled investors about the safety of its technology after veterinary records showed problems with the implants on monkeys included paralysis, seizures and brain swelling. Musk wrote in a social media post on Sept. 10 that no monkey has died as a result of a Neuralink implant. He added that the company chose terminal monkeys to minimize risk to healthy ones.
