        "content": "A female non-academic staff member of a government school has been arrested for the possession of 210 grams of heroin. The suspect was arrested by officers of the Matara Crime Division near the Bodhimaluwa Temple in the Weligama Police Division last evening (15). The arrestee is a 43-year-old resident of the Denipitiya area. Police stated that she is employed as a non-academic staff member of a government school in the Ayagama area and had been involved in distributing drugs for an organized crime and a drug trafficker in the Midigama area. The investigations have revealed that the suspect had only recently started trafficking drugs and was distributing them to individuals as directed by drug traffickers hiding overseas and handling the drug networks. The individuals who received the drugs from her were also allegedly involved in smaller-scale drug rackets. Police stated that the suspect had been tasked with keeping a larger quantity of drugs provided to her and then distribute them among the people who are named by the drug traffickers residing abroad, in the required quantities. However, police said that despite the suspect being employed at a school, there is no evidence to suggest she had utilized the school with regard to these illegal activities, and that she has not directly sold any drugs to addicts. The Matara Crimes Division (MCD) and Weligama Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.",

        "date": "July 16, 2024 03:52 pm",
        "content": "Since Friday, nine butchered bodies trussed up in plastic bags have been hauled from the site of an abandoned quarry in the Mukuru slum, a gruesome discovery that has horrified the nation. Acting Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja said the 33-year-old suspect, named as Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, was arrested at around 3:00am (0000 GMT) near a Nairobi bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football final. We are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Mohamed Amin told reporters. We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath. Amin said Khalusha claimed the murders took place between 2022 and July 11 this year. The suspect confessed to have lured, killed and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, he added. Unfortunately, and this is very sad, the suspect alleged that his first victim was his wife who he strangled to death, before dismembering her body and disposing it at the same site. Police said Khalusha would appear in court Tuesday. Luring another victim The suspect was tracked down after analysis of one of the victims mobile phones, Amin said, in a joint operation by the DCI and the National Police Service. As officers swooped, he was in the process of luring another victim, Amin said. Khalusha had confessed to having had carnal knowledge with some of his victims, he added. Officers searched his one-room house, located just 100 metres (300 feet) from where the bodies were found, discovering a machete, nylon sacks, rope, a pair of industrial rubber gloves  as well as a pink female handbag, and two female panties. The areas will remain active crime scenes, Amin said, promising a thorough investigation. Nine mutilated and dismembered bodies have so far been retrieved from the crime scene, according to police, with Kanja saying autopsies on the victims would be carried out on Monday. Eight have been confirmed to be female. A second suspect who was caught with a phone belonging to one of the victims has also been arrested, Amin said. Police under spotlight The dumped bodies have thrown yet another spotlight on Kenyan police and added more pressure on President William Ruto, who is struggling to contain a crisis over widespread anti-government protests that saw dozens of demonstrators killed. Kenyas police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), said on Friday it was looking into whether there was any police involvement in the bodies found in the dump, noting the dumpsite was just 100 metres from a police station.

The American artist, 22, who recently released her third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, said she loved bedtime stories herself when she was a child. Eilish introduces the story by saying that as well as loving music, she also loves nature. She tells the tale of a young boy called Wilfred who says he owns a big moose called Marcel. Speaking about the story, the What Was I Made For singer said: We need to look after beautiful, wild creatures like Marcel, but we also need to let them do their own thing. She added: My favourite thing in the world as a child was a bedtime story and I would be upset if I didnt get one! I had a lot and I loved them all! Jeffers said he was excited to hear Eilish will read his book later this week. Speaking to BBC Threes The Catch Up, he said: This book is about our relationship with nature in some ways and Billie is a champion of that. He added: Were big fans of Eilish in our house and so the kids were very excited to see if shell read it better than I do, before going on to suggest that she probably will. Eilish was just 14 when she unveiled her debut single Ocean Eyes. Since then, she has shot to worldwide stardom, scooping up multiple awards along the way. Earlier this year, she and her brother and collaborator Finneas OConnell won the Oscar for Best Song with What Was I Made For?, which they penned for the Barbie soundtrack. Critics were very upbeat about Eilishs surprising and intimate new album, which was released in May. At the time, the star wrote on Instagram that she and her brother had put so much into this album and have never ever ever loved something more. Other music stars to have read a CBeebies bedtime story include Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Gregory Porter, Dave Grohl, Dolly Parton, and Christine and the Queens.

        "content": "Disney has confirmed it is investigating an apparent leak of internal messages by a hacking group, which claims it is protecting artists rights. The group, Nullbulge, said it had gained access to thousands of communications from Disney employees and had downloaded every file possible. It is not clear how commercially sensitive the information is for the media and theme park giant, but it is reported to include messages about upcoming projects the firm is working on. Disney is investigating this matter, a company spokesperson told the BBC in an email. Nullbulges website says the group targets anyone it believes is harming the creative industry by using content generated by artificial intelligence (AI), which it describes as theft. The BBC has made contact with the hackers who claim to be in Russia and say they got into Disneys internal Slack messaging system through an insider. But when asked for a sample of the stolen data to verify its authenticity, the hackers did not respond - meaning the BBC has not been able to independently assess if the huge data trove is genuine. Disney was our target due to how it handles artist contracts, its approach to AI, and its pretty blatant disregard for the consumer, the hackers claimed. They said they released the data because they didnt expect Disney to meet their demands to stop using AI. It is unusual for hackers to claim they are Russian hacktivists with an ethical agenda - most cyber criminals, including those in Russia, aim to make money by extorting their victims.

        "title": "Power Minister reveals key factors that contributed to reduction in electricity tariffs",
        "date": "July 16, 2024 10:03 pm",
        "content": "The Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera highlighted that following the revision of electricity tariffs, there is potential for a reduction of approximately 20 in the prices of goods and services in the market. The Minister further urged the business community to alleviate the burden on the public by lowering prices, starting from midnight on the day of the electricity tariff adjustment, coinciding with the reduction in electricity bills. Addressing the press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidents Media Centre (PMC) today (16), Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera emphasized that those consuming less than 90 units have benefited the most from the recent electricity amendment, receiving significant relief. The Minister further elaborated.. The government has decided to revise the electricity tariff every January, April, July, and October each year. Following the tariff adjustment in March, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) requested a July revision instead of April. Therefore, the new electricity tariff revision will take effect from July 16. The next revision is scheduled for October. Amid the economic crisis of 2022, bank interest rates soared to 36. Escalating prices of coal, fuel, and other commodities due to the Russian-Ukrainian war also contributed to the need for an electricity price revision, the first since 2014, which took place in August 2022. However, this time, there are several key factors contributing to a 22.5 reduction in electricity prices. Notably, there has been significant improvement in the economic situation. Additionally, over the past two years, there has been an increase in rainfall, leading to higher hydropower generation. Renewable energy production has also seen a rise. In April, electricity from the Uma Oya hydropower plant was integrated into the national grid. Over the last 18 months, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has diligently worked to reduce operational costs. No new employees have been hired, reducing the workforce from 26,000 to 22,000 employees. This tariff revision has provided the most relief to consumers using less than 90 units of electricity, particularly benefiting the 79 of households in this category. During the peak of electricity billing, the production cost per unit was approximately Rs.48.00, which has now decreased to Rs.35.00. A reduction of 25-26 in electricity tariffs has been granted to hotels and industries, while religious institutions have seen a 30 decrease across their entire category. Looking ahead, the key to further reducing electricity tariffs lies in lowering generation costs, which necessitates the rapid establishment of cost-effective power plants. These new facilities are projected to be operational within the next three years, promising additional reductions in electricity charges thereafter. Currently, there are only 189,000 consumers using more than 180 units of electricity. For those consuming 30 units, the bill amounts to just Rs.290.00, while those using between 1 and 60 units pay around Rs.790.00. There has been a significant 20 tariff reduction for factories and small businesses in this electricity tariff revision. Despite this reduction, it appears unlikely that the prices of goods and services, which typically rise on the same night as electricity price hikes, will decrease accordingly. Recently, fuel and kerosene prices have also dropped without leading to lower consumer prices. Therefore, with the substantial decrease in electricity costs this year, we urge the public to take advantage of these savings, with potential for at least a 20 reduction in overall expenses. During previous electricity tariff increases, media reports often compared our tariffs with those of neighbouring countries in the region. I encourage the media to now initiate discussions on how this reduction compares with regional electricity tariffs and emphasize the continuity of electricity supply. Some media and journalists have speculated that this tariff revision was timed due to upcoming elections. However, these policies were formulated back in 2022 through a formal process, resulting from sound policy decisions rather than populist measures. Therefore, I kindly request equal recognition and acknowledgment for the President and the government when electricity tariffs are reduced. In the future, we are focusing on implementing an electricity generation plan that emphasizes efficiency and low operating costs. Prior to 2022, the power sector consistently operated at a loss. However, we have achieved operating profits in both 2023 and 2024. Due to our agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), funding for the CEB from the Treasury has ceased since August of last year. Despite this, through stringent financial discipline, we have successfully steered the CEB into a profitable position. Significant efforts have also been made to repay a substantial portion of the CEBs debts to other institutions. Moreover, the government has actively promoted the installation of solar panels to bolster renewable energy adoption. A plan was devised for rooftop solar panels to contribute 150 megawatts annually to the national grid. Thus far, these installations have added 149 megawatts per year to our national grid. --PMD",

        "content": "At least 25 people were killed and 17 injured in Peru on Tuesday after a bus crashed while traveling through a mountainous area, according to Ayacuchos regional health department. The bus skidded off a highway in Perus Andean Ayacucho region at dawn, overturning and plummeting down a slope of about 200 meters, Jhonny Rolando Valderrama, head of the highway protection division, told state news agency Andina. Valderrama said the accident occurred on the Los Libertadores highway in Ayacucho in the south-central Andes and that rescue work was ongoing. By early afternoon, a top police officer said early information indicated there were 42 passengers in the bus. Perus ground transportation superintendent SUTRAN said in a statement the bus belongs to local company Turismo Molina Union SAC and that it has initiated an investigation. Company representatives did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Deadly bus accidents are common in Peru, where many buses travel on precarious mountain roads or are driven by inadequately trained drivers. At least 25 people died in April when a bus fell into a river in Perus northern Cajamarca region, while last September at least 24 people died in a similar accident in the Anco region.

        "date": "July 17, 2024 01:10 pm",
        "content": "Bangladesh announced it will indefinitely shut down all public and private universities from Wednesday after protests by students against a quota system for government jobs turned deadly this week, leaving at least six people dead and scores injured. The South Asian nation has been rocked by protests for weeks over public sector job quotas, which include a 30 reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan. It has sparked anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people. Demonstrations intensified after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina refused to meet the protesters demands, citing ongoing court proceedings, and labelled those opposing the quota as razakar - a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war. The protests turned violent this week when thousands of anti-quota protesters clashed with members of the student wing of the ruling Awami League party across the country. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesters. Six people, including at least three students, were killed during the clashes on Tuesday, police said. We urgently call on the Government of Bangladesh to immediately guarantee the safety of all peaceful protesters and proper treatment of all those injured, Amnesty International said in a post on X. Authorities have deployed riot police, along with the Border Guard Bangladesh paramilitary force, at university campuses across the country to maintain law and order. Late on Tuesday, the University Grants Commission ordered all universities to shut down and instructed students to vacate the premises immediately for security reasons. High schools, colleges and other educational institutions were also shut. Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests, said students will hold processions on Wednesday carrying coffins in solidarity with those that lost their lives. Many have left the dormitories out of fear due to attacks by cadres of the student league (the student wing of the ruling party), said a female student of Dhaka University, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. Still, many students remain, especially in the mens dormitories. Those of us currently staying in the dorms are not leaving easily. Police raided the headquarters of the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in Dhaka around midnight on Tuesday and arrested seven activists, including a former leader of its student wing. Harun Or Rashid, the head of polices detective branch, said they recovered 100 crude bombs and several bottles of petrol during the raid that was conducted after a bus was set on fire near the BNP office. Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, the senior joint secretary of BNP, condemned the raid and said the government planted the recovered items to discredit the anti-quota protests. The protests are the first significant challenge to Hasinas government since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by the BNP. Experts attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making government jobs, which offer regular wage hikes and other privileges, increasingly desirable. Currently, 56 of government jobs in Bangladesh are reserved under various quotas, including 10 for women, 10 for people from underdeveloped districts, 5 for indigenous communities, and 1 for people with disabilities.

The shooting occurred at around 9.30 p.m. yesterday in front of the victims house at Kande Mawatha in Bogahawatte, Ambalangoda. Niroshana was shot by an assailant who was armed with a 12-bore rifle, while he had been shot in the head killing him instantly. The shooting took place as the victim was preparing to leave his house to attend a funeral ceremony. The shooter had fired from near an abandoned plot of land near the victims house and had then fled the scene on foot. Niroshana, a 41-year-old father of two, had captained the Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team in 2002. He had been living overseas for a period before returning to the country and was reportedly planning to travel abroad once again. The incident unfolded when a resident had alerted Niroshana regarding a suspicious individual loitering near his home in the abandoned property. Police suspect the murder may be linked to a past dispute at an illegal gambling venue, as Niroshana was involved in organising such gambling activities at funerals and had received threats to his life prior to the incident.",

Im sure Ill feel even more like that every night after the shows in Munich. But its a positive thing. Its just such an exchange of energy. However, not every Vegas concert has gone to plan. Her Munich shows will be on entirely different scale to the Las Vegas residency, with 74,000 fans expected to watch her every night in a specially-built pop up stadium. The venue will also host an Adele experience featuring an English pub, a stage for a cover band and stalls selling specially designed cocktails. Organisers are also aiming to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest outdoor screen of all time, measuring 220m in length. Adele posted pictures of the venue to her Instagram account on Sunday, calling the set-up bloody exciting. And she told ZDF that the video installation would enhance the experience for fans. They just want to see your face and know its you, so the screens are enormous. The first show will take place on 2 August but the residency is yet to sell out, with 5 of tickets still available, according to German press agency DPA. Promoter Marek Lieberberg said the tickets at the upper and lower ends of the price range had the most availability. The cheapest tickets cost 79 (66) and the most expensive 430 (360). But despite all the acclaim, Adele said one of the reasons she wants to take a break from music is because of a struggle with the limelight. I miss everything about before I was famous, I think probably being anonymous the most, she said. I like that I get to make music all the time, whenever I want to, and people are receptive to it and like it. Thats pretty unimaginable. But the fame side of it, I absolutely hate. The fact that people are even interested in my songs and my voice is pretty wild. I dont think it ever gets normal. So its worth it, the balance. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "July 17, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "Cyanide poisoning caused the deaths of six foreigners whose bodies were found in a room in a plush Bangkok hotel, Thai authorities said on Wednesday, with the suspected killer among the dead. Traces of the rapid-acting, deadly chemical were found during autopsies of the bodies and on drinking glasses and a teapot in the room at the luxury Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel where the dead were discovered late on Tuesday, according to police and a hospital. Interviews with relatives of the three women and three men who died revealed there had been a dispute over debt related to an investment, according to police, who said they were investigating how the cyanide was obtained. The six were all of Vietnamese ethnicity, two of those U.S. nationals. Police said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had assisted with the investigation. We can assume that the six died from cyanide, Chulalongkorn Hospitals Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin told reporters, adding that results of further tests would be available on Friday. The U.S. State Department said it was monitoring the situation and local authorities were responsible for the investigation. Vietnams foreign ministry confirmed four of the dead were Vietnamese nationals and its embassy in Thailand was coordinating closely with authorities. We hope that the victims families soon overcome this great loss, foreign ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said. The Grand Hyatt Erawan, operated by Erawan Group ERW.BK, has over 350 rooms and is located in a popular tourist district known for luxury shopping and restaurants. News of the deaths, initially reported by some Thai media as a shooting, could be a setback for Thailand as it bets heavily on its vital tourism sector reviving an economy that has struggled since the pandemic. The government had been eager to quickly get to the bottom of what happened, concerned bad publicity could impact a sector that is expecting 35 million foreign visitors this year and tens of billions of dollars in spending. Trirong Phiwpan, commander of the Thai police evidence office, said the investigation indicated drinks in the hotel room were spiked with cyanide by one of those who died. After staff brought tea cups and two hot water bottles, milk and tea pots one of the six introduced cyanide. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 17, 2024 10:21 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman, announced that the reduction of water tariffs is being studied alongside the new electricity tariff revision, with a decision expected by the end of this week. The Minister also highlighted that the Water Supply Board, previously experiencing a monthly loss of LKR 2.8 billion, has now achieved a profit of LKR 6.2 billion. Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman made these remarks during the Collective Path to a Stable Country press briefing today (17) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Minister Jeevan Thondaman, elaborating further, also stated: We commend Minister Kanchana Wijesekera for initiating steps to lower electricity tariffs. The water supply sector is closely tied to electricity tariffs, making it likely that this revision will also lead to reduced water tariffs. Water availability is influenced by various factors. We previously committed to lowering water tariffs in tandem with reductions in electricity charges. Currently, the Ministry is not only focusing on electricity but also assessing the impact of reduced interest rates, down from 26 to 11. Additionally, we are studying the potential reduction in water tariffs based on changes in the dollar exchange rate. Its important to note that the cost of chemicals procured by the water supply board is influenced by the dollar exchange rate. It is expected that by the end of this week, a decision will be made regarding the extent of the reduction in the water tariff. When I assumed office in January 2023, the Ministry faced challenges, unable to even provide 1,000 new water connections. Moreover, I inherited a Ministry burdened with an USD 800 million debt and a Water Supply Board experiencing monthly losses of approximately LKR 2.8 billion. The boards monthly recurring expenses of LKR 4.5 billion had a significant national impact. Since then, we have delivered on our commitments. The number of new water connections has increased to 113,000, with plans to add approximately 30,000 more connections in the coming weeks. Furthermore, we have successfully transformed the Water Supply Boards monthly loss of LKR 2.8 billion into a monthly profit of LKR 6.2 billion. It is noteworthy that with a recurring expenditure of LKR 4.5 billion, we have ensured the sustainability of the water supply sector by allocating the surplus towards debt servicing. Through the Ministry of Power and Energy, we secured a USD 100 million policy-based loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Similarly, preparations are underway for a sub-programme within the water supply sector. Cabinet approval has been obtained for the final two issues of the ADBs reform proposals: the water tariff formula and the investment framework criteria. Upon approval by the Asian Development Bank Executive Board, an additional USD 100 million is anticipated. Moreover, we are committed to safeguarding vulnerable and economically disadvantaged communities from the impact of water tariffs. Measures have been implemented to provide subsidies to hospitals, schools, and religious institutions classified as charitable entities. We are also pleased with the success of the Aswasuma program and the Presidents focus on increasing wages for plantation workers and granting land rights. The Upcountry communities have gained confidence in the Presidents initiatives. Despite challenges faced by Upcountry communities, we are optimistic about the direction we are heading. Today, many longstanding issues affecting Upcountry communities have been resolved. Next month, discussions will be held with the Ministry of Industries and Estate Companies aimed at finding a lasting solution to the plantation workers wage issue. Furthermore, in response to our longstanding request, the President submitted a cabinet paper on land rights last Monday. In Upcountry areas where numerous families reside, there is often only one Grama Sewa Officer, leading to inadequate distribution of government welfare benefits. This is exacerbated by historical land demarcation issues affecting Upcountry residents. These challenges have impeded the development of Upcountry communities. To address this, the Presidents cabinet paper proposes formally recognizing Upcountry areas as villages. Additionally, there is widespread agreement that priority should be given to providing housing rights to Upcountry people. Securing land rights enables individuals to build homes, fostering community development. --PMD--",

        "title": "Biden tests positive for covid, cancels events amid mild symptoms",
        "date": "July 18, 2024 07:25 am",
        "content": "(AP)  President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas and is experiencing mild symptoms including general malaise from the infection, the White House said. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will fly to his home in Delaware, where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time. The news had first been shared by UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía, who told guests at the groups convention in Las Vegas that president had sent his regrets and could not appear because he tested positive for the virus. Dr. Kevin OConnor, the presidents physician, said in a note that Biden, 81, presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general malaise. After the positive COVID-19 test, Biden was prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid and has taken his first dose, OConnor said. Biden was slated to speak at the UnidosUS event in Las Vegas Wednesday afternoon as part of an effort to rally Hispanic voters ahead of the November election. Instead, he departed for the airport to fly to Delaware, where he had already been planning to spend a long weekend at his home in Rehoboth Beach. The presidents diagnosis comes amid intense scrutiny of his health and stamina after a disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump that sparked a flurry of concern among Democrats that Biden is not up to the rigors of winning another presidential term. Biden gingerly boarded Air Force One and told reporters traveling with him, I feel good. The president was not wearing a mask as he walked onto Air Force One. The president had previously been at the Original Lindo Michoacan restaurant in Las Vegas, where he was greeting diners and sat for an interview with Univision. Biden has been vaccinated and is current on his recommended annual booster dose for COVID-19. The vaccines have proven highly effective at limiting serious illness and death from the virus, which killed more than 1 million people in the U.S. since the pandemic began in 2020. Paxlovid has been proven to curtail the chances of serious illness and death from COVID-19 when prescribed in the early days of an infection, but has also been associated with rebound infections, where the virus comes back a few days after clearing up. Biden last tested positive for COVID-19 twice in the summer of 2022, when he had a primary case and a rebound case of the virus. Health officials have reported recent upticks in emergency room visits and hospitalizations from COVID-19. There has also been a pronounced increase in positive test results in much of the country  particularly the southwestern U.S. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Human Rights Watch pushes for PTA repeal, raises alarm over new bill",
        "date": "July 18, 2024 11:02 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan authorities continue to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to target perceived opponents and minority communities without credible evidence to support the allegations despite repeated pledges to end the practice, claims Human Rights Watch (HRW). Issuing a statement on Wednesday (17), the international watchdog stated that as a result, while some victims have suffered years of arbitrary detention and torture, others are persecuted even after the case against them is dropped. The law, widely known as the PTA, has provisions allowing for extended administrative detention, limited judicial oversight, and inadequate protections against torture. In a 2022 speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the then foreign minister pledged a moratorium on its use, but under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, detentions under the PTA have continued. Such is the chilling effect of the law that in September 2023 the International Monetary Fund found that broad application of counter-terrorism rules restricts civil society scrutiny of official corruption, the statement highlighted. Additionally, it also mentioned that following government promises to repeal the PTA since 2015, draft legislation to replace it, known as the Anti-Terrorism Bill (ATB), was published in March 2023. While the new bill contains some improvements, it includes provisions that could facilitate abuse, it added. Human Rights Watch further stressed that following the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, when Islamist suicide bombers targeted churches and hotels, killing over 260 people, the authorities detained at least 125 Muslims in the eastern town of Kattankudy under the PTA. Little or no evidence was produced against most of them, a lawyer familiar with the situation told Human Rights Watch. Most spent between one and three years in detention and were then either discharged altogether or released on bail. Twenty-four are facing trial in a proceeding that is expected to continue for years, it added. Meanwhile, the statement also said that like the PTA, the draft law to replace it appears designed to give the president, police, and military broad powers to detain people without evidence, to make vaguely defined forms of speech a criminal offense, and to arbitrarily ban gatherings and organizations without meaningful judicial oversight. It would expand the definition of terrorism to include crimes such as property damage, and restrict rights to freedom of assembly and speech. It would give the police and military sweeping powers to stop, question, search, and arrest anyone without a warrant, and allow the attorney general to impose voluntary custodial rehabilitation on a person who has not been convicted of any crime, it mentioned. Accordingly, Human Rights Watch called on the Sri Lankan government to impose a full moratorium on the PTA and work to repeal it and to draft rights respecting counterterrorism legislation in consultation with experts and civil society. Furthermore, it called on foreign partners including the United States, EU, and UK to insist that Sri Lanka abides by commitments to repeal the law. It also emphasized that the UN Human Rights Council should renew the mandates of resolution 461 for reporting and investigating human rights violations in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has reduced the prison sentence of former Mayor of Kurunegala Thushara Sanjeewa Vitharana from three years to one year. This sentence reduction also applies to the four other individuals who were sentenced alongside him. The verdict was issued today (18) following the consideration of appeals petitions filed by the accused. On December 14, 2023, the former Mayor of Kurunegala, the Municipal Commissioner, Engineer and two others were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment after being found guilty over the destruction and removal of the ancient Raja Sabha Mandapaya (Kings Court) in Kurunegala. The building in question, also known as the Buwaneka Hotel, dates back to the 13th century and is presumed to be the assembly hall used by the contemporary rulers. On 16 July 2022, the Mayor of Kurunegala had demolished the said building for a road development project. He had claimed that the Road Development Authority (RDA) had given its approval for the demolition. The Department of Archaeology then filed a complaint claiming that the building demolished by the Kurunegala Mayor is a 13th-century Kings Court, adding that the archaeological site has been listed under the provisions of the Antiquities Ordinance No. 9 of 1940. A five-member committee was then formed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs, under the directives of then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to look into the incident. In the meantime, then Attorney General Dappula de Livera obtained an order from the Kurunegala Magistrates Court to protect and prevent access to the demolished historic building site pending investigations. The prevention order was issued against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Kurunegala, Municipal Councillors, Municipal Commissioner, and Municipal Council staff and their representatives.",

Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero, who had been sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment for making defamatory comments on Islam at Kuragala, until the hearing of the revision petition filed by him. This order was issued when the revision petition filed by Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero was taken up for consideration this morning (18). On March 28, 2024, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thero to four years of rigorous imprisonment while imposing a fine of Rs. 100,000, over the defamatory comments made against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened on the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony. The judge found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately. Gnanasara Theros prison sentence was also ordered to be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine. However, the judge, delivering the verdict, ruled that the allegations levelled against Gnanasara Thero by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, adding it became evident during the trial that the statement in question was not accidental but deliberate. Pointing out that such statements disrupts the religious harmony and unity in the country, the judge emphasized that the accused failed to fulfil his responsibility as a religious leader who is entrusted with maintaining the inter-faith harmony. Further, the judge informed Gnanasara Thero while delivering the verdict that he is allowed to appeal the verdict.",

        "content": "Japanese scientists have devised a way to attach living skin tissue to robotic faces and make them smile, in a breakthrough that holds out promise of applications in cosmetics and medicine. Researchers at the University of Tokyo grew human skin cells in the shape of a face and pulled it into a wide grin, using embedded ligament-like attachments. The result, though eerie, is an important step towards building more life-like robots, said lead researcher Shoji Takeuchi. By attaching these actuators and anchors, it became possible to manipulate living skin for the first time, he added. The smiling robot, featured in a study published online, opens new tab last month by Cell Reports Physical Science, is the fruit of a decade of research by Takeuchi and his lab on how best to combine biological and artificial machines. Living tissue has numerous advantages over metals and plastics, Takeuchi said, ranging from the energy efficiency of brains and muscles to skins ability to repair itself. Looking ahead, the researchers aim to add more elements to the lab-grown skin, including a circulatory system and nerves. That could lead to safer testing platforms for cosmetics and drugs absorbed through the skin. It could also produce more realistic and functional coverings for robots. Still, there remains the challenge of ridding people of the strange or unnerving feelings evoked by machines that fall just short of being entirely convincing. Theres still a bit of that creepiness to it, Takeuchi acknowledged about the robot. I think that making robots out of the same materials as humans and having them show the same expressions might be one key to overcoming the uncanny valley. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The Athurugiriya incident. I cant go into much detail. We have arrested most of the suspects that need to be taken into custody. I think theres only two more left (to be arrested). Everyone else who was connected, who had planned or was involved in the operation stage-by-stage have already been arrested, he told reporters at a press briefing at the ministry today (18). The Minister said that arrests have also been made in connection with the other recent shooting incidents in the country. On the Embilipitiya shooting, everyone has been arrested including the motorcycle rider and the shooter. On the Ambalangoda shooting, as of yesterday, that too we have already made arrests, he said. Dhammika Niroshana, also known as Jonty, a former captain of Sri Lankas Under-19 cricket team, was shot dead in front of his residence in Ambalangoda on Tuesday (16) night. Therefore, these incidents happen. We have issues with regard to preventing the incidents from happening. There are firearms everywhere, the police minister said today. He stated that they have repeatedly requested the public to provide them with any information regarding firearms, but that such information is rarely provided. Minister Alles urged the public to come forward with any information regarding illegal firearms without any fears or doubts. I will say this today. What I have to say even to mothers and fathers is that if you see any (weapons) in the hands of your children or if you come to find out that they are in possession of a weapon, please inform us before your child becomes a criminal. If anyone knows about any locations where there are weapons, please let us know. The minister said Sri Lanka Police had announced rewards for such information on two occasions, but such information is rarely received. However, unfortunately in this country, the firearms that have entered into the country from time to time as well as the firearms that came out after the war against the LTTE, are everywhere. So, when there are so many firearms everywhere, it is not very difficult for someone to just take one of those and go shoot someone. The Minister of Public Security, however, pointed out that none of the recent shooting incident have been left unsolved and that arrests have been made with regard to every case despite a few fleeing the country. However, every one of these, as of this day none of these shootings have been left unsolved. In each and every one of those incidents, we have arrested every individual that need to be arrested. One or two have fled the country after carrying out the shooting. We have made plans to bring back those who have fled the country. When we started this operation, I said that those who are hiding overseas will be brought back, he declared. Responding to a question regarding Wasanthas wealth and assets, he said: As far as I know. we cant say 100, but as far as we know he continuously ran clubs. At that time, he had that money. But according to the information we have now, at the time of his death he had been indebted around the country and was a person without a cent in his hand. That is the information that has come out after our investigations.",

This order was issued when the suspect, who was detained under the custody of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) after being repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, was produced before the court today (18). Piyum Hasthika alias Piyuma, who is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu, was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE on February 15, 2024. Subsequently, the CID secured detention orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to interrogate the suspect. According to Sri Lanka Police, Piyuma was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months. He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was listed as the 8th suspect after he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that Piyuma had fled to Dubai to evade arrest. In June 2022, Piyuma was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of Kudu Salindu for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa. He was later named as the 5th suspect in this double murder. On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend Piyuma and repatriate him to the island.",

        "content": "Television news channels in Bangladesh were off the air and telecommunications were widely disrupted on Friday amid violent student protests against quotas for government jobs in which nearly two dozen people have been killed this week. There was no immediate word from the government. French news agency AFP reported that the death toll in Thursdays violence had risen to 32. Reuters had reported that 13 people were killed, adding to six dead earlier in the week, and could not immediately verify the higher number. Indias Economic Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas government was forced to call in the army late on Thursday to help maintain order. Reuters could not independently verify the information. Authorities had cut some mobile services on Thursday to try to quell the unrest but the disruption spread across the country on Friday morning, Reuters witnesses in Dhaka and New Delhi said. Telephone calls from overseas were mostly not getting connected and calls through the internet could not be completed. Web sites of several Bangladesh-based newspapers were not updating on Friday morning and their social media handles were also not active. Only some voice calls were working in the country and there was no mobile data or broadband on Friday morning, a Reuters photographer in Dhaka said. Even SMSes or mobile-to-mobile text messages were not going through, he added. News television channels and state broadcaster BTV were off the air while entertainment channels continued normal transmission, a Reuters witness said. Some news channels displayed a message which said they were not able to broadcast due to technical reasons and that programming would be back soon, the witness said. Streets in the capital Dhaka were deserted on Friday, which is a weekly holiday in the country. There was little traffic and very few rickshaw pullers on the streets and thin crowds near a vegetable and fish market, he said, adding that a protest rally had been called at the main mosque at around 0800 GMT. The nationwide agitation, the biggest since Hasina was re-elected earlier this year, has been fuelled by high youth unemployment. Nearly a fifth of the countrys 170 million population is out of work or education. Protesters are demanding the state stop setting aside 30 of government jobs for the families of people who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Hasinas government had scrapped the quota system in 2018, but a high court reinstated it last month. The government appealed against the verdict and the Supreme Court suspended the high court order, pending hearing the governments appeal on Aug. 7. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

After it was announced that only those with a reserved date and time would be served, the applicants who had not registered online in advance had voiced their objections causing a heated situation, resulting in long queues and congestion in front of the department.

        "date": "July 19, 2024 11:30 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has scrapped plans to sell off its indebted national airline despite shortlisting three potential buyers, the governments privatisation agency said Friday. Colombo called for bids in September to sell SriLankan Airlines, a key IMF demand when granting a bailout loan to the country last year. Six firms had initially expressed interest in taking a stake in the airline, which owed more than 2.0 billion at the end of the 20222023 financial year. The government announced in April a shortlist of three potential investors, including Malaysias Air Asia. However, on Friday, the State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit said it had called off the sale. The cabinet of ministers at a meeting on July 9 decided to terminate the current bidding process with regard to the divestiture of SriLankan Airlines, it said in a brief statement without giving any reasons for the decision. It added that the government will follow an alternate strategy to be decided shortly, to divest the airline base on a framework approved by Cabinet of Ministers regarding the carrier. The International Monetary Fund had singled out SriLankan for restructuring when granting the government a 2.9 billion bailout last year. The bailout came after the country defaulted on its 46 billion external debt in April 2022 as it faced an unprecedented shortage of foreign exchange needed for essential imports. With nearly 6,000 staff, SriLankan Airlines is the biggest and most expensive of the cash-haemorrhaging companies that are draining the budget and compounding Sri Lankas economic woes. However, analysts had warned that finding a company willing to pour money into the carrier would be immensely challenging given its history of interference, mismanagement and turbulent partnerships. In 1998, Emirates bought a minority stake and took over its management. It stayed in the black for most of the next decade, even in 2001 when several of the airlines planes were destroyed in an attack on the main international airport by Tamil Tiger separatists. But the partnership was terminated and the chief executive sacked by then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2008 after the carrier refused to bump fare-paying passengers to make room for members of his family returning from a trip to London. The authorities tried to sell a 49 percent stake in SriLankan in 2017 when tourism was booming, but private equity firm TPG eventually withdrew its bid after deciding it was not a viable operation.

Newhart also won as best new artist of 1960, and the sequel The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back! won as best comedy spoken word album. Over the years, Newhart also appeared in several movies, usually in comedic roles. They included Catch 22, In And Out, Legally Blonde 2 and Elf, as the diminutive dad of adopted full-size son Will Ferrell. More recent work included Horrible Bosses and the TV series The Librarians, as well as The Big Bang Theory and its spin-off series, Young Sheldon. His sitcoms, nominated several times for an Emmy, included Bob, and George  Leo. I guess they think Im not acting. That its just Bob being Bob, he said of his failure to win an Emmy. Newhart continued appearing on television occasionally after his fourth sitcom ended and vowed in 2003 that he would work as long as he could. Its been so much, 43 years of my life; to quit would be like something was missing, he said. Source: Sky News --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka aims to become regional hub for human capital development  President",
        "date": "July 19, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that efforts are underway to position Sri Lanka as the regional hub for human capital development. He stressed the need to re-evaluate the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) to align with internationally accepted standards, such as those in Australia. He expressed his intent to seek assistance from Australia to strengthen and modernize Sri Lankas education system. He stressed the importance of collective efforts among BIMSTEC countries and seeking support from international partners to build a robust education system. President Wickremesinghe underscored the necessity of systemic changes, advocating for reforms and the strengthening of education and training systems. President Wickremesinghe also underscored the importance of integrating power and land connectivity in a strategic move to enhance Sri Lankas economic growth. Speaking on the subject, the President stated that while power connectivity is vital, land connectivity stands as the most crucial sector for development. He highlighted how the Tamil Nadu economy, which competes with Maharashtra and Gujarat, along with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, could significantly benefit from accessing Sri Lankas ports in Trincomalee and Colombo. This integration, according to the President, would benefit both countries. President Wickremesinghe stressed the need for expansion in various identified areas, advocating for a friendly approach to both foreign and local investments and called for a focus on human capital formation, pointing out that financial capital is essential for developing human capital. He highlighted the necessity of prioritizing the vocational and technical sectors, given that many who left the country were vocationally and technically qualified. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while addressing the Sri Lanka Human Capital Summit 2024 held yesterday (18) at Temple Trees under the theme of Unlocking Sri Lankas Economic Potential by Building a Future-Ready Workforce, focussing on nurturing, harnessing, and amplifying human capital. The Sri Lanka Human Capital Summit was inaugurated in 2016 based on a concept introduced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his tenure as Prime Minister. The President aimed to establish a platform that would bring all stakeholders together to address the skills challenges facing Sri Lanka. This initiative aims to go beyond mere economic growth and transform Sri Lanka from a lower-middle-income economy to a developed nation. The transformation relies on the ability to cultivate talent, foster innovation, and empower every citizen. While there are multiple industries to consider, the summit prioritizes the pillars for their significant impact and strategic potential on Sri Lankas economy: Public Sector Capacity, Information Technology, Tourism, Financial Services and Start-ups. Chairman of the Board of Investment and Chairman of the Human Capital Summit, Dinesh Weerakkody, presented tokens of appreciation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: It was mentioned that nearly 400,000 Sri Lankans left this country in 2022. The number that left in 2023 has been similar, a little less, I would say. Numbers will drop, but we can stem this by about 20262027 if we undertake the fundamental economic reforms that are necessary. The bankruptcy of our nation made us realize that we cant continue as it is. Life is going to be more difficult. They had to look after their childrens education and pay their debts. The money wasnt sufficient, so they decided to leave. We fixed our salaries when the exchange rate was LKR 185 to a dollar and our prices when the rate was LKR 300 to a dollar. So, can you imagine how a middle-class executive can survive? What we have done so far is ensure that the creditors of our nation, both sovereign states and private entities, recognize that we have the capacity to repay their debt after the concessions given to us. But how do we pay off the debt, and where will we find the necessary funds? How can we acquire foreign exchange? These issues require careful attention. When I brought the economic transformation bill, one party in Parliament went to court and said it should be rejected because we require an import substitution economy. First and foremost, we must get out of our heads that there is no such thing as an import substitution economy. We have to undertake and commit ourselves to be a highly competitive, modern, export-oriented economy, as Prime Minister Scott said. I agree with him 200. We have to get the rest of Sri Lanka to agree to it. Thats the small problem. Nevertheless, I think you have the opportunity now, and most people in our country feel that there has to be a fundamental change in the economy. When you do that, we will realize which sectors require people. We have about three to four hundred thousand acres of land to be cultivated through modern methods. We have land held by villagers where agriculture can be modernized. If we go up to 8 metric tons of rice per hectare, we will only need two-thirds of the land for rice cultivation. They have done this in Murray Darling, even going up to about 10 metric tons, but thats a small area with water available. So this is one area. Theres big scope for IT and related industries and to train people for automation. There are so many areas, and I am not going to deal with all of them except to refer to economic cooperation with India. We have decided on an integrated system of power connectivity. But of all the sectors, the most important one will be land connectivity. Then the Tamil Nadu economy, which competes with Maharashtra and Gujarat, together with Andhra and Telangana, can use the ports of Sri Lanka, Trincomalee, and Colombo. Thats going to make a big difference for them and for us. So there are many areas that we have identified which we need to expand. We must be friendly to foreign investment and, more importantly, friendly to local investment. The private sector, big and small, has to expand. There is no other way. Within this framework, yes, we must look at our human capital formation. Without financial capital, you cant develop your human capital. So this is the approach to be taken. We cant tackle everything at the same time. So first, we have to look at the vocational and technical sector. Many of the people who left this country were not graduates. They are vocationally and technically qualified. So where is it? We have too many agencies, too many departments, and Ministries running these agencies. I want to have one single agency for this area, which will look after post-school education and all the training centres. There may be 700-800 in the country, and the government should merge them into about 300 vocational colleges, which can then be updated and modernized. Thats what we have to do. Replace the technical colleges of varying standards with advanced colleges of technology and management and be able to introduce the associate degree in technical and vocational subjects. So these are two of the main issues we have. To begin with, we need to reassess our NVQ qualification. I think we must re-look at the NVQ qualification and bring it in line with the Australian one, which is accepted internationally and makes provision for the associate degree. There is much more we can learn from Australia. This is one of them. If you look at the countries in Asia that have developed, all of them have relied on a good system of vocational and technical education, higher education, and capital formation. Take Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore in the top tier. Theres China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand in the next tier. The UAE and Qatar are catching up. So these are the systems we should look at. In 1990, we were light years ahead of Vietnam. What we need now is assistance to develop this system. We are so used to asking for aid projects, which mainly consist of buildings and some equipment. We need to move away from that. I will not allow anyone to get money for putting up buildings. The foreign assistance we require, as the central authority will have to decide, will be to strengthen and modernize the system. In this respect, one of the countries I will reach out to is Australia. We have a lot to learn. We can also be a platform for human capital formation and do that in this whole region. For India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to develop, we have to improve our human capital formation. The whole BIMSTEC region must come together. But for Sri Lanka, we should seek assistance from these countries to build up our education system. Already, there is a project paper, which I think the Australian High Commission produced somewhere in 2021 or 2022, on educational opportunities. We already have Deakin University, and I think Edith Cowan University and Sydney Technology University have opened up universities recently. So you can see universities coming in. We are also developing some new not-for-profit universities in the government sector, hopefully four focusing on technology. So this is an outline of what we have to do and what we have to consider in our deliberations. Firstly, the system has to change. You dont need new technology for import substitution because it basically cant be done. Secondly, we must pursue reforms followed by strengthening the education and training system. So lets think anew and move forward. Former Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison: In his address, Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison emphasized the urgent priorities essential for Sri Lankas advancement, acknowledging President Ranil Wickremesinghes accomplishments during challenging times. Morrison expressed heartfelt concern for the enduring struggles faced by Sri Lankans, ranging from natural disasters to economic crises and conflicts, praising their resilience and perseverance. Highlighting the need to secure a prosperous future for Sri Lanka, Morrison underscored the critical reforms necessary for economic stability. These included fiscal repair, revenue reforms, debt restructuring, and bolstering financial institutions independence. He stressed the importance of transparency in governance, anti-corruption measures, and enhancing the social safety net, all initiatives championed by President Wickremesinghe crucial for Sri Lankas long-term prospects. He also mentioned the discussions often focus on the need for a future-ready workforce, but realizing this future requires immediate action. President Wickremesinghe has performed an extraordinary task in stabilizing the country following the economic crisis of two years ago. Morrison also advocated for Sri Lankas active engagement in regional partnerships, particularly through the Quadrilateral Leaders Dialogue, where cooperation with India, the United States, Japan, and Australia could strengthen security, sovereignty, and economic success. He concluded by urging a steadfast focus on economic stability as the foundation for building a dynamic, export-oriented economy, enabled by strategic partnerships with international allies committed to Sri Lankas sovereignty and independence. Climate Advisor to the Sri Lankan President Mohamed Nasheed, Minister Bandula Gunawardena, Parliamentarian Harsha De Silva, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake, along with other distinguished national and international guests, attended this event. --PMD",

        "date": "July 19, 2024 04:43 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva has officially inaugurated the runway development project at the Hingurakgoda Airport today (19), which is set to become Sri Lankas sixth international airport. This ambitious project, the largest ever undertaken by the Sri Lanka Air Force, demonstrates exceptional civil engineering capabilities and dedication to advancing the Sri Lankan Aviation Sector the Sri Lanka Air Force said. According to a government decision, construction work to modernize Hingurakgoda Domestic Airport for international flight operations commenced today (19) under the initiative of the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation. The airport, formerly known as RAF Minneriya, was built during World War II for the British Royal Air Force. President Ranil Wickremasinghe has decided to transform the airport, located in the middle of the country, into an international airport, to strengthen Sri Lankas economic enhancement. The 2024 budget has allocated Rs. 2 billion for its initial construction and development. In Phase I, the current 2,287-meter-long and 46-meter-wide runway will be extended to 2,500 meters. Construction is scheduled to be completed in six months to accommodate Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation emphasizes that the total construction cost, estimated at around Rs. 17 billion, will be carried out by the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). The total supervision of the project is entrusted to Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited.

        "date": "July 19, 2024 05:17 pm",
        "content": "Amid celebrations for Hello Kittys 50th anniversarywhich officially occurs November 1fans of the popular cartoon character created by Yuko Shimizu were shocked to learn that she is not as feline as she appears. Hello Kitty is not a cat, Jill Cook, the Director of Retail Business Development at Sanrio, Hello Kittys flagship company, explained on Today July 18. Shes actually a little girl born and raised in the suburbs of London. She has a mom and dad and a twin sister Mimmywho is also her best friend. Naturally, the revelation, while not entirely unknown, had some fans a bit, er, confused. After all, Hello Kitty appears to be a cat with a little red bow and, for some reason, no mouth. So she has whiskers, ears, and is named Kitty but is actually a human? One fan reacted to the Today clip on TikTok. What? Others felt like the fun fact completely changed their lives. Hello Kitty has been my favorite since childhood, another fan wrote. Im almost 40 and this is the first time Im hearing this. While it may be news for some, this isnt the first time Hello Kittys species has stirred controversy. In fact, the character made headlines back in 2014, around its 40th anniversary, for the exact same reason. During that time, anthropologist Christine R. Yanowho authored Pink Globalization: Hello Kittys Trek Across The Pacificwas corrected very firmly by Sanrino on the distinction between cat and little girl amid prepping for a Hello Kitty exhibit at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. Shes a cartoon character, Yano explained to the Los Angeles Times. She is a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat. Shes never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and its called Charmmy Kitty. Meanwhile, other fans were just as surprised to hear where Hello Kitty lives. Hello Kittywhose first ever appearance was on a Japanese coin purse in 1974was very intentionally made British, raised in the suburbs of London. Hello Kitty emerged in the 1970s, when the Japanese and Japanese women were into Britain, Yano added to the Los Angeles Times. They loved the idea of Britain. It represented the quintessential idealized childhood, almost like a white picket fence. So, the biography was created exactly for the tastes of that time. But while fans continue to learn this very shocking fact about Hello Kitty, one aspect that wont surprise anyone is that she was created to be universally adored. Her core message is friendship, kindness, and inclusivity, Cook expressed on Today. Part of what has helped her transcend borders, languages, cultures is that thats understandable to everyone.

Senior Information Engineer of Sri Lanka CERT Charuka Damunupola confirmed that reports have been called to ascertain whether the relevant government information systems operate using Microsoft applications, which have been affected by the massive outage took place. Furthermore, Mr. Damunupola stated that initial findings indicate four private institutions in Sri Lanka have been impacted, while unofficial reports suggest that two Sri Lankan banks are among the affected entities. Speaking to Ada Derana, he asserted that a rigorous investigation is underway to assess the full scope of the impact. CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm with thousands of customers globally, admitted on Friday (19) that a defective software update had caused the major IT outage that is bringing airports, banks, hospitals, media outlets, and businesses to a halt worldwide. Reports of outages began streaming in from around the globe early on Friday, with broadcaster Sky News in the UK forced off the air for several hours. However, the CEO of CrowdStrike told CNN news agency that the IT issue causing a global outage has been identified and that a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike has advised customers to refer to its support portal for updates, and for organisations who use its services to continue communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Earlier today, SriLankan Airlines announced that its internet booking services have been fully restored as of 08:30 GMT (02.00 pm local time), following a global outage of third-party service providers that affected the airlines online booking services. We understand that this may have impacted the experience of some of our passengers, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused, the airline said in a brief statement. Passengers are instructed to contact the Global Contact Centre at 94 19733 1979 for any further assistance with existing or new bookings, it added.",

        "title": "President says there should be no fear regarding constitutional amendment",
        "date": "July 19, 2024 07:10 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasized that there should be no fear regarding the constitutional amendment. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe expressed that Sri Lanka is unique in maintaining democracy following universal suffrage the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. Moreover, the Head of the State added that he is dedicated to preserving this democratic tradition, according to the PMD. President Wickremesinghe urged that there should be no fear regarding the constitutional amendment. He emphasized that when making constitutional amendments, he entrusts the responsibility to experienced professionals. He mentioned that in the past, lawyers like K. N. Choksi were involved in such matters. However, since Mr. Choksi had passed away by the time of the new constitutional amendment in 2015, the task was assigned to Presidents Counsel Jayampathi Wickramaratne. President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged that the current issues have resulted from an oversight on his part and expressed his apology to the public for it. He made this statement today (19) during the opening of the new court complex in Beligaha, Galle. To enhance the efficiency of justice administration for the people of Galle, a new court complex was constructed at a cost of LKR 1600 million. The complex houses a Civil Appeal High Court, two High Courts, three District Courts, two Magistrate Courts, a Legal Aid Centre, a Community Corrections Office, a Probation Office, and a Debt Relief Board. It is fully equipped with necessary facilities for court proceedings, including administrative offices. After unveiling the plaque and officially opening the new court complex, the President took an observation tour of the premises. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: I would like to extend my gratitude to Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe for overseeing the completion of this Judicial Complex. With plans to develop the area as a tourist destination, it was crucial to relocate the existing Court Complex, and I am pleased to say that this has been accomplished. As we work to transform the Galle area into a tourist hub, we have identified locations outside the province for large hotel developments. Additionally, there are plans to move the Transport Board, Timber Corporation, Mahamodara Hospital, Nursing College, Prison and Post Office to the city centre. We also plan to build a similar court complex in the Hikkaduwa area. The Galle District Court Complex holds historical significance. After Dutch rule, the Batavian Statutes introduced Roman-Dutch law to Ceylon, making Galle a jurisdictional centre with a judicial board, a civil board, and a land board. This marked the beginning of our judicial system. While the Galle judicial area was originally divided into the Matara and Galle districts, only the Galle district continues to operate as a judicial region. During the Dutch period, the majority of the Land Board members were Dutch, while the minority were Sri Lankans from Ruhuna. The Sri Lankans learned the law from the Dutch and later emerged as lawyers during the English colonial period. Over time, many Sri Lankans pursued careers in law and entered the Legislative Assembly. Lawyers became a cornerstone of the legislative system. Under the Donoughmore Constitution, they served in the State Council with significant voting power. The English system of governance was established through the Soulbury Constitution, and when India adopted a republican constitution, Sri Lanka followed suit with the English system. Colvin R. de Silva introduced the first Republican Constitution, while J.R. Jayewardene presented the Second Republican Constitution. Sri Lanka has a rich constitutional history and a strong commitment to the rule of law. In 1931, Sri Lanka became the first country in Asia and Africa to grant universal suffrage. Unlike in the United States, where some states did not extend voting rights to Black people, Sri Lanka is unique for maintaining democracy continuously since then. We should take pride in this achievement. Despite facing wars and rebellions, Sri Lanka has preserved its democratic system, and democracy has remained intact despite numerous challenges. In Sri Lanka, power transitions smoothly and without conflict after elections, a testament to the strength of our democratic process. Despite various debates and issues, democracy has never been compromised. Some critics argue that democracy is at risk during certain crises. However, our constitution, judiciary, and political system have worked to advance and protect it. The most significant threat to our democracy occurred in 2022, yet we have continued to progress through consensus. While Parliament remains a venue for debate, protecting democracy is crucial. The upcoming election is on schedule, with the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court confirming that it should be held within the specified timeframe, and we support this directive. In 2015, we proposed a new constitutional amendment. Typically, I would have assigned this task to K. N. Choksi, a lawyer. However, since he had passed away, the responsibility fell to lawyer Jayampathi Wickramaratne. He was unable to make the necessary revisions. This oversight is regrettable, and I apologize to the nation for it. There is no need for further discussion on this matter; our country has upheld democracy since 1931. Additionally, the government will fund the compilation of a book on the heritage of Galles history. --PMD",

        "date": "July 19, 2024 09:46 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police says the alleged shooter involved in the killing of former captain of Sri Lankas Under-19 cricket team, Dhammika Niroshana, in front of his house has been arrested. Officers of the Galle District Crimes Division have arrested the suspect last evening (18), according to a spokesman. He said that three suspects had arrived to commit the murder of Dhammika Niroshana, who is also known as Jonty, and that the other two suspects have been identified. The 48-year-old suspect was arrested in Randombe area in Balapitiya along with 2,800 milligrams of ice drugs, also known as crystal methamphetamine. Meanwhile officers of the Elpitiya Divisional Crimes Unit have recovered the sets of clothes used by the suspects to disguise themselves. Police suspect that the killing was carried out based on a contract received from a foreign country. The arrested suspect was remanded until August 03 after being produced before the Balapitiya Magistrates Court. Dhammika Niroshana, also known as Jonty, a former captain of Sri Lankas Under-19 cricket team, was shot dead on Tuesday (16) night in Ambalangoda. The shooting occurred at around 9.30 p.m. in front of the victims house at Kande Mawatha in Bogahawatte, Ambalangoda. Niroshana was shot by an assailant who was armed with a 12-bore rifle, while he had been shot in the head killing him instantly. The shooting took place as the victim was preparing to leave his house to attend a funeral ceremony. The shooter had fired from near an abandoned plot of land near the victims house and had then fled the scene on foot. Niroshana, a 41-year-old father of two, had captained the Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team in 2002. Police suspect the murder may be linked to a past dispute at an illegal gambling venue, as Niroshana was involved in organising such gambling activities at funerals and had received threats to his life prior to the incident.",

He also announced that proposals to amend the Consumer Act are planned to be submitted to Parliament within the next two weeks. Minister Fernando made these remarks during a news conference held at the Presidential Media Center today (19) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Addressing the media briefing, Minister Fernando further said: The crisis of the past few years has finally been resolved, thanks to the exceptional leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Our government implemented numerous programs to achieve this success, and the people are now reaping the benefits. The economic policies enacted over the past two years have provided significant concessions and privileges, helping to control inflation. Additionally, we have initiated programs to increase peoples incomes. The Central Bank has also made crucial policy decisions to reduce bank interest rates, promising further relief in the coming months. Moreover, the Consumer Act is being amended, with the relevant proposals set to be presented to Parliament in the next two weeks. Efforts are also underway to improve understanding between consumers and traders. Currently, we announce the prices of 15 essential items once a week. However, it has been observed that consumers are not receiving the concessions provided by the government. We plan to discuss this issue with trade associations in the coming days. If these concessions are not passed on to consumers, we will have to implement price controls on certain goods. --PMD",

        "date": "July 20, 2024 08:52 am",
        "content": "The Bangladesh government has decided to impose a curfew across the country and deploy the army, BBC Bangla reported on Friday, citing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas press secretary, amid widening student-led protests against government job quotas. An official decision regarding the curfew would be issued soon, the prime ministers press secretary, Nayeemul Islam Khan, told BBC Bangla. Three people were killed in the country on Friday as police cracked down on unrelenting student-led protests against government job quotas despite a ban on public gatherings, local media said. Police fired tear gas to scatter protesters in some areas, Reuters journalists said. One said he could see many fires across the capital Dhaka from a rooftop and smoke rising into the sky in several places. Telecommunications were also disrupted and television news channels went off the air. Authorities had cut some mobile telephone services the previous day to try to quell the unrest. Bengali newspaper Prothom Alo reported train services had been suspended nationwide as protesters blocked roads and threw bricks at security officials. Violence on Thursday in 47 of Bangladeshs 64 districts killed 27 and injured 1,500. The total number of those dead from the protests reached 105 on Friday night, AFP separately reported, citing hospitals. Reuters could not immediately verify the reports and police have not issued a casualty toll. The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said that reports indicated more than 40 deaths and hundreds to possibly thousands injured across Bangladesh. In a security alert, it said protests were spreading, with violent clashes being reported across Dhaka. The situation was extremely volatile, it said. The protests initially broke out over student anger against quotas that set aside 30 of government jobs for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan. The nationwide unrest - the biggest since Hasina was re-elected this year - has also been fuelled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of a population of 170 million. Some analysts say the violence is now also being driven by wider economic woes, such as high inflation and shrinking reserves of foreign exchange. The protests have opened old and sensitive political fault lines between those who fought for Bangladeshs independence from Pakistan in 1971 and those accused of collaborating with Islamabad. The former include the Awami League party of Hasina, who branded the protesters razakar - making use of a term that described independence-era collaborators. International rights groups criticised the suspension of services and the action of security forces. The European Union said it is deeply concerned by the violence and loss of life. It is vital that further violence is averted and that a peaceful resolution to the situation is found as swiftly as possible, underpinned by the rule of law and democratic freedoms, it said in a statement. Neighbour India said the unrest was an internal matter of Bangladesh and that all 15,000 Indians in that country were safe. Indians studying in Bangladesh were returning by road. Violence linked to the protests also broke out in distant London, which is home to a large Bangladeshi population, and police had to quell clashes between large groups of men in the east of the British capital. TELECOMS DISRUPTED, WEBSITES HACKED Friday began with the internet and overseas telephone calls being crippled, while the websites of several Bangladesh newspapers did not update and were also inactive on social media. A few voice calls went through, but there was no mobile data or broadband, a Reuters journalist said. Even text messages were not being transmitted. News television channels and state broadcaster BTV went off the air, although entertainment channels were normal, he said. Some news channels displayed a message blaming technical problems, and promising to resume programming soon. The official websites of the central bank, the prime ministers office and police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself THE R3SISTANC3. Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students, read identical messages splashed on the sites, adding in crimson letters: Its not a protest anymore, its a war now. Another message on the page read, The government has shut down the internet to silence us and hide their actions. The government had no comment on the communications issues. On Thursday, it had said it was willing to hold talks with the protesters but they refused. Many opposition party leaders, activists, and student protesters had been arrested, said Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chairman of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Reuters could not confirm the arrests. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "At least 40 migrants have died after the boat they were travelling in caught fire off the northern coast of Haiti, a United Nations agency says. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says 41 others were rescued by the Haitian Coast Guard. The vessel was travelling from Cap-Haitien to the Turks and Caicos Islands, more than 220km (137 miles) away, the IOM said. The exact cause of the fire is not yet clear, but a local official told Reuters that people on the boat were lighting candles in a ritual to ask for safe passage, leading gasoline-filled drums to catch fire. The injured are receiving care provided by the IOM, and 11 of them were taken to the nearest hospital, the agency said. Tens of thousands of people flee Haiti every year, escaping poverty, lawlessness and gang violence at home. Rival armed groups took control of the capital, Port-au-Prince, earlier this year, forcing Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign weeks later. Grégoire Goodstein, IOMs chief of mission in Haiti, said: This devastating event highlights the risks faced by children, women and men migrating through irregular routes demonstrating the crucial need for safe and legal pathways for migration. Haitis socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more. The lack of economic opportunities, a collapsing health system and school closures are pushing many to consider migration as the only way to survive, the IOM says. Gang violence on average killed or injured more than one person per hour in the first three months of this year, according to UN data. More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighbouring countries this year, despite the rising violence, according to the IOM. The Caribbean nation has seen an escalation of violence following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse three years ago. Hundreds of Kenyan police arrived in Haiti this month as part of a mission to help Haitian police fight the gangs. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "July 20, 2024 11:37 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that restructuring loss-making public institutions will enable the government to allocate more resources to education and healthcare in the future. He emphasized that the countrys true wealth lies in its youth, not in struggling state enterprises. The President noted that many state enterprises are now operating without burdening the government, and he expects that the financial obligations related to SriLankan Airlines will be resolved by the end of the year. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during the ceremony to hand over the newly built Faculty of Allied Health Sciences at the Ruhuna University, located in Walahanduwa, Galle, yesterday (19). At the event, the President unveiled a plaque and formally transferred the college building to the students. He also took time for a tour and engaged in friendly discussion with the university staff. Additionally, Vice-Chancellor of the Ruhuna University, Mr. Sujeeva Amarasena, presented a commemorative plaque to President Wickremesinghe. Marking the occasion, the President also planted a sapling in the Faculty of Science grounds and took a group photo with the university staff, according to the PMD. Addressing the ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; Minister Ramesh Pathirana dedicated himself to the establishment of this Faculty of Allied Health Sciences. I urge everyone to fully utilize this facility. Major universities in countries like the United States benefit from such buildings 247. When government funds are allocated for education, we must maximize their use. Disrupting classes will harm both you and the country. It was noted that Rs. 700 billion was spent on SriLankan Airlines and other corporations, but this needs to be managed correctly. These funds should have yielded a tenfold return. Instead, this massive expenditure led to loans under three different governments, increasing our national debt. When the countrys economy collapsed, our first step was to stop borrowing, which was a difficult but necessary task. We had to find new sources of revenue and we informed every government agency that they must cover their own expenses. This situation impacted every sector, and I faced severe criticism. I had to choose between letting the economy collapse or enduring the backlash. Despite the criticism, we remained committed to our responsibility, with all ministers rendering their support. At that time, some people opposed the state enterprise restructuring program. Today, electricity and fuel prices are aligned with global prices, and we no longer subsidize them. Additionally, we have stopped providing funds to other corporations, with the only remaining financial obligation being SriLankan Airlines, which we expect to resolve by the end of this year. This will allow the country to redirect funds to education and health services in the coming years. When these measures were introduced, they faced significant criticism. I posed a critical question: Is our national wealth found in failing corporations or in our youth? We must choose between sustaining loss-making corporations and investing in education and health. I invite everyone to help move the country forward by supporting a new economic transformation over the next two to three years with these new initiatives. Minister of Health and Industries Dr. Ramesh Pathirana: The people of Galle thank the President for taking the time, amidst his busy schedule, to inaugurate this university building, which is crucial for the future of our countrys children. I am pleased to have completed such an important project during a critical period. Thanks to President Ranil Wickremesinghes sound economic policies, the Galle district has received several significant projects. In the 2024 budget, he allocated substantial funds for health and education, which is a positive step for the future of our children. This new college, inaugurated today, is a source of pride for the Southern Province. Chairman of the University Grants Commission Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunge; I thank the President for participating in this event. The non-academic staff who have been on strike for 75 days will report back for duty from next Monday. The President intervened to provide a solution to their salary disparity. The President should be thanked for that. The Treasury has allocated Rs. 4.2 billion to pay their arrears. I believe that if we can take our country to a state where there are no strikes, that is the development of the country. The Chancellor of the Ruhunu University Ven. Akuratiye Nanda Nayaka Thera, the Maha Sangha and other religious clergy, Southern Province Governor Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Members of Parliament Mr. Wajira Abeywardana, Sampath Athukorala and a group of former vice chancellors, deans, academic staff, students and others were present on this occasion. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 20, 2024 12:31 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya says that the Bangladesh High Commission in India is on alert about the Sri Lankan students in Bangladesh, amid violent protests. Meanwhile, around 300 Indian students have returned home from Bangladesh after the student-youth agitation against the announcement of reservation in government jobs gained strength. Authorities in Bangladesh have imposed a nationwide curfew after this weeks rioting in the capital Dhaka left around 104 dead and nearly 2500 people seriously injured. Police fire was the cause of more than half of the deaths reported so far this week, as per reports. On Friday, Bangladeshi student protesters stormed a prison and freed hundreds of inmates as police struggled to quell unrest, with huge rallies in the capital Dhaka despite a police ban on public gatherings. The clashes have also not been confined to Dhaka, with 26 districts reporting incidents. Against this backdrop, UN human rights chief Volker Turk told AFP news agency that the attacks on student protesters were shocking and unacceptable. Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the countrys 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition. Hasinas government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists. Her administration this week ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police stepped up efforts to bring the deteriorating law and order situation under control. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "55 years since first moon landing: NASA now hopes to extend Apollos legacy",
        "date": "July 20, 2024 12:40 pm",
        "content": "As the world on Saturday marks the 55th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 Moon landing, hopes are high that another giant leap in lunar exploration is fast approaching. A new global race to return the Moon is gathering pace but now space agencies want to do more than merely visit. Unlike the Apollo programme, which was discontinued due to high costs, future missions are expected to benefit from advancements in technology, international partnerships and private sector involvement making them economically viable. It is hoped these efforts could lead to permanent lunar bases and infrastructure that will support sustainable exploration and scientific research. Gateway to the future Salem Al Marri, director general of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, told The National he hopes to see astronauts thriving on the surface of the Moon in the next few decades. Weve got to look at the last 25 years of what human spaceflight has been and thats really been sustainable presence on the International Space Station, he said. If we take that model, apply it to the Moon and fast forward 20 years in advance  thats what I think we would be seeing at some point  maybe even in the shorter term with the Gateway being built. The Apollo programme, which ran from 1961 to 1972, successfully landed 12 astronauts on the Moon for short-duration missions, but no human has been back since. Nasa now hopes to extend Apollos legacy by building a permanent human base through its Artemis programme and the Gateway, a Moon-orbiting station. The agency is using the help of international partners, such as the UAE, and private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, to make these missions a reality. The UAE is supplying a crucial part of the Gateway and will get to send one of its astronauts to the Moon in exchange. Fifty-five years since Apollo 11 landed, that was a pivotal moment in human history, said Mr Al Marri. We as humans havent been back there since  I think that also poses a strong question of do we need to get back there? And thats really why theres now a renewed push globally to get back to the Moon, whether its with the government programmes, like Artemis, that the UAE is part of as well, or through private missions. Nasa beat the Soviets in the space race by landing the first man on the Moon in 1969, a monumental achievement that showcased US technological prowess. Funding for lunar missions was more accessible due to the intense Cold War rivalry with the Soviets, which fuelled a sense of urgency and national pride in beating them to the Moon. Space rivalries renewed This geopolitical competition ensured substantial financial and political support for Nasa. Today, the agency faces a new rival in China, which has rapidly advanced its space programme with successful missions using the Change lunar landers and the Tianwen Mars rover. Chinas ambitious plans include establishing a lunar research station by the 2030s, positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the quest for lunar dominance. As Nasa competes with China to land humans on the Moon again, it is grappling with budget constraints for the Artemis programme, as the US Congress has been hesitant to approve the necessary financing. It does not help Nasas case that the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which is central to the Artemis missions, has faced criticism for its high development costs. Dimitra Atri, an astrophysicist at New York University Abu Dhabi, said the involvement of private companies could help make Artemis a reality. One difference is that a number of private companies are involved this time round and they might attract funding from private investors and other governments from around the globe, he said. For example, SpaceX launches spacecraft from private companies and other governments, which is a significant source of funding for them. The sustainability of Artemis also depends on how sustainable the Chinese lunar programme is because both programmes are extremely expensive and are of high strategic importance to both countries. But some missions that could have paved the way for the Artemis programme have already been cancelled by Nasa because of high costs. On Wednesday, the agency announced it was cancelling its 450 million Viper (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) project due to budget concerns. The rover would have spent 100 days scouting for lunar ice deposits near the Moons south pole, which is where future Artemis missions are expected to touch down. Source: The National --Agencies",

        "date": "July 20, 2024 01:02 pm",
        "content": "A massive fire erupted on a container cargo merchant vessel about 102 nautical miles south west of Goa on Friday. The vessel was on way from Gujarats Mundra to Sri Lankan capital Colombo, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) said in a statement. On receiving the information, the Indian Coast Guard diverted the ship to proceed to the distressed vessel with maximum speed. Also, a Dornier aircraft took off for aerial assessment. According to the statement by Coast Guard, the ship is carrying Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) cargo and explosions have been occurring on front part of the merchant vessel. The Indian Coast Guard ship arrived in the area and is carrying out fire-fighting operation despite rough sea and inclement weather conditions, the statement added. The panic-stricken crew has been reassured of the safety by the Indian Coast Guard ship. As per the statement, two ICG ships sailed with dispatch from Goa to augment firefighting efforts. On Wednesday, the Indian Coast Guard had rescued an Indian fishing boat with 11 crew on board off the Kerala coast. The ICG braved rough weather conditions due to heavy rain. A Dornier aircraft had sighted the distressed fishing boat on the night of July 16, PTI quoted defence ministry as saying. The vessel was in a critical condition due to flooding from a hull rupture near the keel and loss of propulsion, which posed a threat to the safety of the crew, the ministry said. Patrolling ICG ship Saksham was immediately diverted by the ICG district headquarters no. 4 (Kerala  Mahe) to assist the vessel. To bolster the efforts, another ICG ship Abhinav was deployed, along with an advanced light helicopter to rescue the crew. A technical ICG team embarked onto the distressed boat, carried out de-flooding operations, and provided necessary assistance. The operation culminated with the rescue of all crew members, and the vessel, the ministry added. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "Trump speaks to Zelensky, pledges to end the war with Russia",
        "date": "July 20, 2024 03:23 pm",
        "content": "US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Friday he had spoken by telephone with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky, and pledged to end the European countrys war with Russia. I appreciate President Zelensky for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity. The United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military assistance for Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 -- though a Trump victory in the November election would put Washingtons continued support into question. Zelensky confirmed the call, during which he congratulated Trump on formally becoming the Republican Partys presidential nominee, as well as wishing the 78-year-old well after an attempt on his life a week ago. We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting, Zelensky said in a post on X. I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nations freedom and independence, he said. Trump-Orban meeting Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end the war very quickly, without offering details as to how. Last week, the ex-president hosted at his Florida estate Hungarys Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month. Trumps frequent praise for Putin and reluctance to outright criticize the Russian invasion have stirred concerns among Ukraines allies that he would force the country into accepting partial defeat. He has also repeatedly suggested backing away from NATO, even undermining the alliances collective defense guarantee by saying he would encourage Russia to attack any members not who had not met their financial obligations. Trumps running mate J.D. Vance leads the isolationist wing of congressional Republicans, who argue the United States should drop aid to Ukraine. Vance was one of the fiercest opponents of the approval of 61 billion in new military aid for Ukraine, which was stalled by Republican lawmakers for months earlier this year -- a time in which Russia made battlefield gains. Trump told the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday that he would bring an end to raging international crises, saying he could stop wars with a telephone call. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, Trump said, without elaborating on how. Zelensky said earlier this week that he and Trump would work together if the Republican won the White House. Im not worried about this, he told a news conference. Zelensky declined to say whether he was worried about US President Joe Biden, who has been facing calls to drop his reelection campaign following a disastrous debate performance and questions over his health and mental acuity. He did, however, acknowledge that turbulence during the US election cycle was having a big impact on his country. Trumps relationship with Zelensky famously goes back to his time in the White House. In 2019, Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to Ukraine while pressuring Zelensky to help him dig up dirt on his election rival Biden -- a race he went on to lose in 2020.

        "date": "July 20, 2024 05:13 pm",
        "content": "Dressed in white robes and colourful tunics, devotees of polytheism each year honour gods on Mount Olympus with ceremonies they say can revive the ethos, rituals and lifestyle of the ancient Greeks. The four-day Prometheia festival has been running since 1996, attracting visitors to the foothills of Mount Olympus, where according to mythology ancient Greek gods lived. Organisers say it aims to infuse ancient Greek values and spirit into modern life. Olympus is the great journey towards Hellenism. It is the abode of the gods and everything starts from here, said 55-year old Georgia Altintasiotou, President of the Cultural Association Prometheus Pyrforos which organises the festival. This year, the July 4-7 festival kicked off with a torch-lighting ceremony and a relay from the archaeological site of Dion to an area called the Prometheus grove. Raising their hands to the sky, pouring wine on the ground and dipping their feet in Enipeas river, participants said they aimed to appease or honour gods or urge deities to purify their souls. Polytheism ... recognises the divine within the world, which manifests itself in many forms, with different entities, the so-called gods and goddesses, said Christos Pandion Panopoulos, a founding member of the religious community conducting some of the rituals. The festival takes its name from Prometheus who, according to mythology, stole fire from the Olympian gods to offer it to humankind. Every element of nature is a god, a goddess, Altintasiotou said. As a Greek woman and as a human being, I have an obligation towards this divine whole, to take care of it, to love it. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
