        "date": "May 7, 2023 06:17 pm",
        "content": "Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes Matheesha Pathirana could become a limited-overs asset for Sri Lanka with a light workload that does not include any test cricket. Operating with a slingy action, Pathirana has proved his death-overs skills in the Indian Premier League (IPL) inviting comparisons with compatriot Lasith Malinga, who troubled the best batters of his time with a similar unconventional action. The 20-year-old claimed 3-15 to set up Chennais six-wicket victory on Saturday, bowling all his overs in the second half of the Mumbai Indians innings. I personally think he is not someone who should play a lot of red-ball cricket, Dhoni said alluding to the rigour of test cricket. I think he shouldnt even get close to it. Even in white-ball cricket, he should play the 50-over version as less as possible. Sri Lanka should use him sporadically and only for showpiece events organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Dhoni said. Make sure he is fit and available for all ICC tournaments and he will be a great asset for Sri Lanka. Not to forget, he is a really young boy. Pathirana has played only one T20 International match and went unsold at the auction ahead of last years IPL before Chennai brought him to replace an injured Adam Milne. The right-arm bowler played just two matches last year but has 10 wickets from seven matches this season with an economy rate of 7.60. I feel he will serve for a very long time for Sri Lankan cricket, but well have to keep an eye on how much he bowls, Dhoni said insisting there was more to Pathiranas bowling than just the odd action. People who dont have very clean (conventional) action, batsmen find it difficult to pick them... That is just on the action part, we are not talking about the pace that he bowls, the variations he has and the consistency he has got. All of it makes him special. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 7, 2023 09:49 pm",
        "content": "Ethnic violence in the Indian state of Manipur has killed more than 50 people, left hundreds hospitalized, and displaced 23,000, according to hospital officials and the Indian army. At least 55 people have been left dead and a further 260 hospitalized since violence broke out between members of the Kuki and Meitei ethnic groups earlier this week, hospital officials in the city of Imphal said on Sunday. The Indian military, meanwhile, said that 23,000 civilians had fled the fighting, with displaced people being housed on military bases and garrisons in the state. The two ethnic groups have been clashing in the streets of Imphal in Indias east and elsewhere. Gunshot wounds are the most common injury, according to officials at Imphal hospitals the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences and Churachandpur District Hospital. Most of the patients are coming in with severe bullet injuries or having been hit in the head with lathis sticks, Dr Mang Hatzow of Churachandpur District Hospital in Manipur told CNN. Video and photos broadcast on local television showed vehicles and buildings set on fire, with thick black smoke billowing from the streets. Indian army troops have been deployed to the streets and a five-day mobile internet blackout is in force. A youth tribal leader who works in Imphal told CNN his house had been vandalized and ransacked on May 4 and that since then he had been staying in an army camp. What we are witnessing here unfortunately is there seems to be a very systematic, well-planned series of attacks. The execution is almost clinical and they know exactly the houses where people from tribal communities reside, said the leader, who asked to not be identified due to fears for his safety. A lot of houses are burnt, all our churches have been vandalized, some have been burnt. I barely escaped  the mob was already in the house. I climbed the fence over to the neighbors house. I just came with my laptop bag to this camp. I dont have anything. He said there were about 5,500 people staying in his camp and that there were about six or seven camps in Imphal in total. There have been so many deaths, he added. A mother and son they were on their way to a camp. On their way, a mob encountered them and beat the son to death. The mother was trying to protect the son, she was killed too. CNN reached out to the state government of Manipur and the Indian army for comment on Sunday. There was no immediate response from the state government. The army said it had rescued a total of 23,000 civilians and moved them to operating bases and military garrisons. It added that there was a ray of hope and a lull in the fighting due to the rescue work carried out by the 120-125 Army and Assam Rifles, which had been working tirelessly for the past 96 hours to rescue civilians across all communities, curb violence and restore normalcy. It said it had also enhanced surveillance efforts using drones and helicopters. Earlier this week the states governor, Anusuiya Uikey, issued shoot-at-sight orders in an effort to bring the situation under control. The orders were authorized for extreme cases whereby all forms of persuasion, warning, reasonable force etc. had been exhausted and the situation could not be controlled, a statement from Manipurs home department said. Skirmishes first broke out after thousands of tribal people took part in a rally organized by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur, against the potential inclusion of the states majority Meitei ethnic group in Indias Scheduled Tribe grouping. The Meitei community, who make up about 50 of the states population, have for years campaigned to be recognized as a scheduled tribe, which would give them access to wider benefits including health, education and government jobs. Scheduled tribes are among the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups in India and have historically been denied access to education and job opportunities. If the Meitei community are given scheduled tribe status, other tribal groups say they fear they will not have a fair chance for jobs and other benefits. Source - CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "An experimental Chinese spacecraft returned to Earth on Monday after staying in orbit for 276 days, Chinas state media reported, completing a landmark mission to test the countrys reusable space technologies. The uncrewed spacecraft returned to the Jiuquan launch centre in northwest China on Monday as scheduled, according to state media. No details were given on what the spacecraft was, what technologies were tested, how high it flew, and where its orbits had taken it since its launch in early August 2022. Images of the craft have also yet to be released to the public. The test marks an important breakthrough in Chinas research into reusable spacecraft technology that will provide a more convenient and inexpensive way to mount future space missions, state media reported. In 2021, what may have been a similar spacecraft flew to the edge of space and returned to Earth on the same day in a mission that was also kept largely under wraps. It landed on Earth horizontally, according to Chinas main space contractor at the time. Commentators on Chinese social media have speculated that Beijing has been developing a spacecraft like the U.S. Air Forces X-37B, an autonomous spaceplane that can remain in orbit for years. The uncrewed and reusable X-37B returned to Earth in November last year in its sixth and latest mission, after more than 900 days in orbit. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Saurona was picked as the butterflies genus name thanks to the black rings on their vivid orange wings, reminiscent of the all-seeing eye described in JRR Tolkiens books, and subsequently depicted in the Lord Of The Rings films and TV series. There are currently only two members of this new group - Saurona triangula and Saurona aurigera - however many more as-yet-undescribed species are thought to exist. Saurona is one of several new butterfly groups described by an international team of researchers in a new paper, and one of two named by Dr Blanca Huertas, senior curator of butterflies at the Natural History Museum. Dr Huertas and a fellow researcher named the second genus Argenteria, which translates into English as silver mine, in reference to the silver scales on the flying insects wings. Dr Huertas said: Naming a genus is not something that happens very often, and its even more rare to be able to name two at once. It was a great privilege to do so, and now means that we can start describing new species that we have uncovered as a result of this research. She added: Giving these butterflies an unusual name helps to draw attention to this underappreciated group. It shows that, even among a group of very similar-looking species, you can find beauty among the dullness. Experts hope that piquing public interest will help pave the way to finding out more about the species, including whether they are endemic to an area, or vulnerable to extinction. Published in a new paper, the findings are the result of a decades worth of work by a team of 30 international scientists, studying the butterfly subtribe Euptychiina. The global collaboration included researchers from Natural History Museum London, Harvard University, Florida Museum of Natural History, and Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig. More than 400 different species were analysed, with the Natural History Museums butterfly collections of more than 5.5 million specimens contributing significantly. Advances in DNA sequencing allowed researchers to identify similar-looking species not only by their appearance but also by their genetics. The butterflies are not the first creatures to be named after Sauron - with a dung beetle, a frog, and a dinosaur already taking the villains moniker. The findings are published in the journal Systematic Entomology. Source  Sky News -Agencies",

        "date": "May 8, 2023 07:06 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Janaka Ratnayake says that the electricity consumers should receive an immediate electricity tariff reduction of approximately 20 percent given the facts of reduced the electricity demand in Sri Lanka, reduced exchange rate and reduced fuel prices. According to the tariff requested by CEB on 5th January this year, CEB had estimated an electricity demand of 16,520 GWh for 2023, expecting a revenue of Rs. 722 billion for CEB, from energy sales. But PUCSL forecasted generation demand of 15,031.42 GWh for 2023, he said. He said the PUCSLs demand forecast has been proven by actual demand for January to April and reduced demand forecasted by CEB for the rest of the year. According to CEBs revised demand forecast, total demand for year 2023 will be 15,377 GWh which is very close to the demand that we forecasted early this year. That was the main rationale in our staffs tariff recommendation which limited a tariff increase below 35. Mr Ratnayake said. The PUCSL chairman claims that this proves the 35 percent tariff increase suggested by the staff of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka is in par with the actual demand forecast which didnt materialized due to the majority of the Commission members approving the CEB proposal as it is. The latest forecast by CEB shows a reduction of 6 from the initial forecast in January. Actual data shows in months March and April, the actual generation to be 10 and 8 less than the initial forecast by CEB. Accordingly, the latest forecast also on the higher side and actual demand for 2023 can be even lower. Therefore, the actual total revenue of 2023 for the distribution licensees could be lower than Rs. 658 billion, if we were able to implement PUCSLs staff recommended low tariff hike, we wouldnt need frequent tariff revisions and such low tariff will ensure and stimulate the economic activities while ensuring CEBs yield sufficient revenue, Mr Ratnayake added. Given all those facts, we demand an immediate reduction of electricity tariff of 20 percent, he said.",

        "content": "Several investigation teams have been deployed in order to arrest the main suspect wanted by police in relation to the discovery of the body of a 16-year-old schoolgirl near a hotel in Kalutara. Speaking at a press conference this afternoon (08), Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa stated that the relevant suspect, who is currently evading arrest, has already been identified by the police. Police mentioned that the 28-year-old suspect in question is a resident of Kalutara, while it has also been uncovered that he is married. Meanwhile, SSP Thalduwa emphasized that the investigation officers will take measures to obtain an overseas travel ban, according to future requirements. However, police have arrested the young couple including another schoolgirl (19) and a young man (22), and also the driver of the car in which the group including the deceased girl had arrived at the hotel in question. They were ordered to be remanded in custody until May 15, after being produced before the Kalutara Magistrates Court yesterday (May 07). Police have also taken custody of the car in which they travelled to the hotel. Investigations have revealed that the National Identity Card (NIC) produced by the 16-year-old girl in order to rent a room at the hotel, had been obtained from one of her friends. Furthermore, SSP Thalduwa raised concerns that even if a fake NIC was presented by the victim, it would have been clear to the hotel employees that the girl in question and the photograph in the NIC did not match, if they had checked it properly. The Police Media Spokesman further emphasized that accordingly, separate investigations are being carried out regarding the hotel in question. In addition, an open verdict was given after submitting the girls body to the coroner, the police said. So far, it has not been confirmed whether the incident was a suicide or a murder, while investigations are underway presuming it was a murder, SSP Thalduwa added.",

        "title": "Several firms have shown interest to buy SriLankan Airlines, says CEO",
        "date": "May 8, 2023 09:51 pm",
        "content": "SriLankan Airlines is in a race to restore flight frequencies and increase the number of aircraft in service by replacing the ones that are going off-lease by mid-next year. The GCC markets, especially Dubai and the UAE, remain vital for the airline to achieve at least some - if not all - of these goals, said its CEO Richard Nuttall. It will continue to be hard work as the airline has been struggling with legacy issues surrounding its financial viability. At the same time, there is also the broader context of the country itself having to rebuild its economy. But Nuttall is quite clear of what the airline needs to be doing. SriLankan Airlines has to double its capacities on its high demand routes. The airline operates 43 daily flights to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Riyadh, and Kuwait, serving predominantly Sri Lankan expats. This is much less capacity than pre-Covid operations of twice daily flights from all these destinations, said Dimuthu Tennakoon, Head of Worldwide Sales and Distribution of SriLankan Airlines. Leisure traffic has to pick up because there is a growing demand for tourism to Sri Lanka from this region. Nuttal said SriLankan Airlines cannot copy the financial models of other carriers, especially those in the Gulf. We need to identify where we can compete and where we cannot, he added. The challenge is that theres not enough supply of airline seats. So, the yields are quite high. Which actually might not be great for consumers. But its quite good for airlines trying to restore balance-sheets after pandemic times. Non-stop flights are also an advantage for some travellers, and SriLankan Airlines is focusing on flying eastwards to the Gulf where they can get their fair share of point-to-point traffic. They also plan to codeshare with Gulf carriers to boost Sri Lanka as a hub, said Nuttal. Selling the airline? Last year, the Sri Lankan government agreed to restructure and partially privatise several state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including the airline, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The first step is to find a way to restructure the companys balance-sheet. The government established a State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SRU) under the Ministry of Finance to help privatise SOEs working with international contractors. At some stage during that process, we will ask for Expressions of Interest for buying the airline, said Nuttall. When asked if any prospective buyers approached the airline for a takeover, including Indias Tata Group (the owners of Air India), he said, There have been a couple (of buyers) who said they might be interested, but all we are saying to everyone at this moment is they need to wait until the company balance-sheet is restructured. I think there is interest (to buy the airline). The Sri Lankan government would like to complete the (balance-sheet restructuring) process by the end of the year though I think that may be optimistic. Losing pilots The airline is also struggling to retain talent, losing several of its technical staff and pilots to GCC carriers, said Nuttal. He explained, It is a concern, but were still OK. Fleet numbers are limited at the moment. Were starting cadet prograns, and we are recruiting expatriates. New fleet The airline operated under harsh conditions last year amid scarce jet fuel supplies. SriLankan Airlines spent around 20 million on fuel in January 2022, accounting for 25 per cent of the costs. However, when fuel prices skyrocketed in July and August, and there were supply issues in the country, fuel costs went up to over 40 million. Currently, fuel costs have gone down to just over 30 million, and as long as they remain stable, we should be able to manage our expenses, said Nuttal. Any sudden and significant increases in fuel prices would pose a challenge for us as it takes time to adjust fares accordingly. The airline is also struggling to get its fleet of 23 aircraft back up in the air because it is finding it hard to procure engines, particularly for its A320Neos. We have 18 aircraft flying and four that are on the ground due to engine problems and one thats under heavy maintenance, Nuttal said. The airline has placed a request for proposal to lease five Airbus A330 aircraft and five A320 jets to grow its fleet size to 27 by mid-2024. Source: Gulf News --Agencies",

        "date": "May 9, 2023 12:39 am",
        "content": "The 2023 Asia Cup that is scheduled to take place later this year is set to move from Pakistan to Sri Lanka, a report in The Indian Express said on Monday. The likelihood of the tournament being shifted from Pakistan had increased recently, with BCCI secretary Jay Shah even stating that they refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan over lack of government clearance. According to the report, Pakistans participation in the event is unclear, with reports saying that Pakistan could even boycott the event, scheduled to be held from September 2-17. Following BCCIs refusal to travel to Pakistan citing lack of government clearance, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had proposal for a hybrid model to host the tournament. In such a model, India would have played their matches in Dubai. That proposal, however, hardly received any backing with the tournaments official broadcasters even being concerned with it. The report also claims that Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have supported this idea of moving the tournament out of Pakistan and a decision on it is expected to be taken at the end of this month. The report goes onto add that Oman had also offered to host the Asia Cup, but Sri Lanka had been considered an option keeping the conditions. It would be peak summer in September in the UAE, and the teams reportedly had reservations on playing a 50-over tournament in the Gulf region a month prior to the event. Najam Sethi (PCB chairman) was in Dubai today to procure support but to his horror there were no takers for his proposal of Pakistan playing its games in Karachi or Lahore and India playing in UAE. Sri Lanka was always with BCCI and now even Bangladesh Cricket Board seemed opposed to the idea, an ACC source told PTI. ACC has always maintained that in principle the hybrid model is unacceptable and the budgetary sanctions can never be passed. Also its not about Pakistan hosting its own matches. It also means that if India and Pakistan are in same group, the third team will be travelling to and fro between Dubai and a city in Pakistan, the source added. What added fuel to the fire is PCBs recent decision to host Pakistan Super Leagues matches in UAE due to escalated costs of security arrangements. Also logistically, the broadcasters wouldnt want to send separate units in two countries. Sri Lanka, just like UAE doesnt require inter-city flights whether you play at the Khettarama (Premadasa Stadium), SSC or Galle or Kandy, he added. However the ACC chairman Jay Shah will need to convene an Executive Body meeting to make the decision official. In the prevailing situation, whether Pakistan participates in the event or decides against coming to India for the World Cup remains to be seen. Even ICC wont agree to Pakistan playing its matches outside India (during World Cup). So lets see what PCB decides, the source added. Sri Lanka are the defending champions of the Asia Cup, having clinched the title in 2022, when it was played in the T20 format. With inputs from agencies Source: The Indian ExpressPTI",

He had been arrested by police in the Hikkaduwa area, a short while ago. The 29-year-old person had allegedly accompanied the teenage girl, who was later found dead near the railway track, to the hotel room in Kalutara. Based on the information received by Kalutara HQI Ruwan Wijesinghe that the suspect is hiding in the Galle area, a group of crime division officers headed by Crime Division OIC Inspector Dhammka Silva had carried out the raid in Hikkaduwa area. Accordingly, the suspect had been arrested while he is expected to be produced before the Kalutara Magistrates Court to obtain detention orders. The arrested suspect has been identified as Danushka Gayan Sahabandu, a 29-year-old resident of Isuru Uyana in Kalutara. Sri Lanka Police yesterday revealed that several investigation teams had been deployed in order to arrest the main suspect wanted by police in relation to the discovery of the naked body of a 16-year-old schoolgirl on the rail track near a hotel in Kalutara.

The deceased girl was identified to be aged 16 and a resident of the Nagoda area in Kalutara, while the body had been identified by the parents of the deceased. Information has been uncovered that the girl in question had come to the place of the incident with another young couple and a young male, and that they had rented two rooms on the third floor and stayed there. However, an employee of the hotel had witnessed that all four were drinking alcohol in one room, although they had rented two rooms in the hotel. Later, the young couple had left the hotel, and the hotel employees had witnessed the other young male leaving the hotel in a panic after about 20 minutes. A person, who came to the hotel later on, had informed the hotel staff that a woman was lying naked on the railway track near the hotel. After notifying the police regarding the matter, a team of police officers had arrived at the location and checked on the girl in question, however it had been revealed that she had already died. Later, the young couple who had arrived at the hotel along with the deceased girl had surrendered to police, while another person was arrested on May 07 in connection with the death of the teenage girl.

Japan, which initiated the launch together with India and France, has invited all bilateral creditors, including the largest, China, though Japanese officials said it was uncertain whether it would join the talks. The reason was not immediately clear, although one of the officials felt Beijing could be weighing the merit of participation. Last month France, India and Japan unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Sri Lanka owes 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, government data show, with 3 billion owed to China, followed by 2.4 billion to the Paris Club and 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and 2.7 billion on other commercial loans. Sri Lanka has kicked off talks to rework part of its domestic debt and aims to finalise the deal by May. - Reuters - Agencies",

Cabinet spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena revealed this while addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing this morning (May 09). The ministers made this request a day ahead of the one-year commemoration of the violent unrest on May 09.

The Cabinet spokesperson went on to highlight the downside of not having laws to take action against such violent protesters who violate fundamental human rights. Violence broke out across the country after the supporters of the ruling party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) attacked the anti-government protesters camped at the Aragalaya protest site in Colombo on May 09, 2022. Amidst the unrest, angry mobs also attacked and set fire to the private residences and properties of politicians.",

The credit line, part of about 4 billion in emergency assistance extended by India during the peak of Sri Lankas financial crisis early last year, was scheduled to end in March. Post-negotiations, the credit line was extended until March 2024, said Sri Lankas Deputy Treasury Secretary Priyantha Rathnayake. There is about 350 million left of the credit line that can be utilised as needed, he said. However, given the increase of foreign exchange availability in the market, the need is not as keen as it was last year. Reuters reported in March that Sri Lanka was negotiating with India to extend the facility, used so far mainly for medicines and food. Sri Lankas reserves dropped to record lows in April last year, triggering its worst financial crisis since independence from British colonial rule in 1948. The island, off Indias southern coast, spent months struggling to pay for essential imports such as fuel, cooking gas and medicine and defaulted on its foreign debt. The situation has now improved with Sri Lanka finalising a nearly 3 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund in March and kicking off debt restructuring talks with key bilateral creditors India, Japan and China. Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves hit 2.7 billion at the end of last month. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

The new AI platform launch comes over a decade after IBMs software called Watson got attention for winning the game show Jeopardy. IBM at the time said Watson could learn and process human language. But Watsons high cost at the time made it a challenge for companies to use, according to Reuters reporting. Fast forward a decade, chatbot ChatGPTs overnight success is making AI adoption at companies a focus, and IBM is looking to grab new business. This time, the lower cost of implementing the large language AI models means the chances of success are high, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Reuters ahead of the companys annual Think conference. When something becomes 100 times cheaper, it really sets up an attraction thats very, very different, said Krishna. The first barrier to create the model is high, but once youve done that, to adapt that model for a hundred or a thousand different tasks is very easy and can be done by a non-expert. Krishna said AI could reduce certain back office jobs at IBM in the coming years. That doesnt mean the total employment decreases, he said about some media reports talking about IBM pausing hiring for thousands of jobs that AI could replace. That gives the ability to plow a lot more investment into value-creating activities...We hired more people than were let go because were hiring into areas where there is a lot more demand from our clients. He added that IBM was also embracing a more open ecosystem and partnering with open-source AI software development hub Hugging Face and others. IBM said companies can use the watsonx platform to train and deploy AI models, automatically generate code using natural language and use various large language models built for different purposes such as chemical creation or climate change modeling.

He was identified as a 29-year-old named Danushka Gayan Sahabandu from Isuru Uyana in Kalutara. After learning that the suspect was planning to arrive in Ambalangoda to hire a car in the early hours of the day, the Kalutara South Police launched an extensive operation to apprehend him by deploying an undercover officer who was posing as the car renter. Rs. 95,000 in cash was also found on the suspect at the time of the arrest. After he was brought to the Kalutara South police for onward legal proceedings, the 29-year-old pleaded innocent, claiming that the teenage girl was not murdered but she had, in fact, jumped off the hotel building. In his statement, the suspect further mentioned he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to meeting her for the first time on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old who is currently in custody in connection with the incident. The naked body of the 16-year-old was found on May 06 near the five-storey hotel building, located next to the railway tracks in Kalutara. The 29-year-old told the police that he visited the hotel on May 06 along with another young couple and the 16-year-old girl after renting two rooms on the third floor. He also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. Later, the young couple left the hotel premises, while the suspect stayed behind with the schoolgirl. In his statement given to the police, the suspect confessed that they have had no sexual intercourse, despite being intimate with one another. According to him, the teen, in the interim, had received a call during which she yelled at the caller using foul words. Soon after the call ended, she climbed onto the chair next to the window and jumped off the building following which he left the hotel premises in a state of panic, the suspect further told the police. However, the police said further investigations are underway to ascertain the veracity of the arrestees statement. In the meantime, the young couple  a girl aged 19 and a 22-year-old male  who were with the main suspect and the deceased girl were later arrested after they surrendered to the police. Meanwhile, another person, identified as the driver of the car in which the group arrived at the hotel, is also currently under arrest. The trio has been put behind bars on remand until May 15 after being produced before Kalutara Magistrates Court. Probes into the incident revealed that the National Identity Card (NIC) produced by the 16-year-old girl in order to rent a room at the hotel, in fact, belongs to one of her friends. Meanwhile, the investigators are looking into the mobile phone records of the deceased girl to find out more about the alleged telephone call she received while she was with the suspect. They also uncovered that the 22-year-old youth in custody had discarded the schoolgirls mobile phone into the Kalu River soon after her heath. According to the police, the medical reports indicated that the deceased student had not been sexually assaulted prior to her death.",

        "date": "May 9, 2023 11:54 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Supreme Court has given the green light to a bill seeking to decriminalise homosexuality, the Speaker of Parliament said on Tuesday, in a move hailed as a historic development by campaigners. LGBTQ rights activists in Sri Lanka have been campaigning for years to change the law in a country where homosexuality is still punishable by a prison sentence and a fine, leading to the private members bill presented in parliament last month. The Supreme Court, after hearing more than a dozen petitions on both sides of the argument, ruled it was not unconstitutional, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said. The Supreme Court is of the opinion that the bill as a whole or as any provision thereof is not inconsistent with the constitution, the speaker told parliament. The decision is seen as a historic development that has created hope towards real change, said Kaveesha Coswatte attorney-at-law and advocacy officer for iProbono in Sri Lanka, which supported many of the petitions backing the bill. Activists will still have to lobby for support from the 225 parliamentarians to push forward the proposed legislation through parliament. Neither the government nor the opposition have made any comment on whether they support the bill, proposed for consideration by an individual member of parliament, so the next steps for it to eventually become legislation, or not, are not yet clear. But the door is finally open. This Supreme Court decision is major for the community in terms of any kind of progress they have seen over the last couple of years, Coswatte added.

        "content": "Sri Lankan authorities formally presented on Tuesday a request for debt treatment in the first meeting of the official bilateral creditors committee, the Paris Club said in a statement. The committee, co-chaired by India, Japan and France, consists of 17 members and includes Paris Club creditors as well as other official bilateral creditors. Paris Club members with no claims on Sri Lanka as well as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were observers to the meeting, according to the statement. The meeting, within a new framework launched in Washington D.C. in April that creditors hope will serve as a model to resolve the debt difficulties of middle-income economies, was held online. Japan, which initiated the launch together with India and France, had invited all bilateral creditors, including the largest, China. Last month, France, India and Japan unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, government data show, with USD 3 billion owed to China, followed by USD 2.4 billion to the Paris Club of creditor nations and USD 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than USD 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and USD 2.7 billion of other commercial loans. Sri Lanka has kicked off talks to rework part of its domestic debt and aims to finalise a deal by May. -with inputs from Reuters",

Police said that a lorry, a van and a three-wheeler have also been taken into custody over the incident. The deceased has been identified as Dilshan Ranga Kumara, a 27-year-old resident of Badowita in Mount Lavinia.

        "title": "Jury finds Donald Trump liable for sexual abuse, awards accuser 5M",
        "date": "May 10, 2023 07:50 am",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  A jury found Donald Trump liable Tuesday for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her 5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House. The verdict was announced in a federal courtroom in New York City on the first day of deliberations. Jurors rejected Carrolls claim that she was raped, but found Trump liable for sexual abuse and for defaming Carroll after she made her allegations public. Trump chose not to attend the civil trial and was absent when the verdict was read. Carroll nodded as the verdict was read. Afterward, her lawyers put their arms around her, and she hugged supporters in the gallery, smiling through tears. Trumps lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, shook hands with Carroll and hugged her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. As the courtroom cleared, Carroll could be heard laughing and crying. Trump immediately lashed out with a statement on his social media site, claiming again that he does not know Carroll and referring to the verdict as a disgrace and a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time. Speaking outside of court, Tacopina described the jurys verdict as inconsistent and strange. He says Trump will move forward with the appeals process. Hes firm in his belief, as many people are, that he did not get a fair trial in New York City, Tacopina said of Trump, later adding: Hes got a town hall tomorrow night, and hes moving forward as he always does. When asked about Trump not attending the trial, Tacopina replied: What more could he say other than I didnt do it. Calling the court a circus atmosphere, Tacopina said hes not happy he (Trump) was found liable for anything whatsoever. The trials outcome was a validation for Carroll, one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. She went public in 2019 with her allegation that the Republican raped her in the dressing room of a posh Manhattan department store. Trump, 76, denied it, saying he never encountered Carroll at the store and did not know her. He has called her a nut job who invented a fraudulent and false story to sell a memoir. Carroll, 79, had sought unspecified damages, plus a retraction of what she said were Trumps defamatory denials of her claims. Counsel Roberta Kaplan said Carroll is thrilled about the jurys findings. No one is above the law, not even a former President of the United States, Kaplan said in part, later adding: This is a victory not only for E. Jean Carroll, but for democracy itself, and for all survivors everywhere. Carroll said the lawsuit was about getting her life back. I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed, Carroll said, in part. The trial revisited the lightning-rod topic of Trumps conduct toward women. Carroll gave multiple days of frank, occasionally emotional testimony, buttressed by two friends who told jurors she reported the alleged attack to them in the moments and day afterward. Jurors also heard from Jessica Leeds, a former stockbroker who testified that Trump abruptly groped her against her will on an airplane in the 1970s, and from Natasha Stoynoff, a writer who said Trump forcibly kissed her against her will while she was interviewing him for a 2005 article. The six-man, three-woman jury also saw the well-known 2005 Access Hollywood hot mic recording of Trump talking about kissing and grabbing women without asking. The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll, Leeds and Stoynoff have done. The verdict comes as Trump is facing an accelerating swirl of legal risks. Hes fighting a New York criminal case related to hush money payments made to a porn actor. The state attorney general has sued him, his family and his business over alleged financial wrongdoing. Trump is also contending with investigations elsewhere into his possible mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump denies wrongdoing in all of those matters. Carroll, who penned an Elle magazine advice column for 27 years, has also written for magazines and Saturday Night Live. She and Trump were in social circles that overlapped at a 1987 party, where a photo documented them and their then-spouses interacting. Trump has said he doesnt remember it. According to Carroll, she ended up in a dressing room with Trump after they ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman on an unspecified Thursday evening in spring 1996. They took an impromptu jaunt to the lingerie department so he could search for a womens gift, and soon were teasing each other about trying on a skimpy bodysuit, Carroll testified. To her, it seemed like comedy, something like her 1986 Saturday Night Live sketch in which a man admires himself in a mirror. But then, she said, Trump slammed the door, pinned her against a wall, planted his mouth on hers, yanked her tights down and raped her as she tried to break away. Carroll said she ultimately pushed him off with her knee and immediately left the store. I always think back to why I walked in there to get myself in that situation, she testified, her voice breaking, but Im proud to say I did get out. She soon confided in two friends, according to her and them. But she never called police or told anyone else  or noted it in her diary  until her memoir was published in 2019. Carroll said she kept silent out of fear that Trump would retaliate, out of shame and out of a sense that other people quietly denigrate rape victims and see them as somewhat responsible for being attacked. Trump weighed in on the case from afar, branding it a made up SCAM in a social media post early in the trial. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan called the comments entirely inappropriate and warned that the ex-president could cause himself more legal woes if he kept it up. Tacopina told the jury Carroll made up her claims after hearing about a 2012 Law and Order episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store. Carroll cannot produce any objective evidence to back up her claim because it didnt happen, he told jurors. He accused her of advancing a false claim of rape for money, for political reasons and for status. In questioning Carroll, he sought to cast doubt on her description of fighting off the far heavier Trump without dropping her handbag or ripping her tights, and without anyone around to hear or see them in the upscale retailers lingerie section. The lawyer pressed her about  by her own account  not screaming, looking for help while fleeing the store, or seeking out medical attention, security video or the police. Carroll reproached him. Im telling you he raped me, whether I screamed or not, she said. Theres no possibility of Trump being charged with attacking Carroll, as the legal time limit has long since passed. For similar reasons, she initially filed her civil case as a defamation lawsuit, saying Trumps derogatory denials had subjected her to hatred, shredded her reputation and harmed her career. Then, starting last fall, New York state gave people a chance to sue over sexual assault allegations that would otherwise be too old. Carroll was one of the first to file.

        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says a team of its staff will be visiting Sri Lanka from May 11-23. This visit comes as part of the regular consultations between the global lender and the island nation, ahead of the first review mission later this year. IMFs Director of Asia and Pacific Department, Krishna Srinivasan will be joining this visit from May 12-15. The IMF staff team will convene a press briefing on Monday evening (May 15) in Colombo, chaired by Krishna Srinivasan, the IMFs Director of Asia and Pacific Department; Peter Breuer, the Asia and Pacific Departments Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka; and Sarwat Jahan, the IMF Resident Representative in Sri Lanka. The IMF staff teams visit comes days after the first meeting of Sri Lankas official bilateral creditors committee, during which the island nations authorities formally presented a request for debt treatment. China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in attendance as observers. The committee, co-chaired by India, Japan and France, consists of 17 members and includes Paris Club creditors as well as other official bilateral creditors. Last month, France, India and Japan unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, government data show, with USD 3 billion owed to China, followed by USD 2.4 billion to the Paris Club of creditor nations and USD 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than USD 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and USD 2.7 billion of other commercial loans. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of the IMF approved by its executive board in March comes with strict conditionalities for economic reforms. Sri Lanka had to secure assurances from official bilateral creditors that they would help debt relief andor financing to restore debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported EFF program, as well as an assessment that the authorities are making good faith efforts to reach a private agreement with private creditors. As these requirements were met ahead of the IMF Board meeting in March, the IMF approved the 48-month extended arrangement of 2.286 billion SDR (Special Drawing Rights), which amounts to USD 3 billion, for Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities are now working closely with its creditors to coordinate and make swift progress towards the debt treatment that restores debt sustainability under the EFF program.",

They were handpicked as finalists for the compelling visual narrative documenting public fury over Sri Lankas economic collapse, including clashes between the protesters and police, the takeover of government buildings and jubilation as protesters occupied the plush presidential mansion. The AP images from Sri Lanka captured the full range of human emotion: Protesters pumping their fists in the air shouting anti-government slogans, shielding themselves from tear gas and water cannons, crowds of Sri Lankans storming the office of the prime minister after the president fled the country and others celebrating inside the presidents official residence by jumping in the pool and using the gym equipment. Eranga Jayawardena, born April 11, 1978 and brought up in Colombo, and has been a witness and a recorder though news photography of key natural, socio-political and entertainment events for more than 20 years of his life. Jayawardena, in 1996, started taking up assignments while still at school for major local newspapers in Colombo and they mostly comprised of politically motivated ethnicity based violent events. In 2002 Jayawardena joined Associated Press and has been responsible for the photographic coverage of Sri Lanka and neighbouring Maldives. He has covered the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, Sri Lankas brutal civil war and human rights issues, Commonwealth Games 2010 held in New Delhi, London Olympics in 2012, ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, Public referendum in the Maldives to transform the state into a multi-party democracy after 30 years of one-part rule are some of his significant assignments that got a global reach. Jayawardena is a diplomate in photography earned from the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka and has masters qualifications in Economic Development, Conflict and Peace Studies from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Rafiq Maqbool is a staff photographer for Associated Press and has been based in Mumbai, India since 2009. For AP, he has covered some of South Asias most troubled hotspots including his homeland of Kashmir. Maqbool was in Sri Lanka in 2005 to cover the tsunami-affected areas, in 2009 to cover the end of the Sri Lankan civil war and most recently in 2022, to document yet again, another political upheaval in the country. The Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography in 2023 went to the photography staff of the Associated Press for the unique and urgent images from the first weeks of Russias invasion of Ukraine, including the devastation of Mariupol after other news organizations left, victims of the targeting of civilian infrastructure and the resilience of the Ukrainian people who were able to flee. -with inputs from agencies Protesters storm then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes office, demanding his resignation after former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country amid economic crisis in Colombo, Sri Lanka, July 13, 2022.

Representing the defendant, Attorney-at-Law Sarath Karawita, quoting the medical officer, told the court that it has been determined that the death of the schoolgirl is not a murder, but a suicide. The defence attorney questioned as to why his client is being detained for 48 hours even after he presented all facts to the police. In response, Sub-Inspector K.N.A.G.D. Bandara said the suspect needs to be questioned further and that a blood sample needs to be obtained from him to ascertain whether he had consumed alcohol on that day. The case will be called before Kalutara Magistrates Court again on May 12. During the interrogations following his arrest, the suspect dismissed the murder accusations and told police that the teen had jumped off the window of the hotel room they were staying at. In his statement, the suspect further mentioned he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to meeting her for the first time on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old who is currently in custody in connection with the incident. The naked body of the 16-year-old was found on May 06 near the five-storey hotel building, located next to the railway tracks in Kalutara. The 29-year-old told the police that he visited the hotel on May 06 along with another young couple and the 16-year-old girl after renting two rooms on the third floor. He had also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. Later, the young couple left the hotel premises, while the suspect stayed behind with the schoolgirl. In his initial statement given to the police, the suspect confessed that they have had no sexual intercourse, despite being intimate with one another. According to him, the teen, in the interim, had received a call during which she chided at the caller using foul words. Soon after the call ended, she climbed onto the chair next to the window and jumped off the building following which he left the hotel premises in a state of panic, the suspect further told the police. young couple  a girl aged 19 and a 22-year-old male  who were with the main suspect and the deceased girl were later arrested after they surrendered to the police. Meanwhile, another person, identified as the driver of the car in which the group arrived at the hotel, is also currently under arrest. The trio has been put behind bars on remand until May 15 after being produced before Kalutara Magistrates Court. Probes into the incident revealed that the National Identity Card (NIC) produced by the 16-year-old girl in order to rent a room at the hotel, in fact, belongs to one of her friends. Meanwhile, the investigators are looking into the mobile phone records of the deceased girl to find out more about the alleged telephone call she received while she was with the suspect. They also uncovered that the 22-year-old youth in custody had discarded the schoolgirls mobile phone into the Kalu River soon after her heath. According to the police, the medical reports have indicated that the deceased student had not been sexually assaulted prior to her death.",

        "title": "Several countries issue travel advisories as violent clashes erupt in Pakistan",
        "date": "May 10, 2023 01:21 pm",
        "content": "Supporters of Imran Khan were planning to march to Islamabad on Wednesday where the former Pakistan prime minister is in custody in a corruption case, raising fears of more clashes with security forces. Mobile data services in the country were shut while Twitter, YouTube and Facebook were disrupted. Television carried watered-down coverage of violence that erupted on Tuesday. Authorities in three of Pakistans four provinces have imposed an emergency order banning all gatherings after Khans supporters clashed with police. Khan was arrested from the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday by Pakistans anti-corruption agency. Police said a court hearing would take place at the police guest house where he is being held. The arrest came a day after the countrys powerful military rebuked Khan for repeatedly accusing a senior military officer of trying to engineer his assassination and the former armed forces chief of being behind his removal from power last year. Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told broadcaster Geo News on Wednesday that the protests were not a public response to Khans arrest but a planned move by his party. Her remarks came after Khans supporters clashed with police in many cities on Tuesday and stormed military buildings in Lahore and Rawalpindi, according to witnesses and videos shared by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which has called for a shutdown across the country. Scores of buildings were set on fire ... they attacked official buildings and private houses, Aurangzeb said. Pakistans Dawn newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the nature and locus of the protests that broke out following Mr Khans arrest yesterday signal that public anger is also directed at the military. Khan will appear for two hearings on Wednesday, Geo News reported, including for a corruption case related to property and another case that alleges Khan unlawfully sold state gifts during his 2018-22 tenure as premier. His arrest threatens to worsen political turmoil in the nuclear-armed country of 220 million people that is struggling with its worst economic crisis in decades with record high inflation and depleting foreign exchange reserves. SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE An International Monetary Fund bailout package has been delayed for months even though foreign exchange reserves are barely enough to cover a months imports. Khans supporters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were asked to gather early on Wednesday in Swabi city to leave for Islamabad as part of a convoy, his party wrote on Twitter. PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the partys senior leadership was in Islamabad to meet Khan and will approach the Supreme Court to challenge an Islamabad High Court order that deemed Khans arrest legal. We continue to call PTI family workers, supporters and the people of Pakistan onto the streets for peaceful protest against this unconstitutional behaviour, Qureshi wrote on Twitter. Following Tuesdays protests, Canada has asked its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution in travel to Pakistan while the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad has cancelled all consular appointments on Wednesday. A police spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday that Khan will not be brought to court and his scheduled hearing will take place at the location where he is being held under custody in the Islamabad police lines area. At least one person was killed on Tuesday and 12 others injured, including six police officers, in clashes in the southern city of Quetta, provincial home minister Ziaullah Langove said. The protests have disrupted business in several cities. In Peshawar, chicken seller Malagul Khan said his shop and others were destroyed in the clashes. Raja Imran, 25, also a Peshawar resident, said, There is total chaos across the country ... There are exams going on and school children will suffer. Khan, 70, a cricket hero-turned-politician, was ousted as prime minister in April 2022 in a parliamentary no-confidence vote. Khan has not slowed his campaign against the ouster even though he was wounded in a November attack on his convoy as he led a protest march to Islamabad calling for snap general elections. The corruption case is one of more than 100 registered against Khan since his ouster after four years in power. In most of the cases, Khan faces being barred from holding public office if convicted, with a national election scheduled for November. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

A total of 14 individuals were arrested over the relevant incident which had taken place last night (May 09), while the police had also taken custody of a lorry, a van and a three-wheeler in relation to the incident. The deceased has been identified as Dilshan Ranga Kumara, a 27-year-old resident of Badowita in Mount Lavinia. Police officers said that the suspects had claimed that two persons who had allegedly trespassed to an air conditioning repair centre in the Dehiwala area were beaten, restrained and detained while trying to escape and were then handed over to the police. After the suspects had brought the two persons to the police in a lorry, the police officers had taken steps to hospitalize the two persons who were in critical condition by then. However, police investigations have uncovered that while the victim had been walking on the road, he was taken to the repair center, beaten and detained by the group suspecting that the victim had entered the air conditioner repair center. It has been further revealed that they had forced the youth to make a phone call to the mobile phone of the other person who came with him and got him down to the place where he was also beaten and detained. The police also said that the suspects were brutally beaten and the scene of the crime was subsequently washed and cleaned by the suspects.

        "date": "May 10, 2023 05:33 pm",
        "content": "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan can be held for questioning for eight days, a court ruled Wednesday, a day after the countrys popular opposition leader was dragged from a courtroom and arrested. His detention set off clashes between his supporters and police Tuesday, leaving at least four people dead. On Wednesday, angry protesters stormed and set fire to a building housing Radio Pakistan in the northwest. The 70-year-old politician lost power last year but remains the countrys most popular opposition figure. He is the seventh former prime minister to be arrested in Pakistan. His dramatic arrest on Tuesday deepened the political turmoil. Two people were killed first, one Tuesday in the southwestern city of Quetta and another in the northwestern city of Peshawar overnight. Two more were in clashes with police Wednesday in Peshawar. In eastern Punjab province, where authorities said 157 police officers were injured in clashes with Khan supporters, the local government asked the army to step in and restore order. Pakistans GEO television broadcast footage showing Khan appearing before a judge at a temporary court inside a police compound Wednesday. The former premier was seen seated in a chair, holding documents. He appeared calm but tired. Earlier, the National Accountability Bureau requested 14-day detention of Khan, but the tribunal said authorities could keep him in their custody for eight days. Meanwhile, Khans legal team challenged his arrest before the Islamabad High Court, seeking his release. Also in Peshawar, Khans supporters raided the building housing Radio Pakistan, damaging equipment and setting fire to it, said police official Naeem Khan. Some of the employees were trapped inside, he said, and police were trying to restore order. Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party had called for demonstrators to remain peaceful, hours after mobs angered over the dramatic arrest set fire to the residence of a top army general in the eastern city of Lahore. When he was arrested on Tuesday, Khan was appearing in court on multiple graft charges brought by Islamabad police. As he showed up in court, dozens of agents from the National Accountability Bureau backed by paramilitary troops stormed the courtroom, breaking windows after Khans guards refused to open the door. Khans supporters attacked the militarys headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi near the capital, Islamabad, but did not reach the main building housing the offices of army chief Gen. Asim Munir. Other demonstrators tried to reach the prime ministers residence in Lahore, but were driven off by baton-wielding in police. Others attacked vehicles carrying troops and hit armed soldiers with sticks. So far, police and soldiers have not fired at protesters. The military has not commented on the attacks on its facilities. None of the leaders from Khans party denounced the attacks on the military. A police statement Wednesday said officers in eastern Punjab province arrested 945 Khan supporters since Tuesday  including Asad Umar, a senior leader from Khans party. Dozens of Khan supporters were also detained in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar and elsewhere. Shah Mahmood Qureshi, senior vice president from Khans party, appealed for peaceful demonstrations Wednesday, urging followers: Dont damage public property, dont attack offices, as we are peace lovers. He said the party is considering challenging Khans arrest in the Supreme Court. By morning, police said some 2,000 protesters still surrounded the fire-damaged residence in Lahore of Lt. Gen. Salman Fayyaz Ghani, a top regional commander. They chanted slogans at the military, including Khan is our red line and you have crossed it. Ghani and his family members were moved to a safer place when the mob on Tuesday first attacked their sprawling house. Police deployed in force across the country, and placed shipping containers on a road leading to the sprawling police compound in Islamabad where Khan is being held and where he appeared before a judge at the temporary court placed there for security reasons, according to the government. Amid violence, Pakistans telecommunication authority on Tuesday blocked social media, including Twitter. The government also suspended internet service in Islamabad and other cities. Classes at some private schools were canceled for Wednesday. Rights group Amnesty International said it was alarmed by reports of Pakistani authorities blocking access to mobile internet networks and social media  Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are suspended for a second day. Amnesty urged authorities to show restraint, saying clashes between law enforcement and Khans supporters risk human rights violations. The National Accountability Bureau has detained and investigated former officials, including former prime ministers, politicians and retired military officers. But some view the NAB as a tool used by those in power, especially the military, to crack down on political opponents. When Khan was in power, his government arrested Shahbaz Sharif, then the opposition leader, through the NAB. Sharif was facing multiple corruption cases when he managed to oust Khan in a 2022 no-confidence vote. The charges were later dropped, citing a lack of evidence. Prime Minister Sharif returned to Pakistan on Wednesday from a U.K. trip and was to hold a Cabinet meeting on the latest developments. His brother, Nawaz Sharif, who also served as prime minister, was arrested several times on corruption allegations. In March, police stormed Khans Lahore residence, seeking to arrest him in a corruption case related to hiding income from the sale of official gifts. Later Wednesday, Khan appeared in a different courtroom at the high security court and was indicted in the lingering graft case, pleading not guilty, local media said. As violence spread, diplomats from various countries and common people in Pakistan stayed home. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad canceled all its Wednesday consular appointments following Khans arrest and issued a nationwide alert, telling Americans to review their personal security plans and avoid large crowds.

        "title": "Italy begins to reckon with Fascist-era colonial collections",
        "date": "May 10, 2023 07:01 pm",
        "content": "For decades, Italy has worked to recover ancient Roman-era statues, Etruscan vases and other treasures that were looted from its soil and sold to museums around the world. Now, the country is coming to terms with the fact that it, too, has stolen loot in its museum collections: the relics of a brutal colonial empire in North Africa that it hasnt fully reckoned with. For over a year, a team of museum directors, university researchers and scholars has been conducting a census of the collections in the 498 Italian state museums to get a handle on what exactly they contain. The aim is to provide government authorities with preliminary data of the weapons, artifacts, and ritual objects Italian museums may hold, to respond to requests for restitution that have only increased amid a general reckoning over the legacies of European colonial empires and the related racial justice movements. The survey comes as museums and governments across Europe and the Americas have undergone a sea change in giving back cultural artifacts to countries and communities of origin. These museums reason they can no longer hold the objects in good conscience if they were acquired as a result of historical violence, colonial occupation, looting or war. Even the Vatican has gotten onto the restitution bandwagon, recently returning to Greece the three fragments of the Parthenon Marbles that it had held for two centuries. For starters, theres the Seventh Commandment: If you steal something, you have to give it back, Pope Francis explained. The Italian audit, begun under the previous government, is continuing under Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party has its roots in the neo-fascist successor party of dictator Benito Mussoli. Mussolinis Fascist regime is most closely associated with Italys North African colonies, which covered Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia as well as a protectorate in Albania. The empire began in the late 19th century, but Mussolini tried to expand it, only to be forced to relinquish it after World War II, with Italys final administration of Somalia ending in 1960. Even though we had a more ephemeral colonial history than Britain, Germany, France or Belgium, the problem obviously cannot be underestimated by us, the Culture Ministry official in charge of museums, Massimo Osanna, told a recent conference on restitution. We must rethink the collections, rethink the institutions and rethink the transparency of the narrative, as well as case-by-case restitutions. Osanna has tasked a group of museum directors and academics, headed by Christian Greco, director of the Egyptian Museum in Turin, with the audit. The committee has enlisted a dozen graduate students who are helping curators go through their storerooms and archives to understand whats there. In an interview, Greco acknowledged the issue of restitution and Italys colonial past remains sensitive. He said he had expected resistance when his team sent out a questionnaire asking museums if they held objects that may have been acquired in ways that would be considered unethical today. I was expecting people to be afraid, but actually the contrary is happening, people are very excited that this is happening, he said, adding that 30 museums with substantial collections had already responded. The aim is to produce a report to the Culture Ministry by mid-year, and to then organize an international symposium in the second half of the year to discuss the findings. Objects just dont necessarily tell us about the past, they tell a lot about us, Greco said. When I look at objects of ancient Egypt, do they tell me something about ancient Egyptian civilizations, or do they tell me much more about Eurocentrism? It seems appropriate that Italys experiment in coming to terms with its colonial past, including the recent restitution conference, is based at the Museum of Civilizations, located in one of the huge travertine blocks of Fascist architecture in Mussolinis utopian neighborhood of EUR, in southern Rome. The museum itself is something of a marvel, rebranded in 2016 as a compendium of 2 million objects from a half-dozen old collections: the Colonial Museum, Museum of Oriental Art, Museum of Medieval Art, the Prehistoric and Ethnographic Museum and Museum of Traditional Popular Arts. The most problematic among them is the 12,000-piece collection from the Colonial Museum, which Mussolini himself inaugurated in 1923. Initially made up of war loot sent home by Italian military officers in North Africa, the museum wasnt aimed at teaching Italians about African cultures, but rather to show folks back home the greatness of Italys military conquests abroad, and how they were helping provide raw materials for Italian industry. It was propaganda, purely a propaganda museum that had the purpose of creating a colonial consciousness in the visitor, said curator Rosa Anna Di Lella. The museum storerooms overflow with imposing busts of mustachioed Italian military heroes; specimens of Libyan cotton, Eritrean sunflower seeds, Somalian beans; and plaster facial masks made on live subjects, relics of the anthropological studies of racial typologies that are today so controversial they arent exhibited. It is here that Museum of Civilizations director Andrea Viliani is embarking on a radical rethink of the museum, its problematic collections and the narrative of Italys colonial-era past, starting with a preliminary exhibition opening in June. Alongside a section on restitution, the exhibit will include two giant wall murals that Italian troops stole from the Ethiopian parliament. Also on display: a painting of the Battle of Adwa, the decisive 1896 battle in the First Italo-Ethiopian War that (temporarily) halted the Kingdom of Italys advance in North Africa. Most Italian-made renditions of the battle depict the Italian martyrs who lost. The work going on display was painted by an Ethiopian artist and celebrates the Ethiopian victory in what came to epitomize pan-African independence at a time when European empires were carving up the continent. Villiani said the time had come for ethnographic museums like his to tell histories in a different way, giving voice to peoples whose stories havent been told. Italy, he said, is a bit behind other European countries, but has a unique role to play, given it has been both perpetrator and victim of looting. We are at the beginning, a beginning that is still made up precisely ... of testing the ground and finding the language, he said. Its a journey that will need more chapters, and we cant know how it will end. For Italy, the question of restitution is not entirely unfamiliar: It has spearheaded legal frameworks to bring home thousands of antiquities stolen in recent decades from its soil by unscrupulous tombaroli, or tomb robbers. It has won back so much loot that it recently inaugurated the Museum of Salvaged Art, where returned items spend time in Rome before being shipped back to the regions from where they were stolen. And Italy over the years has given back plenty of Holocaust-era and other stolen loot  four returned objects were unveiled in Egypt just this week. It has also undertaken two high-profile restitutions from its colonial past: In 2005, Italy returned to Ethiopia the massive, 160-ton Axum Obelisk, which Mussolini ordered sent to Rome in 1937 after his troops overran Ethiopia. And in 2008, then-Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi handed over to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi the Venus of Cyrene, an ancient Roman statue taken in 1913 by Italian troops. The statue reportedly disappeared in the chaos that engulfed Libya following the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, providing fodder to restitution critics who maintain that humanity is better served when its artifacts are safe in European museums, visible to millions, even if deprived of their cultural context. Dan Hicks, the Oxford archaeologist who has spearheaded the restitution movement of the Benin Bronzes and other cultural artifacts, says that retain and explain argument is bunk and that Italy is right to be joining other European museums in handing back its loot. Hicks, who spoke alongside Osanna at the restitution conference, has argued that anthropological museums today must now become the public spaces to debate problematic collections, while permitting also case-by-case restitutions. He says cultural audiences today no longer tolerate unethically sourced museum collections. We dont want to walk around the museums constantly having to think, OK, this is interesting, but is there someone, somewhere asking for it back? he said. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "In global rush to regulate AI, Europe set to be trailblazer",
        "date": "May 10, 2023 07:11 pm",
        "content": "The breathtaking development of artificial intelligence has dazzled users by composing music, creating images and writing essays, while also raising fears about its implications. Even European Union officials working on groundbreaking rules to govern the emerging technology were caught off guard by AIs rapid rise. The 27-nation bloc proposed the Western worlds first AI rules two years ago, focusing on reining in risky but narrowly focused applications. General purpose AI systems like chatbots were barely mentioned. Lawmakers working on the AI Act considered whether to include them but werent sure how, or even if it was necessary. Then ChatGPT kind of boom, exploded, said Dragos Tudorache, a Romanian member of the European Parliament co-leading the measure. If there was still some that doubted as to whether we need something at all, I think the doubt was quickly vanished. The release of ChatGPT last year captured the worlds attention because of its ability to generate human-like responses based on what it has learned from scanning vast amounts of online materials. With concerns emerging, European lawmakers moved swiftly in recent weeks to add language on general AI systems as they put the finishing touches on the legislation. The EUs AI Act could become the de facto global standard for artificial intelligence, with companies and organizations potentially deciding that the sheer size of the blocs single market would make it easier to comply than develop different products for different regions. Europe is the first regional bloc to significantly attempt to regulate AI, which is a huge challenge considering the wide range of systems that the broad term AI can cover, said Sarah Chander, senior policy adviser at digital rights group EDRi. Authorities worldwide are scrambling to figure out how to control the rapidly evolving technology to ensure that it improves peoples lives without threatening their rights or safety. Regulators are concerned about new ethical and societal risks posed by ChatGPT and other general purpose AI systems, which could transform daily life, from jobs and education to copyright and privacy. The White House recently brought in the heads of tech companies working on AI including Microsoft, Google and ChatGPT creator OpenAI to discuss the risks, while the Federal Trade Commission has warned that it wouldnt hesitate to crack down. China has issued draft regulations mandating security assessments for any products using generative AI systems like ChatGPT. Britains competition watchdog has opened a review of the AI market, while Italy briefly banned ChatGPT over a privacy breach. The EUs sweeping regulations  covering any provider of AI services or products  are expected to be approved by a European Parliament committee Thursday, then head into negotiations between the 27 member countries, Parliament and the EUs executive Commission. European rules influencing the rest of the world  the so-called Brussels effect  previously played out after the EU tightened data privacy and mandated common phone-charging cables, though such efforts have been criticized for stifling innovation. Attitudes could be different this time. Tech leaders including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak have called for a six-month pause to consider the risks. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist known as the Godfather of AI, and fellow AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio voiced their concerns last week about unchecked AI development. Tudorache said such warnings show the EUs move to start drawing up AI rules in 2021 was the right call. Google, which responded to ChatGPT with its own Bard chatbot and is rolling out AI tools, declined to comment. The company has told the EU that AI is too important not to regulate. Microsoft, a backer of OpenAI, did not respond to a request for comment. It has welcomed the EU effort as an important step toward making trustworthy AI the norm in Europe and around the world. Mira Murati, chief technology officer at OpenAI, said in an interview last month that she believed governments should be involved in regulating AI technology. But asked if some of OpenAIs tools should be classified as posing a higher risk, in the context of proposed European rules, she said its very nuanced. It kind of depends where you apply the technology, she said, citing as an example a very high-risk medical use case or legal use case versus an accounting or advertising application. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans stops in Brussels and other European cities this month in a world tour to talk about the technology with users and developers. Recently added provisions to the EUs AI Act would require foundation AI models to disclose copyright material used to train the systems, according to a recent partial draft of the legislation obtained by The Associated Press. Foundation models, also known as large language models, are a subcategory of general purpose AI that includes systems like ChatGPT. Their algorithms are trained on vast pools of online information, like blog posts, digital books, scientific articles and pop songs. You have to make a significant effort to document the copyrighted material that you use in the training of the algorithm, paving the way for artists, writers and other content creators to seek redress, Tudorache said. Officials drawing up AI regulations have to balance risks that the technology poses with the transformative benefits that it promises. Big tech companies developing AI systems and European national ministries looking to deploy them are seeking to limit the reach of regulators, while civil society groups are pushing for more accountability, said EDRis Chander. We want more information as to how these systems are developed  the levels of environmental and economic resources put into them  but also how and where these systems are used so we can effectively challenge them, she said. Under the EUs risk-based approach, AI uses that threaten peoples safety or rights face strict controls. Remote facial recognition is expected to be banned. So are government social scoring systems that judge people based on their behavior. Indiscriminate scraping of photos from the internet used for biometric matching and facial recognition is also a no-no. Predictive policing and emotion recognition technology, aside from therapeutic or medical uses, are also out. Violations could result in fines of up to 6 of a companys global annual revenue. Even after getting final approval, expected by the end of the year or early 2024 at the latest, the AI Act wont take immediate effect. There will be a grace period for companies and organizations to figure out how to adopt the new rules. Its possible that industry will push for more time by arguing that the AI Acts final version goes farther than the original proposal, said Frederico Oliveira Da Silva, senior legal officer at European consumer group BEUC. They could argue that instead of one and a half to two years, we need two to three, he said. He noted that ChatGPT only launched six months ago, and it has already thrown up a host of problems and benefits in that time. If the AI Act doesnt fully take effect for years, what will happen in these four years? Da Silva said. Thats really our concern, and thats why were asking authorities to be on top of it, just to really focus on this technology. Source The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka is bouncing back after three years of crises and is targeting the Middle East as a key market due to the mix of high-spending Emiratis and expatriates. Speaking at the Arabian Travel Market (ATM), Udaya Indrathna, ambassador at the Sri Lanka embassy in Abu Dhabi, said: Sri Lanka has had its challenges but Im pleased to say most have passed. He went on to refer to the 2019 bomb attack, Covid-19 pandemic, and recent political and economic turmoil. He said the new president has surrounded himself by young talent to steer the country in a new direction, with tourism positioned as a promising economic pillar. In this new chapter of Sri Lankan tourism, the country has shifted its focus from quantity to quality, with the Middle East region  home to a healthy mix of high-spending Emiratis and expatriates  being aggressively targeted. According to official figures, expats from the region tend to stay an average of four to five days and Emiratis for two weeks, enjoying luxury accommodation and experiences. Dushan Wickramasuriya, director of marketing, Sri Lanka Promotion Bureau, noted: The UAE in particular is unique because 80 per cent of the population are expat residents from places like India, Europe, the US and Canada. These are all key markets for us, so when we target this region, were not only reaching Emiratis but other nationalities as well. Minister of tourism, Harin Fernando, said the ministry has set a target to increase visitor spend from the current average of US200 to US250, to between US400 and US500 by next year. The Middle East market is crucial as we are now seeking quality tourists over quantity. We slowly want to focus on the right markets and right people over numbers, he noted, adding there are no plans to make Sri Lanka an expensive destination  instead it will appeal more to the affordable luxury segment. At ATM, Emirates also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to actively promote Sri Lanka as a leading tourist destination. Source  TTG Asia -Agencies",

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Harsha de Silva says that Sri Lankas proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill has raised concerns that it violates fundamental rights guaranteed by the countrys constitution, potentially jeopardizing its chance of regaining the GSP concession. Speaking in Parliament today (May 10), MP Harsha de Silva mentioned that as Sri Lanka approaches the end of this year, the country faces a critical debate on whether it will retain its annual trade concession worth over 500 million to the European Union (EU) through the Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP). Sri Lankas garment sector, one of the top forex earners for the country, relies heavily on this economic lifeline, he added. The MP who pointed out that under new regulations, the EU now requires six countries, including Sri Lanka and Pakistan, to submit applications for the renewal of the GSP facility, also emphasized that the EU will decide whether to grant the facility from 2024 to 2033 after evaluating compliance with various conventions related to human rights, labour rights, good governance, environmental protection, and democratic rights. However, Sri Lankas proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill has raised concerns that it violates fundamental rights guaranteed by the countrys constitution, potentially jeopardizing its chance of regaining the GSP, he claimed. Losing this trade concession would have far-reaching economic consequences for Sri Lanka, particularly in the already-struggling garment sector, he said, mentioning that as the debate unfolds, the outcome will significantly impact Sri Lankas future trade relations with the EU. He further stated that the country must address these human rights and democratic governance issues to retain its economic lifeline and build a sustainable future.",

        "date": "May 10, 2023 09:56 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Representative George Santos was arrested on Wednesday on federal charges of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds in the latest hit to the newly elected Republican, who has resisted calls to resign for lying about his resume. The 13-count indictment, unsealed on Wednesday, charges Santos, 34, with defrauding prospective political supporters by laundering funds to pay for his personal expenses and illegally receiving unemployment benefits while he was employed. He is also accused of making false statements to the House of Representatives about his assets, income and liabilities. Top House Republicans, who control the chamber by a narrow 222-213 margin, said they would wait for the legal process to play out before taking further action on Santos, who is due to appear later Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York. Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself, Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. Santoss congressional office referred requests for comment to his counsel. An attorney for Santos did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the indictment. Nine House Republicans have so far called on Santos to resign, including six from his home state of New York. But No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said the caucus would withhold judgment on Santos. The charges just came out, Scalise said at a press conference. In America, theres a presumption of innocence, but theyre serious charges. Hes going to have to go through the legal process. FALSE CLAIMS Shortly after Santos election in 2022 to represent a wealthy area of New Yorks Long Island, the New York Times and other media outlets revealed that he had fabricated almost every aspect of his personal and professional history. Among other claims, Santos said he had degrees from New York University and Baruch College despite neither institutions having any record of his attending. He claimed to have worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, which also was untrue. He said falsely that he was Jewish and that his grandparents escaped the Nazis during World War Two. Santos, who identifies as gay, also failed to disclose that he was married to a woman for several years ending in 2019. He has since admitted to fabricating large parts of his resume. The House Ethics Committee in March launched a multi-pronged investigation to look at everything from alleged illegal activity over Santos 2022 campaign and failing to properly disclose information required on House statements to violations of federal conflict-of-interest laws. Some of the allegations in the indictment track closely with the claims being investigated by the House panel. In the political campaign scheme, prosecutors said Santos laundered donations into his own personal bank accounts and used thousands of dollars to pay for personal expenses, from luxury clothing to credit card payments. He also is accused of repeatedly making false statements about his income in forms he filed with the House. In 2020, for instance, he allegedly failed to properly report 25,403 in investment income and falsely claimed he earned a salary, commission and bonuses of 55,000 from Company 2, when he had only received 27,555. He also allegedly misstated his income in 2022, claiming for example that he had a salary of 750,000 from an entity he controlled and that he maintained checking accounts with balances of 100,001-250,000. In reality, the indictment says, none of those claims were true. In addition to those alleged schemes, prosecutors said Santos sought to cash in on unemployment benefits during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 11, 2023 09:00 am",
        "content": "The staff team of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive in Sri Lanka today (May 11). The IMF said this visit comes as part of the regular consultations between the global lender and the island nation, ahead of the first review mission later this year. The delegates of the global lender will be staying in Sri Lanka until May 23. They are to call on President Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning soon after the arrival, according to Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. According to an IMF statement, the Director of its Asia and Pacific Department, Krishna Srinivasan will be joining this visit from May 12-15. The IMF staff team will convene a press briefing on Monday evening (May 15) in Colombo, chaired by Krishna Srinivasan, the IMFs Director of Asia and Pacific Department; Peter Breuer, the Asia and Pacific Departments Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka; and Sarwat Jahan, the IMF Resident Representative in Sri Lanka. The IMF staff teams visit comes days after the first meeting of Sri Lankas official bilateral creditors committee, during which the island nations authorities formally presented a request for debt treatment. China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in attendance as observers. The committee, co-chaired by India, Japan and France, consists of 17 members and includes Paris Club creditors as well as other official bilateral creditors. Last month, France, India and Japan unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, government data show, with USD 3 billion owed to China, followed by USD 2.4 billion to the Paris Club of creditor nations and USD 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than USD 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and USD 2.7 billion of other commercial loans. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of the IMF approved by its executive board in March 2023 comes with strict conditionalities for economic reforms. Sri Lanka had to secure assurances from official bilateral creditors that they would help debt relief andor financing to restore debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported EFF program, as well as an assessment that the authorities are making good faith efforts to reach a private agreement with private creditors. As these requirements were met ahead of the IMF Board meeting in March, the IMF approved the 48-month extended arrangement of 2.286 billion SDR (Special Drawing Rights), which amounts to USD 3 billion, for Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities are now working closely with its creditors to coordinate and make swift progress towards the debt treatment that restores debt sustainability under the EFF program.",

        "date": "May 11, 2023 09:19 am",
        "content": "A pre-dawn Israeli air strike on an apartment in the Gaza Strip has killed a top Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) commander and one other person. A warplane attacked an apartment on the fifth floor of a building in Hamad Residential City, near Khan Younis in the south of the strip. Wednesday saw militants in Gaza firing more than 460 rockets at Israel. The Israeli military hit more than 130 militant targets in Gaza, in the heaviest fighting in nine months. Palestinian medical sources estimate the death toll from fighting this week is now at least 24, including three other PIJ commanders. Several people were hurt in Israel rushing to shelters as the rockets were fired from Gaza. The armed wing of the PIJ confirmed that the head of its missile unit, Ali Hassan Ghali, also known as Abu Muhammad, had died in Thursday mornings attack. The PIJ is the second biggest militant group in Gaza after Hamas, and it has sworn to avenge the deaths of Palestinians killed. Israels military confirmed it had targeted Ghali and what it called two other Islamic Jihad operatives in Gaza. They described the commander as a central figure in the PIJ who had been responsible for the recent rocket barrages launched against Israel. On Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israels campaign was not over. We have hit Islamic Jihad with the most significant blow it has ever suffered, he said, referring to the killing of the three PIJ commanders on Tuesday. Hours before Mr Netanyahu spoke, Egyptian media reported that Egypt had brokered a ceasefire, but there was no immediate confirmation from the two sides. An umbrella organisation representing armed factions in Gaza earlier warned that if Israel increases its aggression, dark days await it. This weeks air strikes were the deadliest since three days of hostilities between Israel and PIJ last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed in Gaza. PIJ has been responsible for many of the rocket attacks on Israel in recent years and is sworn to Israels destruction. There was a serious flare-up last week, as PIJ and other groups fired more than 100 rockets into Israel over two days, following the death in an Israeli prison of a Palestinian hunger striker. The Israeli military carried out air strikes on sites it said were linked to Hamas in response. Tensions also remained high in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, after Israel carried out arrest raids. Two Palestinians were killed in the town of Qabatiya by Israeli forces, who said the pair had fired at them. An Israeli soldier was also seriously wounded during a separate exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen in Tubas. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the relevant officials to amend the existing ordinances regarding lands to suit the current development needs. The Head of State issued these instructions during a discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday evening (May 10), on amending the provisions of the ordinances of land management institutions and introducing new regulations. During the meeting, he also informed the respective officials to appoint a suitable committee to speed up the work. Pointing out that the land policies brought during the colonial period are still being implemented in the country, the President also said that the ordinances brought at different times related to land use are not in line with the development needs of the time. It was also discussed at length about the preparation of a new National Land Policy by removing the existing obstacles in providing land for development activities. The President instructed the officials to resolve the issues of the lands under the Provincial Councils through a Land Commission. The President also instructed the officers to identify the details of the land owners in the Grama Niladhari Divisions and the amount of land that is currently utilized and the amount of land that has not been utilized and prepare a report at Divisional Secretariat levels. President Wickremesinghe directed the officers to take steps to redistribute among the public the lands acquired for Government purposes but not yet utilized, and in the future to acquire lands for Government purposes by paying the market value of the respective lands. In order to avoid the delay in the works of the Survey Department and the Valuation Department, he further instructed to take steps to fill the vacancies in those departments promptly.",

        "title": "Deadly violence in Pakistan as ex-PM charged with corruption",
        "date": "May 11, 2023 12:24 pm",
        "content": "Unrest has continued to grip Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan pleaded not guilty to corruption following his arrest on Tuesday. At least eight people have died nationwide in the protests and 1,400 have been arrested, police say. The army has been called into to quell violence and has warned protesters not to carry out attacks on state property. Mr Khans arrest has dramatically escalated tensions between him and the military at a time of economic crisis. Conviction would disqualify the former international cricket star - and Pakistans prime minister from 2018 to 2022 - from standing for office, possibly for life. Elections are due later this year. Pakistans army has heavily influenced the nuclear-armed country for most of its existence and is a crucial behind-the-scenes player. Many analysts believe Mr Khans election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military. But since he was ousted from premiership, Mr Khan has become one of the militarys most vocal critics. On Wednesday, Mr Khan was indicted on charges that he unlawfully sold state gifts during his premiership, in a case brought by Pakistans Election Commission. Mr Khan denied any wrongdoing. A day earlier, dramatic footage showed dozens of security officers forcibly removing the 70-year-old from court - where he was attending to separate graft proceedings - then bundling him into a police vehicle. Mr Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party called his arrest in the capital Islamabad an abduction and said it would challenge its legality in court. The judge has ordered that Mr Khan be remanded in custody for eight days, after which he can seek bail. This is just one of over 100 corruption cases registered against Mr Khan since he left office. For months he had avoided arrest, with his supporters at times fighting pitched battles with police to keep him out of custody. One of his Mr Khans lawyers, Sher Afzal Marwat, said his client was in good spirits. Amid violent protests nationwide, Mr Khans supporters ransacked the corps commanders residence in Lahore, smashing chandeliers and making away with peacocks, strawberries and golf clubs - among other things - which they said were bought with citizens money. Scores of vehicles and public installations were set alight. On Wednesday, the BBC witnessed clashes between protesters and the police in the middle of one of Islamabads main motorways. More than 145 policemen have been wounded in these confrontations, the police said. We came to do a peaceful protest, but these police are shelling us, one man, who was holding stones and a stick and wearing a surgical mask, told the BBC. Until our death we will continue this protest or until they free Imran. Otherwise we will shut the whole country. Mr Khans supporters overseas have also organised protests in the two days since his arrest. In a televised address to the nation, Pakistans Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned that violent protests would not be tolerated. The perpetrators who take the law into their own hands will be dealt with an iron hand, he said. PTI supporters had torched vehicles and hurled petrol bombs at Mr Sharifs residence in Lahore in the wee hours of Wednesday, local media reported. Pakistans army described Tuesday as a dark day and warned protesters of severe retaliation against further attacks on military and state properties. Among the protesters arrested were two senior PTI leaders, including its secretary-general Asad Umar. Mr Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last April, less than four years into his term as prime minister. In November 2022, he was shot in the leg while leading a protest march in the eastern city of Wazirabad demanding early elections. Mr Khan had accused a senior intelligence officials of carrying out the attack - which the military has strongly denied.",
