        "title": "Defense Ministry categorically denies Channel 4s outrageous claims on Easter attacks",
        "date": "September 9, 2023 07:08 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ministry of Defense has vehemently denounced the accusations leveled by the British television network Channel 4 in its new documentary that the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks were deliberately orchestrated by senior governmental officials In a statement, the Defense Ministry went on to categorically deny Channel 4s claims that Major General Suresh Sallay was complicit in the supposed calculated bombings, which targeted several churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. Deeming the accusations outrageous, the Defense Ministry reiterated that the terrorists involved in the Easter Sunday attacks, in which the lives of more than 260 people were and hundreds of others were left wounded, had never been on the government payroll. The ministry also expressed profound dismay at Channel 4 for promulgating such a malicious and unsubstantiated narrative. It asserted that Channel 4 would be held unequivocally accountable for any unforeseen actions or repercussions stemming from their unfounded, malevolent, and poorly substantiated claims made in the documentary. Aired on September 05, Channel 4 new Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long video with serious yet straightforward allegations about the attacks based on testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that governmental officials were complicit. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was once a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by current State Minister of Rural Road Development Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. Maulana told Channel 4 that he had witnessed a meeting between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer in 2018. Claiming that he had, on the directives of Pillayan, arranged the said meeting between then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay and the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) members including its leader Zahran Hashim, Maulana said the plot to create insecurity in the country to pave way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019 was hatched over 2-3 years. Meanwhile, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has also slammed the documentary, deeming it an anti-Rajapaksa tirade aimed at blackening the Rajapaksa legacy from 2005 onwards and is a tissue of lies just like the previous films broadcast by the same Channel. Read the Defense Ministrys full statement below: In the face of a heinous and merciless assault that shook the world - the Easter Sunday Attack of 2019 - which claimed the lives of nearly 270 innocent souls, including children and foreigners, Sri Lanka and the International Community watched in horror. In the wake of this catastrophe, the Sri Lankan Government, its Law Enforcement Agencies, Security Forces and international investigation agencies launched exhaustive investigations. Over the years, these investigations, both local and international, have consistently pointed to ISIS-affiliated group members led by Zahran Hashim as the architects of this horrifying tragedy. However, it is with unwavering resolution and an unyielding commitment to the truth that the Ministry of Defence wishes to respond to the recent documentary produced by British Channel 4 television cooperation on 5th September 2023. This documentary audaciously shifts the blame of the Easter Sunday Attack onto Military Intelligence and Major General Suresh Sallay, the present Director General of the State Intelligence Service of Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Defence vehemently denounces the accusation of orchestrating the attack and assisting the bombers against a dedicated senior military officer who has served the nation for 36 years. Major General Suresh Sallay served at the Sri Lanka High Commission in Malaysia as Minister-Counsellor from December 2016 until December 2018. He left for India on 3rd January 2019 and returned to Sri Lanka on 30th November 2019 after completing the National Defence College Course in Delhi. This officer was never in Sri Lanka during the period mentioned in the Channel 4 video documentary. Furthermore, during the said period (December 2016 to November 2019), this officer was not employed in the Intelligence and Security Apparatus of the country, nor did he hold any official responsibilities in those fields. The Ministry of Defence also reiterates that no terrorists involved in the Easter Sunday attack have ever been on the government payroll. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence categorically refutes these outrageous allegations and expresses profound dismay at Channel 4 for promulgating such a malicious and unsubstantiated narrative. In the wake of the Easter Sunday Attack, successive Sri Lankan governments have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth. They have done so by facilitating transparent investigations conducted by both local and international professional agencies. These investigations including the meticulous work of the Criminal Investigation Department, Counter Terrorist Investigation Division and the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), have consistently corroborated the responsibility of the radical extremist group for the attack. Additionally, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security has played a pivotal role in proposing measures to bolster national security. Moreover, it is imperative to underline that the comprehensive investigation conducted by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, along with the subsequent verdict rendered by the US Department of Justice, have reaffirmed the findings of local investigations. This resounding endorsement from an international investigative agency further substantiates the accuracy and integrity of the investigation. Despite unwavering and magnanimous endeavours, Channel 4s myopic and malevolent conduct not only imperils the very fabric of Sri Lankan society by sowing seeds of discord but also shamelessly jeopardizes the reputation and safety of those who have resolutely upheld their integrity and responsibility. While the Ministry of Defence respects the freedom of expression and upholds the significance of investigative journalism, the Ministry of Defence emphatically asserts that Channel 4 will be held unequivocally accountable for any unforeseen actions or repercussions stemming from their unfounded, malevolent, and poorly substantiated claims made in the video documentary. On behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Defence hereby categorically refutes these false allegations and reiterates the governments unwavering commitment to the truth, justice and the well-being of the Nation.",

        "date": "September 9, 2023 08:22 am",
        "content": "A powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Morocco on Friday night, killing nearly 300 people and forcing many residents to spend the night in the streets in what the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said was the strongest tremor to hit that part of the North African nation in more than a century. The quake struck in Moroccos High Atlas mountain range shortly after 11 p.m. local time at a relatively shallow depth of 18.5 kilometers (11.4 miles), USGS said, with the epicenter located about 72 kilometers (44.7 miles) southwest of Marrakech, a city of some 840,000 people and a popular tourist destination. At least 296 people were killed, and 153 others were wounded, Morocco state-run Al-Aoula television reported on Saturday. The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces warned that residents were still vulnerable to aftershocks. We remind you of the need to exercise caution and take safety measures due to the risk of aftershocks, the military wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. The USGS said Friday nights quake was unusually strong for the region. Earthquakes of this size in the region are uncommon, but not unexpected. Since 1900, there have been no earthquakes M6 (magnitude 6) and larger within 500km of this earthquake, and only 9 M5 (magnitude 5) and larger earthquakes, USGS said. The US body predicted that significant damage is likely and the disaster is potentially widespread, noting that many people in the area reside in structures that are highly vulnerable to earthquake shaking. State-run Al-Aoula television on Saturday showed multiple buildings collapsed near the epicenter and reported that thousands of people had fled their homes after the countrys National Institute of Geophysics warned of aftershocks. In Marrakech, some houses in the tightly packed old city have collapsed and people were moving debris by hand while they waited for heavy equipment, local resident Id Waaziz Hassan told Reuters news agency. Another Marrakech resident, Brahim Himmi, told Reuters he saw ambulances coming out of the old town and that many building facades were damaged. He said people were frightened and were staying outside in case of another quake. Shaking was also felt in the capital Rabat, some 350km north of the High Atlas mountains, Reuters said citing eyewitnesses. Source: CNN -Agencies",

Accordingly, as per the relevant gazette, issued on Friday (08 Sep.), the new Act will be deemed effective from 15 September. The new Anti-Corruption Act aims to enhance transparency in governance and public confidence in the government, and to establish an independent commission to exercise and perform the powers and functions under the legislation. It also seeks to give effect to obligations under the UN Convention against corruption and any other international convention on prevention of corruption to which Sri Lanka is a party and recognize international standards and best practices in order to establish a culture of integrity in Sri Lanka. Speaking at a press briefing regarding the new legislation on Thursday afternoon (07 Sep.), the Minister explained that although the existing laws pertaining to bribery are only applicable to the public sector and politicians, the new Anti-Corruption Act will allow these laws to be enforced against the private sector as well.

        "date": "September 9, 2023 12:53 pm",
        "content": "A strong earthquake of magnitude 6.8 has struck central Morocco, killing at least 632 people, the countrys interior ministry says. The epicentre was in the High Atlas Mountains, 71km (44 miles) south-west of Marrakesh, at a depth of 18.5km, the US Geological Survey said. The quake struck at 23:11 local time (22:11 GMT). There was a 4.9 aftershock 19 minutes later. People died in Marrakesh and several areas to the south, the ministry said. The ministry said the earthquake killed people in the provinces and municipalities of al-Haouz, Marrakesh, Ouarzazate, Azilal, Chichaoua and Taroudant, adding that at least 329 people have been injured. Unverified video clips on social media show damaged buildings, other buildings shaking and rubble-strewn streets. People are seen fleeing in alarm and some walking through clouds of dust. There are also reports of families trapped under the rubble of their homes, and damage to parts of Marrakeshs Medina, a Unesco World heritage Site. Hospitals in the city have seen an influx of injured people, and the authorities have called on residents to donate blood. Some buildings in the old city have collapsed, one resident told the Reuters news agency. Several clips on X show buildings crashing down, but the BBC has not identified where they were. Locals are said to have decided to stay outside their homes in case the city is rocked by powerful aftershocks. Another man in the historic city described feeling a violent tremor and seeing buildings moving. People were all in shock and panic. The children were crying and the parents were distraught, Abdelhak El Amrani told the AFP agency. He said power and phone lines were down for 10 minutes. AFP also reported that one family was trapped in the collapsed rubble of a house - and that a number of people in Marrakesh were taken to hospital. The quakes epicentre in a remote area of the High Atlas Mountains was relatively shallow - and tremors were also reportedly felt in the capital Rabat, some 350km away, as well as Casablanca and Essaouira. Simple buildings in mountain villages near the epicentre may not have survived and, being remote, it may take some time to determine casualties there. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankan Force Protection Unit (SLFPU) serving in the peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has been honoured at the United Nations medal awarding ceremony. The event was held on Wednesday (Sept. 06) at the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) headquarters in Naqoura, South of Lebanon, under the patronage of Major General Aroldo Lazaro Saenz, the Head of Mission and Force Commander of UNIFIL. Accordingly, UN Peacekeeping Medals were bestowed upon the Sri Lankan contingent, which consists of 125 army personnel. In his speech, Major General Saenz commended the professionalism and commitment of the Sri Lanka contingent. The event was followed by a reception hosted by the Sri Lankan contingent of UNIFIL. The UNIFIL was established in 1978 by the UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 in response to a surge in violence on the border between Israel and Lebanon. The UNIFIL patrols the Lebanons southern border with Israel. Since the inception of SLFPU, the Sri Lankan army has thus far dispatched 12 contingents to serve in Lebanon at the request of UNIFIL. In February 2022, a 125-member contingent left for Lebanon consisting of 10 army officers and 115 other ranks. In August 2023, the UN Security Council voted to extend the long-running peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for another year after a compromise was reached between France and the United States on language about the freedom of movement of UN troops.",

        "date": "September 9, 2023 03:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says it is imperative for Sri Lanka to excel in healthcare in order to boost medical tourism. Addressing an event on Friday (Sept. 09), the Head of State also emphasized the necessity of restructuring healthcare policies and increasing the number of medical colleges to address the shortage of doctors, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). President Wickremesinghe attended the centenary commemoration of Joseph Fraser Ninewells Hospitals and paid tribute to the legacy of Joseph Fraser, a Scottish planter who played a pivotal role in Sri Lankas tea industry during its formative years. He emphasized the necessity of restructuring healthcare policies and increasing the number of medical colleges to address the shortage of doctors. The President further acknowledged the challenges posed by the shortage of doctors and stressed the importance of developing an effective solution. He also announced plans to establish the first non-government medical faculty in Sri Lanka, a significant step towards expanding medical education opportunities. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the allocation of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the University of Moratuwa, aiming to create more medical education institutions. He expressed hope that the government would support the establishment of additional medical colleges and universities, ensuring that Sri Lanka can produce more doctors. The President recognized that while some doctors may choose to practice abroad, increasing the overall number of medical professionals in the country is essential. He affirmed that expanding medical education is a critical strategy to meet this challenge. In an inspiring declaration, President Wickremesinghe underscored Sri Lankas transition from an aid-receiving country to a donor nation, showcasing the countrys progress and commitment to addressing its healthcare needs independently. Indeed, I have resolved that Sri Lanka shall not merely remain a beneficiary of aid; instead, we aspire to evolve into a nation that contributes aid to others. We have extended our support by sending our doctors to the United Kingdom, where these dedicated expertise plays an indispensable role in sustaining their healthcare system. Collaboratively, with Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, we exert significant influence over the healthcare infrastructure in the UK, a testament to the high calibre of our professionals. I find myself in a situation similar to that of a doctor in recent times. I am tasked with the responsibility of tending to a patient who is teetering on the brink of critical condition, and I am steadfastly committed to nursing them back to health. If circumstances permitted, I would readily entrust this patient to the care of Joseph Fraser. Regrettably, circumstances necessitate that I retain oversight of the patients care within the treasury. Furthermore, we have diligently devised a novel approach that fosters synergy between the private and public sectors, ensuring that they can effectively collaborate for the greater good. The Presidents remarks underscore the governments determination to address the healthcare workforce shortage in Sri Lanka, thereby ensuring the nations healthcare system remains robust and accessible. The President also shared insights into efforts to create a hybrid healthcare system that combines public and private healthcare services while exploring the potential of health insurance. President Wickremesinghe concluded by highlighting the importance of Sri Lankas private sector in propelling the countrys growth and development. He invoked Joseph Frasers legacy as an example of an individual who, through perseverance and dedication, made a significant contribution to Sri Lankas progress.",

Reports revealed that the deceased was a British citizen of Sri Lankan origin. The body was found after the Mount Lavinia police officers received a complaint at around 2:40 a.m. The 27-year-old had arrived on the island on March 08 this year and purchased an apartment unit in the aforementioned residential building located at Alwis Road in Mount Lavinia. It was also reported that she was romantically involved with a young law student from the Wellawatta area with whom she had become acquainted via Facebook. Upon her arrival, she had been living in the apartment unit with her 29-year-old boyfriend for the past six months. The police said the young man, who is pursuing his studies in Switzerland, had returned to the island in 2022. According to reports, she was supposed to fly back to England tomorrow morning (Sept. 10). During interrogations, the boyfriend told the police that they had an argument over religion last night. The youth also divulged that he had consumed at least 6 cans of beer last evening. He had reportedly looked for his girlfriend later that night after realizing she was missing. He had later noticed her body lying on the floor outside the apartment building. Mount Lavinia Police is investigating the incident further to ascertain if foul play was involved in the death of the young woman. The magisterial inquest into the death was conducted this afternoon, and the post-mortem is scheduled to be performed tomorrow.",

        "date": "September 9, 2023 07:31 pm",
        "content": "Moroccos deadliest earthquake in decades has killed over 1,000 people, authorities said Saturday, causing widespread damage and sending terrified residents and tourists scrambling to safety in the middle of the night. The 6.8-magnitude quake struck a mountainous area 72 kilometres (45 miles) southwest of tourist hotspot Marrakesh at 11:11 pm (2211 GMT) Friday, the US Geological Survey reported. Strong tremors were also felt in the coastal cities of Rabat, Casablanca and Essaouira. I was nearly asleep when I heard the doors and the shutters banging, said Ghannou Najem, a Casablanca resident in her 80s who was visiting Marrakesh when the quake hit. I went outside in a panic. I thought I was going to die alone. It is the strongest-ever quake to hit the North African kingdom, and one expert described it as the regions biggest in more than 120 years. Where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough... so many collapse, resulting in high casualties, said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus at Britains University College London. Updated interior ministry figures on Saturday showed the quake killed at least 1,037 people, the vast majority in Al-Haouz, the epicentre, and Taroudant provinces. Another 1,204 people were injured, including 721 in a critical condition, the ministry said. The ministry also recorded deaths in Ouarzazate, Chichaoua, Azilal and Youssoufia provinces, as well as in Marrakesh, Agadir and the Casablanca area. Unbearable screams Faisal Badour, an engineer, said he felt the quake three times in his building in Marrakesh. There are families who are still sleeping outside because we were so scared of the force of this earthquake, he said. The screaming and crying was unbearable. In Moulay Brahim village, in the mountains of Al-Haouz province near the quakes epicentre, rescuers were searching for survivors in the rubble of collapsed houses, AFP correspondents reported. On a nearby hill, residents began digging graves for the victims, the correspondents said. Frenchman Michael Bizet, 43, who owns three traditional riad houses in Marrakeshs old town, told AFP that he was in bed when the quake struck. I thought my bed was going to fly away. I went out into the street half-naked and immediately went to see my riads. It was total chaos, a real catastrophe, madness, he said. Footage on social media showed part of a minaret collapsed on Jemaa el-Fna square in the historic city. An AFP correspondent saw hundreds of people flocking to the square to spend the night for fear of aftershocks, some with blankets while others slept on the ground. Mimi Theobold, 25, a tourist from England, said she was with friends on a restaurant terrace when the tables began shaking and plates went flying. Houda Outassaf, a local resident, said she was still in shock after feeling the earth shake beneath her feet -- and losing relatives. I have at least 10 members of my family who died... I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago, she said. The interior ministry said authorities have mobilised all the necessary resources to intervene and help the affected areas. The regional blood transfusion centre in Marrakesh called on residents to donate blood for those injured. The army has set up a field hospital in Moulay Brahim and deployed significant human and logistical resources to support search and rescue efforts in Al-Haouz, state news agency MAP said. Significant damage likely We heard screams at the time of the tremor, a resident of Essaouira, 200 kilometres (125 miles) west of Marrakesh, told AFP. Pieces of facades have fallen. The USGS PAGER system, which provides preliminary assessments on the impact of earthquakes, issued a red alert for economic losses, saying extensive damage is probable. US President Joe Biden said in a statement he was deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation. Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed deep grief for the victims and hope that the Moroccan government and people will be able to overcome the impact of this disaster, according to Beijings state media. Pope Francis expressed his profound solidarity with those who are touched in the flesh and heart by this tragedy. The earthquake was also felt in neighbouring Algeria, where the Algerian Civil Defence said it had not caused any damage or casualties. In 2004, at least 628 people were killed and 926 injured when a quake hit Al Hoceima in northeastern Morocco, and in 1960 a magnitude 6.7 quake in Agadir killed more than 12,000. The 7.3-magnitude El Asnam earthquake in Algeria killed 2,500 people and left at least 300,000 homeless in 1980. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "September 9, 2023 10:15 pm",
        "content": "The Group of 20 adopted a consensus declaration at a summit on Saturday that avoided condemning Russia for the war in Ukraine but called on all states not to use force to grab territory. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Leaders Declaration had been adopted on the first day of the weekend G20 summit in New Delhi. On the back of the hard work of all the teams, we have received consensus on the G20 Leaders Summit Declaration. I announce the adoption of this declaration, Modi told the leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and heads of government and state from across the world. The consensus came as a surprise as G20 is deeply divided over the war in Ukraine, with Western nations earlier pushing for strong condemnation of Russia in the Leaders Declaration, while others demanded a focus on broader economic issues. We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty, international humanitarian law, and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability, the declaration said. We ... welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible, the statement added. Ukraines foreign ministry said the declaration was nothing to be proud of, adding that a Ukrainian presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the declaration demonstrated a clear position on Russias invasion of Ukraine by saying that the territorial integrity of countries cannot be called into question with violence. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the declaration had very strong language about Russias illegal war in Ukraine. I think that is a good and strong outcome. There was no immediate reaction from Russia, which is being represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. He had said he would block the final declaration unless it reflected Moscows position on Ukraine and other crises. Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and sown economic turmoil across the world. Moscow denies committing atrocities during the conflict, which it terms a special operation to demilitarize Ukraine. The declaration also called for the implementation of the Black Sea initiative for the safe flow of grain, food and fertiliser from Ukraine and Russia. Moscow pulled out of the agreement in July over what it called a failure to meet its demands to implement a parallel agreement easing rules for its own food and fertiliser exports. CHINA SUPPORTS, INDIA SAYS Indias Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said China, Russias main major ally, was supportive of the outcome. Differing viewpoints and interests were at play, but we were able to find common ground on all issues, he told a press conference. The differing views on the war had prevented agreement on even a single communique at ministerial meetings during Indias G20 presidency so far this year. Indias sherpa, the country representative to the G20, said the host nation worked very closely with Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia to reach a consensus on the language on the war in Ukraine in the summit document. The declaration also said the group agreed to address debt vulnerabilities in low and middle-income countries in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner, but did not make any fresh action plan. It said countries pledged to strengthen and reform multilateral development banks, while it accepted the proposal for tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies. It also agreed that the world needs a total of 4 trillion of low-cost financing annually for the energy transition, with a high share of renewables in the primary energy mix. The statement called for accelerating efforts towards a phasedown of unabated coal power, but said this had to be done in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards just transitions. DELHI CLOSED DOWN FOR SUMMIT At the start of the day, Biden and other leaders were driven through deserted streets to a new, 300 million conch-shaped convention centre called Bharat Mandapam, opposite a 16th-century stone fort. Many businesses, offices and schools have been closed in the city and traffic restricted as part of security measures to ensure the smooth running of the most high-powered meeting to be hosted by the country. Modi inaugurated the meeting by calling on members to end a global trust deficit and announced that the bloc was granting permanent membership to the African Union in an effort to make it more representative. Despite the compromise over the Leaders Declaration, the summit had been expected to be dominated by the West and its allies. Chinese President Xi Jinping is skipping the meeting and has sent Premier Li Qiang instead, while Russias Vladimir Putin was also absent. Biden, Scholz, Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, Saudi Arabias Mohammed Bin Salman and Japans Fumio Kishida, among others, are attending. Its incumbent upon the Chinese government to explain why its leader would or would not participate, Jon Finer, the U.S. deputy national security adviser, told reporters in Delhi. Biden said on Saturday: It would be nice to have him here but the summit is going well. Finer said there was speculation that China is giving up on G20 in favour of groupings like BRICS, where it is dominant. BRICS includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and has agreed to add another six members -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates - accelerating its push to reshuffle a world order it sees as outdated.

        "date": "September 9, 2023 10:42 pm",
        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has revealed that in the event the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) participates in the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) process, the opportunity loss to the EPF bond portfolio will amount to 4. He noted, however, should the EPF choose not to participate, the opportunity loss to the bond portfolio increases to 21 due to the higher tax rate of 30 as per the latest amendment to the Inland Revenue Bill. Speaking before the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) in this regard on Thursday (07 Sep.), Dr. Weerasinghe further stated that all superannuation funds not eligible for the DDO will be subjected to a 30 tax increase, potentially discouraging the formation of new superannuation funds in the future. The COPF, chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, approved the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill by a majority at the Committee meeting held in Parliament on Thursday, following which the relevant discussion took place. As COPF Chair, Dr. de Silva, however, abstained from voting while committee member MP Patali Champika Ranawaka also abstained. The CBSL officials clarified that the 30 tax increase, as stipulated by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill, applies only to the interest income on the bond portfolio. Furthermore, it was highlighted that in the event that superannuation funds do participate in the DDO, this will be reversed to 14. The Committee also questioned the ability of the CBSL to guarantee the proposed rate of a 12 return until 2025 and 9 thereafter to the superannuation funds participating in the DDO. In response, the CBSL Governor stated that it is not possible to guarantee the return to each member; however, he assured them that they will strive to achieve the proposed return. He further mentioned that in the event that this rate cannot be maintained, there is an ongoing discussion for the treasury to step in to ensure the proposed return until 2025.",

        "date": "September 10, 2023 09:43 am",
        "content": "The death toll from Fridays massive earthquake in Morocco climbed above 2,000 on Saturday evening with authorities speculating that the figure would rise further as rescuers struggled to reach hard-hit remote areas. The magnitude 6.8 quake, the biggest to hit the North African country in 120 years, sent people fleeing their homes in terror and disbelief late Friday. One man said dishes and wall hangings began raining down, and people were knocked off their feet. The quake brought down walls made from stone and masonry, covering whole communities with rubble. The devastation gripped each town along the High Atlas steep and winding switchbacks in similar ways: homes folding in on themselves and mothers and fathers crying as boys and helmet-clad police carried the dead through the streets. Remote villages like those in the drought-stricken Ouargane Valley were largely cut off from the world when they lost electricity and cellphone service. By midday, people were outside mourning neighbors, surveying the damage on their camera phones and telling one another May God save us. In historic Marrakech, people could be seen on state TV clustering in the streets, afraid to go back inside buildings that might still be unstable. The citys famous Koutoubia Mosque, built in the 12th century, was damaged, but the extent was not immediately clear. Its 69-meter (226-foot) minaret is known as the roof of Marrakech. Moroccans also posted videos showing damage to parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. At least 2,012 people died in the quake, mostly in Marrakech and five provinces near the epicenter, Moroccos Interior Ministry reported Saturday night. At least 2,059 more people were injured  1,404 critically  the ministry said. The problem is that where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough to cope with strong ground shaking, so many collapse, resulting in high casualties, said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London. In a sign of the huge scale of the disaster, Moroccos King Mohammed VI ordered the armed forces to mobilize specialized search and rescue teams and a surgical field hospital, according to a statement from the military. The king said he would visit the hardest hit area Saturday, but despite an outpouring of offers of help from Israel and other countries around the world, the Moroccan government had not formally asked for assistance, a step required before outside rescue crews could deploy. The epicenter of Fridays tremor was near the town of Ighil in Al Haouz Province, roughly 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of Marrakech. Al Haouz is known for scenic villages and valleys tucked in the High Atlas Mountains. Police, emergency vehicles and people fleeing in shared taxis spent hours traversing unpaved roads through the High Atlas in stop-and-go traffic, often exiting their cars to help clear giant boulders from routes known to be rugged and difficult long before Fridays earthquake. In Ijjoukak, a village in the area surrounding Toubkal, North Africas tallest peak, residents estimated nearly 200 buildings had been leveled. Couch cushions, electric cords and grapes were strewn in giant piles of rubble alongside dead sheep, houseplants and doors wedged between boulders. Relatives from the town and those who had driven from major cities cried while they wondered who to call as they reckoned with the aftermath and a lack of food and water. It felt like a bomb went off, 34-year-old Mohamed Messi said. Morocco will observe three days of national mourning with flags at half-staff on all public facilities, the official news agency MAP reported. World leaders offered to send in aid or rescue crews as condolences poured in from countries in Europe, the Middle East and the Group of 20 summit in India. The president of Turkey, which lost tens of thousands of people in a massive earthquake earlier this year, was among those proposing assistance. France and Germany, with large populations of people of Moroccan origin, also offered to help, and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia expressed support for Moroccans. A rescue team from the Israel Defense Forces was also readying for departure to Morocco, pending a formal request from Rabat. Israeli emergency NGO IsraAID said Saturday it was also prepared to join the relief efforts in Morocco, and planned to dispatch a delegation with aid to Marrakesh and the surrounding area. The group said its team was due to arrive in Marrakesh Sunday and had been in contact with the local Jewish community. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with his Moroccan counterpart Abdellatif Loudiyi. A significant part of the Abraham Accords is our commitment to stand by our partners during national crises. The State of Israel is prepared to assist the Kingdom of Morocco during this difficult time, Gallant was quoted as saying in a statement from his office, referring to a series of US-backed normalization deals. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry said it was also readying to join any aid efforts, dispatching a delegation that will include doctors and nurses, along with medical equipment. Israels Foreign Ministry said Saturday night that it had accounted for all 479 Israeli citizens Morocco, and there were no reports of any casualties among them. Israels consul in Rabat Dorit Avidani was heading to the hardest-hit Marrakesh area to get a full picture of the needs there, the ministry said. In an exceptional move, neighboring rival Algeria offered to open its airspace to allow eventual humanitarian aid or medical evacuation flights to travel to and from Morocco. Algeria closed the airspace when its government severed diplomatic ties with Morocco in 2021 over a series of issues. The countries have a decades-long dispute involving the territory of Western Sahara. The US Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 when it hit at 11:11 p.m. (22:11 GMT), with shaking that lasted several seconds. The U.S. agency reported a magnitude 4.9 aftershock hit 19 minutes later. The collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates occurred at a relatively shallow depth, which makes a quake more dangerous. Earthquakes are relatively rare in North Africa. Lahcen Mhanni, Head of the Seismic Monitoring and Warning Department at the National Institute of Geophysics, told 2M TV that the earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in the region. In 1960, a magnitude 5.8 tremor struck near the Moroccan city of Agadir and caused thousands of deaths. That quake prompted changes in construction rules in Morocco, but many buildings, especially rural homes, are not built to withstand such tremors. In 2004, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake near the Mediterranean coastal city of Al Hoceima left more than 600 dead. Fridays quake was felt as far away as Portugal and Algeria, according to the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and Algerias Civil Defense agency, which oversees emergency response.

We are yet to see the reduction of market interest rates and the subsequent credit flow, banks too, are still maintaining high interest rates, the Professor said in this regard, attributing such policies to Sri Lankas lack of economic growth. Albeit acknowledging certain policies that indeed contributed towards the countrys economic stability thus far, such as policies which helped maintain low inflation rates and prevented the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, Prof. Dunusinghe noted that although certain economic policies related to stabilisation have shown to be effective, they have still failed to intervene to create economic growth. Meanwhile, commenting with regards to Sri Lankas Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) process, Prof. Dunusinghe warned that if the relevant parties do not come to an agreement pertaining to the DDO soon, it is likely to hinder the countrys future with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",

        "title": "Presidents Capital Market Clubs concept for schools an investment for future - CSE chief",
        "date": "September 10, 2023 04:16 pm",
        "content": "Chief Executive Officer of the Colombo Stock Exchange Mr. Rajiva Bandaranayake highlighted that President Ranil Wickremesinghes Concept on Capital Market Clubs for schools is a future investment. He further emphasized that President Wickremesinghe has taken a very timely decision to promote financial literacy among the school population which is the most appropriate group to promote. Chief Executive Officer of the Colombo Stock Exchange Mr. Rajiva Bandaranayake expressed these views while participating in the 1O1 Katha program produced by the Presidential Media Division recently. Mr. Rajiva Bandaranayake further said, We hope to introduce the stock market to students more formally through Capital Market Clubs. In the first phase of this program, 100 schools that have shown the best results in the commercial sector according to the A-level results will be selected and 100 capital market associations will be established in them. This is expected to give the students a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the capital market. This allows students to gain knowledge as well as practical study. Even though banking knowledge is imparted in schools, the level of knowledge about the capital market and financial literacy is low. Therefore, it is hoped to expand the knowledge that is limited to the commercial stream beyond that, i.e. to provide some knowledge about the capital market to students in any field such as arts, science, mathematics, etc. through these clubs. We intend to create a new dimension of financial studies in children, through this program. In addition to workshops and seminars, we try to provide more practical knowledge. This program is implemented to improve the knowledge and understanding of the capital market of the current generation of students when they become socialized in the future. Accordingly, this also prepares them for socialization. In particular, they are encouraged to become self-entrepreneurs and be involved in the development of the country effectively. This program has several components. Students are encouraged to develop practical knowledge by conducting workshops for knowledge and understanding as well as holding a competition. In particular, it is planned to allocate a Rs. 100,000 per school as their capital and schools will be allowed to make a profit using that allocation. The best-performing schools will be rewarded as well. As mentioned by the President, we are taking necessary steps to reward the top 10 students and their teacher in charge of the best-performing school with the opportunity to travel to Singapore to enhance their knowledge by observing and studying the Stock Market. These works are carried out under the direct supervision of the Presidents Office, the Ministry of Education, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Stock Exchange. As a country, we have to face some economic difficulties today due to the lack of financial literacy among the majority of us. In comparison with other countries, we are not in a satisfactory position regarding the financial literacy of school children and that should be improved. The future generation will certainly tend to contribute more effectively to the countrys economy. Also, it must be said that financial education is a very important factor for personal success. Small and medium enterprises now have the opportunity to join the stock market and obtain capital to improve their businesses. This knowledge helps to take advantage of that opportunity. The capital market is widely used in developed economies like India. The market capitalization of the stock market is calculated as a percentage of the gross domestic productivity. It is about 25 in Sri Lanka. In India, it is between 80-85 and 100 in Malaysia. Accordingly, it is a good example that the contribution of the stock market has a very high impact on the economy of a country. The stock market of our country should also be brought to the same. For that, financial literacy must be at a high level. These capital market clubs are trying to create a platform for that. As the stock market is conducted on a digital platform, it is easier for todays youth to handle it. Because all these activities are at a distance of two fingertips. All the operations in the Colombo stock market can be done from anywhere in the world through a mobile phone or a laptop. President has decided that it is best to popularize this at the school level because of the closeness between school students and digital technology. That idea is very timely. We have a strong belief that this will be successful. Students need to think in a new way and they should not wait for the government to provide jobs as done traditionally. With digitization and technology, limitless global opportunities are available to todays youth. Through this, we expect to provide them with guidance. Entrepreneurship should be brought to students. We must say that we are fulfilling that responsibility through this program.",

Commenting on the recent controversies surrounding the provision of medial degrees at private universities, the Minister stated there are many children who are eligible to study medicine, but we have only 11 universities in our country, which is insufficient. Moreover, he emphasised on the global recognition medical degrees obtained from Sri Lankan universities hold, further explaining that the island nation should capitalize on this opportunity and produce more such students. Instead of hindering this global recognition medical degrees from Sri Lanka receive, we need to maintain the same standards at both private and state universities. If we are able to produce outstanding students who would be of service to the world, we need to implement a system that would work parallel with this goal, he said in this regard.",

        "title": "G20 summit wraps up in New Delhi; Macron says it confirms isolation of Russia",
        "date": "September 10, 2023 10:07 pm",
        "content": "The G20 summit in New Delhi ended on Sunday as India handed over the bloc presidency to Brazil, while both the U.S. and Russia praised a consensus that did not condemn Moscow for the war in Ukraine but called on members to shun the use of force. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the groups leaders to hold a virtual meeting in November to review progress on policy suggestions and goals announced at the weekend. It is our responsibility to look at the suggestions that have been made to see how progress can be accelerated, he said in a statement. On Saturday, the group adopted a Leaders Declaration that avoided condemning Russia for the war but highlighted the human suffering the conflict had caused and called on all states not to use force to grab territory. The consensus came as a surprise. In the weeks leading to the summit, sharply differing views on the war had threatened to derail the meeting, with Western nations demanding members call out Moscow for the invasion and Russia saying it would block any resolution that did not reflect its position. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the head of the Russian delegation, said the summit was a success for India as well as the Global South, the worlds developing countries. The Global Souths position in the talks helped prevent the G20 agenda from being overshadowed by Ukraine, he told a press conference. India has truly consolidated G20 members from the Global South. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the summit declaration does a very good job of standing up for the principle that states cannot use force to seek territorial acquisition or to violate the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of other states. Germany and Britain have also praised the resolution, but Ukraine said it was nothing to be proud of. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that the G20, which was founded to solve international economic issues, was not necessarily the place to expect diplomatic progress on the war in Ukraine. However, he said the G20 declaration was not a diplomatic victory for Russia. This G20 confirms once again the isolation of Russia. Today, an overwhelming majority of G20 members condemn the war in Ukraine and its impact, Macron told a press conference after the closing ceremony of the summit. Japans Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: Russias invasion of Ukraine is something that could shake the foundation of cooperation at G20. Also, that is having a major impact on the global economy through such developments as continued increases in food and energy prices. Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands dead, displaced millions and sown economic turmoil across the world. Moscow, which says it is conducting a special military operation there, denies committing any atrocities. WALKING BAREFOOT The summit also admitted the African Union, which includes 55 member states, as a permanent member of the G20, underlining the blocs inclusivity of more developing countries. Addressing food security concerns, Lavrov said Russia would return to the Black Sea deal that lets Ukraine export grain if Moscows demands were met. Moscow pulled out of the agreement in July over what it called a failure to meet its demands to implement a parallel agreement easing rules for its own food and fertiliser export. The summit document had called for the safe flow of grain, food and fertiliser from both Ukraine and Russia. Russia, Ukraine and Turkey are going to continue to discuss the grain deal, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said, saying that reviving the agreement was not hopeless. On Sunday, world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, German Olaf Scholz, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japans Fumio Kishida, visited the memorial of Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi. Most of the leaders were barefoot as they walked to the site where Gandhi was cremated following his assassination in 1948 by a Hindu extremist. Biden later left for Vietnam, missing the last session of the summit. The White House said it was not aware of him having any talks with Lavrov or Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who led their countrys delegations at the summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russias Vladimir Putin both skipped the summit. This was one of the most difficult G20 summits in the almost twenty-year history of the forum ... it took almost 20 days to agree on the declaration before the summit and five days here on the spot, Svetlana Lukash, the Russian G20 government negotiator, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax. This was not only due to some disagreements on the Ukraine subject, but also due to differences in positions on all key issues, primarily the issues of climate change and the transition to low-carbon energy systems... A European Union official, who did not want to be identified, said on Sunday the Ukraine war was the most contentious issue in the negotiations. Without Indias leadership it would not have been possible, the official said, adding that Brazil and South Africa also played a crucial role in bridging differences. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "content": "Google is reportedly rolling out an AI-powered Proofread feature within its Gboard keyboard for beta users, enhancing text composition on the fly. This feature is accessible with Gboard version 13.4, currently in beta for Android users. The Proofread option is prominently located in the keyboards toolbar. This functionality leverages generative AI to instantly check text for spelling and grammar errors, as reported by 9to5Google. When users activate this feature, a pop-up message provides an explanation of the proofreading process. It involves temporarily sending the text to Google for processing to generate grammar and writing suggestions. Users can opt to enable this feature, but its essential to note that the text being proofread is sent to Googles servers during this process. Tapping the Proofread option in Gboards toolbar initiates text analysis, delivering suggestions for spelling and grammar corrections, including punctuation. Additionally, a Fix it button accompanies these suggestions, allowing users to swiftly apply recommended corrections. This AI-powered enhancement aims to improve text accuracy and coherence while composing messages, emails, or any text-based content using Gboard. In a related update, Google is undergoing a rebranding for its Android brand, which includes adopting a new stylization with a capital A for Android instead of using all lowercase letters. The iconic bug droid logo is also being transformed into a 3D avatar. This branding update aligns the Android logo more closely with Googles own branding by capitalizing the A and introducing design elements that bring it in line with Googles visual identity. The goal is to create a harmonious visual representation between the Android and Google logos, enhancing their cohesion. Source - India Today - Agencies",

        "date": "September 11, 2023 12:26 pm",
        "content": "Like many horrors before it, bad reviews didnt scare off moviegoers from buying tickets for  The Nun II. The sequel to the 2018 hit, released in 3,728 theaters by Warner Bros., topped the box office in its first weekend in North American theaters earning an estimated 32.6 million, the studio said Sunday. APs Mark Kennedy wrote in his one star review that its a movie that seems destined to pound a nail into this franchises undead coffin and audiences gave it a C CinemaScore. But it hardly matters: Horror is perhaps the most reliably critic-proof genre, at least when it comes to opening weekend. The Michael Graves-directed sequel starring Taissa Farmiga and Storm Reid fell far short of the debut for the first film (53.8 million), but its still a solid launch. The Nun movies are part of the so-called Conjuring universe, which now has nine films, and 2.1 billion in box office, to its name. The sequel also played well internationally, picking up 52.7 million from 69 markets (Mexico being the strongest with 8.9 million) and boosting its global debut to 85.3 million. To have a horror universe is really powerful in terms of the revenue generating potential, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Its a great bet that Warners made on the horror moviegoing experience never waning. And there are many more scary movies on the calendar through the fall including A Death in Venice, which opens next week, Saw X on Sept. 29 and The Exorcist: Believer on Oct. 6. The Nun II bumped Denzel Washingtons  Equalizer 3  to second place in its second weekend. The Columbia Pictures release added 12.1 million, bringing its domestic grosses to 61.9 million and its worldwide earnings to 107.7 million. Third place went to another new movie: The third installment of Nia Vardaloss My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which arrives 21 years after the first film became a massive sleeper hit earning some 369 million against a 5 million production budget. Released by Focus Features in 3,650 theaters, the third film earned an estimated 10 million, overwhelmingly driven by female audiences. Vardalos wrote, directed and stars in Greek Wedding 3, which brings back John Corbett and takes the gang to Greece. APs Jocelyn Noveck wrote in her review that the movie, which has gotten mostly poor marks, is like a thrice-warmed piece of baklava. The Indian revenge thriller, Jawan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, opened in fourth place with 6.2 million from only 813 locations. It was released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Khan, a Bollywood superstar, also led another box office sensation this year, Pathaan, which has made 130 million worldwide. Barbie, which comes to VOD on Tuesday, dropped to No. 5 after 8 triumphant weeks with 5.9 million from 3,281 locations. The Warner Bros. film has now made 620.5 million domestically. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. The Nun II, 32.6 million. 2. The Equalizer 3, 12.1 million. 3. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, 10 million. 4. Jawan, 6.2 million. 5. Barbie, 5.9 million. 6. Blue Beetle, 3.8 million. 7. Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story, 3.4 million. 8. Oppenheimer, 3 million. 9. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, 2.6 million. Source - CP24 - Agencies",

        "content": "The four police personnel arrested over their alleged involvement in the custodial death of R. Rajakumari, a housemaid, have been further remanded until 18 September, on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court. The relevant order was issued by Colombo Additional Magistrate Harsha Kekunawala when the case was brought before the court this morning (11 Sep.). Three of the four suspects, two Police Sergeants and a Constable, were scheduled to be referred to an identification parade today, however this was postponed by a week after the accused raised an objection in this regard. Meanwhile, appearing on behalf of the aggrieved party, Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera informed the court that as per information received by him, the OIC of the Welikada Police Station, who was transferred from his post following Rajakumaris death, was reinstated as the Welikada OIC once again. The lawyer raised concerns in this regard, highlighting the fact that this could potentially hinder the ongoing investigations into the housemaids death. Colombo Additional Magistrate Harsha Kekunawala did not, however, issue an order in this regard. 41-year-old R. Rajakumari, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on 11 May based on a complaint made by her employer, famed producer Sudharma Nethicumara, claiming that the former had stolen gold jewellery belonging to her. She had later died while in the custody of the Welikada Police. Her relatives raised suspicions, alleging that she had been subjected to assault. On 25 August, the Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala ordered the CID to arrest the suspects linked to the housemaids death. The verdict was delivered after careful examination of evidence and the findings in the post-mortem report submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer. Accordingly, the cause of death was ruled as hemorrhagic shock caused by damage to the deceaseds muscles after being attacked with a blunt weapon or similar force.",

Meanwhile, speaking on the accountability project established by the Council in Sri Lanka, Al-Nashif further stated that the project is receiving a steady increase in requests from competent state authorities, including in relation to 10 named individuals. The project was established to collect, consolidate, analyse and preserve information and evidence pertaining to accountability claims, and provide support to relevant judicial and other proceedings including those in other member states with competent jurisdiction, she said in this regard. Highlighting the fact that accountability remains central to secure Sri Lankas present and its future, Al-Nashif stressed that the accountability project, the council and its member states can play an important and complementary role in advancing accountability within the country, further adding that her office remains committed to ensuring reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. Addressing Sri Lankas recent economic crisis, Al-Nashif regretfully noted that the transformation that was hoped for to address longstanding challenges has still not materialized, albeit one year having passed since the anti-government protests. The country continues to deal with the aftermath of the deep economic crises of 2022, and the current stresses in the global economy, she said emphasising that the crisis affected the poor and marginalized community the most, doubling the islands poverty rates from 13 in 2021 to 25 in 2022. Thus, she urged that the international community, including international financial institutions, continue to support Sri Lankas economic recovery by providing the fiscal space required while simultaneously pressing for genuine progress in governance, transparency and accountability. Presenting the annual report of the UNHCHR and report of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General, promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, Al-Nashif emphasised that: Truth-seeking alone will not suffice. It must also be accompanied by a clear commitment to accountability and the political will to implement far-reaching change.",

        "date": "September 11, 2023 06:08 pm",
        "content": "Two persons have been taken into custody by the Sri Lanka Customs central intelligence directorate, for allegedly attempting to smuggle 4.5 million sticks of foreign-made cigarettes worth around Rs. 110 million into the country. The undeclared stock of cigarettes was taken into custody by officers of the central intelligence directorate at the Grayline Container Yard in Colombo on Monday (11), following the inspection of a container that had reached the Colombo Port from India. The Customs spokesman said the arrest was made based on the information provided by the Customs Intelligence Division of India to the officials of the Customs Intelligence Directorate of Sri Lanka and that this container had arrived at the port of Colombo from the Kattupalli Port in Tamil Nadu on September 07. The contents of the container had been declared to customs as 100 cotton fabric and plastic buttons by an importer in the Wattala area and that, however no such items were discovered inside the container. Sri Lanka Customs says that the loss of tax revenue to the government from the illegally imported cigarettes has been estimated at around Rs. 316 million. Customs officers have arrested two persons who came to release the container in connection with this illegal import while the Customs intelligence officers are conducting further investigations in this regard.",

        "date": "September 11, 2023 07:52 pm",
        "content": "Responding to the oral report on Sri Lanka at the first meeting of the 54th Regular Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday, Sri Lanka has rejected the report and its recommendations, claiming that is does not reflect the actual situation in Sri Lanka, and instead gravely distorted and misinterpreted the ground situation within the country. Speaking further in this regard, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva, Himalee Arunatilaka noted that it is regrettable that the Office of the Human Commissioner of Human Rights (OCHCR) has chosen to ignore the democratic resilience of the country and its institutions demonstrated in the past year. She stated that Sri Lanka remains deeply concerned about the ever-increasing mandate of the OCHCR, in making sweeping and intrusive comments on all aspects of economic, financial, political, electoral, domestic, budgetary and development policies, adding that the nation strongly objects to pronouncements on policy matters that are essentially domestic for any sovereign country and are outside the framework of this council. Albeit the UN reports claims that Sri Lankas economic recovery is yet to materialize one year after the countrys turbulent anti-government protests and its most severe economic crisis, Arunatilaka highlighted that those who are mandated and possess the required expertise, both domestically and internationally, remain confident in Sri Lankas prospects. Commenting on the reports references to targeted sanctions, the diplomat stated that Sri Lanka rejects all such references, which are based on incorrect and unsubstantiated sources, contravening the process of natural justice of universality, impartiality objectivity and non-selectivity, emphasising Sri Lankas commitment towards pursuing tangible mechanisms on human rights through our domestic institutions, having made significant progress in this regard. Speaking further on these said mechanisms, she pointed out that certain independent domestic mechanisms have made tangible progress, citing the Office on Missing Persons, Office for Repatriations and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation as examples of this said progress. Moreover, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka highlighted other such examples, including the Anti-Corruption Act which strengthened the financial and functional independence of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Corruption or Bribery (CIABOC), and the ongoing deliberations pertaining to the Anti-Terrorism Bill with the aim of bringing it in line with international standards. Thus, rejecting all recommendations and conclusions put forward by the UN report in concern, Sri Lanka urged that the written observations submitted countering the report also be given equal visibility as the OHCHR report. Meanwhile, commenting on UN Resolutions 461 and 511, which have repeatedly been rejected by Sri Lanka, Arunatilaka asserted that the nation vehemently refuses to cooperate with the resolution in question, deeming them intrusive and polarising. We recall that the majority of member states either opposed or abstained from voting on these resolutions in fundamental disagreement with their unacceptable content, in particular the so-called evidence gathering mechanism, the establishment of which remains unprecedented, the diplomat said in this regard. Speaking further on Resolutions 461 and 511, Arunatilaka characterized them to be intrusive and polarizing, adding that they are upheld only by a handful of countries for reasons unrelated to human rights and based on their vote-bank domestic politics. Highlighting that Sri Lanka has repeatedly pointed out that this is an unproductive and unhelpful drain on the resources of the council and its member, she stated that Sri Lanka will not cooperate with it. Arunatilaka noted, however, that the nation will continue to engage constructively with other mechanisms of the council which have proved productive to the people of Sri Lanka, such as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process.",

        "date": "September 11, 2023 09:15 pm",
        "content": "In a significant development, Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella announced today that the Cabinet has granted approval for the establishment of three private medical colleges within Sri Lanka. Minister Rambukwella emphasized that these new medical institutions will adhere to the standards set by existing medical schools in the country. Addressing a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (11 Sep.) on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country  Minister Rambukwella elaborated on the initiative, stating: The Cabinet has already given its approval to launch three new medical colleges. These institutions must maintain the same high standards as our existing medical schools. We must consider the number of our youth who choose to study in private institutions or abroad. It is our moral duty to provide adequate facilities and opportunities for our countrys children. The Minister further stressed that Professors who have worked as consultants in the medical colleges of our country have outlined minimum qualifications. There is a law that mandates other recognized medical schools in this country to meet or exceed these standards. Additionally, three hospitals have been integrated into these universities. The minister also revealed that these universities have been urged to allocate scholarships to 10 of their student population, acknowledging the existence of qualified students who face financial barriers to pursuing medical education. Minister Rambukwella took the opportunity to address concerns about the brain drain of medical professionals, attributing it to economic challenges faced by the country in 2019. He assured that the government is committed to addressing these issues, particularly regarding doctors remuneration. He highlighted the need for comprehensive short, medium and long-term plans to address these challenges and pointed out that countries like England offer significantly higher salaries to medical professionals educated in Sri Lankas free education system. In furtherance of our commitment to addressing critical healthcare challenges, it is essential to consider augmenting the intake capacity in specific domains. Currently, there exist stipulated minimum qualifications and approximately 13 medical faculties throughout the country. Regrettably, only around 2000 individuals are admitted into these institutions. It is evident that there is ample room to expand these numbers, as the intellectual capabilities of our nations youth are beyond question. It is imperative to provide opportunities to those with foundational qualifications who aspire to excel in the medical field. In a related development, the motion of no confidence presented against Minister Rambukwella in Parliament was defeated. He acknowledged the constructive suggestions provided during the debate and pledged to take steps to implement them. He also presented evidence countering false allegations made during the motion, including concerns about the quality and availability of medicines In response to allegations raised within the no-confidence motion, particularly concerning the quality of medicines, I had the opportunity to present evidence substantiating the veracity of our claims. Reference was made to a report from 2017 highlighting issues related to substandard medications, with subsequent years showing varying numbers of such incidents: 85 in 2018, 96 in 2019, 77 in 2020, 88 in 2021, 86 in 2022 and 43 so far in 2023. It is worth noting that, in some cases, reports of substandard drugs have emerged years after their approval, registration and utilization. We have initiated a comprehensive investigation into these reported incidents of inferior quality medicines. Additionally, there were allegations regarding the shortage of essential medicines, a concern we take seriously and are actively addressing. Our on-going commitment remains to bolster our healthcare system, ensure the availability of high-quality medicines and provide opportunities for aspiring medical professionals. We recognize the need for continued dialogue and effective action to overcome the challenges facing our healthcare sector and to uphold the well-being of our citizens. Regarding lower quality medicines, Rambukwella referenced reports from recent years, indicating that these cases are being addressed. He affirmed that the government takes such matters seriously and is committed to ensuring the quality and availability of essential medicines for the public.",

Accordingly, Sri Lanka Police have released an image of the Constable in question, and have urged the public to contact either the Police Media Division (PMD) on 071 859 1774 or 071 859 4929 with any relevant information. The organized criminal gang leader known as Harak Kata, had reportedly attempted to flee from the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Sunday (10 Sep.). According to the CID, Harak Kata had been aided by a certain Police Constable, who had fled soon after the incident. Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers last afternoon, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with aid of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom, the CID reported, and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  the Constable, and another Sub-Inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed, and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene of the incident upon hearing the commotion, and detained Harak Kata in their custody, while the missing Police Constable had reportedly fled the scene during this altercation. Investigations are currently underway to apprehend the suspect, Police confirmed.",

        "date": "September 11, 2023 10:18 pm",
        "content": "At least 150 people have died after a powerful storm caused severe flooding in eastern Libya, an official has said. Storm Daniel made landfall in the North African nation over the weekend, prompting authorities to declare a state of extreme emergency. Last week, it killed a dozen people in Europe. Seven Libyan army personnel have gone missing during ongoing rescue efforts. Officials in eastern Libya have imposed a curfew, while schools and shops have been ordered to close. Storm Daniel has affected the eastern cities of Benghazi, Sousse, Derna and Al-Marj. At least 150 people were killed as a result of flooding and torrential rains... in Derna, the Jabal al-Akhdar region and the suburbs of Al-Marj, Mohamed Massoud, a spokesman for the Benghazi-based administration in Libya, told French news agency AFP. The head of Benghazis chapter of the Red Crescent humanitarian network said at least 150 deaths occurred in Derna alone, according to news agency Reuters. Reports said two dams in Derna - home to approximately 100,000 - have collapsed, submerging much of the area and drowning some of its residents. Authorities have declared the port a disaster city. The western city of Misrata was also among those hit by the floods. Unverified videos of the storm have been circulating online, including a clip showing torrents of floodwater sweeping a man away. Other footage shows drivers trapped on their car roofs. Alongside schools and shops, four major oil ports closed because of the storm. While the Benghazi-based administration has been dealing with matters in the east of the country, the rival, internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, has also been involved. Its Prime Minister, Abdulhamid Dbeiba, said on Sunday that he had directed all state agencies to immediately deal with the damage and floods, while the United Nations in Libya said it was following the storm closely and would provide urgent relief assistance in support of response efforts at local and national levels. Libya has been divided between two rival administrations since 2014, following the killing of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Both governments declared three days of mourning after Storm Daniel swept in. Last week, it struck Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, killing more than a dozen people. It is is expected to reach western Egypt on Monday. Climate scientists have warned that global warming means more water evaporating during the summer, leading to more intense storms.

        "content": "At least 20 scheduled train services were cancelled this morning due to the strike launched by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineers Union, according to Sri Lanka Railways. The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union had launched the strike from midnight yesterday over several key demands, including amendments to the recruitment process and promotions, which they say have been delayed for nearly five years despite their constant requests in this regard. The unions secretary, S.R.C.M. Senanayake said the promotions and recruitment process of locomotive operating engineers have been stalled due to the absence of a proper salary scale. Despite informing the President, the Prime Minister, the Transport Minister and the Railway General Manager about the matter, Senanayake said the locomotive operating engineers are yet to receive a proper solution. He vowed to carry on the trade union action by incorporating all locomotive operating engineers, if the authorities fail to meet their demands. However, the members of the public were gravely affected by the railway strike this morning. As multiple trains were cancelled, the trains that were in operation were crammed with passengers. Many commuters were seen train surfing due to overcrowding. Meanwhile, the express trains, including Kurunegala-Colombo Fort and Puttalam-Mount Lavinia trains, have made stops at additional railway stations along the way. Some of the trains that were cancelled are as follows:  Slow train from Rambukkana to Colombo  Chilaw-bound train departing Aluthgama at 4:30am  Colombo Fort-bound train from Chilaw  Negombo-bound train departing Colombo Fort at 6:50am  Maradana-bound train departing Panadura at 7:40am  Maradana-bound trains departing Moratuwa at 7:45am and 8:10am  Maradana-bound train departing Kalutara South at 7:25am  Colombo Fort-bound trains departing Padukka at 5:20am and 7:10am  Colombo Fort-bound train departing Kosgama at 6:05am",

        "content": "Days of relentless rain from the remnants of former Typhoon Haikui have caused more than 100 landslides, trapped about 1,360 residents in floodwaters and killed at least seven people in Chinas south, said state media. Typhoon Haikui hit southern China eight days ago and has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, but unrelenting rain continues to deluge southwestern Guangxi. Incessant storms in the last three days in most areas of Yulin city caused 115 landslides that destroyed roads, uprooting trees, inducing floods and leading authorities to issue a warning of emergencies on national and provincial trunk highways, state media said. Three people remain missing and rescue operations were ongoing. Further south near the coast, Beihai city was inundated from widespread downpour. Rescuers were seen treading thigh-deep in waterlogged areas evacuating residents in boats. About 1,360 people were trapped on Tuesday, state media said. The citys observatory raised its storm warning to the highest in a four-tier alert system after more than 101mm (4 inches) rain poured in a three-hour period on Tuesday morning, and flagged risks of flash floods, geological disasters and waterlogging in urban and rural areas. Haikui, which weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall in southeastern Fujian province on Sept. 5, had last week wrecked havoc in the populous city of Shenzhen dumping historic rainfall since records began in 1952. Neighbouring Hong Kong was also pelted by the worst storm in 140 years. Scientists warn that typhoons hitting China are becoming more intense and their paths growing more complex, escalating risk of disaster, even in coastal cities such as Shenzhen that already have strong flood defence capabilities. China Meteorological Administration forecast heavy rains in the south and southeast parts of Guangxi on Tuesday and Wednesday, with storms in the southwest. Localised hourly precipitation could hit 70mm (2.76 inches) in some areas, it said. The national forecaster also warned relevant departments and people in Guangdong and Guangxi to be alert to any delayed effects of disasters from frequent rainfall in recent days.

Director of the Traffic Administration and Road Safety Division, DIG Indika Hapugoda states that most of the road accidents involve motorcycles. About 12,000 people die a year in Sri Lanka. A quarter of these deaths, which amounts to around 3,000, are caused by traffic violations. As per calculations, approximately 7-8 individuals lose their lives daily. Furthermore, DIG Hapugoda mentioned that, according to the statistics of the Traffic Headquarters of the Sri Lanka Police, 1,500 people have thus far lost their lives in 1,427 fatal road accidents between January 01 and August 31, 2023. Notably, about one-third of these road deaths are caused by motorcycle accidents, he added, emphasizing that so far in 2023, a total of 630 motorcyclists have lost their lives in 612 accidents. We can, of course, reduce these accidents. DIG Hapugoda highlighted that the World Health Organization (WHO) hopes to reduce this figure by 50 by the year 2030. However, if we could reduce the current number of 07 deaths per day to 04, it will be a huge victory for us, he added.

Joining the Cabinet press conference held this morning, the minister stated that the relevant request will be made in order to safeguard the law and peace and the public security of the country. Strict legal actions will be sought against anyone who disrupts it, he added. Furthermore, Gunawardena said that a country that has fallen into trouble due to trade union terrorism, and is unable to recover, will not survive further if this situation continues. However this morning, at least 20 scheduled train services were cancelled due to the strike action launched by the Locomotive Operating Engineers Union since midnight yesterday (Sept. 11). As a result of the trade union action, passengers were seen train surfing due to overcrowding, and many others were left stranded at railway stations, whereas a fatal incident of a 20-year-old falling off the train roof after knocking against the roof of the Horape railway station was also reported. According to reports, the critically injured youth has died on the spot.",

The approval was given at the Cabinet meeting on Monday (Sept. 11). The Head of State, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies, has suggested that a proposal regarding the aforementioned revision be submitted to the committee stage of Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Bill when it is taken up for discussion in the parliament. Previously, the Cabinet of Ministers had given the nod to submit to the parliament the draft bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman to revise the VAT Act No. 14 of 2022 including the repeal of SVAT scheme with effect from January 01, 2024. However, the government says the representations made by relevant parties have pointed out that drastic issues are likely to emerge in finance flow in relation to individuals especially the exporters who have been registered under the system at present if the SVAT system is repealed without a strong VAT repayment system. Therefore, it is apparent that it is appropriate to repeal the SVAT system step by step until a strong tax repaying mechanism is established, the government said further in a statement.",

Sri Lanka has been battling its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades after its foreign exchange reserves depleted to record lows and forced the island to default on its debts in May 2022. The bonds, largely from superannuated funds, were eligible for exchange under a domestic debt restructuring program announced by Sri Lanka in June. A total of 3.2 trillion rupees of the 8.7 trillion rupees in bonds eligible for exchange were accepted, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The settlement date of the exchange has been set at Sept. 14. The success of the Invitation to Exchange will enable the Republic to reduce Gross Financing Needs (GFN) over the next 10 years, thereby contributing to achieving the Republics GFN target agreed in the context of the current IMF-supported programme, the statement added. A delegation from the IMF will arrive in Colombo on Thursday to start the evaluation process for the first review of the 2.6 billion four-year program which Sri Lanka secured in March. Under the IMF program, Sri Lanka has set a target of restructuring its debt for the next 10 years and reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 120 to about 95 by 2032. However, Sri Lanka still needs to complete talks with key bilateral creditors, including Japan, China and India, before it can take the next step to restructure its debt. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15",
        "date": "September 12, 2023 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Apple is expected to debut its iPhone 15 lineup Tuesday at the companys annual September keynote event, and it could introduce the biggest change to the phones design in 11 years. The press event, which Apple teased with a wonderlust tagline, will take place at the companys headquarters in Cupertino, California, and will be livestreamed on its website, starting at 10am local time. Although the annual iPhone event has become formulaic over the years, announcing incremental changes to battery life, camera system and displays, this year Apple is expected to introduce USB-C charging to its smartphones for the first time. The change could ultimately streamline the charging process across various devices and brands. But the company will have to show off more than just a new charging system to get users to upgrade. Last month, Apples sales fell for the third consecutive quarter. iPhone revenue came in at 39.7 billion for the quarter, marking an approximately 2 year-over-year decline. Heres more of what to expect: A big change to charging Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, but now may be the time for the company to finally make the change on iPhones. The move would come less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. This is arguably the biggest disruption to iPhone design for several years, but in reality, it is hardly a dramatic move, said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. Last year, Apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, publicly stressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger, which is designed for faster device charging, but noted obviously we will have to comply with the EU mandate. The Lightning charger was introduced in 2012. The change to USB-C would also likely usher in a wave of charging accessories, potentially in various colors. Its possible iPhone users will also pay up for a USB-C wall adapter because it will be a different size connector. Other iPhone 15 features The entire iPhone 15 lineup is rumored to get the Dynamic Island feature  an interactive home for alerts, notifications and various controls  that replaces the notch on top of the screen. The tool launched on the higher-end iPhone 14 Pro models last year. Although there are few other rumors circulating about its entry-level iPhone models, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models are expected to get a handful of new features, according to a Bloomberg report. This may include a rear-facing periscope lens, which allows for more optical zoom, and a titanium casing to make the device up to 15 lighter and thinner. The Pro models are also expected to get Apples latest A17 chip  the first with 3 nanometer technology, which could deliver faster processing and a longer-lasting battery. The lineup is also expected to come in various new colors, as hinted at in the Apple logo featured in the events invitation, including navy and updated shades of gray, white and silver. A Vision Pro update In June, Apple introduced the Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset that the company says will usher in a new era of spatial computing. Yoram Wurmser, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, believes the company will tease some new features and deeper collaborations to drum up excitement ahead of its 2024 launch. (Its also possible Apple could announce a launch date). The headset blends both virtual reality and augmented reality, a technology that overlays virtual images on live video of the real world. The headset is Apples biggest, and riskiest, product launch in years. New AirPods, Apple Watches and software release dates The company typically unveils its latest Apple Watches alongside the iPhone each year, so its likely well see the debut of the Apple Watch Series 9 and possibly its next-generation Ultra 2 smartwatch, its more rugged wearable for serious sports enthusiasts. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on a full revamp of its smartwatch for next years Apple Watch Series 10, so this years updates will be relatively minor. In addition, Apple is expected to show off its next-generation AirPods with a new charging case that will work with USB-C cables. Its also likely to announce launch dates for its next-generation operating systems for the iPhone, iPads, Mac computers and Apple Watch. In May, for example, Apple showed off a slew of new tools coming to iOS 17, such as a more accurate autocorrect, a new feature called Live Voicemail that will transcribe a callers message in real time, and a NameDrop tool that lets users share their contact information by holding two iPhones close together. The iPhones phone app will also reposition the hang up button to the bottom right of the screen, next to other functions. What not to expect With the new iPhone expected to take center stage, many analysts dont anticipate Apple will release new iPads or Mac computers until October. And despite rivals Samsung and Google doubling down on foldable devices, Apple is still not expected to unveil a similar version this fall. Source - CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "September 12, 2023 04:51 pm",
        "content": "Libyas eastern city of Derna has buried 700 people killed in devastating flooding and 10,000 were reported missing as rescue teams struggled to retrieve many more bodies from the horrific deluge, officials said Tuesday. Mediterranean storm Daniel on Sunday night caused havoc and flash flooding in many towns in eastern Libya but the worst destruction was in Derna, where heavy rainfall and floods broke dams and washed away entire neighborhoods, authorities said. The situation is catastrophic, said Othman Abduljaleel, the health minister in Libyas eastern government. The bodies are still lying on the ground in many parts (of the city). Hospitals are filled with bodies. And there are areas we have yet to reach. Authorities estimated earlier that as many as 2,000 people may have perished in Derna alone. The Ambulance and Emergency Authority, which coordinates search and rescue efforts, said Tuesday that about 2,300 people died in Derna but did not clarify what that figure was based on. Emergency responders, including troops, government workers, volunteers and residents were digging through rubble to recover the dead. They also used inflatable boats to retrieve bodies from the water. Excavators and other equipment have yet to arrive in Derna. Tamer Ramadan, Libya envoy for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said 10,000 people were missing after the unprecedented flooding. Speaking to reporters at a U.N. briefing in Geneva via videoconference from Tunisia, he said the death toll was huge and expected to reach into the thousands in the coming days. Referring to Fridays devastating earthquake in Morocco, on the other side of North Africa, Ramadan said the situation in Libya was as devastating as the situation in Morocco. Ossama Hamad, prime minister of the eastern Libyan government, said that many of the missing were believed to have been carried away after two upstream dams burst. He said the devastation in Derna is far beyond the capabilities of his country. After more than a decade of chaos, Libya remains divided between two rival administrations: one in the east and one in the west, each backed by different militias and foreign governments. The conflict has left the oil rich North African country with crumbling and inadequate infrastructure. Derna was declared a disaster zone and more bodies were still under the rubble in the citys neighborhoods, or washed away to the sea, according to Abduljaleel, the health minister. Residents posted videos online showing major devastation. Entire residential blocks were erased along Wadi Derna, a river that runs down from the mountains through the city center. Multi-story apartment buildings that once stood well back from the river were partially collapsed into mud. Abduljaleel said the city was inaccessible and bodies were scattered all over, according to Libyas state-run news agency. The situation was more significant and worse than we expected.  An international intervention is needed, he was quoted as saying. Emergency responders, including troops, government workers, volunteers and residents were digging through rubble to recover the dead. They also used inflatable boats to retrieve bodies from the water. Excavators and other equipment have yet to arrive in Derna. Many described scenes of chaos when floods hit the center. They heard loud explosions at night and realized that dams outside the city collapsed, sending a wall of water that erased everything in its way, said Ahmed Abdalla, a Derna resident. Workers said they buried more than 200 bodies in one cemetery on Monday. Footage overnight showed dozens more bodies on the ground, covered by blankets or sheets, in a hospital yard in Derna. The storm hit other areas in eastern Libya, including the town of Bayda, where about 50 people were reported dead. The Medical Center of Bayda, the main hospital, was flooded and patients had to be evacuated, according to footage shared by the center on Facebook. Other towns that suffered, included Susa, Marj and Shahatt, according to the government. Hundreds of families were displaced and took shelter in schools and other government buildings in the city of Benghazi and elsewhere in eastern Libya. Northeast Libya is one of the countrys most fertile and green regions. The Jabal al-Akhdar area  where Bayda, Marj and Shahatt are located  has one of the countrys highest average annual rainfalls, according to the World Bank. Authorities in eastern and western Libya rushed to Derna. The Health Ministry in Tripoli said a plane carrying 14 tons of medical equipment, drugs and body bags, along with health care workers headed Tuesday to Benghazi. Other agencies across the country said they would send humanitarian aid to Derna. Foreign governments also sent messages of support to Libya. Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates were among those that said they would send humanitarian assistance and teams to help with search and rescue efforts. The U.S. Embassy said Monday it was contacting the United Nations and Libyan authorities on how to deliver aid to the most affected areas. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi convened his military commanders on Tuesday to arrange urgent assistance to Libya. He said in televised comments that the military would deploy equipment and personnel in coordination with eastern Libyan forces to help affected communities. Known for its white-painted houses and palm gardens, Derna is about 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of the capital of Tripoli. It is controlled by the forces of powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, who is allied with the east Libya government. The rival government in west Libya, based in Tripoli, is allied with other armed groups. Much of Derna was built by Italy when Libya was under Italian occupation in the first half of the 20th century. The city was once a hub for extremist groups in the yearslong chaos that followed the NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

South Asias fastest man, who was expected to spearhead Sri Lankas campaign for an athletic medal at this years Asiad, says that as his team planned earlier this year, he had a strong start to the summer season in 2023, achieving good results. However, as many of you already know, I faced an unfortunate injury during a race in Savona, Italy. Since then, I have been dedicated to my recovery and rehabilitation under expert guidance for the past three months, he said, in a Facebook post today. Abeykoon states that after evaluating the required timings to secure a medal in the Asian Games considering the past results, personal records, and the current form of competing athletes, along with his current physical condition and the limited time remaining, it was decided following extensive discussions not to take part in the Asian Games. Abeykoon, who points out that the Asian Games is a significant competition in the region, also emphasizes that his primary aspiration was not simply to participate but to emerge victorious. While competitions are undeniably important for winning and gaining experience, there come moments when health takes precedence. I put in every effort possible, but the time needed for a full recovery and the intervals required for ongoing treatment significantly affect training capacity. Those familiar with sports injuries understand the risk of rushing back into intensive training too soon, which could lead to further setbacks, he added. However, he further expresses that the Paris Olympics next year is a monumental milestone in his sporting journey, adding that every competition, experience gained, and record achieved has been in preparation for this ultimate goal. Tomorrow, I will commence training and treatment once again. In an event as competitive as the 100m, the stakes are high. While we are accustomed to taking calculated risks each time we compete, this time we have chosen not to risk a potential re-injury, keeping our focus firmly on the Paris Olympics next year, he said. The Sri Lankan sprinter, who assures that he is fully committed to this endeavour and has dedicated himself with unwavering determination, also expressed his special gratitude to the team, doctors, and specialists who have assisted him with treatment, as well as the Sri Lanka Cricket and TV Derana for the unwavering support. Yupun Abeykoon underwent a minor hamstring injury during a race in Savona, Italy three months ago, which also caused him to withdraw from the 2023 World Athletics Championships earlier in August.",

It has stayed off the air since the strike began on May 2nd, but has now (unfortunately) decided to return without its writers. However, although writers are not working on the programme as it returns, Variety noted, Barrymores work as a performer on The Drew Barrymore Show is not a violation of current strike rules. Thats because the CBS show is covered by a different Sag-Aftra contract than the one in dispute. The contract which covers talk shows, game shows, variety shows and soaps was renewed and ratified by union members last year. Barrymore said the programme would comply with rules not to discuss or promote film and television that is struck of any kind when it returned. Barrymore previously stepped down as host of the MTV Film and TV Awards in May, in solidarity with the striking WGA members. In her Instagram statement, she explained: It had a direct conflict with what the strike was dealing with which was studios, streamers, film, and television. It was also in the first week of the strike and so I did what I thought was the appropriate thing at the time to stand in solidarity with the writers. But, she continued: I am also making the choice to come back for the first time in this strike for our show, that may have my name on it but this is bigger than just me. I own this choice, she added. Barrymore, who first shot to fame as a child actress in the 80s when she starred in E.T., also explained how the last season of her show finished on 20 April so had never had to shut down during the strikes, which began a couple of weeks later. Talk shows generally have fewer writers attached to them than scripted shows. Barrymore she said she hoped her shows return would provide what writers do so well, which is a way to bring us together or help us make sense of the human experience. But one writer, David Guggenheim, commented on her post: You are definitely going to be bringing us writers together... when we picket your show tomorrow. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "At least 119 scheduled short distance trains have been cancelled due to the strike launched by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineers Union, according to Sri Lanka Railways. The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union had launched the strike from midnight yesterday (11) over several key demands, including amendments to the recruitment process and promotions, which they say have been delayed for nearly five years despite their constant requests in this regard. The unions secretary, S.R.C.M. Senanayake said the promotions and recruitment process of locomotive operating engineers have been stalled due to the absence of a proper salary scale. However, the members of the public were gravely affected by the railway strike this morning. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a gazette notification this evening declaring the public transport services for passengers or goods and the provision and maintenance of facilities for transport services by railway lines as essential services with immediate effect under the Essential Public Service Act.",

Speaking to the media in this regard on Tuesday (12 Sep.), Kongahage revealed that nearly one year ago, during the anti-government protests, Sri Lankan media personality and British citizen Faraz Shauketaly had requested the ex-diplomat for an interview, claiming that it was for the Independent Television News (ITN), a UK-based media production and broadcast journalism company. Claiming that the context of his full interview had been misinterpreted in the full documentary, Kongahage stated; I said that this was completely the work of the ISIS and Muslim extremists. When they asked me how Mahinda Rajapaksa won the presidential election in 2005 and 2010, I told them it was because he was the most popular leader at the time. These were the only two parts they took for the interview. Raising concerns as to how the British TV channel had obtained certain footage used in the exposé, Kongahage claimed that they were definitely obtained from the archives of a Sri Lankan media channel. They never came and shot these visuals, they were given from a local channel, he alleged in this regard.",

        "title": "India urges Sri Lanka to work meaningfully towards early implementation of its commitments",
        "date": "September 12, 2023 10:58 pm",
        "content": "India has urged the Sri Lankan government to work meaningfully towards early implementation of its commitments to ensure fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens, including Tamils, are fully protected. As a close neighbour and friend of Sri Lanka, India has consistently supported Sri Lankas efforts towards relief, rehabilitation, resettlement and reconstruction process in Sri Lanka since 2009, Indias Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey said on Monday. India has always been guided by two fundamental principles of support to the aspirations of Tamils for equality, justice, dignity and peace; and unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka, Pandey said while speaking during the Interactive Dialogue on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report on Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka at the 54th Session of the Human Rights Council. We hope that the Government of Sri Lanka will fulfil the aspirations of Tamils for equality, justice and peace and its commitment to implement the 13th Amendment and conduct Provincial Council Elections to ensure a life of respect and dignity for Tamils in Sri Lanka, he said. The minority Tamil community in Sri Lanka has been demanding the implementation of the 13th Amendment that provides for devolution of power to it. The 13th Amendment (13A) was brought in after the India-Sri Lanka agreement of 1987. It created 9 provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces. The elections for the nine provinces have been on hold since 2018 following a move to introduce electoral reforms. It now needs a parliamentary amendment to enable the elections to be held under the existing proportional representation system. Pandey added that India has taken note of reaffirmation by the Government of Sri Lanka on the implementation of its commitments. However, progress on the same is inadequate and we urge the Government of Sri Lanka to work meaningfully towards early implementation of its commitments to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected. He told the Council that India has provided multi-pronged support, totalling more than USD four billion to Sri Lanka and its people, in the last year, to tide over its economic challenges. During the visit of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India in July at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both leaders issued a Vision Statement on Connectivity which highlighted the significance of a strong India-Sri Lanka economic partnership for inclusive and sustainable growth in all regions and for all the people of Sri Lanka and for promoting reconciliation in the country, he said. Pandey also expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of thousands of lives in the recent earthquake in Morocco. United Nations Deputy High Commissioner Nada Al-Nashif told the Council that one year after the remarkable protest movement demanding deep political and democratic reforms, the transformation that was hoped for to address long-standing challenges has still not materialised. Sri Lanka continues to deal with the aftermath of the deep economic crisis of 2022 and the current stresses in the global economy. Delays in holding local government elections and in reconstituting Provincial Councils under the 13th amendment have limited peoples right to political participation and the free expression of voters, the official said. Al-Nashif noted that 14 years after the war ended, tens of thousands of victims and their families continue to suffer in agony and grief as they await truth, justice and remedy. The report recognizes the initiatives the Government has initiated to advance reconciliation, including its proposal for a new truth-seeking mechanism. However, it also stresses that urgent confidence-building steps are needed to create an environment in which a genuine reconciliation and transitional justice processes could succeed, Al-Nashif said. The report recommends that the Sri Lankan Government accelerate investigations and prosecutions in emblematic cases of human rights violations, as well as the Easter Sunday bombings of April 2019, in compliance with international human rights standards.

        "date": "September 12, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs  Constitutional Reforms Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on Tuesday (Sept. 12) emphasized the pressing necessity of formulating a national government policy to enhance the quality of education in Sri Lanka. Dr. Rajapakse, who is also the chairman of Parliamentary Special Committee tasked with Providing Recommendations for the Expansion of Higher Education Opportunities in Sri Lanka, made this remark while addressing a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Addressing the press conference further, the lawmaker underscored the challenge of nurturing the human potential of children in the absence of a competitive education system. He said that as long as the countrys competitive education system persists, it remains challenging to nurture an altruistic community for our nation. Rajapakshe pointed out that the children need to have a relaxed mindset in order to grasp the knowledge, adding that the pressure of competition often results in mental stress among the majority of university-bound children. The minister stressed that the emphasis given to universities should also extend to early childhood development adding that ensuring a strong foundation during early childhood is paramount. Speaking on the lack of organization in the countrys higher education system, the minister said with 16 state universities governed by the University Grants Commission, there exists some independence, but its vital to align the necessary provisions for these institutions. Despite extending free education to the private sector, we have yet to establish a comprehensive system for its oversight. Drawing attention to the current demand for vocational training in the country, the minister advocated that institutions offering such education should receive recognition on par with universities. I find it disheartening to witness the youth community of our country discouraged from pursuing vocational education. In contrast, vocational training in other countries often leads to the attainment of degrees. This is why I strongly suggest a comprehensive overhaul of our countrys education system. The minister also pointed out that the inability to establish a high standard for higher education in the country has led some students to seek education abroad. In addition, the practice of leaving students idle for months after exams until results are released is a serious concern, he said emphasizing that the educational system, which wastes valuable time, must be reformed. In light of these challenges, Rajapakshe says the government has proposed the establishment of a Higher Education Commission to replace both the University Grants Commission and the Vocational Training Authority. Under this Higher Education Commission, there would be three units: public universities, private universities and professional universities, each with its own standards protected by a separate unit. Speaking further, the minister said the government aims to eradicate the perception of education being a commodity or lacking in quality. We have put forth numerous suggestions to prevent the recurrence of issues in educational institutions. Additionally, we propose shifting the general level examination to the 10th grade and the advanced level examination to the 12th grade.",

The department added that it stands ready to deploy security forces to other railway stations as well if the need arises. The decision was taken after taking into account a request made by the station masters and locomotive operating engineers who are on duty amidst the ongoing strike action. The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union had launched the strike from midnight on Monday (11) over several demands, including amendments to the recruitment process and promotions, which they say have been delayed for nearly five years. This had resulted in the cancellation of more than a hundred train services, while commuters were gravely affected by the railway strike leading to several tense situations at some railway stations yesterday. As multiple trains were cancelled, the trains that were in operation were crammed with passengers. Many commuters were seen train surfing due to overcrowding. A tense situation was reported at the Maradana railway station yesterday as commuters were left infuriated by railway strike after a youth fell to death from the roof of an overcrowded train near the station. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a gazette notification yesterday declaring the public transport services for passengers or goods and the provision and maintenance of facilities for transport services by railway lines as essential services with immediate effect under the Essential Public Service Act. However, at least 50 trains, including Colombo-bound night mail trains, are operated this morning despite the trade union action, the Deputy General Manager of Railways (Traffic), M.J.

        "date": "September 13, 2023 09:02 am",
        "content": "More than 5,000 people are presumed dead and 10,000 missing after heavy rains in northeastern Libya caused two dams to collapse, surging more water into already inundated areas. Tamer Ramadan, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies delegation in Libya, gave the numbers of missing people during a briefing to reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The death toll is huge, she said. At least 5,300 people are thought dead, said the interior ministry of Libyas eastern government on Tuesday, state media LANA reported. CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of deaths or those missing. Of those who were killed, at least 145 were Egyptian, officials in the northeastern city of Tobruk, in Libya, said on Tuesday. In the eastern city of Derna, which has seen the worst of the devastation, as many as 6,000 people remain missing, Othman Abduljalil, health minister in Libyas eastern administration, told Libyas Almasar TV. He called the situation catastrophic, when he toured the city on Monday. Whole neighborhoods are believed to have been washed away in the city, according to authorities. Hospitals in Derna are no longer operable and the morgues are full, said Osama Aly, an Emergency and Ambulance service spokesperson. Dead bodies have been left outside the morgues on the sidewalks, he told CNN. There are no first-hand emergency services. People are working at the moment to collect the rotting bodies, said Anas Barghathy, a doctor currently volunteering in Derna. We are all terrified Relatives of people who lived in the destroyed city of Derna told CNN they were terrified after seeing videos of the flooding, with no word from their family members. Ayah, a Palestinian woman with cousins in Derna, said she has been unable to reach them since the floods. Im really worried about them. I have two cousins who live in Derna. It seems all communications are down and I dont know if they are alive at this point. It is very terrifying watching the videos coming out of Derna. We are all terrified, she said. Emad Milad, a resident of Tobrok, said eight of his relatives died in the flooding in Derma. My wife Areejs sister and her husband both passed away. His whole family is also dead. A total of eight people are all gone. Its a disaster. Its a disaster. We are praying for better things, he said on Tuesday. Ferocious weather conditions The rain, which has swept across several cities in Libyas north-east, is the result of a very strong low-pressure system that brought catastrophic flooding to Greece last week and moved into the Mediterranean before developing into a tropical-like cyclone known as a medicane. The deadly storm comes in an unprecedented year of climate disasters and record-breaking weather extremes, from devastating wildfires to oppressive heat. Just as ocean temperatures around the world soar off the charts due to planet-warming pollution, the temperature of the Mediterranean is well-above average, which scientists say fueled the storms heavy rainfall. The warmer water does not only fuel those storms in terms of rainfall intensity, it also makes them more ferocious, Karsten Haustein, climate scientist and meteorologist at Leipzig University in Germany, told the Science Media Center. Libyas vulnerability to extreme weather is increased by its long-running political conflict, which has seen a decade-long power struggle between two rival administrations. The UN-backed Government of National Unity (GNU), led by Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, sits in Tripoli in northwest Libya, while its eastern rival is controlled by commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA), who support the eastern-based parliament led by Osama Hamad. Derna, which lies some 300 kilometers (190 miles) east of Benghazi, falls under the control of Haftar and his eastern administration. The countrys complex politics pose challenges for developing risk communication and hazard assessment strategies, coordinating rescue operations, and also potentially for maintenance of critical infrastructure such as dams, Leslie Mabon, lecturer in Environmental Systems at The Open University, told the Science Media Center. Dams collapse The collapse of two dams, which sent water rushing towards Derna, has caused catastrophic damage, authorities said Tuesday. Three bridges were destroyed. The flowing water carried away entire neighborhoods, eventually depositing them into the sea, said Ahmed Mismari, spokesperson for the LNA. Homes in valleys were washed away by strong muddy currents carrying vehicles and debris, said Aly, the Emergency and Ambulance authority spokesperson. Phone lines in the city are down, complicating rescue efforts, with workers unable to enter Derna due to the heavy destruction, Aly told CNN. Aly said authorities didnt anticipate the scale of the disaster. The weather conditions were not studied well, the seawater levels and rainfall were not studied, the wind speeds, there was no evacuation of families that could be in the path of the storm and in valleys, he said. Libya was not prepared for a catastrophe like that. It has not witnessed that level of catastrophe before. We are admitting there were shortcomings even though this is the first time we face that level of catastrophe, Aly told Al Hurra channel. Unprecedented flooding The storm looks certain to be one of the deadliest on record in North Africa. Libya is facing an unprecedented situation, said Hamad, the head of the eastern administration, according to a report from state news organization Libyan News Agency (LANA). Mismari, the LNA spokesperson, said the floods have affected several cities, including Al-Bayda, Al-Marj, Tobruk, Takenis, Al-Bayada, and Battah, as well as the eastern coast all the way to Benghazi. At least 37 residential buildings were swept away into the seas. We are not prepared for such a scale of devastation, Mismari said. Libyan authorities need three types of specialized search groups including teams to recover bodies from rugged valleys after torrents dispersed them, teams to recover bodies from under the rubble, and teams to recover bodies from the sea, he added. Tens of thousands of military personnel have been deployed, but many of the flood-stricken regions are still inaccessible to emergency workers, according to Mismari. Several countries and human rights groups have offered aid as rescue teams scramble to find survivors under the debris and rubble. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said the country faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, in the wake of the disaster. Ciaran Donelly, IRCs senior vice president for crisis response, said the challenges in Libya are immense, with phone lines down and heavy destruction hampering rescue efforts. He added that climate change has compounded the steadily deteriorating situation in the country after years of conflict and instability. Turkish aircraft delivering humanitarian aid have arrived in Libya, according to Turkeys Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) on Tuesday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the country would send 168 search and rescue teams and humanitarian aid to Benghazi, according to state run news agency Anadoulu Agency on Tuesday. Italy is sending a civil defense team to assist with rescue operations, the countrys Civil Protection Department said Tuesday. The US Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, announced that its special envoy, ambassador Richard Norland, had made an official declaration of humanitarian need. This will authorize initial funding that the United States will provide in support of relief efforts in Libya. We are coordinating with UN partners and Libyan authorities to assess how best to target official US assistance, it posted on X (formally known as Twitter). United Arab Emirates President, Zayed Al Nahyan, has directed to send aid and search and rescue teams while offering his condolences to those affected by the catastrophe, state news agency reported. Egypts President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi sent a military delegation, led by the Egypts Armed Forces chief of staff Osama Askar, whom arrived in Libya on Tuesday to coordinate the provision of logistical and humanitarian assistance.

        "title": "13 trains cancelled thus far today due to ongoing railway strike",
        "date": "September 13, 2023 09:12 am",
        "content": "The Department of Railways says a total of 13 scheduled trains were cancelled thus far today due to the ongoing strike action launched by the Locomotive Operating Engineers Union. At least 50 trains including Colombo-bound night mail trains were planned to be in operation to provide services to the commuters this morning despite the ongoing trade union action, according to Deputy General Manager of Railways (Traffic) M.J. Indipolage. However, 13 of them have now been cancelled. The locomotive operating engineers have been on strike since midnight on Monday (Sept. 11) over several key demands including the amendments to the recruitment process and promotions. Commuters were afflicted yesterday as more than 100 train journeys were cancelled after locomotive operating engineers withdrew from duties. The trains that were up and running yesterday were crammed with passengers and desperate commuters also resorted to train surfing due to overcrowding. Many others were left stranded at railway stations. An 18-year-old youth who was travelling on the roof of a long-distance train plying from Kandy to Colombo fell to his death at the Horape railway station. As infuriated passengers reached their boiling point after the tragic incident, tense situations were reported at multiple railway stations. Accordingly, at the request of station masters and locomotive operating engineers on duty amidst the strike, the Railways Department took steps to deploy Sri Lanka Army personnel to provide security to multiple railway stations including Maradana and Colombo Fort stations this morning. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued a gazette notification yesterday declaring the public transport services for passengers or goods and the provision and maintenance of facilities for transport services by railway lines as essential services with immediate effect under the Essential Public Service Act. Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena, addressing a press briefing yesterday, slammed the strike action, and said the government would not negotiate with railway terrorists. He said the locomotive operating engineers are responsible for the death of the youth who fatally fell from an overcrowded train.",

It is a good trend, Dr. Ariyaratne said. Amidst the showery conditions, there is an increase in the number of dengue patients in some provinces of the island, especially in the Western, Southern and Central provinces.

        "content": "The Ministry of Defence says it has made necessary arrangements to pay stipends to disabled tri-forces personnel who retire from the service on medical grounds due to disabilities caused during the terrorist war until the age of 55 years and thereafter for the lifetime of the serviceman and his widow. However, as per the existing procedures, if a disabled serviceperson dies before reaching the age of 55, a medical board must confirm that the cause of death is a direct result of the disability of the relevant serviceperson, for the widow to be entitled to the aforementioned stipend. If a disabled serviceperson dies from any other cause where the medical board cannot confirm that the death was caused as a direct result of the disability, the widow can only be entitled to the Widows and Orphans Pension, the ministry said further in a statement. Owing to this, the Defence Ministry says it has received a significant number of requests from affected widows urging that the allowance and salary be continued to be paid to them. Taking into account these requests, the ministry says it has taken steps to obtain the Cabinet approval for providing relief to them. Thus, the ministry urged retired disabled servicepersons and their family members not to have any undue fears, adding that it has observed the attempts of certain groups to create confusion about the matter. The Defence Ministry vowed to take all measures to ensure the welfare of retired tri-forces personnel and their families in the future as well.",

The Attorney Generals Department had instructed the Special Investigations Unit of the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs to file criminal charges against Sachithra Senanayake, for match-fixing.

On September 06, Senanayake was arrested after he reportedly surrendered to the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry, and was later ordered to be remanded until 15 September on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court, in the case filed over the relevant allegations. However, the Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the Attorney General, had informed the court that his department had received the voice recordings related to the match-fixing incident and sought an order that the former Sri Lanka off-spinner be produced to the Department of Government Analyst, in order to confirm whether the audio recording resembles the suspects voice.

        "date": "September 13, 2023 01:00 pm",
        "content": "Taylor Swift cleaned up at Tuesdays MTV Video Music Awards and won the evenings top trophy, as Shakira accepted the nights prestigious Video Vanguard honor with a hip-shaking, career-spanning performance. Swift continued her global reign by scooping awards including Best Song, Best Pop and Best Direction, as well as the top competitive award for Video of the Year, which she won for her hit Anti-Hero. Turn-of-the-millennium teen heartthrobs NSYNC reunited onstage for the first time in a decade to present her with the Best Pop award, leaving Swift, who is poised to post the first billion-dollar tour, fanning her cheeks. This is unbelievable, Swift said as she accepted the nights top prize, which she also took home in 2022. I just want to say that the fact that this is a fan-voted award means so much to me. But she didnt perform on the night known far more for its spectacle than its awards, instead sipping her drink as artists including Olivia Rodrigo, Anitta and Doja Cat took the stage. The made-for-broadcast show, held this year in Newarks Prudential Center, frequently panned to Swift who was seated near the main stage next to Ice Spice, the viral Bronx rapper who has collaborated with the pop phenom and who won the evenings prize for Best New Artist. A camera operator was reportedly tasked with filming Swift for the shows entire duration. The nearly four-hour show that included some 20 performances ended without handing out awards in a number of categories, however, including for Artist of the Year, which for the first time was an all-women slate including Swift, Shakira and Beyonce. Lil Wayne opened the show in a nod to this years 50th anniversary of hip hop, and Sean Combs -- known by his stage names Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy and Diddy -- delivered a career-spanning performance as he accepted the nights Global Icon lifetime achievement award. This is so surreal, said the 53-year-old from Harlem. I started out as a paper boy. And it was Shakira who scored the nights most prestigious honor for lifetime achievement, the Video Vanguard award that celebrates music video innovations. The Colombian performer, 46, stole the show as she performed her signature hip swings and pops, singing a bilingual medley including She Wolf, Te Felicito, Objection (Tango), Whenever, Wherever and Hips Dont Lie. Wearing a glittering, nude ensemble, the artist finished her set by crowd-surfing to a platform that then elevated her high above a screaming crowd of fans and peers. Thank you MTV. Thank you for being such a big part of my career since I was only 18 years old, she said. Afrobeats and Bongos Rapper Nicki Minaj hosted the event for the second consecutive year, also debuting live her newest single, Last Time I Saw You, which is slated for release on her album Pink Friday 2 in November. She won the nights award for Best Hip Hop, for Super Freaky Girl. Minaj also participated in the evenings tribute to five decades of hip hop, which also saw Lil Wayne return to the stage for a medley performance that included pioneers Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick, LL Cool J, DMC of Run-DMC, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Earlier Doja Cat ignited the crowd as she performed a medley of Attention, Paint The Town Red and Demons, donning a sexy skirtsuit situation she slowly loosened as she danced, meanwhile unfurling a long blonde mane. Best RB went to SZA, who did not attend, while South Koreas Stray Kids won the award for Best K-pop and later performed. Nigerias Rema won the prize for Best Afrobeats, a new category, for his remixed single Calm Down featuring Selena Gomez. The song surpassed a billion streams on Spotify over the weekend. This means so much seeing Afrobeats grow this big, Rema said while accepting the trophy. Brazils Anitta dropped a booty-shaking dance party of a show with hits including Funk Rave, which earned the evenings prize for Best Latin. Colombian Karol G was also among the evenings top performers, and she scored a prize with Shakira for Best Collaboration. Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion debuted their live performance of Bongos, their latest collaboration that follows the resounding success of WAP. Cardi entered the stage from the ceiling on a disco ball, her hair in loose waves a la Donna Summer. Megan joined her from another stage, and after their respective verses the pair led the audience through a high-energy, twerkified dance breakdown. Pop-punk band Fallout Boy rounded out the millennial nostalgia tour that began the night with NSYNC. The emo rockers performed their updated version of Billy Joels We Didnt Start The Fire, hitting major moments of the past three decades in a revamp that includes the line: YouTube killed MTV.

Minister Fernando had previously filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition, seeking an order to prevent his arrest with regard to the incident. Appearing for the Attorney General, Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris conveyed this to the court when the relevant petition was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising of Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Preethi Padman Surasena and Janak de Silva this morning. The Additional Solicitor General emphasized that the Attorney General had instructed the police on June 20 to conclude the probes against the minister, after examining the investigation files compiled by the Police Special Investigation Unit. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court ordered this case to be recalled on September 18, before a judge bench which excludes Justice Janak de Silva to decide whether the petition should be maintained further.",

        "date": "September 13, 2023 03:21 pm",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) says it has approved the creation of a separate Listing Board and Listing Rules at the Colombo bourse to facilitate the entry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) into the Capital Market. Countrys capital market regulator said this is in response to the governments policy to expedite reforms in SOEs, improve their overall governance, efficiency, productivity and profitability, and empower them to add greater value to the economy. These rules were developed under the guidance and direction provided by the SEC to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), and include consultations with and inputs by the SOE Restructuring Unit of the government and the Auditor General. SEC notes that the dismal performance of many SOEs in Sri Lanka has become a heavy fiscal burden on the country with significant macroeconomic implications. Therefore, the SEC believes addressing this issue is crucial in the countrys economic reform process. The Capital Market is the globally accepted platform for raising long-term capital funds for business entities compared to banks which operate on a business model heavily reliant on short-term customer deposits. It also enables business entities to minimize exposure to interest rate volatility. Further, the Capital Market provides opportunities for businesses to attract strategic and other investors through the listing process. Most SOEs have relied on government funding and local and foreign borrowings for expansion and modernization. By listing on the Stock Exchange these enterprises will be able to improve their internal governance, and operating efficiencies and attract foreign and local investor capital. The SEC and the CSE have given due consideration to the current levels of governance, organization structure and operational challenges prevailing in the SOE sector and have therefore created a separate Listing Board and Listing rules with a view to enabling SOEs to progressively transition from what they are now to what they should be. Any SOE that meets the Listing criteria of the Main Board or the Diri Savi Board can straightaway list on those Boards. The new transitionary Board, when launched, is expected to facilitate those SOEs seeking a listing to do so on a set of new rules that are designed to enable a progressive transition from the initial listing Board to the Main Board or Diri Savi Board. The salient features of the rules applicable to the new Board include a stated capital of not less than Rs. 250 million; revenue, net asset and market capitalization tests; a minimum 3 years of operating history; time-bound requirements for financial reporting; and a minimum 10 public float with 300 public shareholder requirement. The Corporate Governance requirements under these rules will be the same as those applicable to the Main Board and Diri Savi Board with a view to aligning the internal governance structures and processes of listed SOEs with the standards set in the market.",
