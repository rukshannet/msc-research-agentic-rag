        "date": "November 28, 2024 10:34 pm",
        "content": "The principal and a teacher from the Madrasa in Ninthavur, as well as two who had served as assistants to the tractor driver have been arrested in connection with the investigation into the incident where a tractor transporting a group of school children was swept away by floodwaters in Karaitivu, Ampara. Police said that the suspects are to be produced before the Sammanthurai Magistrates Court. It is reported that the principal in question had instructed the school boys to go back home on the tractor after school, as there were no buses available due to flooding on November 26. Bus services had been suspended on the route due to the floods. The principal had also reportedly provided money to the students to cover transportation costs for the tractor. In such a background, police investigations have revealed that the principal had given instructions to take the children to their homes in the tractor, which was being used as a passenger transport vehicle operating for a fee. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the army had advised against using the tractor for transportation, warning that the road was unsafe due to the floodwaters. Accordingly, the incident occurred when the tractor, which was carrying a total of 13 individuals, including 11 schoolboys, the driver, and an assistant, toppled due to strong currents while passing through flood waters. Police had initially confirmed that five children had been rescued while another six students were reported missing. The six missing children are aged between 12 and 16 years while they are residents of Sammanthurai, according to police. So far, the bodies of five of the students have been recovered, and operations are underway to find one more student. Additionally, the bodies of the tractor driver and another individual have been recovered as well.",

        "title": "Putin says Russia could hit decision-making centres in Kyiv with new missile",
        "date": "November 29, 2024 08:39 am",
        "content": "Russia may use its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile to attack decision-making centres in Kyiv in response to Ukraines firing of Western missiles at Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. Russia has not so far struck Ukrainian government ministries, parliament or the presidents office in the course of the 33-month war. Kyiv is heavily protected by air defences, but Putin says the Oreshnik, which Russia fired for the first time at a Ukrainian city last week, is incapable of being intercepted - a claim greeted with scepticism by Western experts. Of course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range Western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on November 21, Putin told leaders of a security alliance of ex-Soviet countries at a summit in Kazakhstan. At present, the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory. These could be military facilities, defence and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centres in Kyiv, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced Putins promotion of the Oreshnik as a tactic to disrupt attempts to end the war, particularly by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. He doesnt seek an end to this war. Moreover, Putin wants to prevent others from ending the war, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. He can go on wielding his Oreshnik only to thwart the efforts of President Trump which are sure to follow his inauguration. Putin wants to escalate the situation to such an extent so that President Trumps attempts will fail. So that he cannot end the war. Putin said a massive Russian overnight attack on Ukraine was also a response to Kyivs use of U.S. ATACMS ballistic missiles. Zelenskiy said Russia used cruise missiles with cluster munitions in the attack, which cut power to more than 1 million people, something he called a despicable escalation. Zelenskiy also said he was speaking to Western leaders, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, to devise a response to Russias attempt to make the situation more unbearable and drag out the war. Russia says Ukraine fired ATACMS into western Russia for the first time on Nov. 19, prompting it to respond two days later by firing the Oreshnik, a new intermediate-range missile, at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Since then, Russia says Ukraine fired more ATACMS at its Kursk region on Nov. 23 and Nov. 25 and struck Russia with British Storm Shadow cruise missiles too, after the United States and Britain agreed for the first time to allow Kyiv to strike deep inside Russian territory with these weapons. Putin reiterated in his summit remarks that this, from Moscows viewpoint, meant the direct involvement of the West in an armed conflict with Russia. Putin said Russias production of advanced missile systems exceeds that of the NATO military alliance by 10 times, and that Moscow planned to ramp up production. He said Russia had several Oreshniks ready to use - consistent with comments from U.S. military officials last week that the new missile was experimental and Russia likely possessed only a handful of them. Putin, for the second time in less than a week, boasted that the Oreshnik was comparable to a nuclear weapon in terms of its destructive power and would atomise everything at the point of impact - but he said it would not carry a nuclear warhead or spread radioactive contamination. Western security experts say the missile, like many others in Russias arsenal, could be fitted with a nuclear warhead. Ukraine said the Oreshnik fired on Nov. 21 reached a top speed of 13,600 kph (8,450 mph) but sources said it carried dummy warheads, not live explosives. Tensions between the warring sides have risen sharply with the missile exchanges and Putin last week updated Russias nuclear doctrine to extend the list of scenarios that might prompt it to launch a nuclear weapon. But five sources familiar with U.S. intelligence told Reuters that the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to fire American weapons deeper into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack - something they said was still unlikely.

This combined operation followed intelligence received from the Sri Lanka Navy, indicating possible narcotics smuggling by Sri Lankan flagged fishing vessels. Acting swiftly on the intelligence, the Indian Navy initiated an operation to intercept the boats involved. The operation relied on continuous inputs from the Sri Lanka Navy and the Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region, along with extensive surveillance by the Indian Navys aerial assets. These efforts led to the identification of two fishing boats suspected of being involved in the illegal activity. Both vessels set for sail on November 24 and 25. The seized narcotics were handed over to the Sri Lankan authorities, along with the crew members, for further legal action.

Anuradhapura District has been severely affected by the adverse weather conditions, said the Ada Derana reporter. It is reported that approximately 11,800 cubic meters of water per second is being released into the Kala Oya from the opened sluice gates. Meanwhile, arrangements have also been made to close the sluice gates of the Angamuwa Reservoir. The Wimalasurendra Reservoir in the Nortonbridge area continues to discharge water from the sluice gates due to ongoing intermittent showers and heavy rains in the Central Highlands western slopes. Engineers in charge of the Castlereigh reservoir and Maussakele reservoirs have also reported that both the reservoirs are nearing their overflow levels due to the persistent rainfall in their catchment areas. As a result of rising water levels in these reservoirs, the Wimalasurendra, Canyon, Laxapana, New Laxapana, and Polpitiya Hydro Power Stations are all operating at full capacity to generate electricity, said the engineers in charge. The irrigation engineer has informed that residents in the low-lying areas on both sides of the Malwathu Oya should exercise caution due to the release of water from all the sluice gates of the Nachchaduwa Tank. Approximately 2,140 cubic meters of water per second is released into Malwathu Oya. Accordingly, it has two sluice gates opened 2 feet each, two more sluice gates 3 feet each and the other two sluice gates with an opening of 4 feet each.",

        "date": "November 29, 2024 11:59 am",
        "content": "Chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans have said they are leaving their agency after accusing it of mistreatment and manipulation. The five-member girl band announced their departure from Ador, a subsidiary of powerhouse label Hybe, in a late-night press conference held on Thursday. Ador however has said its contract with NewJeans still stands, as the agency has not violated any terms. This dispute is the latest development in a long-running conflict between former NewJeans producer Min Hee-Jin and Hybes chairman Bang Si-hyuk, which has made headlines in South Korea. One of the groups members, Hanni, has alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label. This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm, Hanni said. She added the group had faced mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff, and said the group had experienced deliberate miscommunications and manipulation in multiple areas. Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to continue their activities with the agency. A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract, Ador said in the statement after the groups announcement. We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter, the agency said. NewJeans said they would like to work with Min, the groups former mastermind who left Ador in August following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her. This would have made NewJeans and Ador independent of Hybe. Min has denied the accusations against her. She has previously accused Hybe of launching another girl group, Illit, that was copying NewJeans music and appearance. On 13 November, NewJeans filed a legal notice to Ador demanding the company resolve breaches of their exclusive contracts within 14 days. They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts. The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min. They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the bands name after the contract terminates. Prior to the NewJeans announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029. The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty. However, the matter is likely to go to court as both sides do not agree. In such a scenario, a judge would decide if the contract can be terminated and if one side owes the other any damages. In October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about 170m) to terminate the contract early. But group singer Haerin said it made no sense that the group would be liable to pay a contract breach fee. We never broke any rules, Haerin said. We did nothing but try our best - they are the ones at fault. Hybe and Ador are the ones responsible. Ador said it had not violated the terms of the contract, adding that it respectfully requests that the group continue its collaboration with Ador on upcoming activities. Despite multiple requests for meetings with the artists, our efforts have not been successful. We hope the members will now be willing to engage in an open and candid discussion, it said, referring to NewJeans. The group has been embroiled in a year-long controversy with audits and emotional accusations making South Korean headlines. In October, a member of the group, Hanni, 20, testified at the Labour Committee of South Koreas National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment. She alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her. Following several incidents, she said: I came to the realisation that this wasnt just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us. Hybe shares were trading around 3 lower in Friday morning trading in Seoul. NewJeans made its debut in 2022 and is among Hybes most successful K-pop groups, along with BTS. With slick pop hits including Super Shy and OMG, NewJeans were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this years MTV Awards. Formed by Ador in 2022, its five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - range in age from 16 to 20. Source: BBC --Agencies",

On September 12, 2022 former Minister Rajitha Senaratne and former State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) chairman Rumy Mohamed had pleaded not guilty for the charges against them over the controversial white van press conference. In the days leading up to the Presidential Election in 2019, former Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had called two persons named Anthony Douglas Fernando and Athula Sanjeewa Madanayake for the said press conference, where they made controversial statements regarding alleged white vans and purported incidents of certain abductions, assassinations, robberies and forced disappearances during the administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. One of them had claimed that he was a white van driver involved in abducting people while the other claimed he once served as a driver to transport a stock of gold in previously LTTE-held areas. The former Health Minister was arrested in December 2019 and was remanded over the controversial white van press conference organized by him, but he continued to receive medical treatment at the hospital. On December 30, Colombo Magistrates Court ordered to release Senaratne on bail. However, the Attorney General had filed a revision application on January 08 challenging the decision of the Magistrate Court to grant bail to the former Health Minister.",

Torrential rain for the past week in the province has triggered flash floods and landslides in four different districts, Indonesias disaster agency has said. The death toll from one landslide on Wednesday on a hilly interprovince road rose to nine from seven, Hadi Wahyudi, the spokesperson of North Sumatra police told Reuters on Friday. At least five cars, one bus, and one truck were trapped at the base of a cliff following the landslide. On Friday, police and rescuers focused their search for missing people on three cars and one bus buried in mud. We still dont know how many people who were still trapped, Hadi said. In other districts, landslides over the weekend killed 20 people and rescuers will keep searching for two missing people until Saturday. Flash floods hit the provincial city of Medan on Friday although waters have receded in some areas, said Sariman Sitorus, spokesperson for the local search agency. The floods forced a delay in votes for regional elections in some areas in Medan on Wednesday.

        "date": "November 29, 2024 02:10 pm",
        "content": "The Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Qi Zhenhong, says that while some critics label the large-scale projects implemented in Sri Lanka with Chinese financial assistance as white elephants, all such projects were developed according to the requests of the governments in power at the time. The Ambassador made these remarks during a meeting with a group of representatives of media organisations last evening (28), where the discussion touched on various topics including the projects funded by China in Sri Lanka. He emphasized that certain projects have not been optimally utilized due to inefficiencies in their operation by the Sri Lankan side. The Ambassador cited the Colombo Lotus Tower project as an example, noting that although it was leased to a private company, it has now started generating profits and he emphasized that the Lotus Tower has become a symbolic landmark for Sri Lanka. He also highlighted that both the Hambantota International Port and the Colombo Port, which received Chinese investments, are expected to contribute significantly to the Sri Lankan governments revenue. Particularly, the Ambassador pointed out that the Colombo Port City project is completely a Chinese investment where Sri Lanka did not incur any expenditures. He also addressed the various concerns regarding Chinese investments and loans, which some have labeled as a debt trap, explaining that these investments were made based on the long-standing and friendly relationship between China and Sri Lanka, and not for personal gain. The Ambassador further explained that Chinas financial support to Sri Lanka was aimed at helping the country maintain its independence without succumbing to external pressures. He expressed optimism that China-Sri Lanka relations would enter a new phase under the current government. In response to an inquiry about why the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between China and Sri Lanka has not yet been signed, despite seven rounds of negotiations, the Ambassador attributed this delay to unwarranted concerns that China would dominate the Sri Lankan market through the FTA. He reassured that if the FTA were to be signed, the Sri Lankan government would have the option to amend the agreement after one year if any unfavorable conditions arose. The Ambassador reiterated Chinas commitment to supporting Sri Lanka as a true friend, highlighting Chinas assistance during Sri Lankas challenges at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, during the Covid-19 pandemic, and throughout the countrys ongoing economic and disaster-related crises.",

        "title": "Fatal car crash in India sparks concerns over Google Maps",
        "date": "November 29, 2024 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Can a navigation app be held responsible if a user gets into an accident? That is the question being asked in India after three men died when their car veered off an unfinished bridge and fell on to a riverbed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Police are still investigating the incident, which took place on Sunday, but they believe that Google Maps led the group to take that route. A part of the bridge had reportedly collapsed earlier this year because of floods and while locals knew this and avoided the bridge, the three men were not aware of this and were from outside the area. There were no barricades or sign boards indicating that the bridge was unfinished. Authorities have named four engineers from the states road department and an unnamed official from Google Maps in a police complaint on charges of culpable homicide. A spokesperson from Google told BBC Hindi that it was co-operating with the investigation. The tragic accident has spotlighted Indias poor road infrastructure and sparked a debate on whether navigation apps like Google Maps share responsibility for such incidents. Some blame the app for not providing accurate information while others argue that it is a larger failure on the part of the government for not cordoning off the place. Google Maps is the most popular navigation app in India and has become synonymous with GPS (Global Positioning System), a satellite-based radio navigation system. It also powers the services of many ride-sharing, e-commerce and food delivery platforms. The app reportedly has around 60 million active users and witnesses around 50 million searches in a day. But the app has frequently come under scrutiny for providing incorrect directions, sometimes leading to fatal accidents. In 2021, a man from Maharashtra state drowned after he drove his car into a dam, allegedly while following directions on the app. Last year, two young doctors in Kerala state died after they drove their car into a river. Police said that they had been following a route shown by the app and cautioned people against relying on it too much when roads were flooded. But how does Google Maps learn about changes on a road? GPS signals from users apps track traffic changes along routes - an increase signals congestion, while a decrease suggests a road is less used. The app also receives updates from governments and users about traffic jams or closures. Complaints related to high traffic, or the ones notified by authorities are given priority, as Google does not have the manpower to deal with the millions of complaints streaming in daily, says Ashish Nair, the founder of mapping platform Potter Maps and a former Google Maps employee. A map operator then uses satellite imagery, Google Street View and government notifications to confirm the change and update the map. According to Mr Nair, navigating apps cannot be held responsible for mishaps as their terms of services make it clear that users must apply their own judgement on the road and that the information provided by the app might differ from actual conditions. Besides, it is simply very difficult for a platform like Google, which manages maps across the world, to keep across every change that happens on a road, he adds. Unlike other countries, India also does not have a robust system for reporting such issues on time. Data remains a big challenge in India. There is no system for infrastructural changes to be logged into a web interface, which can then be used by apps like Google Maps. Countries like Singapore have such a system, Mr Nair says. He adds that Indias vast population and fast-paced development make it even more challenging to get accurate, real-time data. In other words, bad maps are here to stay until governments become more proactive about collecting and sharing data. Lawyers are divided on whether GPS apps can be held legally responsible for road accidents. Advocate Saima Khan says that since Indias Information Technology (IT) Act gives digital platforms like Google Maps the status of an intermediary (a platform that merely disseminates information provided by a third party) it is protected against liability. But she adds that if it can be proven that the platform did not rectify its data despite being given correct, timely information, then it might be held liable for negligence. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "In a shock offensive, insurgents breach Syrias largest city for the first time since 2016",
        "date": "November 30, 2024 08:43 am",
        "content": "Insurgents breached Syrias largest city Friday and clashed with government forces for the first time since 2016, according to a war monitor and fighters, in a surprise attack that sent residents fleeing and added fresh uncertainty to a region reeling from multiple wars. The advance on Aleppo followed a shock offensive launched by insurgents Wednesday, as thousands of fighters swept through villages and towns in Syrias northwestern countryside. Residents fled neighborhoods on the citys edge because of missiles and gunfire, according to witnesses in Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the countrys unresolved civil war, said dozens of fighters from both sides were killed. The attack injected new violence into a region experiencing dual wars in Gaza and Lebanon involving Israel, and other conflicts, including the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. Aleppo has not been attacked by opposition forces since they were ousted from eastern neighborhoods in 2016 following a grueling military campaign in which Syrian government forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. But this time, there was no sign of a significant pushback from government forces or their allies. Instead, reports emerged of government forces melting away in the face of advances, and insurgents posted messages on social media calling on troops to surrender. Robert Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador to Syria, said the attack showed that Syrian government forces are extremely weak. In some cases, he said, they appear to have almost been routed. This weeks advances were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, and represent the most intense fighting in northwestern Syria since 2020, when government forces seized areas previously controlled by the opposition. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanons Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollahs two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups, said the insurgents have signaled for a while that they were ready for an offensive. But no one expected the swift advance of the forces toward Aleppo. Its not only that the Russians are distracted and bogged down in Ukraine, but also the Iranians are distracted and bogged down elsewhere. Hezbollahs distracted and bogged down elsewhere, and the regime is absolutely cornered, she said. But the surprise element comes in with how quickly the regime crumbled. The attack on Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, which has backed Syrian opposition groups, failed in its diplomatic efforts to prevent the government attacks, which were seen as a violation of a 2019 agreement sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran to freeze the line of the conflict. Turkish security officials said Thursday that Syrian opposition groups initially launched a long-planned limited offensive toward Aleppo, where attacks targeting civilians originated. However, the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began retreating from their positions, the officials said. The aim of the offensive was to reestablish the boundaries of the de-escalation zone, according to Turkish officials. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests against Bashar Assads rule turned into an all-out war. Russia and Iran and its allied groups helped Syrian government forces reclaim control of the city that year after a grueling military campaign and a siege that lasted for weeks. Besides backing opposition forces, Turkey has also established a military presence in Syria, sending troops into parts of the northwest. Separately and largely in the east of Syria, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants. The Syrian government did not comment on insurgents breaching Aleppo city limits. The Kremlin said Friday that it considered the attack an encroachment on Syrias sovereignty and that it supported the quickest possible establishment of constitutional order in the region. Of course, this is a violation of Syrias sovereignty in this region, Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a press briefing. Syrias armed forces said in a statement Friday that they clashed with insurgents in the countryside around Aleppo and Idlib, destroying drones and heavy weaponry. They vowed to repel the attack and accused the insurgents of spreading false information about their advances. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the insurgents detonated two car bombs Friday at the western edge of Aleppo. The war monitor said insurgents were also able to seize control of Saraqeb, south of Aleppo, a town at the strategic intersection of the highways linking Aleppo with Damascus and the coast. Syrian government authorities diverted traffic from that highway Thursday. An insurgent commander posted a recorded message on social media calling on Aleppo residents to cooperate with the advancing forces. Turkeys state-run Anadolu Agency reported that the insurgents entered the city center Friday and now control about 70 locations in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Syrias state media reported that projectiles from insurgents landed in student accommodations at Aleppos university in the city center, killing four people, including two students. Syrian armed forces said the insurgents are violating a 2019 agreement that de-escalated fighting in the area, the last remaining opposition stronghold for years. Hezbollah was the main force in the governments control of Aleppo, said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Observatory. In a phone call with his Syrian counterpart, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the insurgent attacks in Syria as a plot orchestrated by the U.S. and the Zionist regime following the regimes defeat in Lebanon and Palestine. Insurgents posted videos online showing they were using drones, a new weapon for them. It was not clear to what extent the drones were used on the battleground. Insurgents attacked a military airbase southeast of Aleppo with drones early Friday, destroying a helicopter, the Anadolu Agency reported. The opposition groups also seized heavy weapons and military vehicles belonging to the government forces, the agency said. Source: AP --Agencies",

Furthermore, the individuals who are experiencing respiratory difficulties are advised to seek immediate medical attention. According to the daily air quality report of NBROs Environmental Studies and Services Division, the Sri Lanka Air Quality Index (SLAQI) is expected to range between 92 and 120 throughout the day, as a result of the prevailing weather conditions and a border disturbance from the north. While this range falls within the moderate to slightly harmful categories, several urban areas are projected to reach unhealthy levels, as per the NBRO. Meanwhile in Colombo, the air quality is forecasted to range between 108 and 116, while Jaffna and Polonnaruwa are expected to record even higher levels, between 112 and 120 within the day. Other cities, including Kurunegala, Vavuniya, Kandy, Kegalle, Galle, Badulla, and Trincomalee, are also predicted to exceed a value of 100 on the SLAQI, signaling air quality that could pose health concerns for sensitive groups. The NBRO advises individuals, especially those with respiratory or heart conditions, to monitor their health closely and seek medical advice if they experience breathing difficulties. In the meantime, a few locations, including Nuwara Eliya, Embilipitiya, Kalutara, Hambantota, and Monaragala, are expected to maintain moderate air quality levels (51-100). The AQI (Air Quality Index), used to communicate to the general public the daily air quality, is based on the measurement of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. An AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality, as per international standards.",

        "title": "UK MPs back proposals to legalise assisted dying",
        "date": "November 30, 2024 11:53 am",
        "content": "MPs have backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in a historic vote which paves the way for a change in the law. In the first Commons vote on the issue in nearly a decade, MPs supported a bill which would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life by 330 to 275, a majority of 55. It followed an emotional debate in the chamber, where MPs from both sides shared personal stories which had informed their decisions. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament required before it becomes law. Supporters gathered outside Parliament wept and hugged each other as the result was announced. Campaign group Dignity in Dying said the vote was a historic step towards greater choice and protection for dying people. Dame Esther Rantzen, one of the most high-profile campaigners for assisted dying, said she was absolutely thrilled. The broadcaster, who has terminal lung cancer, said any change in the law would probably come too late to affect her personally. But she said future generations will be spared the ordeals we have to suffer at the moment if the bill becomes law. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who put forward the bill, told the BBC she was a bit overwhelmed following the vote and it meant a huge amount to be able to tell campaigners the bill had passed its first parliamentary hurdle. However, Conservative Danny Kruger, a leading opponent of the bill, said it could be defeated at a later stage if MPs concerns were not properly addressed. He said many of his colleagues believed the bill was very dangerous and he hoped that if safeguards in the legislation were not strengthened they would choose to vote against it in the future. MPs were given a free vote, meaning they could make a decision based on their own conscience rather than having to follow a party line. A higher percentage of female MPs backed the bill compared to their male counterparts. Of the 258 female MPs able to express their preference, 143 - or 55 - were in favour, while 188 (49) of the 381 male MPs backed the bill. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and his Conservative predecessor Rishi Sunak voted in favour, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch voted against. The PM, who previously supported a change in the law in 2015, did not speak in the debate or reveal how he planned to vote in advance, saying he did not want to influence the decisions of MPs. The government has taken a neutral stance on the bill and has said it will work to ensure it is effective if Parliament backs a change in the law. The vote followed more than four hours of passionate debate in a packed Commons chamber. More than 160 MPs requested to speak but far fewer got an opportunity to do so due to time constraints. Opening the debate, Leadbeater said the current law was failing and needed to change to give terminally ill people choice at the end of their life. The MP for Spen Valley said too many people were experiencing heartbreaking suffering as a result of the cruel reality of the status quo. She gave examples of terminally ill people who had died screaming for assistance or taken their own lives because they were in uncontrollable pain. Opponents of the bill raised concerns that terminally ill people, particularly the elderly, disabled or vulnerable, could be pressurised into ending their own lives. They also argued the focus should be on improving end-of-life care rather than introducing assisted dying. Leadbeater insisted her bill included the most robust and strongest set of safeguards and protections in the world, with strict eligibility criteria. To be eligible for assisted dying under Leadbeaters Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, someone must have the mental capacity to make a choice about ending their life and express a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure, at every stage of the process. Two independent doctors and a High Court judge must be satisfied someone is eligible and has made their decision voluntarily. However, Labours Diane Abbott was among those who argued these safeguards were not sufficient. The longest serving female MP said she feared the role of the judge could be only a rubber stamp. She told MPs some terminally ill people may also feel under pressure to end their lives as they dont want to be a burden or because of the cost of their care. Cabinet ministers are divided over the issue, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood  the two ministers who would have overall responsibility for implementing any change in the law  voting against. Overall 15 cabinet members, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, voted in favour, while eight voted against. Current laws across the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. A separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland has been proposed by a Liberal Democrat member of the Scottish Parliament and is expected to be voted on by MSPs next year.

Accordingly, the government has implemented measures to reduce the Special Commodity Levy on big onions from Rs. 30 to Rs. 10, a reduction of Rs. 20. Meanwhile, it has been decided to keep the Special Commodity Levy imposed on imported potatoes unchanged.

The Finance Ministry said that the move comes amid a notable rise in the market price of onions and concerns over potential price hikes for potatoes and other vegetables. These price increases are attributed to ongoing adverse weather conditions and the annual demand surge during the festive season. Furthermore, the Finance Ministry added that the tax revisions were made base on the recommendations from the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation, and the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Food Security, and Cooperative Development to balance the needs of both farmers and consumers, as the validity of the current gazette notification related to the matter concluded on November 30, 2024.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) is emphasizing that the world can end AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) as a public health threat by 2030, provided that human rights are upheld and communities lead the way. In this years campaign, WHO is calling on global leaders and citizens to champion the right to health by addressing the inequalities that hinder progress in ending AIDS. Although the WHO European Region has made progress in tackling HIV, significant challenges remain in identifying and treating cases, as well as preventing new infections in the first place. Furthermore, in the local context, Sri Lanka is recognized as a country with a relatively low prevalence of AIDS, despite which recent reports from health officials indicate an alarming rise in AIDS cases within the country, compared to previous years. Commenting regarding the matter, the Director of National STDAIDS Control Programme, Community Medicine Specialist Dr. Vindya Kumarapeli explained that the number of AIDS cases in Sri Lanka has increased significantly from the period of 2020-2021 to 2022-2023. In 2020-2021, the number of reported cases was between 200 and 300, while in the 2022-2023 period, the figure has doubled. There has been an increased likelihood of new cases increasing among men in the last 10 years. 15 of the patients are young men and women aged between 15 and 24, she added. In conjunction with World AIDS Day, the Ministry of Health organized a march starting from the Galle Face Green and proceeding to the Ministry of Health. Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, who participated in the event, emphasized that it is the governments responsibility to foster a compassionate society and work towards eradicating AIDS from the country.",

Addressing an event held today (01), MP Jayaweera said: According to the results of the last election, the Sarvajana Balaya has advanced by the highest percentage, while the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has advanced by the lowest percentage. The Podujana Peramuna used all their strength. The Pohottuwa SLPP was created solely to gather the necessary support to keep Basil Rajapaksa in politics. However, the Pohottuwa had no vision. Now that the American citizen has left the country, the mill is no longer turning. If there is at least one political party that has been scattered both in the traditional and scientific sense, it is the Sarvajana Balaya. The traditional UNP United National Party is no more; it has become the gas cylinder. Many of its members worked hard to send Mr. Ravi Karunanayake to parliament, he added. The Pohottuwa has been fragmented, and some of them are in the gas cylinder New Democratic Front. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna has been successfully dismantled by handing over power to them. It is a dream of our Ranil Wickremesinghe that his friend Anura Kumara is now fulfilling. A political movement that was once maintained with discipline for a long time has had it corrupted now, Jayaweera expressed.",

        "date": "December 1, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Romanians vote in a parliamentary election on Sunday in which the far right is expected to gain from uncertainty over whether the shock result in a presidential election will stand. Days after far-right politician Calin Georgescu won most votes in the presidential election first round, an opinion poll this week showed the hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) had a narrow lead over the governing Social Democrats. Gains by far-right groupings in Sundays parliamentary vote after a campaign dominated by voters concerns over budget problems and the cost of living could upend Romanias pro-Western orientation and undermine support for Ukraine, political analysts said. People who have serenely voted for Georgescu do not realise we are essentially talking about a total trajectory shift, political scientist Cristian Pirvulescu said. Romania is a member of the European Union and NATO. Georgescus unexpected success last Sunday aroused suspicions of interference in the campaign, prompted a vote recount and led to a defeated candidate asking the countrys top court to rerun the first round of voting. The confusion means the parliamentary election is going ahead with voters uncertain whether the outcome of the presidential first round vote will stand. They also do not know whether the presidential run-off - scheduled for Dec. 8 between Georgescu and centrist Elena Lasconi - will go ahead or be held at a later date. The Constitutional Court considered the situation on Friday but decided to put off until Monday a decision on whether to annul the first round. Georgescu ran as an independent challenging entrenched mainstream parties, but political analysts say far-right parties are likely to gain from the uncertainty. The net beneficiaries ... are Georgescu and the anti-establishment camp which is now getting additional ammunition: here is how state institutions work, how discretionary they are, said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University. An AtlasIntel opinion poll conducted from Nov. 26-28 put the hard-right AUR on 22.4, with Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacus Social Democrats on 21.4, down 10 percentage points over two weeks and Lasconis Save Romania Union at 17.5. The poll did not factor in the recount. Budget, Jobs and Investment Georgescu, 62, has been critical of NATO and Romanias stance on Ukraine, and has said Bucharest should engage, not challenge Russia. Opinion polls had not predicted his success. AUR has 8.5 of seats in the current legislature, and two far-right splinter parties could also enter parliament. Ciolacu ranked third in the presidential election first round, reflecting voters discontent with his government after campaigning on a promise of stability while the war in Ukraine continues. The next government will face a tough task in trying to cut a budget deficit that is the highest in the EU at 8 of economic output. It will also face pressure to uphold defence spending goals when Donald Trumps U.S. presidency starts. Romania has the EUs biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment. We have an unevenly developed country and the biggest frustrations accumulate in these periphery areas which will fall prey to candidates who know how to address them, said anthropologist Bogdan Iancu. In towns such as Victoria, in the shadow of the Fagaras mountains in the Southern Carpathians, the promise of jobs is vital. In the three decades since a communist-era chemical plant was hugely scaled back, the citys population halved to 6,400 and hundreds of residents endure long commutes to work. Firstly, I will vote for factories to come here. So that we have a place to work, said Mihai Coroianu, 52, shovelling snow in the towns main square. Town mayor Camelia Bertea has secured 31 million euros (33 million) in EU funds for local projects in three years, including reopening the local hospital, the equivalent of Victorias budget for 31 years. The government has also secured investment by German defence group Rheinmetall to build a gunpowder facility near Victoria by 2027, providing hundreds of jobs. The future of a small town without financial prospects can only be EU funds, Bertea said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Huge flooding caused by heavy rain in Malaysia and neighbouring Thailand has killed at least 12 people, officials say. More than 122,000 people have been forced out of their homes in northern Malaysia, while in southern Thailand, around 13,000 others have also been displaced. There are fears the number could rise, as heavy rain and storm warnings remain in place. Emergency services personnel have been deployed to help rescue stranded residents and shelters are being provided. The flooding, which began earlier in the week, has seen thousands of residents evacuated in both nations. Videos on social media and local news show cars and houses submerged, and people wading through waist-deep water. One video, filmed in Thailands Sateng Nok district, showed rescuers carrying a baby out from a roof of a flooded home. Flooding has impacted nearly 534,000 households in southern Thailand, disaster officials said, and two hospitals had to close to prevent floodwaters from damaging medical facilities. Six provinces have declared a disaster due to the floods. The government has designated 50 million baht (1.7m; 1.3m) in flood relief for each province, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra saying the goal is to restore normalcy as quickly as possible. In Malaysia, the flooding is mostly concentrated on the north-eastern state of Kelantan, which borders Thailand. There, the National Disaster Management Agency says the evacuees account for 63 of the total number. One resident in the town of Pasir Puteh in Kelantan said her area had been flooded since Wednesday. The water has already reached my house corridor and is just two inches away from coming inside, Zamrah Majid told AFP news agency. Another resident of the same town said he and his family have been isolated by the floods. Theres no way in or out of for any vehicles to enter my neighbourhood, Muhammad Zulkarnain told AFP. Another eight states in Malaysia have also been affected. So far, the number of those displaced surpasses that of 2014, which saw one of the worst floods in the country. Provisions for disaster management have been sent to Terengganu and Kelantan State Governments, according to the prime ministers office. On Friday, he barred his cabinet members from going on leave so they can focus on the disaster. The Malaysian Meteorological Department warned that heavy rains will continue until Sunday in some states, while its Thai counterpart warned that very heavy rain could continue through next week. Both countries experience monsoon rains around this time of the year, and flooding isnt uncommon. In 2021, Malaysia faced some of its worse flooding in decades, which killed at least 14 people. Ten years earlier, in 2011, widespread flooding across Thailand killed at least 500 people and damaged millions of homes. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 2, 2024 09:44 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sunday he had pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of making false statements on a gun background check and illegally possessing a firearm and pled guilty to federal tax charges. Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted, he said in a statement released by the White House. The White House had said repeatedly that Biden would not pardon or commute the sentences of his son, a recovering drug addict who became a target of Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son, Biden said. Hunter Biden faced sentencing for the false statements and gun convictions on Wednesday. In September he pled guilty to federal charges of failing to pay 1.4 million in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He faced sentencing in that case on Dec. 16. I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction  mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport, Hunter Biden said in a statement on Sunday, adding he had remained sober for more than five years. In the throes of addiction, I squandered many opportunities and advantages ... I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. The president, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, said his opponents had sought to break Hunter with selective prosecution. He said people were almost never brought to trial for felony charges over how they filled out a gun form, and said others who were late in paying taxes because of addiction but paid them back with interest and penalties as his son had typically received non-criminal resolutions to their cases. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election, Biden said. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me  and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. Biden said he had made the decision over the weekend. The president, his wife, Jill Biden, and their family including Hunter, spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts and returned to Washington on Saturday night. During a walk around Nantucket shops on Friday afternoon, one supporter shouted at the president from across a street to pardon his son. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice  and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further, Biden said. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Commenting further, Dr. Amarasekara expressed: We do not expect deflation to continue for such a long time to have an impact on production. So, I think by the second quarter of the next year, we will see the end of deflation. Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist whether the corporate profitability be impacted if the deflation drags for another year, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said the cost of production comes down means the profitability can increase. Moreover, the CBSL Chief also expressed that Sri Lanka does not need to rely on foreign exchange swaps at the moment, as the countrys official foreign reserves have grown, ensuring sufficient reserve liquidity. Meanwhile, the Director of the Payments and Settlements Department, K.V.K. Alwis, mentioned that Sri Lanka is currently in discussions with Indian authorities to implement a system allowing Sri Lankans to pay in Sri Lankan rupees when visiting India. This initiative would mirror the UPI system available in Sri Lanka for Indian travelers, he added. Sri Lankas consumer prices fell by 2.1 in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the island nation since 1961, official data showed Saturday (Nov. 30). Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices, the CBSL said earlier in a statement. However, the countrys financial regulatory authority said the inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.",

        "content": "Dozens of people have died in a crush following clashes at a football match in Guineas second-largest city, Nzérékoré, local media report. Prime Minister Mamadou Oury Bah said a stampede at the event led to a number of victims on Sunday and called for calm. One doctor, who did not want to be named, told AFP news agency that there were several bodies lined up in the local hospital, and the morgue was full. Local media said police used tear gas after supporters of the visiting team, Labé, threw stones towards the pitch in anger at the referee. So far no official casualty figures have been given. It all started with a contested decision by the referee. Then fans invaded the pitch, one witness told AFP. Videos and images on social media appear to show chaotic scenes outside the stadium, with large crowds attempting to climb over walls and numerous bodies on the ground. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these videos. Regional authorities are working to restore calm, Prime Minister Bah said in a statement, and added that hospitals are aiding the injured. Thousands of spectators were present when the crush happened at a match between Guinean teams Nzérékoré and Labé, local news website MediaGuinee reported. It said Sundays match was part of a tournament in honour of President Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in a coup in September 2021. One of the worst massacres in Guineas history also took place in a stadium. In 2009, 156 people were killed after troops opened fire at an opposition rally at a stadium in the capital, Conakry. Many were shot, stabbed, beaten or crushed in a stampede as security forces fired teargas and charged into the stadium. Scores of women were also raped. Former military ruler Moussa Dadis Camara was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity in connection with the massacre. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 2, 2024 11:48 am",
        "content": "The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) says that the Sri Lanka Air Quality Index (SLAQI) is gradually reaching towards moderate levels across several regions in the country. Speaking at a media briefing, CEA media spokesperson Dr. Ajith Gunawardena stated that the SLAQI readings in many areas ranged between 100 and 110 as of yesterday (Dec. 01). Dr. Gunawardena assured the public that the current slightly unhealthy levels of the air quality are temporary and are expected to improve significantly within the next two days. The air quality levels dropped in Colombo and several other areas across the country during last two days as a result of the recent adverse weather conditions and a border disturbance from the north. During yesterday, SL AQI was slightly unhealthy level in most of the cities while moderate level in Vavuniya, Kegalle, Nuwaraeliya, Rathnapura, Puttalam, Mullaitivu, Batticaloa, Kalutara and Anuradhapura, according to the latest data released by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO). However, the NBRO forcasted that AQI level will be between 86  120 over the day today, indicating slightly unhealthy level in most urban areas due to the trans-boundary conditions happening from northern region. SLAQI will be moderate level in Vavuniya, Nuwaraeliya, Embilipitiya, Hambantota and Anuradhapura areas today. The NBRO urged the general public to seek medical advice if this condition causes breathing difficulties for sensitive individuals. repor1 by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

        "date": "December 2, 2024 11:50 am",
        "content": "The Attorney General (AG) has informed the Supreme Court this morning (02) that the Cabinet of Ministers has recommended to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. Appearing on behalf of the AG, Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne further stated that the Cabinet of Ministers stance was that it is not necessary to re-conduct the examination for this question paper, considering the potential stress it could cause to the students. Furthermore, the Solicitor General informed that the Attorney General has filed a motion seeking the petition to be taken up for hearing before a full bench of Supreme Court judges. Later, the petition was ordered to be taken up for hearing on December 11, Ada Derana reporter said. The Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an order preventing the release of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination results and the cut-off marks was taken up for consideration before the Supreme Court today. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. On October 14, the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. However in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the release of results of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.",

        "date": "December 2, 2024 03:36 pm",
        "content": "Are you spending hours scrolling mindlessly on Instagram reels and TikTok? If so, you might be suffering from brain rot, which has become the Oxford word of the year. It is a term that captures concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The words usage saw an increase of 230 in its frequency from 2023 to 2024. Psychologist and Oxford University Professor, Andrew Przybylski says the popularity of the word is a symptom of the time were living in. Brain rot beat five other shortlisted words including demure, Romantasy and dynamic pricing. What is brain rot? Brain rot is defined as the supposed deterioration of a persons mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material considered to be trivial or unchallenging, The first recorded use of brain rot dates much before the creation of the internet - it was written down in 1854 by Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden. He criticises societys tendency to devalue complex ideas and how this is part of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort. It leads him to ask: While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot  which prevails so much more widely and fatally? The word initially gained traction on social media among Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities, but its now being used in the mainstream as a way to describe low-quality, low-value content found on social media. Prof Przybylski says theres no evidence of brain rot actually being a thing. Instead it describes our dissatisfaction with the online world and its a word that we can use to bundle our anxieties that we have around social media. Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, says looking back at the Oxford Word of the Year over the last two decades you can see societys growing preoccupation with how our virtual lives are evolving, the way internet culture is permeating so much of who we are and what we talk about. Last years winning word, rizz, was an interesting example of how language is increasingly formed, shaped, and shared within online communities. Brain rot speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. What other words made the shortlist? Demure (adj.): Of a person: reserved or restrained in appearance or behaviour. Of clothing: not showy, ostentatious, or overly revealing Dynamic pricing (n.): The practice of varying the price for a product or service to reflect changing market conditions; in particular, the charging of a higher price at a time of greater demand Lore (n.): A body of (supposed) facts, background information, and anecdotes relating to someone or something, regarded as knowledge required for full understanding or informed discussion of the subject in question Romantasy (n.): A genre of fiction combining elements of romantic fiction and fantasy, typically featuring themes of magic, the supernatural, or adventure alongside a central romantic storyline Slop (n.): Art, writing, or other content generated using artificial intelligence, shared and distributed online in an indiscriminate or intrusive way, and characterized as being of low quality, inauthentic, or inaccurate Other dictionary words of the year Oxford University dictionary is not the only one to have a word of the year, last month Cambridge Dictionary announced that manifest was its winner. The traditional definition of manifest included the adjective easily noticed or obvious and the noun to show something clearly through signs or actions. It now includes to manifest in the sense of to imagine achieving something you want, in the belief doing so will make it more likely to happen. It comes off the back of a global wellness trend endorsed by celebrities including singer Dua Lipa who said she manifested her headline slot at Glastonbury. Collins dictionary also announced in November that its word of the year was brat - a word that has been everywhere over the last couple of months thanks to Charli XCXs viral album. Brat is defined as someone with a confident, independent and hedonistic attitude. It started as the name of her number one album, but it has arguably grown into a cultural movement for some, with people adopting the brat way of life. Another internet phenomenon has inspired the Dictionary.com word of the year which is demure. The word took off in August after content creator Jools Lebron, posted on TikTok abut her demure work outfit and mindful make-up. The very demure, very mindful trend took off after that and the satirical idea pokes fun at the stereotypical ideas of femininity. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Landmark climate change case opens at the top UN court as island nations fear rising seas",
        "date": "December 2, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "The top United Nations court took up the largest case in its history on Monday, hearing the plight of several small island nations helpless in combating the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very survival. They demand that major polluting nations be held to account. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on the obligations of States in respect of climate change. The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line, said Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney-general of the Vanuatu archipelago nation. As the principal legal officer of my country, I have come before this court because domestic legal remedies are unable to address a crisis of the scope and magnitude, he said during the opening session of two weeks of hearings. States have obligations ... to act with due diligence, to prevent significant harm to the environment, to prevent, to reduce the emissions and provide support to countries like mine to protect the human rights of present and future generations, he said. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and couldnt directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could be the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis but it affects many more island nations in the South Pacific. Cynthia Houniuhi, the head of the Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change that initiated the case, said climate change was undermining the sacred contract between generations. Without our land, our bodies and memories are severed from the fundamental relationship that define who we are. Those who stand to lose are the future generations. Their future is uncertain, reliant upon the decision making of a handful of large emitting states., she told the court, referring to China, India and the United States. Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said that the conduct of major polluters responsible for the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences is unlawful under multiple sources of international law. Vanuatus climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told the court that since 1990, emissions have increased by over 50, reaching an all time high in 2023. He added that a handful of readily identifiable states have produced the vast majority of historic and current greenhouse gas emissions. Yet other countries, including my own, are suffering the brunt of the consequences. The Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. Its the largest lineup in the institutions nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least 300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the 1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the worlds biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines, said Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to small island developing States likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to members of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change. The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.

During the discussion, the President emphasized the importance of ensuring a continuous and affordable supply of rice to consumers in the coming months. He engaged with the mill owners to identify immediate measures needed to achieve this goal. The meeting also focused on enhancing storage facilities across the country to prevent shortages and ensure a steady rice supply, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Additionally, concerns were raised about the declining availability of Nadu rice for consumption due to its increased use in value-added products. President Dissanayake highlighted the potential benefits of introducing a QR code system to streamline the distribution of fertilizer subsidies and boost domestic agricultural production, the PMD added. Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Wasantha Samarasinghe, Lak Sathosa Chairman Dr. Samitha Perera, officials, and small and medium-scale rice mill owners attended the discussion. --PMD",

        "date": "December 2, 2024 09:20 pm",
        "content": "Fifty-six people were killed and several injured in a stampede at a soccer stadium in southern Guinea, following clashes between fans, Guineas government said Monday. Authorities are conducting an investigation to establish those responsible for the stampede on Sunday, Communications Minister Fana Soumah said in a statement read on national television. Among the victims are several children according to local media and a coalition of political parties. The stampede broke out on Sunday afternoon at the stadium in the city of Nzerekore during the final of a local tournament between the Labe and Nzerekore teams in honor of Guineas military leader, Mamadi Doumbouya, Guineas Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah said on the X platform. During the stampede, victims were recorded, Bah said, without giving details. The regional authorities are working to restore calm in the area, he added. Local media reported that security forces tried to use tear gas to restore calm after the chaos that followed a disputed penalty. This (the disputed penalty) angered supporters who threw stones. This is how the security services used tear gas, Media Guinea, a local news website, reported. It said several of those killed were children while some of the injured being treated at a regional hospital are in critical condition. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed fans in a section of the stadium shouting and protesting the refereeing before clashes broke out as people poured onto the field. People were running as they tried to escape from the stadium, many of them jumping the high fence. Videos also showed many people lying on the floor in what looked like a hospital as a crowd gathered nearby, some assisting the wounded. The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition coalition called for an investigation. It said the tournament was organized to drum up support for the illegal and inappropriate political ambitions of the military leader. Guinea has been led by the military since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. It is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Doumbouya, who ousted the president three years ago, said he was preventing the country from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. He has, however, been criticized for not meeting the expectations that he raised. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 3, 2024 09:40 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas tourism sector is taking a bold step into the limelight as a leading destination for Indian film productions, with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) taking centre stage at the 10th edition of the India International Film Tourism Conclave (IIFTC) in Mumbai, held from October 23 to 25, 2024. The event, renowned as the largest film tourism platform in India, provided an exceptional opportunity for Sri Lanka to showcase its diverse landscapes and cultural richness to the Indian film industry, positioning the island as the perfect location for cinematic ventures. Sri Lankas focus on film tourism aligns with global trends where countries are seeing significant economic benefits from attracting international film productions. A high-profile delegation from Sri Lanka, led by renowned international film producer Chandran Rutnam and supported by the International Film Producers Association of Sri Lanka (IFPA), joined forces with SLTPB to captivate key stakeholders from Indias film industry. Mr. Chaminda Munasinghe, Assistant Director of SLTPB responsible for film tourism promotions, presented Sri Lankas potential as a top-tier filming destination at the main event of IIFTC. The SLTPBs presentation at IIFTC 2024 was a masterclass in promoting Sri Lankas unparalleled natural beauty, cultural diversity, and ease of access. The showcase specifically targeted the Bollywood, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, and Marathi film industries, emphasizing Sri Lankas scenic landscapes ranging from pristine beaches to lush jungles and vibrant cultural sites. Sri Lankas capability to cater to large-scale productions with minimal logistical challenges was a key highlight of the presentation. Discussions were held by Mr. Munasinghe and Mr. Chandran Rutnam with some of the most influential Indian film industry representativesranging from producers to location managersresulting in promising dialogues and a roadmap for future collaborations. Targeted digital campaign undertaken at the event aimed over 800 attendees amplified Sri Lankas appeal as a cinematic hotspot. A pivotal part of Sri Lankas strategy was its partnership with the Sri Lanka Consulate General Office in Mumbai, which collectively worked to enhance the countrys visibility within the Indian film tourism sector. Specially, Mrs. Shirani Ariyarathne Actg. Consul General has been eagerly supported Sri Lanka Tourisms delegation to connect with Indian Film Producers as well as key Indian government officials from The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of India. A series of high-level meetings at the Sri Lanka Consulate General Office in Mumbai provided further opportunities for strengthening ties and securing support from Indian production houses. In addition, discussions with the Indian Film Development Corporation (NFDC) which is the main governing body for all Indian Cinema was a significant milestone. NFDC extended a formal invitation to the SLTPB team to explore future promotional opportunities at the prestigious International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2025, which is set to feature countries like Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. This partnership is expected to pave the way for even greater visibility for Sri Lanka in the global film tourism market.",

        "date": "December 3, 2024 10:42 am",
        "content": "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car, less than a fortnight after the release of a teaser video that stirred online controversy. The unveiling of the Type 00 car was met by mixed responses from social media users, with some cheering its design, while others mocked the launch. Last month, many critics pointed out that the promotional video teasing the new model did not feature an actual car - but the firm was also praised by some for its bold new approach. The car maker, which is embarking on the biggest change in its history, announced a new logo and released a so-called social media tease, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand. During the Type 00 event in Miami on Monday, the UK-based companys chief creative officer, Gerry McGovern, said he welcomed the attention Jaguars new direction had been getting. It has already stirred emotions and it will continue to, he said. Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody. Replies on Jaguars social media posts about the car ranged from Go back to the drawing board and hopefully this doesnt actually come out to Exciting and Absolutely stunning. Car industry analyst Karl Brauer was sceptical about the rebranding. The company seems to be sacrificing Jaguars past to the hopes of a better future, he told the BBC. I dont think its going to work. Last month, the company urged people to trust and reserve judgement over the rebrand of the business, which has a history dating back more than a century. Earlier in November, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) stopped selling new Jaguar cars in the UK ahead of a relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026. The firm said it was a deliberate move to create some breathing space before launching the new brand this month. The firm announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all three of its three British plants open as part of the strategy. Jaguar has been the weakest link within the JLR group, which has been owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade. The Range Rover and Defender were behind the companys highest profits since 2015, which were announced earlier this year. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Iraqi fighters head to Syria to battle rebels but Lebanons Hezbollah stays out, sources say",
        "date": "December 3, 2024 10:59 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi fighters crossed into Syria on Monday to help the government fight rebels who seized Aleppo last week, but Lebanons Hezbollah has no plans for now to join them, according to sources. Irans constellation of allied regional militia groups, aided by Russian air power, has been integral to the success of pro-government forces in subduing rebels in Syria who rose up against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. But that alliance faces a new test after last weeks lightning advance by rebels in northwest Syria, with Russia focused on war in Ukraine and Hezbollahs leadership decimated by a war with Israel that ended in a ceasefire last week. The rebel storm of Aleppo is the biggest success of anti-Assad fighters for years. Government forces had held complete control of Aleppo since capturing what was then Syrias largest city in a siege in 2016, one of the major turning points of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. The head of Syrias main opposition group abroad, Hadi al-Bahra, told Reuters the rebels were able to seize the city so quickly because Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups were distracted by their conflict with Israel. Preparations had been made since last year for an assault on Aleppo, but it was held up by the war in Gaza, he said. Syrias civil war had been frozen since 2020, with Assad in control of most territory and all major cities. Rebels still held an enclave in the northwest, Turkey-backed forces held a strip along the northern border and U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces controlled a pocket in the northeast. Any prolonged escalation in Syria risks further destabilising a region roiled by the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, with millions of Syrians already displaced and with regional and global powers backing rival forces in the country. Iraqi and Syrian sources confirmed the deployment of more Iran-backed Iraqi fighters to Syria. Irans Foreign Minister said Tehran will provide any support needed and that resistance groups would come to Assads aid. At least 300 fighters, primarily from Iraqs Badr and Nujabaa groups, crossed late on Sunday using a dirt road to avoid the official border crossing, two Iraqi security sources said, adding that they were there to defend a Shiite shrine. A senior Syrian military source said the fighters had crossed in small groups to avoid airstrikes. These are fresh reinforcements being sent to aid our comrades on the front lines in the north, the source said. The head of Iraqs Popular Mobilisation Forces, which includes the major Shiite militia groups aligned with Iran, said no group under its umbrella had entered Syria, and that it does not operate outside Iraq. The spokesperson of the Iran-aligned Iraqi armed group Kataib Hezbollah, meanwhile, said in a statement on Monday that the group was closely monitoring the aggression of criminal groups on the Syrian people, adding that they had not yet decided whether to send fighters. Lebanons Hezbollah, long the most capable Iran-backed force on the battlefield and key to Assads military alliance in Syria, has not yet been asked to intervene and was not ready to send forces after its gruelling conflict with Israel, said three sources familiar with the groups thinking. One of the sources said the group had pulled senior officers responsible for Aleppo out of northern Syria to help in the ground war against Israel that raged until last weeks ceasefire. Two other sources, one Lebanese and the other Syrian, said Hezbollah had pulled back forces from Syria in mid-October when the fighting with Israel intensified. Arab countries and Washington have seen the weakening of Hezbollah as a potential opportunity to peel Assad away from his alliance with Iran. Sources have told Reuters that the United Arab Emirates and United States had been discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions against Assad if he reduces his reliance on Tehran. The rebel advance could complicate this, if it pushes Assad to depend more on Iranian support. DEADLY STRIKES Russia, whose 2015 entry into the conflict turned the military balance decisively in Assads favour, continues to support him and is analysing the situation on the ground, the Kremlin said. On Sunday Moscow dismissed the general in charge of its forces in Syria, Russian war bloggers reported. The Syrian government said Syrian and Russian air forces were striking rebel-held positions in the countryside east of Aleppo city. The White Helmets rescue organisation and residents of rebel-held areas in the north said warplanes had hit residential areas of Aleppo city and a displaced peoples camp in Idlib province where seven people were killed, including five children. The government said the military was working to secure a string of towns recaptured from rebels on Sunday that run along the front line north of Hama, a major city lying between Aleppo and Damascus. Rebel shelling of Hama killed three people on Monday, state television said. The Syrian government said it had killed hundreds of rebel fighters in recent days, which Reuters could not independently confirm. The rebels fighting in Aleppo, Idlib and Hama provinces in northwest Syria include mainstream groups backed by Turkey as well as the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. A Turkish official told Reuters Turkey had not given any permission for the rebel offensive, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham took no instructions from Turkey. The Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers discussed the fighting in Syria on Monday. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said rebel advances could not be explained by foreign intervention and urged the Syrian opposition to compromise. A spokesperson for Israels military said it would not let Iran exploit the Syria conflict to transfer weapons to Hezbollah. Turkeys state-owned Anadolu news agency said the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army had taken the town of Tel Rifaat from the Kurdish YPG militia and was advancing in outer areas of the district. Rebel sources and an Aleppo resident said the Kurdish YPG group was pulling out of longstanding positions in the citys Sheikh Maqsoud district under a deal with rebel forces.
