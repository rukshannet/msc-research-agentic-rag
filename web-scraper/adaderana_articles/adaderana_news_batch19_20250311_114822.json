        "title": "US partners with Sri Lanka to preserve historic Thuparama Image House in Polonnaruwa",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 10:13 am",
        "content": "The U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and the Central Cultural Fund, has launched a new conservation project to protect the ancient Thuparama Image House, a key site within the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Polonnaruwa Ancient City, yesterday (17). This initiative, funded by a 109,000 grant (over Rs. 32 million) from the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), reflects U.S. commitment to preserving Sri Lankas cultural heritage for future generations. The event was attended by U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung and Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Prof. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi , according to the US Embassy in Colombo. At Fridays ceremony, Ambassador Chung emphasized, The United States and Sri Lanka share a long history of partnership built on mutual respect and shared values. Together, we have worked on strengthening democratic institutions, promoting sustainable economic growth, and preserving cultural heritage, such as the Thuparama Image House. Through initiatives like the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, on behalf of the American people, we continue to help Sri Lanka protect its heritage, promote sustainable tourism, and attract global visitors to explore its historical and cultural richness. Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs Prof. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi, who attended the ceremony, remarked, The United States, through the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, once again demonstrates its commitment to preserving Sri Lankas cultural treasures. This collaboration strengthens our bond and reflects the U.S. dedication to preserving not only Sri Lankas heritage but also the connection between our nations, the statement said. The Thuparama Image House, constructed in the 12th century as part of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom, is a monumental site with a distinctive vaulted brick roof and stunning stucco decorations. This historical gem has suffered damage over time due to environmental factors, and the preservation project aims to prevent further deterioration while raising awareness about its cultural and historical significance. For over 23 years, the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) has supported cultural preservation projects in more than 140 countries globally. In Sri Lanka, since 2001, the U.S. has collaborated with local archaeologists, historians, and faith communities on 17 significant cultural preservation initiatives, funded by 1.5 million from the American people. These projects include the conservation of the Rajagala Buddhist forest monastery, the preservation of collections at the Anuradhapura Archaeological Museum, and the restoration of the Batticaloa Dutch Fort, US Embassy in Colombo said. Most recently, the U.S. has supported the preservation of the Kandyan Kings Palace and Archaeology Museum, located within the Sacred Temple of the Tooth Relic complex. Beyond land-based efforts, the U.S. is also helping to protect the Godawaya shipwreckthe oldest known shipwreck in the Asia-Pacific regionoff the coast of Hambantota. Cultural heritage stands as a powerful reminder of humanitys shared history and contributions. Through its preservation efforts, the United States shows deep respect for diverse cultures around the world. From restoring ancient structures to conserving rare manuscripts, safeguarding vital archaeological sites, and documenting disappearing traditions, AFCP projects protect invaluable heritage, it added. AFCP initiatives preserve history, strengthen civil society by fostering unity and dialogue, support good governance through transparency and accountability, and promote political and economic stability by generating jobs, income, and sustainable growth.",

        "date": "January 18, 2025 11:15 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Energy, Kumara Jayakody has stated that as a priority, the government will implement the recommendations of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to reduce electricity tariffs. He emphasized that recommendation will be implemented considering this as the first phase in the plan to provide a 30 tariff reduction over the next three years for the domestic, hotel, and industrial sectors. He made these remarks in response to an inquiry from Ada Derana. Meanwhile, the Minister has also issued a special statement today regarding the matter. I am aware that a significant reduction in electricity bills is a great relief to the people. I am pleased that as a government, we have been able to manage the challenges and provide relief to the public, Minister Jayakody said in the special statement today (18). I hope that all the people of the country, especially those in the hotel sector and industrialists, have benefited greatly from this, he added. Accordingly, he stated that the overall electricity bill will be reduced by about 20, with the recommendations of the PUCSL being accepted and implemented from midnight on January 17. The PUCSL had announced that it has decided to reduce electricity tariffs by an average amount of 20 overall for the first 06 months of the year, with effect from midnight yesterday (17). However, the Ministry of Energy later issued a special announcement regarding the revision of electricity tariffs recommended by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), yesterday (17). According to the announcement, once the new electricity tariff revision recommended by the PUCSL is officially received, it will be implemented by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) following the advice of the Ministry of Finance.

        "title": "Israel to free 737 prisoners in first phase of Gaza truce deal",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 12:23 pm",
        "content": "Israels justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal approved Saturday. It said in a statement on its website that the government approves the release (of) 737 prisoners and detainees currently in the custody of the prison service. Israels cabinet voted to approve the ceasefire deal early Saturday, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend. Those named by the ministry include men, women and children who it said will not be released before Sunday at 4:00 p.m. local time (1400 GMT). It had previously published a list of 95 Palestinian prisoners, the majority women, to be freed in exchange for Israeli captives in Gaza. Among those on the expanded list was Zakaria Zubeidi, a chief of the armed wing of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbass Fatah party. Zubeidi escaped from Israels Gilboa prison with five other Palestinians in 2021, sparking a days-long manhunt, and is lauded by Palestinians as a hero. Also to be freed is Khalida Jarar, a leftist Palestinian lawmaker whom Israel arrested and imprisoned on several occasions. Jarar is a prominent member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a group designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union. Detained in late December in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, the 60-year-old has been held since then without charge. Two sources close to Hamas told AFP that the first group of hostages to be released consists of three Israeli women soldiers. However, since the Palestinian Islamist movement considers any Israeli of military age who has completed mandatory service a soldier, the reference could also apply to civilians abducted during the attack that triggered the war. The first three names on a list obtained by AFP of the 33 hostages set to be released in the first phase are women under 30 who were not in military service on the day of the Hamas attack. Justice ministry spokeswoman Noga Katz has said the final number of prisoners to be released in the first swap would depend on the number of live hostages released by Hamas. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok says it will go dark on Sunday unless Biden intervenes immediately",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 12:35 pm",
        "content": "TikTok on Friday said that it would turn off more than 170 million Americans access to the super popular video app on Sunday, unless President Joe Bidens administration acts urgently to assure the company it will not be punished for violating the terms of its looming ban. A bipartisan law, signed by Biden in April, requires TikTok to sell to American buyers by Sunday or face a ban in the United States. The Supreme Court earlier in the day allowed the controversial ban to stand. The Biden administration has made clear it would leave enforcement of the ban to President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday, and a White House official reiterated Friday night that its position on the matter has been sufficiently clear. While the official did not rule out further action before the Sunday deadline, they said the administration had clearly signaled that it would not penalize service providers like Google and Apple for hosting TikTok on Sunday. Still, TikTok said that was not enough. The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikToks availability to over 170 million Americans, the company said in a statement Friday evening. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19. Trump has suggested  but not outright stated  that he will not enforce the ban. He had asked the Supreme Court to stay the ban so his incoming administration could work out a deal to sell TikTok to American buyers. But the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the apps owners that claimed the law violated the First Amendment, allowing the ban to take place. So TikTok could turn itself off Sunday, only to turn itself back on at a later date if Trump gives it assurances it will go unpunished for violating the ban. The companys Friday night warning was driven by concerns from service providers that face steep fines for allowing access to the app in the event of a ban. Some service producers  companies that would face exorbitant fines for allowing access to TikTok once the ban takes effect  told TikTok Friday that they still feel vulnerable, according to a person familiar with the matter, who added that the service providers do not feel that theyve been given enough assurance that they will not be liable. Of course, the Biden administrations power runs out on Monday, and White House aides have made clear that implementation of the law is entirely up to the incoming administration. In the meantime, TikTok executives seem to be operating out of an abundance of caution, fearing legal and financial penalties and exerting maximum pressure to keep the app alive in the United States over the long term. The Supreme Court wont intervene Earlier Friday, the high court handed down an unsigned opinion in the TikTok case, and there were no noted dissents. The decision, which followed warnings from the Biden administration that the app posed a grave national security threat because of its ties to China, will allow the ban to start Sunday. But there are a lot of lingering questions about how the ban would work in practice because theres no precedent for the US government blocking a major social media platform. And how exactly the government would enforce it remains unclear. In its opinion, the Supreme Court acknowledged that for 170 million Americans TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But the court said, Congress was focused on national security concerns and that, the court said, was a deciding factor in how it weighed the case. Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikToks data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary, the court wrote. In a TikTok video responding to the decision, TikTok CEO Shou Chew suggested the company will continue its efforts to ensure the app remains accessible for Americans  potentially now with an assist from President-elect Trump. We have been fighting to protect the constitutional right of free speech for the more than 170 million Americans who use our platform every day to connect, create, discover and achieve their dreams, Chew said. On behalf of everyone at TikTok, and our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. He added: We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process. Trump tells CNN: Ill be making the decision The ruling also puts the spotlight on Trump, who spoke with CNNs Pamela Brown after the decision came down. It ultimately goes up to me, so youre going to see what Im going to do, Trump said. Asked if he would try to reverse the pending ban, Trump said: Congress has given me the decision, so Ill be making the decision. Trump also confirmed he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying they had a great talk about TikTok and a great talk about many other subjects. But the Biden administration  which ends in less than 72 hours  said it was time for Trump to take the baton on the ban. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Friday morning that President Bidens position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the Presidents desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law. Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday, she added. Companies and content creators connected to TikToks operations in the US  caught in limbo between the two administrations  are seeking assurances that a ban on the popular app and any penalties wont be enforced right away. The law penalizes companies that distribute or update the app with fines of up to 5,000 for each user affected, an equation that could easily reach hundreds of millions of dollars  and potentially billions of dollars  in penalties. The law requires the Department of Justice to investigate potential violations and pursue enforcement. From what weve heard already  that the implementation is up to the new administration already suggests that they dont plan on enforcing it, Jeffrey Fisher, who represented TikTok users in the challenge to the ban, said on CNNs The Lead with Jake Tapper. But just given the nature of the law and how many people in the country are watching this, Fisher said, were just seeking additional clarification that theres a little breathing space for the new administration to come in and take a fresh look at this. A US law enforcement official, however, told CNN that the current Biden administration is leaving it to companies and their attorneys to interpret how to comply with the law on Sunday. In practical terms, the Justice Department isnt going to file lawsuits over the holiday weekend, with Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, the law enforcement official added. In his video, Chew told viewers, Rest assured we will do everything in our power to ensure the popular app remains available, adding: More to come. The TikTok CEO is set to be seated on the dais, alongside other leading tech CEOs, at Trumps inauguration  perhaps a sign of just how serious the incoming president is about trying to save the app. And with some in Congress now suggesting that TikTok might need more time to find a buyer, Trump could find support in trying to push off the ban to a later date. The law gives the president the option to extend the ban by 90 days, but triggering the extension requires evidence that parties working on purchasing have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal  and TikToks parent company, ByteDance, hasnt publicly updated its stance that the app is not for sale. Decision focuses on extensive data collection and security concerns The Supreme Court decision focuses heavily on concerns about the apps data collection. The Biden administration had made two national security arguments about TikTok. One was a fear that the China could access users information as potential blackmail material. Another was that the company could manipulate content in a way that benefits the Chinese governments talking points. The Supreme Court, which often defers to the executive branch on matters of national security, leaned heavily into the data collection argument. TikTok does not dispute that the government has an important and well-grounded interest in preventing China from collecting the personal data of tens of millions of U.S. TikTok users, the court wrote. Nor could they. The platform collects extensive personal information from and about its users. The court was careful to note the inherent narrowness of its ruling given the specific concerns regarding TikTok and the Chinese government. In another similar case, the justices said, the ruling could look different. Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age. But TikToks scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Governments national security concerns, they wrote. The ruling also noted that justices are conscious that the cases before us involve new technologies with transformative capabilities. Gorsuch and Sotomayor discuss level of scrutiny Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurrence sketching out distinctions in how he viewed the case from a legal perspective, while stressing that these thoughts came with just a very limited time that the court had to review and decide the case. He said that he had serious reservations about the level of scrutiny the courts opinion applied to the law, indicating that he thought strict scrutiny  which sets a higher bar for the government to overcome to prove the laws constitutionality  may have been the more appropriate approach. But even under that high bar, Gorsuch said he thought the government had met its burden. Speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another, he wrote. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, also concurring in the courts opinion, wrote separately to air her disagreement with the courts decision to assume without deciding that the law implicates the First Amendment. The courts line of cases dealing with the First Amendment, she said, leaves no doubt that it does. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "The Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) has uncovered further information regarding a planned terrorist attack targeting tourists in the Arugam Bay area, a popular tourist destination frequented by Israeli tourists. The facts were presented before the court on Friday (January 17). The TID reported that the terrorist attack was planned while the perpetrators were in prison. When the case was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Pasan Amarasena, the court was informed that seven suspects have been arrested thus far in connection with the terror plot. Three of the suspectsYogaraja Nirojan, Suresh Ranjana, and W.A. Don Amarasiriwere produced before court yesterday. Investigating officers, who had interrogated the suspects for 90 days, stated that the attack was planned to be carried out using former members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who had been convicted for their involvement in terrorist acts and released after serving long sentences. The suspects had planned to execute the attack coinciding with the last Presidential Election. As part of their preparations, they had dispatched several individuals to the Arugam Bay tourist area to film and take photographs on October 7 and 8 last year. Investigators further informed the court that Bilal Ahmed, the first accused in the case, had made contact with Anandan Sugadaran, who had been convicted over the 2008 Kesbewa bus bombing, while both were in prison. Attorney Rajinda Kandegedara, representing the suspects, claimed in court that either the TID or the police had obtained Bilal Ahmeds signature on certain documents. In response, the Magistrate noted that the court had been monitoring the suspects since their detention for interrogation and that none of the suspects had complained to him regarding such incidents when he had visited them for observation. After considering the arguments presented by both parties, the Magistrate ordered that the suspects be remanded until further instructions are received from the Attorney General.",

        "title": "Court orders release of Sri Lankan detained in Cyprus",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 06:38 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court of Cyprus has ruled to immediately release a Sri Lankan man from detention, highlighting the alleged risk of torture he faces if returned to his home country. The court issued a habeas corpus order after rejecting a decision to keep him in custody, agreeing with the asylum service that he should not be deported to Sri Lanka due to the danger of inhumane treatment. The case, as detailed in the supreme courts decision, dates back to 2017, when the man applied for a renewal of his residence and work permit in Cyprus, which was granted. However, his asylum application, filed in February 2018, was rejected by the asylum service in 2020. In May 2020, the man appealed the decision in the administrative court of international protection, but the appeal was dismissed later that year. A second asylum application was also rejected in January 2023, and a further appeal was denied in March 2023. On 5 January 2024, when the man attempted to cross from the occupied areas of Cyprus into the republic, he was found to be living illegally in the country. He was arrested and placed in detention at the Menogeia detention centre for illegal immigrants. During his detention, the man made it clear that he did not wish to return to Sri Lanka, but on 6 January 2024, detention and deportation orders were issued. However, due to his refusal to comply with the previous decision ordering him to return to Sri Lanka, the authorities determined that keeping him in detention was the only option. On 15 January 2024, the man submitted a new asylum application. Then, on 22 February 2024, the authorities issued another detention and deportation order. In August last year, the mans asylum application was once again rejected, but the authorities acknowledged that returning him to Sri Lanka would place him at risk of torture. The asylum service advised against deporting him, and the man appealed this decision to the administrative court of international protection in September 2024, with the case still pending. In his appeal, the man argued that the lower court had failed to consider important new facts, making his continued detention unlawful. He also pointed out that the court had misinterpreted the law, as the reasons for his detention no longer applied. The supreme courts ruling supported the asylum services position that deporting the man to Sri Lanka would expose him to serious risks. The court referred to the principle of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, which allows individuals to challenge unlawful detention. The court also noted that the mans continued detention for almost a year was meant to facilitate his deportation. However, the authorities had indicated that deportation to Sri Lanka was not a viable option due to the risk he faced there, weakening the justification for his detention.

        "title": "HRW urges Sri Lanka President to address legacy of past conflicts and continuing rights abuses",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 07:18 pm",
        "content": "The government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which took office on September 23, 2024, has promised to address longstanding human rights issues that have plunged Sri Lanka into repeated crises, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in its World Report 2025. Dissanayake has pledged to introduce more equitable economic policies and to repeal the notoriously abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act, but he has not backed accountability for widespread rights violations during Sri Lankas 1983-2009 civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the report said. For the 546-page world report, in its 35th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In much of the world, Executive Director Tirana Hassan writes in her introductory essay, governments cracked down and wrongfully arrested and imprisoned political opponents, activists, and journalists. Armed groups and government forces unlawfully killed civilians, drove many from their homes, and blocked access to humanitarian aid. In many of the more than 70 national elections in 2024, authoritarian leaders gained ground with their discriminatory rhetoric and policies. Sri Lankas multiple crises are connected by entrenched impunity for rights violations, discrimination against minority communities, and laws and institutions that seek to silence critics, said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. President Dissanayake has an opportunity to make real progress on rights if he carries out his campaign pledges, but he also needs to address the legacy of past conflicts and continuing abuses against Tamils, Muslims, and others on which he has been troublingly silent.  While an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout helped stem the immediate crisis after the Sri Lankan government defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022, the United Nations estimated that a quarter of households were suffering food insecurity in 2024.  Policies pursued by the outgoing administration of President Ramil Wickremesinghe under the IMF program shifted the burden of recovery largely onto people with low incomes. The Dissanayake government has pledged to combat corruption and create more equitable economic policies.  Police and other security agencies harassed and threatened activists and human rights defenders with impunity during 2024, particularly in predominantly Tamil areas in the north and east, including undue restrictions and interference in the financing of civil society organizations.  In May, the UN human rights office issued a report calling for the international community to undertake prosecutions and other accountability measures to address thousands of unresolved cases of enforced disappearance that occurred over decades during the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprisings, and the LTTE armed conflict. The UN Human Rights Council has extended a mandate to monitor human rights violations and collect evidence of crimes during the civil war. President Dissanayake should begin to address Sri Lankas many human rights problems by fulfilling and building upon the pledges he made during his partys election campaigns.",

        "content": "Two senior Iranian Supreme Court judges involved in handling espionage and terrorism cases were shot dead in the capital Tehran on Saturday, Irans judiciary said. It said the attacker killed himself after opening fire at the judges inside the Supreme Court, and that a bodyguard of one of the judges was wounded. The judiciary identified the judges who were killed as mid-ranking Shiite Muslim clerics Mohammad Moghiseh and Ali Razini. While the motive for the assassination was still unclear, judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told state television that the two judges had long been involved in national security cases, including espionage and terrorism. In the past year, the judiciary has undertaken extensive efforts to identify spies and terrorist groups, a move that has sparked anger and resentment among the enemies, he said. State TV said these cases were related to individuals linked to Israel and the Iranian opposition supported by the United States. It did not elaborate. Opposition websites have in the past said Moghiseh was involved in trials of people they described as political prisoners. Razini was a target of an assassination attempt in 1998.

        "date": "January 18, 2025 09:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka and China are ushering in a new chapter in bilateral relations, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said in an interview with Xinhua. At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Dissanayake was on a state visit to China from Tuesday to Friday, his first trip to China since taking office in September as Sri Lankan president. I first visited Beijing in 2004. Returning after 20 years, I see a tremendous transformation, Dissanayake said. Over the past 68 years since establishing diplomatic ties, China and Sri Lanka have deepened their strategic cooperative partnership through sincere mutual assistance and lasting friendship. Following their talks on Wednesday, the two heads of state jointly witnessed the signing of several cooperation documents in such areas as Belt and Road cooperation, agricultural products, social welfare, and the press, radio and television. Dissanayake said that Sri Lanka is currently facing several challenges, including poverty reduction, technological advancement and infrastructure development, and China can play a significant role in supporting Sri Lanka in overcoming these challenges. I observed that the Chinese government is people-centered and attentive to public needs. Similarly, Sri Lankas new government is also dedicated to serving its people, said the 56-year-old president. Dissanayake applauded Chinas poverty alleviation achievements. Chinas poverty reduction experience is a global model and has been praised by the United Nations. Sri Lanka has much to learn from Chinas experience, he said, highlighting his plan of field trips to rural areas in China to learn firsthand how local farmers have overcome poverty. Dissanayake was also impressed by his visit to the Museum of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which shows how China, led by the CPC, has overcome challenges and achieved its current success. The exhibition holds great significance not only for the Chinese people, but also for us as it offers new perspectives on development, he said. Over the years, Sri Lanka and China have made steady progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Chinese enterprises have constructed ports, highways, railways, hospitals, water conservancies and power facilities in Sri Lanka, significantly improving its infrastructure and investment environment while boosting local employment. China is a major trade partner for Sri Lanka, a leading source of imports and foreign investment, and a key provider of development assistance. The Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port are landmark projects of the Belt and Road cooperation between the two sides. These two projects will undoubtedly bring long-term economic benefits to Sri Lanka, Dissanayake said. Industrial parks would be developed around Hambantota Port, and Colombo Port City would attract more investment, greatly improving the living standards of the Sri Lankan people, he said. Debunking Western medias disinformation that China is creating a debt trap and militarizing Sri Lankan ports, Dissanayake said, Global South countries need development, which cannot be achieved without external investment and loans. We cannot view such assistance as a debt trap. Looking ahead, Dissanayake expressed hope of attracting more Chinese enterprises to invest in Sri Lanka and more Chinese tourists. Currently, China is Sri Lankas fourth-largest source of tourists. To further boost tourism, Sri Lanka has launched tourism promotion campaigns and streamlined visa application processes, and it is planning more direct flights to attract Chinese tourists. Sri Lanka and China are both nations rich in cultural heritage with a long history of people-to-people exchanges. I believe Chinese tourists will have a wonderful time in Sri Lanka, said the president. Source: Xinhua --Agencies",

The Premier made this statement at the occasion of declaring open the renovated Court of Appeal building to the public yesterday (18), the Prime Ministers Media Division stated. The renovations of the building were carried out by the expense of the Peoples Republic of China in the form of a total donation. Further she mentioned that the investment made in a countrys judicial system and in the provision of facilities for the delivery of justice to the people is a reflection of the commitment made towards the country and its people, the statement said. This is not just a building, but a symbol of the delivery of justice, fairness of law, equality and dignity. Our country has suffered for decades because many were denied justice under systems of rewards and sponsorships. Our intention is to resolve those deficiencies, bring forth fairness and ensure that everyone has access to justice, said the Prime Minister. The people must be able to keep trust and rely on the judicial system by exemplifying that the legal powers granted to judges by the Constitution are exercised fairly and providing independent and fair judgment to the parties concerned. Everyone, including women, children and the disabled community, expects justice. Their aspiration is that such a system will ensure that no one faces hardships, an attention will be paid to their mental conditions, protection from the consequences they may face when seeking justice for them or defending their rights. All actors in this process must be treated with respect. There are people who have faced hardships for years in the pursuit of justice. We ensure that they are treated fairly. They should not be subjected to intimidation, harassment or threat in the pursuit of justice, the Premier highlighted.

        "date": "January 19, 2025 08:50 am",
        "content": "At least 70 people were killed and more injured in northern Nigeria on Saturday when a petrol tanker truck overturned, spilling fuel that exploded, the countrys national emergency agency said. The accident in Niger state follows a similar blast in Jigawa state last October that killed 147 people, one of the worst such tragedies in Nigeria. As of this report, over 70 bodies have been recovered, 56 individuals are injured, and more than 15 shops have been destroyed, the National Emergency Management Authority said in a statement. The injured have been transported to hospitals for treatment, while recovery efforts for the deceased are ongoing. A Reuters witness said residents and officials were digging graves with a view to bury the victims on Saturday night in accordance with Islamic rites. Niger is a largely Muslim state in Africas most populous nation. Earlier, Kumar Tsukwam, the Federal Road Safety Corps sector commander for Niger state, said most of the victims were impoverished local residents who had rushed to scoop up the spilled petrol after the truck overturned. Large crowd of people gathered to scoop fuel despite concerted efforts to stop them, Tsukwam said in a statement. Tsukwam said firefighters had managed to put out the fire. Such accidents have become common in Africas largest oil producer, killing dozens of people in the country grappling with its worst cost of living crisis in a generation. The price of petrol in Nigeria has soared more than 400 since President Bola Tinubu scrapped a decades-old subsidy when he came into office in May 2023. Bologi Ibrahim, spokesperson to Niger state governor, said residents should give priority to their safety when petrol tanker trucks are involved in accidents. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Israeli PM says ceasefire will not start until Hamas releases hostage list",
        "date": "January 19, 2025 12:15 pm",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Gazas ceasefire, due to start at 0630 GMT on Sunday, will not begin until the Palestinian militant group Hamas provides a list of hostages to be released. Netanyahus announcement comes one hour before the ceasefire deadline. Hostages were expected to be released within hours of the start of the ceasefire, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East. The prime minister instructed the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) that the ceasefire, which is supposed to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., will not begin until Israel has the list of released abductees that Hamas has pledged to provide, his office said on Sunday. Hamas on Sunday affirmed its commitment to the Gaza ceasefire deal, saying the delay in disclosing the names of hostages to be released in first phase was due to technical field reasons. Israeli forces had started withdrawing from areas in Gazas Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza, pro-Hamas media reported early on Sunday. Israels military warned Gaza residents not to approach its troops or move around the Palestinian territory ahead of the ceasefire deadline, adding when movement is allowed a statement and instructions will be issued on safe transit methods. The ceasefire agreement followed months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The three-stage ceasefire will come into effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday. Its first stage will last six weeks, during which 33 of the remaining 98 hostages - women, children, men over 50, the ill and wounded - will be released in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. They include 737 male, female and teen-aged prisoners, some of whom are members of militant groups convicted of attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, as well as hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza in detention since the start of the war. Three female hostages are expected to be released on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross, in return for 30 prisoners each. After Sundays hostage release, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said, the accord calls for four more female hostages to be freed after seven days, followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days thereafter. During the first phase the Israeli army will pull back from some of its positions in Gaza and Palestinians displaced from areas in northern Gaza will be allowed to return. U.S. President Joe Bidens team worked closely with Trumps Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to push the deal over the line. As his inauguration approached, Trump had repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be hell to pay if the hostages were not released. Post-War Gaza? But what will come next in Gaza remains unclear in the absence of a comprehensive agreement on the postwar future of the enclave, which will require billions of dollars and years of work to rebuild. And although the stated aim of the ceasefire is to end the war entirely, it could easily unravel. Hamas, which has controlled Gaza for almost two decades, has survived despite losing its top leadership and thousands of fighters. Israel has vowed it will not allow Hamas to return to power and has cleared large stretches of ground inside Gaza, in a step widely seen as a move towards creating a buffer zone that will allow its troops to act freely against threats in the enclave. In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure that led to the deadliest single day in the countrys history. But hardliners in his government have already threatened to quit if war on Hamas is not resumed, leaving him pressed between Washingtons desire to see the war end, and his far-right political allies at home. And if war resumes, dozens of hostages could be left behind in Gaza. Mideast Shockwaves Outside Gaza, the war sent shockwaves across the region, triggering a war with the Tehran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement and bringing Israel into direct conflict with its arch-foe Iran for the first time. More than a year later, the Middle East has been transformed. Iran, which spent billions building up a network of militant groups around Israel, has seen its Axis of Resistance wrecked and was unable to inflict more than minimal damage on Israel in two major missile attacks. Hezbollah, whose huge missile arsenal was once seen as the biggest threat to Israel, has been humbled, with its top leadership killed and most of its missiles and military infrastructure destroyed. In the aftermath, the decades-long Assad regime in Syria was overturned, removing another major Iranian ally and leaving Israels military effectively unchallenged in the region. But on the diplomatic front, Israel has faced outrage and isolation over the death and devastation in Gaza. Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant on war crimes allegations and separate accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel has reacted with fury to both cases, rejecting the charges as politically motivated and accusing South Africa, which brought the original ICJ case as well as the countries that have joined it, of antisemitism. The war was triggered by Hamas Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed in combat in Gaza since. Israels 15-month campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health ministry figures, which do not distinguish between fighters and civilians, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble. Health officials say most of the dead are civilians. Israel says more than a third are fighters. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Gaza ceasefire begins after delay as Hamas names hostages to be released Sunday",
        "date": "January 19, 2025 04:00 pm",
        "content": "A long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza began after a three-hour delay as Hamas named the three female hostages it plans to free later on Sunday. Israel had vowed to keep fighting until it received the names, as the long and uncertain process aimed at ending the war got off to a bumpy start. Celebrations erupted across the war-ravaged territory and some Palestinians began returning to their homes despite the delay, which underscored the fragility of the agreement. The truce, which started at 11:15 a.m. local time, is a first step toward ultimately ending the conflict and returning nearly 100 hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Hamas had not lived up to its commitment to provide the names of the three hostages it was set to release in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners. The names of the three hostages had not been handed over when the deadline for the truce to begin passed at 8:30 a.m. local time. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the top Israeli military spokesman, said the army continues to attack and would until Hamas complies with the agreement. The military later said it had struck a number of militant targets in northern and central Gaza. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight people in the southern city of Khan Younis after the ceasefire was delayed. Nasser Hospital confirmed the casualties from Sundays strike, which it said had occurred around two hours after the truce was supposed to take effect. Gazas Health Ministry reported another three deaths from strikes on Sunday in Gaza City. Hamas had earlier blamed the delay in handing over the names on technical field reasons. It said in a statement that it is committed to the ceasefire deal announced last week. The party of Israels hard-line National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir meanwhile said its Cabinet ministers submitted their resignations from the government on Sunday in opposition to the ceasefire. The departure of the Jewish Power party weakens Netanyahus coalition but will not affect the ceasefire. In a separate development, Israel announced that it had recovered the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, in a special operation. The bodies of Shaul and another soldier, Hadar Goldin, remained in Gaza after the 2014 war and had not been returned despite a public campaign by their families. Delay underscores fragility of the agreement The planned ceasefire, agreed after a year of intensive mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, is the first step in a long and fragile process aimed at winding down the 15-month war. Netanyahu said he had instructed the military that the ceasefire will not begin until Israel has in its possession the list of hostages to be freed, which Hamas committed to provide. He had issued a similar warning the night before. The 42-day first phase of the ceasefire should see a total of 33 hostages returned from Gaza and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. Israeli forces should pull back into a buffer zone inside Gaza, and many displaced Palestinians should be able to return home. The devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. This is just the second ceasefire in the war, longer and more consequential than the weeklong pause over a year ago, with the potential to end the fighting for good. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this ceasefire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain, including whether the war will resume after the six-week first phase and how the rest of the nearly 100 hostages in Gaza will be freed. Palestinians celebrate despite delay Dozens of people took to the streets in Gazas southern city of Khan Younis to celebrate the ceasefire, according to an Associated Press reporter. Four masked and armed Hamas fighters arrived in two vehicles as the celebrations were underway, with people welcoming them and chanting slogans in support of the militant group. Gazas Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, held a parade in Gaza City, where the rescuers waved a Palestinian flag alongside other revelers, according to AP footage, which also showed a small group of people carrying the flags of Islamic Jihad, the second largest militant group after Hamas, which took part in the Oct. 7 attack. The Hamas-run police began deploying in public after mostly lying low due to Israeli airstrikes. Gaza City residents said they had seen them operating in parts of the city, and the AP reporter in Khan Younis saw a small number out on the streets. Palestinian residents began returning to their homes in parts of Gaza City early Sunday, even as tank shelling continued to the east, closer to the Israeli border, overnight. Families could be seen making their way back on foot, with their belongings loaded on donkey carts, residents said. The sound of shelling and explosions didnt stop, said Ahmed Matter, a Gaza City resident. He said he saw many families leaving their shelters and returning to their homes. People are impatient. They want this madness to end, he said. Israels Cabinet approved the ceasefire early Saturday in a rare session during the Jewish Sabbath, more than two days after mediators announced the deal. The warring sides were under pressure from both the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump to achieve a deal before the U.S. presidential inauguration on Monday. The toll of the war has been immense, and new details on its scope will now emerge. Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazas Health Ministry. The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war killed over 1,200. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died. Some 90 of Gazas population has been displaced. The United Nations says the health system, road network and other vital infrastructure have been badly damaged. Rebuilding  if the ceasefire reaches its final phase  will take several years at least. Major questions about Gazas future, political and otherwise, remain unresolved. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok goes dark as US ban takes effect",
        "date": "January 19, 2025 04:57 pm",
        "content": "Millions of TikTok users in the United States are no longer able to watch videos on the social media platform as a federal ban on the immensely popular app takes effect. The companys app was removed Saturday evening from prominent app stores, including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told users that the short-form video platform was no longer available. The blackout began just hours before the law took effect. Users opening the TikTok app on Saturday encountered a pop-up message preventing them from scrolling videos that read, Sorry, TikTok isnt available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S., the message said. Unfortunately that means you cant use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office, the notice continued, in a reference to President-elect Donald Trumps pledge to save the platform. The company told its users to stay tuned. The only option the message gives to U.S. users is to close the app or click another option leading them to the platforms website. There, users are shown the same message and given the option to download their data, an action TikTok previously said may take days to process. Before the announcement went out, TikTok said in another message to users that its service would be temporarily unavailable and the company was working to restore its U.S. service as soon as possible. But how long the platform will remain dark is unclear. Apple said in a statement on its website that TikTok and ByteDance apps were no longer available in the U.S., while visitors to the country could have limited access. Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates, the company said. If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they cant be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible, the statement said, adding that the change could impact performance, security and compatability with future versions of iOS and iPadOS. TikTok CEO Shou Chew posted a video thanking Trump for his commitment to work with the company to keep the app available in the U.S. and a strong stand for the first amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform. One who has used talk to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process, Chew said. In an interview with NBC News on Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said he was thinking about giving TikTok a 90-day extension that would allow them to continue operating. If such an extension happens, Trump  who once favored a TikTok ban  said it would probably be announced Monday, the day that he is sworn in as president. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is expected to attend Trumps inauguration with a prime seating location. In Washington, lawmakers and administration officials have long raised concerns about the app, which they see as a national security threat due to its Chinese ownership. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a technology company based in Beijing that operates the well-known video editing app CapCut and Lemon8, both of which were also unavailable for service Saturday evening. The federal law required ByteDance to cut ties with TikTok by Sunday or face a nationwide ban. The statute was passed by Congress in April after it was included as part of a high-priority 95 billion package that provided foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel. President Joe Biden quickly signed it, and then TikTok and ByteDance quickly sued on First Amendment grounds. While defending the law in court, the Biden administration argued it was concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of U.S. user data that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way thats difficult to detect. But to date, the U.S. has not publicly provided evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or tinkering with its algorithm to benefit Chinese interests. The Supreme Court unanimously decided on Friday the risk to national security posed by TikToks ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States. After TikToks service started going dark, some in China slammed the U.S. and accused it of suppressing the popular app. In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, Hu Xijin, a former editor-in-chief for the Chinese Communist Party-run newspaper Global Times, said TikToks announcement to halt services in America marks the darkest moment in the development of internet. A country that claims to have the most freedom of speech has carried out the most brutal suppression of an internet application, said Hu, who is now a political commentator. TikTok does not operate in China, where ByteDance instead offers Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijings strict censorship rules. After the court ruling, both White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the Biden administration would leave the laws implementation to President-elect Donald Trump given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect. But TikTok said on Friday evening it will be forced to go dark if the administration didnt provide a definitive statement to the companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, that deliver its service in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called TikToks demand a stunt and said there was no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office. But despite those statements from the administration, confusion lingered about what would happen until TikTok began blocking its service. Under the law, mobile app stores are barred from offering TikTok and internet hosting services are prohibited from delivering the service to American users. Violators could incur fines of up to 5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties the companies could face if they continue offering TikTok could total to a large sum. As its written, experts said the law does not require TikTok to take down its platform, so its unclear if the company voluntarily shut it down or was unable to continue the service alive after losing access support from its tech providers. The company did not respond to questions sent this week about its plans. The statue allows the sitting president to extend the deadline by 90 days if a sale is in progress. But no clear buyers have emerged, and ByteDance has previously said it wont sell TikTok. On Saturday, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance to create a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter. Perplexity is not asking to purchase the ByteDance algorithm that feeds TikTok users videos based on their interests and has made the platform such a phenomenon. Other investors have also been eyeing TikTok. Shark Tank star Kevin OLeary recently said a consortium of investors that he and billionaire Frank McCourt put together offered ByteDance 20 billion in cash. Trumps Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said last year that he was putting together an investor group to buy TikTok. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has reiterated his commitment to completely eliminating the corrupt politics in the country, as promised to the people. He made these comments delivering a strongly worded speech while addressing a public gathering in Katukurunda, Kalutara, today (19). The President participated in an interactive meeting held at the Pakistan Sports Ground in Wettumakada, Katukurunda, Kalutara. Speaking at the event, President Dissanayake emphasized his administrations no-nonsense approach to governance, stating: We took the oath of office on November 21 with a 21-member Cabinet. There are no state ministers. In the past, there were a number of ministers from Kalutara alone. While we have 8 MPs from Kalutara, only one of them holds a ministerial portfolio. This is because we dont believe in developing the country by granting benefits to ministers. In the past, the practice was different. Ministerial posts were a way to please certain individuals. It is only us who will create such a government. He also highlighted the irregularities in past appointments, saying: Previously, ministerial posts were shared among relatives. Family members were recruited into ministerial staff, with positions such as private secretary often given to spouses. I recall when Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had a staff comprised entirely of his own relatives. We have put an end to these practices. Today, there are no vehicle fleets or police escorts behind ministers. This policy applies not only to the government but also to the opposition. That is because the police force is short of 21,000 personnel. They are working with the greatest difficulties. The President further noted that, in the past, even military personnel were assigned to escort and serve high-profile individuals and their family members unnecessarily. Some used navy officers to help dress their wives. This is the kind of country that we have changes. Rs. 700 million was spent annually for the security of one former president. Thousands of police, military and STF personnel were assigned for their security. We have removed all of them and kept 60. If there are further complaints, we will remove the remaining 60 as well. We are no longer providing state-owned residences to any minister. We will also not provide housing to any former president. I will give it in writing that I do not require any house. But the others will not do so. Addressing the issue of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas official residence, President Dissanayake revealed: I personally commissioned the valuation of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas residence in Colombo through the Government Valuation department. We have only valuated the residence so far, without the land. According to the valuation, the monthly rent for the residence is Rs. 4.6 million. The land on Bauddhaloka Mawatha has not been valuated yet. According to the Constitution, a former president is entitled to a residence or a third of their salary. Therefore, we will take over the residence and provide a third of his salary, which amounts to Rs. 30,000. Or else he can pay the remaining amount and purchase it. If he does not pay the rest he has vacate the premises. This is the way forward. We must develop this country. Until now they have misled the public and lived luxuriously on public funds. He also announced plans to introduce a proposal to revoke MPs pensions: A proposal to abolish pensions for MPs will be submitted soon. Additionally, there has been a debate regarding the Parliament canteen. I will tell you what will happen in a week or two. If you want to buy food, you have to pay the right amount, and that will be done. The National Peoples Power government will not issue permits to MPs, he added.",

The ongoing investigation has revealed that the cause of the accident was careless driving by the bus driver. Serunuwara Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.",

        "date": "January 20, 2025 07:56 am",
        "content": "A fire tore through at least 18 temporary tents at a massive Hindu festival thronged by millions of people in Indias northern Prayagraj city, officials said Sunday. There were no injuries. The blaze was caused by the explosion of a gas cylinder and was contained by firefighters, police said. Images from the sprawling tent city at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers showed smoke billowing out as dozens of firefighters doused the blaze. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started last Monday and is the worlds largest religious gathering. At least 77 million people are attending and authorities expected more than 400 million in total over the next six weeks. Hindus believe that bathing at the confluence will cleanse them of their sins and release them from the cycle of rebirth. To accommodate tens of thousands of holy men, pilgrims and tourists visiting the festival, authorities have built a sprawling tent city on the riverbanks. Its equipped with 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 toilets and also has roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and crowd management. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok restores service for US users based on Trumps promised executive order",
        "date": "January 20, 2025 08:03 am",
        "content": "TikTok restored service to users in the United States on Sunday just hours after the popular video-sharing platform went dark in response to a federal ban, which President-elect Donald Trump said he would try to pause by executive order on his first day in office. Trump said he planned to issue the order to give TikToks China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer before the ban takes full effect. He announced the move on his Truth Social account as millions of U.S. TikTok users awoke to discover they could no longer access the TikTok app or platform. But by Sunday afternoon, a message greeted those who signed on thanking them  and the president-elect  for their support. As a result of President Trumps efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.! the message read. TikTok said it shut down the platform late Saturday because of a federal law that required parent company ByteDance to sell its U.S. operation by Sunday. Google and Apple also removed TikTok from their digital stores. The law, which passed with wide bipartisan support in April, allows for steep fines. While the company that runs TikTok in the U.S. said on X that the steps Trump outlined Sunday provided the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties, the TikTok app remained remained unavailable for download in Apple and Googles app stores. It was a brilliant marketing stunt for both TikTok and incoming president Donald Trump, Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with market research firm Emarketer, said. By abruptly shutting off service, TikTok proved how unpopular the ban was among its users. The law that took effect Sunday required ByteDance to cut ties with the platforms U.S. operations due to national security concerns. However, the statute authorized the sitting president to grant a 90-day extension if a viable sale was underway. Although investors made some offers, ByteDance has said it would not sell. Trump said his order would extend the period of time before the laws prohibitions take effect and confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. It wasnt immediately clear how Trumps promised action would fare from a legal standpoint since the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ban on Friday and the statute came into force the day before Trumps return to the White House. Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin and the bills author, said on Fox News Sunday that there is no extension for TikTok. Let me tell you, as the person who wrote the bill, the extension was within the 270-day window, which closed at 12:01 a.m. this morning, he said, adding that only if the president certifies there are legally binding documents showing a divestiture is on the way would there be an extension. I think Trump can at least make an argument that the language is meant to cover any president, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said. Some lawmakers who voted for the sale-or-ban law, including some of Trumps fellow Republicans, remain in favor of it. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas warned companies Sunday not to provide TikTok with technical support. Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, Cotton wrote on X. Think about it. Constitutional and business law attorney Kirk McGill said he thinks Trump lacks the legal authority to suspend the ban but its unlikely the question would reach a court in the time it might take TikTok to find a buyer. Its also unlikely that Apple or Google will face legal consequences if they move forward with Trumps demands, given that his administration would have to initiate any prosecutions, McGill said. In the next week or two, before the courts have the chance to do anything, this is certainly going to be a political fight, not a legal one, McGill said. TikTok shuts off  but only temporarily? The on-and-off availability of TikTok came after the Supreme Court ruled that the risk to national security posed by TikToks ties to China outweighed concerns about limiting speech by the app or its millions of U.S. users. When TikTok users in the U.S. tried to watch or post videos on the platform as of Saturday night, they saw a pop-up message under the headline, Sorry, TikTok isnt available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S., the message said. Unfortunately that means you cant use TikTok for now. The app was removed late Saturday from prominent app stores and remained so as of Sunday afternoon. Apple told customers it also took down other apps developed by ByteDance. They included Lemon8, which some influencers had promoted as a TikTok alternative, the popular video editing app CapCut and photo editor Hypic. Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates, the company said. Google declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the days developments. Experts had said the law as written did not require TikTok to take down its platform, only for app stores to remove it. Current users expected to continue to have access to videos until a lack of updates caused the app to stop working. After TikTok was back online Sunday, content creator Tiffany Watson, 20, said she was pretty hopeful it would stay up. At the same time, Watson said her dedication solely to the platform declined during the months the threat of a ban loomed. Overall, I hope that creators will succeed and find community in spite of the unpredictability of TikTok, she said. Will the bans timing help TikTok? Trumps plan to spare TikTok on his first day in office reflected the bans coincidental timing and the unusual mix of political considerations surrounding a social media platform that first gained popularity with often silly videos featuring dances and music clips. During his first presidential term, Trump in 2020 issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat, moves that courts subsequently blocked. Trump has since credited TikTok with helping him win support from young voters in last years presidential election. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is expected to attend Trumps inauguration with a prime seating location. Trumps choice for national security adviser, Michael Waltz, told CBS News on Sunday that the president-elect discussed TikTok during a weekend call with Chinese President Xi Jinping and they agreed to work together on this. The Biden administration has also stressed in recent days that it did not intend to implement or enforce the ban before Trump takes office on Monday. Who are possible buyers of TikTok? ByteDance has publicly insisted it would not sell TikTok, and no likely buyer has emerged. On Saturday, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance to create a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikToks U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter. Perplexity is not asking to purchase the ByteDance algorithm that feeds TikTok users videos based on their interests. In Washington, lawmakers and administration officials have long warned that the algorithm is vulnerable to manipulation by China. To date, the U.S. has not publicly provided evidence of TikTok providing user data to Chinese authorities or tinkering with the algorithm to benefit Chinese interests. Another unknown is whether Trump will remain a TikTok fan. Hes flip-flopped on his stance toward TikTok before, and theres no guarantee he wont do so again, EMarketers Enberg said.

        "title": "Israel frees 90 Palestinian prisoners as ceasefire takes hold after Hamas returns 3 Israeli hostages",
        "date": "January 20, 2025 09:02 am",
        "content": "The first three hostages were released from Gaza and the first Palestinian prisoners were freed from Israeli custody as the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold following 15 months of war, with mixed emotions and more difficult steps ahead over the next six weeks. Palestinians across Gaza began making their way home, and the first trucks with a surge of humanitarian aid began to enter the devastated territory. The ceasefire that began on Sunday morning raises hopes for ending the devastating conflict and returning the nearly 100 remaining hostages abducted in Hamas Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But major questions remain about whether fighting will resume after the six-week first phase. First came the release of Emily Damari, 28; Romi Gonen, 24, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, in a tense handover to the Red Cross on a Gaza City street. Footage showed them surrounded by a crowd of thousands, accompanied by masked, armed men wearing green Hamas headbands. The women were taken to Israeli forces and then into Israel, where they hugged family members fiercely and wept. Damari was shown raising her bandaged hand in triumph. The military said she lost two fingers in the Oct. 7 attack. In Tel Aviv, thousands of people who gathered to watch the news on large screens erupted in applause. For months, many had gathered in the square weekly to demand a ceasefire deal. An entire nation embraces you, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Over seven hours later, the first Palestinian prisoners were released. They had been detained for what Israel called offenses related to its security, from throwing stones to more serious accusations such as attempted murder. Israels military, which occupies the West Bank, warned Palestinians against public celebration  the release took place after 1 a.m.  but crowds thronged the buses after they left the prison, some people climbing on top or waving flags, including those of Hamas. There were fireworks and whistles, and shouts of God is great. Those released were hoisted onto others shoulders or embraced. The most prominent detainee freed was Khalida Jarrar, 62, a member of a secular leftist faction that was involved in attacks against Israel in the 1970s but later scaled back militant activities. Since her arrest in late 2023, she was held under indefinitely renewable administrative detention orders that were criticized by human rights groups. The next release of hostages and prisoners is due on Saturday, with 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be freed over the ceasefires 42-day first phase. In just over two weeks, talks are to begin on the far more challenging second phase. This is just the second ceasefire in the war, longer and more consequential than a weeklong pause in November 2023, with the potential to end the fighting for good. But Netanyahu, who had been under pressure from both the Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump to achieve a deal before Mondays U.S. inauguration, has said he has Trumps backing to continue fighting if necessary. Meanwhile, Israels hard-line national security minister said his Jewish Power faction was quitting the government in protest over the ceasefire, reflecting the political friction that some Israelis said delayed a deal. Itamar Ben-Gvirs departure weakens Netanyahus coalition but will not affect the truce. Joy mixed with pain Across Gaza, there was relief and grief. The fighting has killed tens of thousands, destroyed large areas and displaced most of the population. This ceasefire was a joy mixed with pain, because my son was martyred in this war, said Rami Nofal, a displaced man from Gaza City. Masked militants appeared at some celebrations, where crowds chanted slogans in support of them, according to Associated Press reporters in Gaza. The Hamas-run police began deploying in public after mostly lying low due to Israeli airstrikes. In the southern city of Rafah, residents returned to find massive destruction. Some found human remains in the rubble, including skulls. Its like you see in a Hollywood horror movie, resident Mohamed Abu Taha said as he inspected the ruins of his familys home. Already, Israeli forces were pulling back from areas. Residents of Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya in northern Gaza told the AP they didnt see Israeli troops there. One resident said they saw bodies in the streets that appeared to have been there for weeks. Israelis divided over deal In Israel, people remained divided over the agreement. Asher Pizem, 35, from the city of Sderot, said the deal had merely postponed the next confrontation with Hamas. He also criticized Israel for allowing aid into Gaza, saying it would contribute to the militant groups revival. They will take the time and attack again, he said while viewing Gazas smoldering ruins from a small hill in southern Israel with other Israelis gathered there. When President Joe Biden was asked Sunday whether he has any concerns about Hamas regrouping, he said no. Immense toll The toll of the war has been immense, and new details will now emerge. The head of the Rafah municipality in Gaza, Ahmed al-Sufi, said a large part of the infrastructure, including water, electricity and road networks, was destroyed, in addition to thousands of homes. There should be a surge of humanitarian aid, with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza daily, far more than Israel allowed before. The U.N. humanitarian agency said more than 630 trucks with aid entered on Sunday, with at least 300 going to hard-hit northern Gaza. This is a moment of tremendous hope, humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said. Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants abducted around 250 others. More than 100 hostages were freed during the weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Some 90 of Gazas population has been displaced. Rebuilding  if the ceasefire reaches its final phase  will take several years at least. Major questions about Gazas future, political and otherwise, remain unresolved. Source: AP --Agencies",

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) reported that the Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.2 in December, while the Services PMI reached 71.1. In its statement on the Sri Lankan PMI, the Central Bank explained that the increase in the Manufacturing PMI which rose to 57.2 in December 2024 from 53.3 a month earlier was primarily driven by higher production orders during the festive season, particularly in the food and beverage manufacturing sector. However, new orders and production in the textile and apparel sectors decreased on a month-on-month basis due to a drop in orders from key garment export destinations during the seasonal winter holidays. The CBSL also noted that expectations for manufacturing activities over the next three months point to further improvement, with an optimistic outlook for better economic conditions. Meanwhile, the PMI for the services sector indicated that expansion in December reached 71.1 from 60.5, driven by significant growth in business activities across most sectors. The CBSL highlighted that wholesale and retail trade saw strong growth during the festive season and the peak of the tourist season. Additionally, business activities in the financial services sector improved substantially, driven by an increase in lending activities. The CBSL further noted that expectations for business activities over the next three months remain positive, albeit at a slower pace, supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions.",

        "content": "With projections indicating historically high levels of inflows from the services trade and workers remittances, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) plans to capitalize on market opportunities through diversified strategies across various markets. These initiatives include establishing a new investment tranche leveraging advanced portfolio management strategies. Additionally, the CBSL projects that the country is likely to record a current account deficit in 2025, driven by increased economic activity and underscores the importance of maintaining the external current account at sustainable levels over the medium term. In its policy agenda for 2025, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka highlighted that the near completion of the governments external debt restructuring and the progress achieved under the IMF-EFF programme have created a robust foundation for boosting investor confidence and ensuring external sector stability. The regulator noted that the country has consistently recorded a current account surplus over the past two years, in 2023 and 2024. However, as economic activity gains momentum, the external current account is projected to register a deficit in 2025. CBSL emphasized the importance of maintaining the external current account at sustainable levels over the medium term. The report also projected a gradual recovery in import expenditure, driven in part by the governments planned relaxation of vehicle import restrictions in 2025. Inflows from the services trade and workers remittances are expected to reach historically high levels, supporting the external current account. The Central Bank stated its commitment to increasing external buffers and expanding reserve management activities through market diversification strategies. These efforts include the establishment of a new investment tranche utilizing advanced portfolio management strategies. The CBSL will prioritize strengthening risk mitigation measures to safeguard foreign reserve investments. Also, the CBSL said that the International Transactions Reporting System which is in operation since early 2024 will be used to improve the data quality and coverage of the financial account of the Balance of Payment, facilitating policy analysis and planning related to foreign exchange flows.",

        "date": "January 20, 2025 11:27 am",
        "content": "Instagram has rolled out a number of updates in recent days that appear to be aimed at attracting TikTok users while the short-video apps future remains in limbo. And on Sunday, Instagram parent company Meta went one step further and announced the launch of a new video creation app on Sunday called Edits, which bears an uncanny resemblance to CapCut, the app owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance that many creators use to make TikTok videos. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said on Friday that Instagrams profile photo grids will now display images as rectangles, rather than the apps signature squares  a layout thats notably similar to how profile pages look on TikTok. On Saturday, Mosseri said Instagram will increase the maximum length for Reels videos from 90 seconds to three minutes  following the lead of TikTok, which began pushing users to post longer videos in 2023. Weve historically only allowed reels up to 90 seconds given our focus on short-form video, but weve heard the feedback that this is just too short for those who want to share longer stories, Mosseri said Saturday in an Instagram post. And on Sunday, in an Instagram video about the new Edits app, Mosseri said, there is a lot going on in the world right now and no matter what happens, we think its our job to create the most compelling creative tools for those of you who make videos for not just Instagram but platforms out there. The updates could mark an effort to attract users to spend more time on the platform amid uncertainty over the future of TikTok. TikTok, as well as CapCut, shut down access for US users Saturday night, hours before a law that was set to ban it went into effect. But if Instagram was hoping it would score some new users during the TikTok shutdown, those hopes were quickly dashed. Trump on Sunday pledged to issue an executive order to restore access to TikTok, and the app would later come back online. Metas announcement about Edits  which is available in the app stores as of Sunday but wont be functional until February  came hours after TikTok restored access for US users. Instagram did not respond to CNNs request for comment on the changes. Since it gained popularity in 2020, TikTok has posed a major competitive threat to Instagram  drawing away users attention and time and forcing the older app to rework its algorithm. Instagram first launched Reels in the United States in August 2020, days after former- and now incoming-President Donald Trump announced plans to ban TikTok in the country. And even if TikTok had stayed offline for longer, users may not necessarily have turned to Instagram. In the week leading up to the shutdown, other TikTok alternatives  including another China-owned app called RedNote  surged in popularity, while downloads of Instagram ticked up only slightly.

        "date": "January 20, 2025 11:29 am",
        "content": "Move over billionaires. The first trillionaires are on their way. Five people are expected to amass at least 1 trillion in wealth within the next decade, if current trends continue, according to Oxfams annual inequality report, released Sunday. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, currently the worlds richest person worth more than 430 billion, should cross the mark in just under five years. He will soon be joined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and family. The Oxfam report, which draws on data compiled by Forbes, is timed to coincide with the kickoff of the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, an elite gathering of some of the richest people and world leaders. Its release also comes the day before billionaire President-elect Donald Trumps inauguration. 2024 was a very lucrative year for the worlds wealthiest individuals and families, fueled in part by a soaring US stock market, Oxfam found. Their net worth expanded so quickly that Oxfam revised its estimate from last year that only one trillionaire would be crowned in the next decade. Thats an unimaginable amount, Rebecca Riddell, senior policy lead at Oxfam America, said of 1 trillion. This extreme inequality is nothing to celebrate. The ranks of the billionaire class last year grew by just over 200 to nearly 2,770 people. Their wealth skyrocketed by 2.1 trillion  three times faster than the year before  to a total of 15 trillion. In the United States alone, where 816 billionaires reside, the net worth of this group soared by 1.4 trillion. Whats more, if any of the 10 richest men lost 99 of his wealth, hed still be a billionaire, Oxfam found. Meanwhile, the number of people living in poverty is roughly the same as it was in 1990, according to the report, citing World Bank data. Inherited wealth This years Oxfam report, titled Takers not Makers, also points out that more than one-third of billionaires wealth stems from inheritance. In 2023, more billionaires amassed their wealth through inheritance than through entrepreneurship for the first time. Plus, all of the 17 billionaires under 30 had their fortunes passed down to them. This transfer of assets is aided by the fact that two-thirds of countries dont tax inheritances to direct descendants, Riddell said. And in the United States, the estate tax has been gutted by tax cuts and strategies to dodge it. Unchecked, were about to see the biggest transfer of generational wealth in human history  hardly earned and hardly taxed, unless we take action, she said, adding that Oxfam is calling on governments to ensure that the rich and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Growing political power The wealthy are also increasingly exerting influence over politics. Case in point, Oxfam says, is the incoming Trump administration. It is stocked with nearly a dozen people worth at least 1 billion on their own or with their spouses, making it one of the richest in history. Musk, who pumped more than 260 million into Trumps 2024 campaign, is serving as a prominent advisor to the president-elect and is co-leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and the immense influence he has over policy and politics is really emblematic of the unchecked billionaire power thats come to define our economic and political system, Riddell said. In his farewell address from the Oval Office last week, President Joe Biden warned of the concentration of power among a very few ultra-wealthy people. Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead, he said.

The Capital One Arena in Washington will host a live viewing of the ceremony - due to start at 5pm UK time - as well as the Presidential Parade. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and past presidents will attend the swearing-in ceremony - but notably Barack Obamas wife Michelle will be absent with no explanation offered. Mr Trump has invited several world leaders, including Chinas Xi Jinping, Argentinas Javier Milei, and Italys Giorgia Meloni, to his inauguration - the first president-elect to do so. Several high-profile tech bros will also be in attendance including Mr Trumps close confidante Elon Musk, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, and TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew - fresh from the US ban which saw the app shut for several hours before the president-elect said he would stall the ban. Mr Trump also promised to sign close to 100 executive orders on his first day in office and said he would ensure that the curtain closes on four long years of American decline. He added: Were going to give them the best first day, the biggest first week and the most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history. This evening will end with a series of inaugural balls across Washington DC. Todays swearing-in ceremony will stand in stark contrast to Mr Bidens in 2021. Then, security was beefed up after the January 6 unrest around two weeks earlier, and the COVID-19 pandemic drastically limited crowd sizes. US officials have said they are not anticipating any major disruptions or protests on inauguration day. But they are operating in a heightened threat environment due to the New Years terror attack in New Orleans. The District of Columbia National Guard will deploy roughly 7,800 soldiers for security, which includes traffic control and patrolling underground stations. Thousands of federal agents, police and other law enforcement officials will also be on hand. Source: Sky News --Agencies",

        "title": "Biden issues preemptive pardons for Trump critics and Biden family members",
        "date": "January 20, 2025 10:37 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on Monday issued an extraordinary slate of preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump and members of his own family, using executive prerogative as a shield against revenge by his incoming successor while also guaranteeing his closest relatives arent subject to future prosecutions. Clemency for Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and members of Congress who served on the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, was announced early Monday morning. Later, minutes before Trump was to be inaugurated as the nations 47th president, Biden also issued pardons for members of his family. The pardons, coming in the final hours of Bidens presidency, amount to a stunning flex of presidential power that is unprecedented in recent presidential history. They serve to protect several outspoken critics of the incoming president, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom Trump has vowed retribution against. But they also protect his close family members and potentially establish a precedent the new president will use to protect his own allies from criminal prosecution. My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt methe worst kind of partisan politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end, Biden said in a statement released as the inauguration ceremony was underway at the US Capitol. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finances, the outgoing president said. A statement earlier in the day said Biden in good conscience could not stand aside with the threat of reprisals by the incoming president against his adversaries. These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing, Biden wrote in a statement about the initial batch of pardons, issued hours before he was set to welcome Trump to the White House for tea before attending his swearing-in. Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Biden: Protection outweighs implication Biden had been weighing issuing the pardons in the waning days of his presidency, concerned Trump would enter office and immediately seek to prosecute his adversaries. In his statement, he spelled out his rationale, saying alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties. The recipients of Bidens pardons have all faced intense criticism from Trump and his allies. Fauci served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Disease for decades, including during the outbreak of Covid in Trumps first presidency, and Milley served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Trumps first term and has warned Trump is a fascist. Biden, in his statement, noted that the pardons did not denote guilt. The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country, he wrote. As he weighed preemptive pardons over the past several days, the president has made clear in conversations with aides that he does not believe those who received them were guilty of any crimes  and voiced concern that pardoning them could connote guilt, according to people familiar with the conversations. Ultimately, Biden put aside those concerns with the view that providing protection would outweigh the potential implication of guilt. In doing so, he is taking a step thats unprecedented in presidential history. Preemptive pardons on such a sweeping scale have never previously been issued. When President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, the 37th president was facing a real threat of prosecution. None of those on Bidens list appeared at risk of imminent legal action, but Biden believed the threat was real enough that protection was necessary. Lawmakers stunned, pardonees grateful Multiple members of Congress who served on the committee investigating the attack on the Capitol were stunned to learn of the decision, according to multiple sources. They did not receive a heads-up that it was happening and one person said they still do not even know what the pardon is for, the sources said. Taylor Budowich, Trumps incoming deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, said that Bidens pardons will go down as the greatest attack on Americas justice system in history. With the stroke of a pen, he unilaterally shielded a group of political cronies from the scales of justice. This is yet another dangerous and unreversible erosion of American norms, Budowich posted to X. In a statement to CNN, Milley said he and his family were deeply grateful for Bidens action. After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights, Milley said. I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety. Former Capitol Hill police officer Harry Dunn expressed his thanks to Biden for the decision. I am eternally grateful to President Joe Biden, not just for this preemptive pardon, but for his leadership and service to this nation, especially over the last four years. I wish this pardon werent necessary, but unfortunately, the political climate we are in now has made the need for one somewhat of a reality. I, like all of the other public servants, was just doing my job and upholding my oath, and I will always honor that. Fauci added that he was very appreciative of the preemptive pardon, though he didnt ask for it. As (Biden) said, we did nothing wrong, but the baseless accusations and threats are real for me and my family, Fauci said. Several former DOJ officials who served during the Biden administration expressed skepticism over Bidens preemptive pardons, saying they ultimately may not be effective protective tools and could usher in a new era of presidential pardons. The recipients could now become targets of other probes, another former official said. Some of those who were issued the last-minute pardons did not get a heads up, a person familiar told CNN. Biden said Trumps rhetoric weighed on his decision Earlier this month, the president told reporters one factor weighing in his decision is whether Trump telegraphed any of his intentions for possible prosecution of his political opponents in the days leading up to his inauguration. It depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcasts in the last couple of days here as to what hes going to do, the president said when asked about what pardons and commutations hes considering. The idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy as it related to his well-being is outrageous, Biden said. But theres still consideration of some folks, but no decision. In an interview with USA Today, Biden said he told Trump during their Oval Office meeting shortly after the president-elects November victory that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores. Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff have said they do not want preemptive pardons. Jesse Binnall, one of Trumps primary private attorneys working on lawsuits related to January 6, pointed out on social media a major reason the legal community was skeptical of Bidens preemptive pardons before Monday: It makes it easier to force testimony. The pardons are actually great news. No one who was just pardoned will be able to refuse to testify in a civil, criminal, or congressional proceeding based upon the 5th Amendment, Binnall wrote. The pardons also wont protect those who received them from congressional investigation, or other types of investigation, such as tax inquiry, if those were to arise. The pardons would only protect them from federal criminal charges. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Donald Trump sworn in as 47th US President in Capitol ceremony",
        "date": "January 20, 2025 10:42 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, promising a revolution of common sense and taking charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the countrys institutions. Trump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, will act swiftly after the ceremony, with executive orders already prepared for his signature to clamp down on border crossings, increase fossil fuel development and end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. Declaring that government faces a crisis of trust, Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. Trump claimed a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, promising to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. He added: From this moment on, Americas decline is over. The executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. Frigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trumps swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda  the first time that has happened in 40 years  and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities. At the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath. A cadre of billionaires and tech titans  including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai  were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trumps incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the worlds richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees. Trump began the day with a prayer service at St. Johns Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Bidens victory or attend his inauguration. Welcome home, Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol. Trumps inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the countrys tradition of the peaceful transfer of power. But Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration. I am ready for a new United States, said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Trump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, We will strive together to make his dream a reality, and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November. Now Trump is the first person convicted of a felony  for falsifying business records related to hush money payments  to serve as president. He pledged to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. Hes said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot. Eight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats climate and social initiatives. He has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration. With minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats and that he has no reason to believe these attacks will end. Earlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trumps anger. Biden said these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing. Trump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the countrys political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump. Democrats who once formed a resistance are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests. Long skeptical of American alliances, Trumps America First foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russias invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas. Also present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress. Trump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border  again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. Hes expected to take additional actions  including constitutionally questionable ones  such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S. Trump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution. Others orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Bidens recent directive on artificial intelligence. More changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff. With control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Bidens policies and institute their own priorities.

        "content": "While highlighting plans to embark on an official visit to the Middle East in February, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake outlined that the discussions will aim to bolster Sri Lankas energy and economic sectors. Speaking at a public meeting, the President detailed ongoing discussions regarding the import of petroleum and the establishment of an oil refinery in collaboration with India. Highlighting plans for an oil refinery, the President revealed that the project would be developed in partnership with India, with aspirations of exporting petroleum globally. We will join hands with the Indian company and build an oil refinery, the President stated.  We will refine the oil and store it in these warehouses and sell it to the world. He also briefed on the agreement with India to construct the Sampur power plant. The ownership of the power plant is 50 to 50. Earlier, electricity was to be provided at USD 07 cents per unit. We concluded negotiations to buy it at USD 5.97 cents. Now we are building that power plant, he noted. The President further elaborated on the status of the 99 oil tanks in Trincomalee. We took 24 tanks and gave 14 to the IOC, leaving 61 more oil tanks, he said, emphasizing the strategic importance of these facilities for the proposed refinery. Commenting on fuel prices, the President acknowledged that while diesel prices have fallen below Rs. 300 under his administration, further reductions are not immediately feasible on a monthly basis due to financial constraints. The Petroleum Corporation owes Rs. 900 billion. The debt is paid on the basis of each liter of fuel sold. The excise duty will be removed once the debt is paid, he explained. Non-Refundable Loan from China The President also highlighted ongoing infrastructure projects supported by China, including the construction of a conference hall in the Colombo Port City, financed through a grant of USD 1.2 million, and an oil refinery in Hambantota. Anti-Corruption Addressing concerns over corruption, President Dissanayake assured the public that legal action against alleged wrongdoers is progressing. The work has now started. Cases are being filed vigorously, he stated. Previously, the files were hidden in the Attorney Generals Department. Cases are being filed quickly, dont worry. Several cases will be concluded by the end of January, he added.",

        "content": "The United States will exit the World Health Organization, President Donald Trump said on Monday, saying the global health agency had mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic and other international health crises. Trump said the WHO had failed to act independently from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states and required unfairly onerous payments from the U.S. that are disproportionate to the sums provided by other, larger countries, such as China. World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. Its not going to happen anymore, Trump said at the signing. The move means the U.S. will leave the United Nations health agency in 12 months time and stop all financial contributions to its work. The United States is by far the WHOs biggest financial backer, contributing around 18 of its overall funding. WHOs most recent two-year budget, for 2024-2025, was 6.8 billion. Trumps withdrawal from the WHO is not unexpected. He took steps to quit the body in 2020, during his first term as president, accusing the WHO of aiding Chinas efforts to mislead the world about the origins of COVID. WHO vigorously denies the allegation and says it continues to press Beijing to share data to determine whether COVID emerged from human contact with infected animals or due to research into similar viruses in a domestic laboratory.

        "date": "January 21, 2025 11:29 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol four years ago as he moved swiftly to impose his will on the U.S. government just hours after reclaiming the presidency on Monday. After a day of ceremony, Trump signed a series of executive actions to curb immigration and roll back environmental regulations and racial and gender diversity initiatives. He did not take immediate action to raise tariffs, a key campaign promise, but said he could impose 25 duties on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. His decision to pardon supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is sure to enrage police, lawmakers and others whose lives were put at risk during an unprecedented episode in modern U.S. history. Roughly 140 police officers were assaulted during the attack, with some sprayed with chemical irritants and others struck with pipes, poles and other weapons. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. Trump ordered 14 leaders of the far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys militant groups, who were serving long prison sentences, released from prison early, but left their convictions intact. Earlier in the day, Trump, 78, took the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, where a mob of his supporters had rampaged on Jan. 6 in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. At the ceremony, Trump portrayed himself as a savior chosen by God to rescue a faltering nation. His inauguration amounts to a triumphant return for a political disruptor who survived two assassination attempts and won election despite a criminal conviction and a prosecution stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. I was saved by God to make America great again, he said. Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a second term after losing the White House and the first felon to occupy the White House. The oldest president ever to be sworn in, he is backed by Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Trump moved quickly to clamp down on illegal immigration, a signature issue since he first entered politics in 2015. Shortly after he took the oath of office, U.S. border authorities shut down a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. legally by scheduling an appointment through a smartphone. Existing appointments were canceled. Nearly 1,660 Afghans who had been cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S., including family members of active-duty U.S. military personnel, were having their flights canceled under a Trump order suspending U.S. refugee programs, a U.S. official and a leading refugee resettlement advocate said on Monday. BORDER EMERGENCY DECLARED, CLIMATE DEAL NIXED At the White House, Trump signed an order that declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which would unlock funding and allow him to dispatch troops there. He signed an order that would end a policy that confers citizenship to those born in the United States, which is certain to trigger a lengthy court fight. Another executive order designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Trump once again withdrew the United States from the Paris climate deal, removing the worlds biggest historic emitter from global efforts to fight climate change for the second time in a decade. Were getting rid of all the cancer ... caused by the Biden administration, Trump said as he signed a stack of executive orders in the Oval Office. Other orders revoked Biden administration policies governing artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. He also imposed a freeze on federal hiring and ordered government workers to return to the office, rather than working from home. He also signed paperwork to create a Department of Government Efficiency, an outside advisory board headed by billionaire Elon Musk that aims to cut large swaths of government spending. In the State Department, more than a dozen nonpartisan senior diplomats were asked to resign as part of a broader plan to replace nonpartisan civil servants with loyalists. He also said he would issue orders to scrap federal diversity programs and require the government to recognize only genders assigned at birth. While Trump sought to portray himself as a peacemaker and unifier during his half-hour speech, his tone was often sharply partisan. He repeated false claims from his campaign that other countries were emptying their prisons into America and voiced familiar grievances over his criminal prosecutions. With Biden seated nearby, Trump issued a stinging indictment of his predecessors policies from immigration to foreign affairs. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people, Trump said. Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration - including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg - had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trumps family. Trump said he would send astronauts to Mars, prompting Musk - who has long talked about colonizing the planet - to raise his fists. Trump vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and repeated his intention to take back control of the Panama Canal, one of several foreign policy pronouncements that have caused consternation among U.S. allies. RETURN TO POWER Trump took the oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the U.S. Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET (1701 GMT), administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him. Outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, was seated next to Biden in a section with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, sat with her husband Bill. Obamas wife, Michelle, chose not to attend. The ceremony was moved indoors due to the extreme cold gripping much of the country. Trump skipped Bidens inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged. Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has threatened with retaliation, including General Mark Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who Trump has suggested should be executed for holding back-channel talks with China. Milleys portrait was removed from the Pentagon shortly after Trumps inauguration. He also pardoned five family members minutes before leaving office, citing fears that Trump would target them.

        "content": "Vice President for South Asia at the World Bank Martin Raiser stated that the organization is committed to providing financial and technical assistance for Sri Lankas key government projects. This statement was made during a meeting between President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and representatives of the World Bank held today (21) at the Presidential Secretariat, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. During the discussion, consensus was reached to extend financial and technical support for programs aimed at generating employment for youth, the Clean Sri Lanka project, poverty alleviation in rural areas, and digital transformation projects. New projects in the areas of education, energy, digitalization, and Northern development were also discussed for potential support, the statement mentioned. Mr. Martin Raiser has also assured that the World Bank would ensure the timely disbursement of approved financial assistance for Sri Lanka. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that rural poverty could be alleviated by developing the education sector.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also revealed plans for the rapid development of ports and airports and stated that the government is focused on speeding up port development initiatives. Special attention is being directed toward Northern development, with plans to establish three investment zones in the Northern Province. The President added that efforts are underway to enhance tourism in the north, improve water facilities, and address the social issues of the Northern population while preserving their cultural identity, according to the PMD. The meeting was attended by Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando; Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; World Bank Regional Country Director for Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, David Sislen; the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Gevorg Sargsyan; and the Vice Presidents Special Assistant, Kishan Abeygunawardena.",

        "date": "January 21, 2025 07:05 pm",
        "content": "A fire at a ski resort hotel in Turkeys Bolu mountains killed 66 people on Tuesday and forced panicked guests to jump out of windows in the middle of the night. Some 51 people were also injured, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said at the Kartalkaya ski resort in northwest Turkey. The fire began around 3:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) on the restaurant floor of the 12-storey Grand Kartal Hotel, authorities said. Several fire engines and ambulances surrounded the charred, wood-fronted building, with white bed sheets tied together and dangling from one upper-floor window where people tried to flee. Baris Salgur, a hotel guest, told broadcaster NTV that people jumped from windows to escape, including two women on the top floor who urged those on the ground to ready pillows. When the fire got close they jumped right away, he said. Another guest told Ekol TV that he and his family woke up to the fire but did not hear alarms, then entered smoke-filled corridors and eventually jumped from a lower-floor window onto snow below. Yerlikaya said there were 238 guests at the hotel lying at the base of several ski slopes. It was still smouldering in the afternoon. I would like to share this pain, which is impossible to describe, he said in offering condolences. The fire has now been extinguished. Cooling efforts are ongoing. Since the back of the hotel is on a slope, fire extinguishing efforts could only be carried out from the front and side facades. He added that fire crews began battling the blaze about 45 minutes after the first call. An investigation was underway into the fire, which coincided with school holidays when many families from nearby Istanbul and Ankara head to the Bolu mountains to ski. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
