        "content": "The high-level Indo-Lanka bilateral discussions, with the participation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake along with their respective delegations, were held at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, a short while ago. Modi held a restricted level talks with Sri Lankan President Dissanayake at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo today, shortly after being accorded a historic ceremonial welcome at Independence Square - the first time Sri Lanka has honoured a visiting leader in this manner. The meeting marks a key moment in PM Modis ongoing three-day visit, which aims to strengthen bilateral ties under the shared vision of Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future. The ceremonial welcome earlier in the day, led by President Dissanayake, reflected the significance Colombo places on the India-Sri Lanka relationship. PM Modis arrival on Friday marked his first visit to Sri Lanka since 2019 and comes amid a renewed regional focus on development partnerships and cultural exchange. PM Modi is on a three-day visit to Sri Lanka, which began yesterday after he attended the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok. India and Sri Lanka are set to sign a major Defence cooperation pact during Prime Minister Narendra Modis ongoing visit to Colombo, aimed at strengthening bilateral ties. The agreements, including a Defence pact, come as part of a broader effort to bolster economic, energy, and digital cooperation between the two countries. During the visit, India and Sri Lanka are expected to sign eight memoranda of understanding (MoUs) covering several key sectors, including Defence, health, energy, and digitalisation. Notably, one of the MoUs will focus on supplying Sri Lanka with more affordable energy, a much-needed support amid the countrys ongoing economic challenges. In addition to the Defence pact, the visit will include high-level discussions on restructuring Sri Lankas debt, enhancing bilateral connectivity, and further cooperation across various domains. PM Modis visit is expected to significantly boost diplomatic relations between the two nations. Modi is also scheduled to meet other political leaders of the nation before travelling to Anuradhapura with Dissanayake for the inauguration of development projects implemented with Indian financial assistance on Sunday. In Anuradhapura, both leaders will pay respect at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex in Anuradhapura. PM Modi had also visited the temple, which holds a special significance in India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership, during his visit to the country in 2015. Prime Minister Modi then visited Sri Lanka again in 2019. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "date": "April 5, 2025 12:43 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake today virtually witnessed the commencement of several key Indo-Lanka joint projects. The projects launched include the Sampur Solar Power Plant, a temperature-controlled agricultural warehouse in Dambulla, and the supply of solar rooftop systems for 5,000 religious institutions across Sri Lanka. The Sampur Solar Power Plant is a 5050 joint venture between NTPC Limited of India and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) of Sri Lanka. NTPC and CEB jointly incorporated Trincomalee Power Company Limited to develop the 120-megawatt project. Phase one of the project will have a 50-megawatt capacity, built over 500 acres of land. This solar project will bring an investment of approximately USD 100 million to Trincomalee in the eastern province of Sri Lanka. The project, featuring the latest solar PV Topcon technology, will enhance energy security, reduce fossil fuel dependence, create jobs, and foster a cleaner environment by reducing 200,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. It is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2027. With the groundbreaking of the Sampur Solar Power Project, both countries are now progressing on a shared pathway toward a forward-looking and green future. Meanwhile, the temperature-controlled agricultural warehouse in Dambulla is a 524 million Sri Lankan rupee joint initiative, built with a 300 million Sri Lankan rupee grant assistance from the Government of India. The warehouse is a first-of-its-kind facility in the country, divided into six chambers, each with independent temperature and humidity controls, and each capable of holding around 30,000 crates. The facility is fully equipped with a receiving area, sorting area, pre-cooling and post-heating chambers, and a service area complete with administrative units, stores, and a quality control lab. It will significantly minimize post-harvest losses, which currently stand at around 40, reduce price fluctuations, and ensure the delivery of good-quality agro-produce to consumers around the country. The inauguration of the Dambulla temperature-controlled warehouse underlines Indias commitment to being a partner in Sri Lankas development and prosperity. Additionally, the supply of solar rooftop systems for 5,000 religious institutions across Sri Lanka is being financed through Indian credit assistance of 17 million US dollars. The 5,000 solar rooftop systems are being supplied to institutions of major religions in Sri Lanka, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. The sites identified by the Government of Sri Lanka span across all nine provinces and 25 districts in the country. The solar rooftop systems will add 25 megawatts of solar capacity, generating over 37 million units of clean energy annually. The project will ensure reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable energy for the beneficiary institutions. With this, India and Sri Lanka will be partners in the clean energy transition, illuminating the future together.",

I am reminded of the words of the great Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar. He said: Seyar Kariya Yaavul Natt Pinn Aadu Pul Vinnaikkariya Yaavul Kaapu. Which means, in the face of challenges and enemies, there is no stronger assurance than a true friend and the shield of his friendship, he added. Earlier in the day, PM Modi and Dissanayake held a bilateral meeting and delegation-level talks in Colombo. PM Modi calls his talks with Dissanayake productive and extensive.

        "date": "April 5, 2025 09:46 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed grave concern over the death of a youth while in the custody of the Welikada Police in the early hours of April 02, 2025. The youth reportedly sustained fatal injuries while in custody, which are said to have been self-inflicted. It has also been reported that the youth was not in a proper mental state at the time. He was subsequently transferred to Mulleriyawa Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Attorney-at-Law Rajeev Amarasuriya, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, issued a statement expressing the Associations serious concerns regarding the incident, the reported circumstances, and the broader implications for law enforcement accountability and public trust. The BASL calls upon the Acting Inspector General of Police to ensure the conduct of an immediate and impartial investigation into this incident. The BASL will closely monitor the developments in this respect, and would take whatever measures that may be necessary to ensure due process is followed and that the rule of law is ensured, Amarasuriya said. He further reiterated that for decades, the BASL has consistently warned that law enforcement agencies, including the Sri Lanka Police, must act with the highest degree of care, caution, and responsibility to prevent such incidents. These incidents erode trust and confidence in the system of administration of justice, he noted. The BASL also expressed regret that custodial deaths continue to occur, despite longstanding concerns and repeated calls for reform. Amarasuriya stated that the BASL is concerned that the authorities are slow in taking meaningful action to prevent such incidents, as well as in taking expeditious steps to bring the culprits to justice. The repetition of such incidents will lead to the allegation of a climate of impunity on the part of the State, which is most detrimental to all citizens of this Country, he added. The BASL affirmed its support for the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy on custodial deaths and expressed its readiness to work with law enforcement authorities, including the Sri Lanka Police, in capacity-building efforts aimed at preventing future occurrences.",

        "date": "April 5, 2025 10:01 pm",
        "content": "During his official visit to Colombo, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, had the opportunity to engage with members of the iconic 1996 Sri Lankan cricket team, which secured the nations historic victory in the ICC Cricket World Cup that year. This included prominent players such as Sanath Jayasuriya, Chaminda Vaas, Aravinda de Silva, Marvan Atapattu, and others. PM Modi is on a state visit to Sri Lanka from April 4 to 6 at the invitation of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. His arrival in Colombo on Friday marked his first visit to Sri Lanka since 2019. During his visit, he met members of the 1996 World Cup-winning Sri Lankan team, who brought the country its maiden world title by defeating Australia in the final at Lahore. Expressing his appreciation for the team and their enduring legacy, the Prime Minister shared his thoughts on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), stating: Cricket connect! Delighted to interact with members of the 1996 Sri Lankan cricket team, which won the World Cup that year. This team captured the imagination of countless sports lovers! After the meeting, several Sri Lankan players spoke to the media about the interaction and the strong cricketing ties between India and Sri Lanka. Marvan Atapattu, who scored 14,036 runs for Sri Lanka across formats in 360 matches, said, It was an extraordinary meeting. We have been lucky. Meeting a head of state who is a strong leader who has brought India to its heights was a dream come true. It was our honour and privilege to meet the Prime Minister this evening. Chaminda Vaas, who took 760 wickets in 438 matches for Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2009, praised PM Modis cricket knowledge. Its a great honour to meet him personally as the 1996 World Cup team. We just talked about sports and during 1996, how we won the World Cup and how we beat India (during the semifinal at Eden Gardens in Kolkata). The Prime Minister follows cricket, he knows everything and not only as a leader, but being the most powerful person in the South Asian countries, his cricket knowledge is very good. He asked me about how we beat India. India is the most powerful country when it comes to cricket as well. The way we interacted with him was really good. Aravinda de Silva, who scored a match-winning century in the final against Australia in 1996, also said, Hes a well-respected person around the world, and he has done so much for India. Becoming the Prime Minister for the third time in such a large country is a remarkable achievement. His influence on this country will be very important. It was quite nice chatting with him and we really enjoyed it. Sanath Jayasuriya, an explosive all-rounder who scored 21,032 runs, took 437 wickets, and hit 42 centuries in 586 matches, said, It was really nice meeting the Prime Minister. We discussed a few things about cricket, the present and past, and what we are going through currently. It was a great experience for us. He also talked about how he became the PM, developed India, and what he did for India. We also discussed matters on the international ground in Jaffna. Romesh Kaluwitharana, who revolutionized ODI batting with Jayasuriya in the 1990s and scored 5,644 runs across Tests and ODIs with five centuries, also said, From the time he (PM Modi) came to power, he changed a lot of things. He did a lot of things for Sri Lanka as well. India has always been there for us in times of crisis, in cricket as well. Kumar Dharmasena, a member of the 1996 team who later became an international umpire, said, For the first time, I have seen a leader like him. He is very friendly and casual, and that was fantastic. One thing I want to mention is that as a neighbour of Sri Lanka, he has given a lot of support to us. Over the years, India-Sri Lanka cricketing ties have grown stronger, with both nations facing each other in numerous bilateral series and major ICC tournament clashes, including the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final in Mumbai and the 2014 ICC T20 World Cup final in Bangladeshwon by India and Sri Lanka, respectively. Notably, both countries will co-host next years ICC T20 World Cup, with the Men in Blue defending their second title. Meanwhile, in a solemn and respectful gesture, Prime Minister Modi also visited the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) Memorial in Colombo, where he laid a wreath in honour of the Indian soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Sri Lanka. Reflecting on their courage and commitment, he said: Laid a wreath at the IPKF Memorial in Colombo. We remember the brave soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force who laid down their lives in service of peace, unity and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Their unwavering courage and commitment remain a source of inspiration for us all. (With Agencies Inputs)",

        "date": "April 6, 2025 08:48 am",
        "content": "US customs agents began collecting President Donald Trumps unilateral 10 per cent tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday (Apr 5), with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week. The initial 10 per cent baseline tariff paid by US importers took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am Eastern Time (4.01am GMT), ushering in Trumps full rejection of the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates. This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime, said Kelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trumps first term. Shaw told a Brookings Institution event on Thursday that she expected the tariffs to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates. This is a pretty seismic and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on earth, she added. Trumps Wednesday tariff announcement shook global stock markets, wiping out US5 trillion in value for SP 500 index companies by Fridays close, a record two-day decline. Driven by recession fears, prices for oil and commodities plunged while investors fled to the safety of government bonds. Among the countries first hit with the 10 per cent tariff were Australia, Britain, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Saudi Arabia despite their having goods trade deficits with the US last year. White House officials have said many countries would run larger deficits with the US if their policies were fairer. A US Customs and Border Protection bulletin provided a 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded or in transit to the US before 12.01am Eastern Time on Saturday. These cargoes need to arrive by May 27 to avoid the 10 per cent duty. Trumps higher reciprocal tariff rates of 11 per cent to 50 per cent are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12.01am Eastern Time. European Union imports will face a 20 per cent tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34 per cent tariff, bringing Trumps total new levies on China to 54 per cent. The Trump Administration has imposed a 44 per cent reciprocal tariff on Sri Lanka and according to experts it will have a major impact on the local apparel industry. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration has issued a circular in this regard to all Secretaries to Ministries, Chief Secretaries of Provinces and Heads of Departments. The circular instructs all state institutions to adhere to the 3R concept (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Since many state institutions are located in urban areas, the program is intended to manage the waste generated at all government organizations on a daily basis, the statement of the Ministry noted. Accordingly, the Ministry further emphasized that the use of paper should be minimized in official activities, the use of single-use plastics should be discouraged, and the use of eco-friendly alternatives should be encouraged. The relevant circular also provides guidelines on waste collection and disposal, as well as the monitoring of waste management practices. Additionally, the circular states that a formal waste management plan should be developed and implemented for each institution within six months of the effective date of the circular.",

The special request has been made as more than two million devotees are expected to visit Kandy during the period. The special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic will be held at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy for 10 days from April 18. Issuing a statement, the Mahanayaka Thero of the Asgiriya chapter said although traditionally the exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic takes place once in five years, it has not taken place for 16 years due to various reasons. Most Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thero noted that since an exposition has not taken place for 16 years, the general public is eager to witness the Tooth Relic by visiting the Dalada Maligawa after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year period. It has also been revealed that although it is estimated that three devotees per second will be able to worship the Tooth Relic during the 10 days of the exposition, only around 600,000 people will be able to enter the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy during that time. The Mahanayaka Thero of the Asgiriya chapter therefore urged the general public to be mindful of the safety and needs of all visitors.",

        "content": "In a significant gesture, Sri Lanka today released 14 Indian fishermen, to coincide with the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island. The release followed detailed discussions between Prime Minister Modi and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday (5), during which the long-standing issue of fishermens arrests was reportedly taken up. Prime Minister Modi, during his remarks at a joint media briefing, said, We discussed the fishermens issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats. Sri Lanka Navy continues to arrest Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, for poaching in Sri Lankan waters. Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by authorities. Addressing a press conference following the talks, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days. This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister himself said during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides, Misri added. The release of the 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during Prime Minister Modis visit, which included the signing of seven Memoranda of Understating. The Indian delegation led by Prime Minister Modi left the island after concluding his engagements in Anuradhapura this morning.",

        "content": "High-level discussions have been held between the government and Washington to minimize the impact of the reciprocal tariffs announced by United States President Donald Trump will have on local businesses, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Harshana Sooriyapperuma has revealed. The Deputy Minister noted that despite the assertions by the opposition, discussions were held with US authorities even before the announcement was made by President Trump. On Wednesday (2), US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. Sri Lanka is facing one of the steepest tariffs among countries amounting 44 per cent. Speaking at a media briefing held at the Department of Government Information this afternoon (6), Deputy Minister Sooriyapperuma said the government recognizes the evolving trade landscape with the US looking to address trade imbalances through reciprocal tariffs. The Deputy Minister said once the announcement was made, the government took several decisions and also reached out to Washington with the aim of finding solutions and lesson the impact tariffs will have on local businesses. According to Deputy Minister Sooriyapperuma, discussions were held virtually between the two factions and the Trump administration had appreciated the move taken by the Sri Lankan government to reach out to them over the matter. He said during the meeting, the US delegation acknowledged that tariffs were decided based on a formula and not based on duty imposed by Sri Lanka on imports. Deputy Minister Harshana Sooriyapperuma added that further details and specifics will be deliberated with the Trump administration during a meeting to be held next Tuesday. He said all businesses and stakeholders will be informed of the progress made during the discussion with US authorities.",

Severe, widespread flash flooding is expected into Sunday in parts of the central-eastern region, the National Weather Service (NWS) said, warning that lives and property are in great danger. Two storm-related deaths were recorded in Missouri and one in Indiana, according to local media reports and authorities. A five-year-old was found dead in a home in Little Rock, Arkansas in connection to the ongoing severe weather, the states emergency management agency said in a statement. Flooding has reached record levels in many communities, Kentuckys Governor Beshear wrote on social media on Saturday, urging residents in the state to avoid travel, and never drive through water.

        "date": "April 6, 2025 08:26 pm",
        "content": "More than 50 countries have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks, a top economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday as U.S. officials sought to defend sweeping new tariffs that have unleashed global turmoil. During an interview on ABC News This Week, U.S. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett denied that the tariffs were part of a strategy by Trump to crash financial markets to pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He said there were would be no political coercion of the central bank. In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump shared a video that suggested his tariffs aimed to hammer the stock market on purpose in a bid to force lower interest rates. In a separate interview on NBC Newss Meet the Press, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the stock market drop and said there was no reason to anticipate a recession based on the tariffs. Trump jolted economies around the world after he announced broad tariffs on U.S. imports on Wednesday, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a globe trade war and recession. On Sunday morning talk shows, top Trump officials sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the U.S. in the global trade order and the economic disruptions as a short-term fallout. U.S. stocks have tumbled by around 10 in the two days since Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating. It is a drop that market analysts and large investors have blamed on Trumps aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth. Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential tariff turmoil, with fallout from Trumps sweeping import levies keeping investors on edge after the worst week for U.S. stocks since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis five years ago. Hassett told ABC News This Week that Trumps tariffs had so far driven more than 50 countries to contact the White House to begin trade talks. Taiwans President Lai Ching-te on Sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks with the U.S., pledging to remove trade barriers rather than imposing reciprocal measures and saying Taiwanese companies will raise their U.S. investments. Unlike other economists, Hassett said he did not expect a big hit to consumers because exporters were likely to lower prices. Bessent told NBC News he did not anticipate a recession based on the tariffs, citing stronger-than-anticipated U.S. jobs growth. We could see from the jobs number on Friday, that was well above expectations, that we are moving forward, so I see no reason that we have to price in a recession, Bessent said.

        "content": "Grammy-nominated Malian musician Amadou Bagayoko, who won global fame by moulding traditional West African sounds with Western rock and pop influences as one half of the blind duo Amadou  Mariam, has died aged 70, the Malian government said. The ministry of culture learned with concern of the passing of artist Amadou Bagayoko this Friday, it said in a statement read on state television. Amadou was a blind man who made his mark on the Malian and international scene. Bagayoko was born in Bamako in 1954 and played music from an early age. He met his wife and musical partner Mariam Doumbia at the Institute for Young Blind People in Bamako in the 1970s, according to Radio France Internationale. Their 2004 album Dimanche a Bamako (Sunday in Bamako) put them on the international map and the 2008 release Welcome To Mali was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album. They opened for British band Coldplay in 2009, performed at the Nobel Peace Prize concert that same year, when U.S. President Barack Obama was awarded the prize, and played to crowds at some of the worlds biggest music festivals, including Glastonbury in the UK. They also composed the official song for the 2006 soccer World Cup. International artists offered their condolences online. Amadou! Well always be together ... with you wherever you go, said French-born Spanish musician Manu Chao, who produced Dimanche a Bamako.

        "date": "April 6, 2025 10:47 pm",
        "content": "During his recent visit to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with the island countrys 1996 World Cup-winning cricketers, including Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva and recalled Indias 1996 tour amid unrest as a symbol of strong ties between the two countries. During the interaction he praised the cricketers and recalled when Team India extended a helping hand to the nation that was rocked by bomb blasts just days ahead of the tournament which it was co-hosting with India and Pakistan. The cricketers thanked India for support during Sri Lankas economic crisis and requested help developing a stadium in Jaffna. The video of the interaction from Saturday was released on the YouTube channel of the Prime Ministers Office today. Cricketer Jayasuriya said, When we had unrest, problems in Sri Lanka, you and the government helped us a lot. We are always grateful to you for helping Sri Lanka. Jayasuriya, who is also the current Sri Lanka head coach, requested PM Modi to support Sri Lanka in its aim of bringing international cricket matches to Jaffna by building an international-level stadium. As the coach of Sri Lanka, at the moment we play all over Sri Lanka except Jaffna. If India can help us to bring international ground in Jaffna, there will be a big help for the people in Jaffna North and Eastern parts...I have a small request, if this can be done?... PM Modi reaffirmed Indias Neighbourhood First policy and cited aid to Myanmar as a recent example. PM Modi said, India has always believed in the Neighbourhood First policy. We always want to respond to the crisis of our neighbouring countries. In the recent earthquakes in Myanmar, we were the first respondents. During the crisis in Sri Lanka, we ensured that the country should come out of it, and we tried our best to do that...You (Sanath Jayasuriya) spoke about Jaffna that international matches should be played in Jaffna is a very strong thought and I assure you that my team will try to do everything possible for it... In January 1996, Sri Lanka was rocked by bomb blasts at the Central Bank. Due to this, Australia and West Indies refused to send their teams to Sri Lanka due to security reasons. However, in a great show of solidarity, sportsman spirit and brotherhood, India and Pakistan, two arch-rivals, sent a joint team led by Indian star Mohammad Azharuddin to play a friendly match against Sri Lanka in February ahead of the marquee tournament. The team featured several Indian stars like Azhar himself, alongside Sachin Tendulkar, Ajay Jadeja, Anil Kumble and Aashish Rakesh Kapoor. From Pakistan, came stars like Saeed Anwar, Aamir Sohail, Ijaz Ahmed, Rashid Latif, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. However, West Indies and Australia did not turn up at all, giving Sri Lanka free points via walkover that made them the sole undefeated team in Group A and sent them straight to knockouts. In a one-sided semifinal which was interrupted by rioting and arson by angry fans, Sri Lanka defeated India at Eden Gardens by default and marched to the final, where they defeated Australia by seven wickets in Lahore to capture their maiden World Cup title, paving the way for the rise of the Island nation as a cricketing superpower, which gave the sport icons like Kumar Sangakkara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas etc in years to come. Speaking about the bomb blast and its aftermath in the video, ex-Sri Lanka batter Marvan Attapattu said to PM Modi, One of the reasons why won, there were two teams (Australia and West Indies) which did not come due to bomb blast. India sent a team here, to show the world the safety of the place. That is one of the reasons we won. In his reply, PM Modi recalled how the gesture of Indian team was appreciated in the sports fraternity, particularly in Sri Lanka. When other teams were scared and running, India showed Sri Lanka kheldilli and did not leave Sri Lanka alone. There was a lot of sportsman spirit. On one side, there was a bomb blast and on the other, was Indias sportsman spirit. It was sportsman spirit which prevailed over bomb blast, he added. PM Modi also recalled that after another terrorist attack in Sri Lanka in 2019 during Easter, he was the first world leader to visit the nation in the aftermath of the attack. I also remember the Indian team came to Sri Lanka (for the 2021 series) after the attack as well. That spirit (of being together for neighbours) has continued. India is with Sri Lanka in its days of happiness and sorrow both, the Prime Minister said. PM Modi also hailed Sri Lankan teams aggressive performances during the 1996 World Cup, particularly those of their opening pair of Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, who are often hailed as pioneers of attacking batting in ODI cricket. When India won the World Cup in 1983 and you won in 1996, your wins changed the world cricket. If T20 was born, it was in 1996 during your matches and your methods. You are a team that the Indians still remember. They have not forgotten the bashing you gave them, the Prime Minister said about the Sri Lankan team. Jayasuriya thanked PM Modi for always helping Sri Lanka when in need and also told PM about his time in the Indian Premier League (IPL), playing for Mumbai Indians (MI) from 2008-11. His 2008 season with MI was a brilliant one, scoring 514 runs in 14 matches at an average of 42.83 and a stunning strike rate of 166.34, with a century and two fifties. He also took four wickets. To this, PM Modi assured Sri Lanka of all possible help in its various endeavours. Aravinda da Silva, who scored a match-winning century for Sri Lanka in the 1996 WC final, also told PM the class of 1996 is still involved with cricket in some way or the other. They are in more pressure now than they used to during finals, he added. Kumar Dharmasena, the member of the World Cup-winning team who took up umpiring following his retirement, said that umpiring in Ahmedabads Narendra Modi Stadium, the biggest in the world was a great experience. Everyone loves to umpire there, he added. Romesh also said, First tour (to India was in 1990) and I came to India recently. Those memories are always there. We regularly visit India. Whenever SL is in crisis financially, India always steps up and supports. Thank you. India is our brother. Over the years, India-Sri Lanka cricketing ties have grown stronger, with both nations facing each other in numerous bilateral series and major ICC tournament clashes, including the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final in Mumbai and the 2014 ICC T20 World Cup final in Bangladesh--won by India and Sri Lanka, respectively. Notably, both countries will be co-hosting next years ICC T20 World Cup, with Men in Blue defending their second title. Source: ANI --Agencies",

Such a move would mean the EU joining China and Canada in imposing retaliatory tariffs on the United States in an early escalation of what some fear will become a global trade war, making goods more expensive for billions of consumers and pushing economies around the world into recession.

Trumps tariffs cover some 70 of the EUs exports to the United States - worth in total 532 billion euros (585 billion) last year - with likely duties on copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and timber still to come. The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, will propose to members late on Monday a list of U.S. products to hit with extra duties in response to Trumps steel and aluminium tariffs rather than the broader reciprocal levies. It is set to include U.S. meat, cereals, wine, wood and clothing as well as chewing gum, dental floss, vacuum cleaners and toilet paper. One product that has received more attention and exposed discord in the bloc is bourbon. The Commission has earmarked a 50 tariff, prompting Trump to threaten a 200 counter-tariff on EU alcoholic drinks if the bloc goes ahead. Wine exporters France and Italy have both expressed concern. The EU, whose economy is heavily reliant on free trade, is keen to make sure it has wide backing for any response so as to keep the pressure up on Trump ultimately to enter negotiations. Luxembourg will earlier on Monday host the first EU-wide political meeting since Trumps announcement of the sweeping tariffs when ministers responsible for trade from the 27 EU members will exchange views on the impact and how best to respond. EU diplomats said the main aim of the meeting was to emerge with a united message of a desire to negotiate with Washington a removal of tariffs, but a readiness to respond with countermeasures if that failed. Our biggest fear after Brexit was bilateral deals and a break of unity, but through three or four years of negotiations that did not happen. Of course, here you have a different story, but everyone can see an interest in a common commercial policy, one EU diplomat said. Counter-Tariffs Among EU members, there is a spectrum of opinion on how to respond. France has said the EU should work on a package going well beyond tariffs and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested European companies should suspend investments in the United States until things are clarified. Ireland, almost a third of whose exports go to the United States, has called for a considered and measured response, while Italy, the EUs third largest exporter to the U.S., has questioned whether the EU should hit back at all. Its a difficult balance. Measures cannot be too soft to bring the United States to the table, but not too tough to lead to escalation, one EU diplomat said. Talks with Washington to date have not borne fruit. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic described his two-hour exchange with U.S. counterparts on Friday as frank as he told them U.S. tariffs were damaging, unjustified. The initial EU counter-tariffs will in any case be put to a vote on Wednesday and will be approved except in the unlikely event that a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65 of the EUs population oppose it. They would enter force in two stages, a smaller part on April 15 and the rest a month later. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also hold separate discussions on Monday and Tuesday with chief executives from the steel, automotive and pharmaceutical sectors to assess the impact of tariffs and determine what to do next.

        "content": "Meta Platforms on Saturday released the latest version of its large language model (LLM) Llama, called the Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. Meta said Llama is a multimodal AI system. Multimodal systems are capable of processing and integrating various types of data including text, video, images and audio, and can convert content across these formats. Meta said in a statement that the Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick are its most advanced models yet and the best in their class for multimodality. Meta added that Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout will be open source software. It also said it was previewing Llama 4 Behemoth, which it called one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet to serve as a teacher for our new models. Big technology firms have been investing aggressively in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure following the success of OpenAIs ChatGPT, which altered the tech landscape and drove investment into machine learning. The Information reported on Friday that Meta had delayed the launch of its LLMs latest version because during development, Llama 4 did not meet Metas expectations on technical benchmarks, particularly in reasoning and math tasks. The company was also concerned that Llama 4 was less capable than OpenAIs models in conducting humanlike voice conversations, the report added. Meta plans to spend as much as 65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure, amid investor pressure on big tech firms to show returns on their investments. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Asian markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by US President Donald Trumps trade war. Japans benchmark Nikkei fell by more than 8 shortly after opening. The share average, which tracks 225 of the countrys most valuable companies, has fallen below the 33,000 level for the first time since August 2024, according to Reuters. The broader Topix index last traded more than 7.5 lower, recovering from its steepest losses. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday the government will continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results wont come overnight, according to Reuters. As such, the government must take all available means to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba reportedly told parliament. On Wednesday, Trump imposed a 24 across-the-board tariff on Japan, a defense treaty ally, which is due to take effect later this week. Asian markets are tracking the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of sell-offs that wiped away over 5.4 trillion in market value. Global investors have rejected President Trumps massive tariff regime, some of which went into effect on Saturday morning and even larger tariffs are set to launch on Wednesday. China retaliated fiercely on Friday, imposing a 34 tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war. On Sunday evening, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he didnt intentionally crash markets but declined to predict how markets would trade in the future. Whats going to happen with the market? I cant tell you, Trump said. But I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually itll be a country like no other. US stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday, putting the SP 500 on the precipice of a bear market  a decline of 20 from its peak and an ominous sign for investors and perhaps the broader economy. South Koreas Kospi tumbled more than 4.8 shortly after opening. Trading was halted for five minutes when a circuit breaker designed to prevent panic selling was triggered. Taiwans Taiex plummeted more than 9.7 after opening. Circuit breakers were activated for TSMC and Foxconn, two of the islands best known export powerhouses, after their shares each fell by nearly 10, according to Reuters. In Australia, the benchmark ASX 200 index fell as much 6.3 in morning trade, while New Zealands NZX 50 lost more 3.5. Source: CNN --Agencies",

The ban comes in effect from April 13 and will remain in effect until mid-June. The issuance of three types of visas - Umrah visa, Business visa and Family Visit visa - have been halted by Saudi Arabia. The Saudi authorities have implemented the measure to curb unauthorized participation in the Hajj. Media reports claimed that many foreign nationals entered the country on Umrah visa or family visit visa and overstayed illegally to participate in Hajj without official authorization. Under the new travel restrictions, the foreign nationals are allowed to apply for Umrah visas till April 13. After the deadline, no new Umrah visa will be issued till Hajj ends. The 14 countries impacted by the newly-imposed travel restriction are - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria, Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Yemen and Morocco. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Its rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismails mother Hajar and the Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islams holy book. Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal. All Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities.

North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent. He had a heart as big as a mountain, loved his friends deeply. He called us frequently and ended every conversation with I love you with all my heart, Jacobson wrote in a tribute on Facebook. North was 6 when he was cast as the smiling troublemaker in the CBS sitcom adaptation of Hank Ketchams popular comic strip that took place in an idyllic American suburb. Often wearing a striped shirt and overalls, Dennis mischievous antics frequently frustrated his retired next-door neighbor George Wilson, played by Joseph Kearns. Dennis patient parents were played by Herbert Anderson and Gloria Henry. The show ran on Sunday nights until it was canceled in 1963. After that it was a fixture for decades in syndication. Later, North appeared on TV in shows including The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Lucy Show, My Three Sons, Lassie and The Simpsons, and in movies such as Maya (1966), The Teacher (1974) and Dickie Robert: Former Child Star (2003).

Shadi Taiseer Alsaaydeh, 45, is due to appear in Sydneys Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, charged with two counts of endangering the safety of an aircraft and one count of assaulting cabin crew. Police will allege he initially tried to open the rear emergency exit door of an AirAsia X flight travelling from Kuala Lumpur, prompting airline staff to escort him to a seat in the middle of the plane. He then attempted to open the middle emergency exit door before crew and passengers forcibly prevented him from doing so, during which he allegedly assaulted an airline staff member. Australian Federal Police officers met the flight on its arrival in Sydney. Each of the offences Alsaaydeh is charged with carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Australian Federal Police detective acting superintendent Davina Copelin said dangerous behaviour on aircraft would not be tolerated. The actions of this man could have had tragic consequences, and passengers and airplane staff shouldnt have to put up with unruly, violent or dangerous behaviour on flights, Copelin said. In a statement, AirAsia X said its cabin crew took the necessary steps to protect everyone on board. At no time was the safety of guests or crew compromised, the statement said. AirAsia has a zero tolerance policy for inappropriate behaviour of any kind. The incident comes after a Jetstar flight from Bali to Melbourne was forced to turn back on Monday after a woman attempted to open a cabin door. The woman lifted the door handle an hour into the journey before a warning signal alerted the crew. The captain of the plane decided to return to Denpasar Airport where she was arrested and banned from flying with Jetstar. She wanted to sit in a different row and have a chair that could recline, so she decided to try to open the doors, passenger Brook Jowett said. A New Zealand man was also banned and charged after allegedly assaulting a Qantas staff member and two other people at Sydney Airport on Tuesday. Source: Sydney Morning Herald --Agencies",

He said they urged the Indian Prime Minister Modi to discuss and prevent the continuous arrest of Tamil Nadu fisherman by Sri Lankan authorities for poaching. Chief Minister M.K.

A total of 97 fishermen and their boats are in Sri Lankan custody at present, according to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. He added that they have urged the central government of India to intervene in the matter since the livelihoods of Tamil Nadu fishermen are severely affected by repeated arrests by Sri Lankan authorities.

The report was officially handed over by Governor of the Central Bank Dr. P.

AER 2024 comprises four main chapters: Macroeconomic Developments, Conditions of the Financial System, Review of Central Banks Policies and Macroeconomic Outlook. According to the Review, the Sri Lankan economy showed significant signs of recovery in 2024, following the deep economic crisis experienced two years ago. The recovery trajectory, though challenging, has been notably faster than that of many other debt-distressed countries. Improvements in economic activity, a partial resurgence in purchasing power and reduced uncertainty are among the key positive indicators noted in the report, the statement added. The event was attended by Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the President, Mr. K. M. Mahinda Siriwardena, Secretary to the Treasury, Mrs. K. M. A. N.

        "content": "New Democratic Front (NDF) Parliamentarian Chamara Sampath Dassanayake has been further remanded until 21 April by the Badulla Magistrates Court. MP Dassanayake is accused of misappropriating a sum of Rs. 1 million of the Uva Provincial Council in 2016. MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was taken into custody on March 27, over three separate corruption-related cases. The Colombo Magistrates Court previously granted bail in two of the cases but ordered him placed in remand custody over the third charge. The allegations stem from his tenure as Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016. According to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission filed a case against the MP, citing the government incurred a financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions. After reviewing the evidence, the Colombo Magistrates Court ruled that while Dassanayake could be released on bail for two of the charges, he would remain in remand custody for the third. Accordingly, this morning MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was once again produced before the Badulla Magistrates Court when the case was taken up for hearing.",

        "content": "Residents of Colombo witnessed a rare astronomical event at exactly 12.12 p.m. today (April 07) as their shadows vanished momentarily under the midday sun. The phenomenon, known as a Zero Shadow Day, occurs when the sun is positioned directly overhead, causing vertical objects to cast no shadow. This striking event is part of the suns apparent northward journey across the Earths surface, known as the subsolar point. As the sun reaches the zenith over different locations, its rays fall perpendicularly on those areas, causing shadows to temporarily disappear. The phenomenon began in Sri Lanka at Dondra Head on April 4 and will continue to move northward across the island until April 15. Today, Colomboone of the countrys most densely populated citiesexperienced the zenith moment, attracting the attention of astronomy enthusiasts and curious onlookers. Among them was veteran astronomer Anura C. Perera, who joined a group at the Colombo Municipal Council premises to observe the spectacle. Observers used simple toolssuch as a one-foot vertical rodto witness the moment when no shadow was cast, confirming the suns exact overhead position. Meanwhile, similar observations were reported in other parts of the country, including Galle and Anuradhapura, where residents marked the occasion by watching shadows disappear under clear skies. According to astronomers, residents in areas such as Nainamadama and Mahiyanganaya will experience their own Zero Shadow Day tomorrow, as the sun continues its apparent journey across the island. The sun will complete its overhead passage and will move away from Sri Lankas Point Pedro on April 15. This rare alignment - Zero Shadow Day - also known as Lāhainā Noon, occurs twice a year in regions between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, according to astronomers.",

        "content": "Oil slid around 3 on Monday to its weakest since 2021, while most commodity markets including metals tumbled as an intensifying trade war between the United States and China triggered worries over demand for raw materials. Gold, which climbed to a record peak last week, also fell amid a wider markets sell-off. Major stock indexes plunged in Asia as White House officials showed no sign of backing away from their sweeping tariff plans, and investors wagered the mounting risk of recession could see U.S. interest rates cut as early as May. The biggest threat to the global goods trading system since World War II is forcing a rapid deleveraging in risk assets and escalation in recession risks, ANZ said in a note. Golds allure as a haven asset failed to protect it from the selloff across global markets. Responding to U.S. President Donald Trumps tariffs, China on Friday said it would impose additional levies of 34 on American goods, confirming investor fears that a full-blown global trade war is under way and that the global economy may be at risk of a recession. Brent futures and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit their lowest since April 2021. Over the past week, both benchmarks have lost more than 10. The primary driver of the decline is concern that tariffs will weaken the global economy, said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities. Additionally, a planned production increase by OPEC is also contributing to the selling pressure, he said, adding that retaliatory tariffs from countries beyond China will be a key factor to watch. Benchmark LME copper, which dropped more than 6 to its lowest since November 2023 in early Asia trade, recovered and was trading up 2 by 0339 GMT. However, base metal prices in China dropped, with copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange falling 6, marking its lowest in more than three months. Gold has come under pressure as investors sell off bullion to cover losses from the broader market meltdown and to realise profits, potentially meeting margin calls or offsetting declines in other assets. Japanese rubber futures dropped to their lowest since February 2024 and Malaysian palm oil futures fell for a third consecutive session. Source: The Economic Times --Agencies",

        "content": "Indias weather department has warned of high temperatures in parts of northern India, including capital Delhi, for this week. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said northern and central states - including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat - can expect maximum temperatures to cross 40C. It has issued a yellow alert which means that the heat is tolerable for the general public but can cause moderate health concerns for infants, the elderly and people with chronic diseases. Northern India usually sees heatwaves between April and June, but in recent years, global warming and climate change have caused extreme temperatures to arrive earlier and last longer. According to the IMD forecast, the highest temperature in Delhi is expected to hit 41C on Monday afternoon. People have been advised to avoid heat exposure, wear lightweight and breathable cotton clothing and cover their heads with a cloth or umbrella outdoors. The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2C on Sunday. Last week, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said most parts of India would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with above-normal temperatures expected across most of the country. States like Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mr Mohapatra said. Heatwaves usually start occurring in northern India from the end of April, but we are seeing that their occurrence has recently been exacerbated by climate change, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. We go straight from winter to summer; the spring season in northern India is shrinking, he said. Last year, India recorded its hottest day ever at 50.5C in Rajasthan state. More than 40,000 suspected cases of heatstroke were also reported. One weather station in Delhi in May recorded a maximum temperature of 52.9C, although the government later said it was due to a sensor error and revised it down by 3C. Nearly 150 people died due to the heatwave in 2024, according to official data but independent researchers said the toll was much higher. Source: BBC",

As per a statement from Adani Ports and SEZ, the CWIT project represents a significant investment of USD 800 million and features a 1,400-metre quay length and 20-metre depth, enabling the terminal to handle approximately 3.2 million twenty-foot equivalent Units (TEUs) annually. According to APSEZ, it is the first deep-water terminal in Colombo to be fully automated, designed to enhance cargo handling capabilities, improve vessel turnaround times and elevate the ports status as a key transshipment hub in South Asia. Construction began in early 2022 and has since achieved rapid progress. With the installation of cutting-edge infrastructure now nearing completion, CWIT is poised to set new benchmarks in operational efficiency and reliability in regional maritime logistics, the release said. The commencement of operations at CWIT marks a momentous milestone in regional cooperation between India and Sri Lanka, said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group.

The stock market crashed today. Trading was halted for some time. The United States said it will impose 44 reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lankan exports with effect from the 9th of April. If these tariffs come into effect, it will cause severe economic damage. Poverty will certainly increase, Premadasa stressed. Commenting further, the Opposition Leader criticized the governments action to appoint committees to create a program to address the 44 tariffs that are coming into effect on April 09. My hope is that these tariffs will not come into effect, he added. Ministers told the media that they appointed committees and held discussions via Zoom, Premadasa said, stressing that instead of virtual meetings, they should hold face-to-face discussions with the US. Vietnam and Cambodia initiated these discussions a while ago. Why did our country fail to do so? It is because of arrogance and haughtiness, the Opposition Leader expressed. Government ignored our suggestions, and now it is the citizens who have to endure the consequences of the governments actions, he added.",

        "date": "April 7, 2025 09:51 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas government formed a working group aimed at evaluating the repercussions of the US tariffs on Sri Lanka goods, which will impact its fashion export sector. JAAF, whose members include the Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association and the Fabric and Apparel Accessory Manufacturers Association among others, has thrown its full support behind this initiative. The task force is in the process of crafting a proposal slated for submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. JAAF secretary general Yohan Lawrence said: We appreciate the urgency with which the Government has responded. We are working closely with the relevant authorities to determine a constructive path forward that also remains consistent with Sri Lankas ongoing IMF programme. With over 40 of its exports heading to the US, a figure surpassing 5.5bn in 2023, Sri Lanka considers the US its most crucial apparel export destination. The policy, enacted by US President Donald Trump on 2 April institutes an immediate baseline tariff of 10 on all imports into the US, which started on 5 April. Subsequently, on 9 April, this rate will escalate for each country based on the US administrations assessment of Tariffs charged into the USA. For Sri Lanka, this means an increase from the baseline to a staggering 44. The apparel industry fears that this could significantly disrupt the nations primary export domain. However, it maintains a steadfast commitment to principles such as ethical production, transparency, and sustainable practices. This tariff is significantly higher than what our regional competitors face. We could see a rapid shift in US sourcing away from Sri Lanka, which would be extremely difficult to recover from, Lawrence stated. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan officials have affirmed their readiness to engage with the US to fortify trade ties. A statement from the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development reads: We are committed to substantially reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder trade and investment. --Agencies",

The incident occurred around 11.00 p.m. when a lorry had arrived to refill LP gas at the station. Initial reports indicate that one of the two gas tanks at the siteeach containing approximately 6,000 litres of gasexploded during the filling process, engulfing the area in flames. Police suspect that the explosion may have been triggered by an untrained worker mishandling the gas transfer procedure. It is believed the victims, including the fuel station manager and several workers, were attempting to manage the filling process when the tank exploded, leaving them with fatal burn injuries. Emergency crews from the Kurunegala Municipal Council Fire Department, the Kurunegala Police, and the Sri Lanka Army responded promptly to the scene and battled the blaze for nearly two hours before bringing it under control, Ada Derana reporter said. Municipal workers were also able to safely secure the second gas tank, which helped prevent further destruction. The fire was fully extinguished approximately 2 and 12 hours after the explosion, and the charred remains of the victims were recovered, according to Ada Derana reporter.

        "date": "April 8, 2025 08:11 am",
        "content": "China threatened Tuesday to take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own rights and interests in response to President Donald Trumps threat of an additional 50 tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry statement said the U.S.s imposition of so-called reciprocal tariffs on China is completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice. China has taken retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted more many be coming. The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate, the ministry said. The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end. Trump threatened the additional tariffs on China on Monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens. Trumps threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week. If China does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50, effective April 9th, Trump wrote on Truth Social. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! If Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104. The new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union. Trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on Wall Street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. But that hasnt been the case, and Trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. I dont mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. Trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations has calmed the markets. The only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for China. Stock prices spiked before the White House denied it was true by calling the post fake news. China is one of the U.S.s top trading partners, especially for consumer goods, and the tariffs  essentially a tax on imports paid by U.S. companies  will eventually be passed on to the consumer. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, Theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would focus on trade with other countries besides the United States, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere.

        "date": "April 8, 2025 08:48 am",
        "content": "The never-ending talk of tariffs has people rushing to buy the best iPhone that they can afford now before it becomes significantly more expensive. Apples stock prices continue to suffer, as President Trumps Liberation Day tariffs have caused concerns for analysts and casual iPhone users alike. According to a Bloomberg report, published on Monday, Apples US retail locations are as busy as they usually are during holiday seasons. Employees are often asked questions about increases in iPhone pricing, but Apple has reportedly provided no instruction or guidance. Some stores allegedly experienced higher sales over the past weekend than they did in years prior, which serves as an indication of users concerns over a potential price hike. The overall uncertainty of the situation has seemingly left people expecting the worst outcome for end consumers, as many iPhone users are now scrambling to get ahold of new devices in anticipation of major price increases. The panic-buying is likely to continue in the days ahead, at least until a solution is reached. Apple could opt to increase the prices across its hardware platforms, or it could pass some of the costs on to its suppliers to maintain current pricing. In any case, the company will have to find a way to tackle President Trumps latest assortment of tariffs, as they could have further consequences. On April 2, the Trump administration introduced a series of reciprocal tariffs, which had an overwhelmingly negative impact on Apple and its supply chain. Theres now a 10 tariff on all goods coming into the United States, while China could face a staggering 104 tariff in the immediate future. Many worry that Apple will pass these costs onto end consumers, with one report predicting a 43 iPhone price increase in September 2025. Apple has reportedly been stock-piling its current-generation devices, and the company supposedly plans to mitigate the costs of the Trump tariffs by importing more devices from India, which has a lower 26 tariff rate. This approach would allow Apple to maintain prices in the short term, but a long-lasting solution, such as a tariff exemption, remains a distant possibility. An order from President Trump is the only way Apple could secure a tariff exemption, as there are no other mechanisms through which it could file a request. Unlike last time, new tariffs have been implemented through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Though it may seem unlikely at first glance, two separate reports have indicated theres a strong possibility of talks between Apple and the Trump administration. Apple CEO Tim Cook already has an established method of dealing with President Trump, where their conversations revolve around a singular issue of great significance to Apple. Overall, Apple will likely minimize the impact of the Trump administrations reciprocal tariffs through increased imports from India, and by taking advantage of existing iPhone supply chain inventory in the short term. This means that theres ultimately no cause for immediate alarm, as an iPhone 16 price hike seems unlikely, but an increase could be on the horizon for the iPhone 17 in September 2025.

Attending the passing out parade of the 82nd batch of the Special Task Force (STF) at the Katukurunda STF Training Camp in Kalutara yesterday (07), the President noted that the public places its trust in the Police service to uphold the supremacy of the law and maintaining that trust is a fundamental responsibility of the Police Department Addressing the newly commissioned officers, President Dissanayake stated that how one serves and respects their profession is reflected in their career and urged the officers to embrace their professional duty in a way that contributes meaningfully to the transformative change the country requires, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. Highlighting the current state of institutional breakdown in many sectors, the President pointed out that people have already initiated change by altering the political authority, but reiterated that political transformation alone is insufficient. Instead, a comprehensive and positive transformation across all sectors is necessary for national progress. The President further emphasized that new police officers carry the responsibility of meeting public expectations. The Head of State urged them to ensure public safety and security and to prevent the nation from falling prey to organized crime and drug-related issues, the PMD said.

Located at the Port of Colombo, the terminal is developed under a public-private partnership involving Adani Ports, Sri Lankas John Keells Holdings PLC, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The CWIT project represents an 800 million investment and features a 1,400-metre quay length and a depth of 20 metres, enabling it to handle approximately 3.2 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) annually. Notably, CWIT is the first fully automated deep-water terminal in Colombo. It is designed to enhance cargo handling efficiency and improve vessel turnaround times, further solidifying the ports role as a key transshipment hub in South Asia. Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group, called the commencement of operations a momentous milestone in regional cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. This terminal not only represents the future of trade in the Indian Ocean but also places Sri Lanka firmly on the global maritime map, he said.

        "date": "April 8, 2025 10:37 am",
        "content": "Chocolatiers have unveiled what they say is the worlds largest Cadbury Creme Egg. Funny foodstuffs had seemed to reach their zenith as recently as Friday, when the King had a blow on a carrot whistle. But not to be outdone, Cadbury has since raised the stakes with its oval ambition. Just how big, though, is the colossal confectionery? Well, lets just say you might bite off more than you can chew, and definitely wouldnt want to drop it on your foot. Cadbury proudly states it to be as tall as an emperor penguin, with the poundage of a newborn horse - or, in old money, 3ft (90cm) and 7st 1lbs (45kg). And whats more, not a bit of the brown behemoth - on display at Birmingham tourist attraction Cadbury World - is fake. Its real chocolate, with real gooey fondant filling and even has the signature touch of the engraved twinkle. The only bit of the Easter treat that isnt quite legit is the wrapping. Its actually a painted veneer, presumably because there was not a piece of foil large enough, lest a run on crinkly silver lead to stale sarnies. Terry Collins, who made the egg with fellow chocolatier Dawn Jenks, said nobody gets to eat the egg unfortunately. Although asked whether not even he got to have a little nibble, he confessed to BBC Radio 5 Live: I was tempted during creation, I wont lie. He said: Here at Cadbury World we normally do creations for each season and we were just thinking what better way to celebrate Easter than something as iconic as a Creme Egg? and we figured weve got to go as massive as we can with it. The pair crafted it by hand over two-and-a-half days. Asked why it was so heavy, Mr Collins said: That would be just purely down to the amount of chocolate we used and fondant. To actually make the egg weve had to have a mould, which weve got two sides of, and then we have to build up the chocolate by hand to make sure that the egg actually stays intact. Ms Jenks said: We challenged ourselves to create something unique and memorable this Easter. Replicating the much-loved Cadbury Creme Egg on an extra-large scale was an ambitious project, and it has been so rewarding to see the vision brought to life. The egg is on display at Cadbury Worlds chocolate-making zone until 27 April. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Leading contenders began to throw their hats in the ring on Tuesday as South Korea officially set June 3 for a snap presidential election triggered by last weeks removal from office of impeached leader Yoon Suk Yeol. The power vacuum at the top of government has impeded Seouls efforts to negotiate with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of spiralling U.S. tariffs and slowing growth in Asias fourth-largest economy. Yoon was removed on Friday over his short-lived declaration of martial law in December that plunged the key U.S. ally into crisis, triggering a new election that could reshape its foreign and domestic policy. The government intends to designate June 3 as the 21st presidential election day, Acting President Han Duck-soo told a cabinet meeting, citing factors such as the time political parties need to prepare for the event. Yoons labour minister Kim Moon-soo is among a handful of hopefuls who have signalled their intention to run, resigning his post on Tuesday and saying he would launch his campaign. While not officially a member of Yoons People Power Party at the moment, Kim has been polling better than other conservative contenders. I tendered my resignation and decided to run because the people want it, people I know want it, and I feel a sense of responsibility to solve national difficulties, Kim told reporters. Economic conditions during a severe national crisis are hurting peoples livelihoods, he said. I thought that all politicians and people should unite to overcome the crisis and work together to help the country develop further, Kim said. Ahn Cheol-soo, a PPP lawmaker who was its first to vote for Yoons impeachment, also declared his intention to run on Tuesday, saying he was a cleaner candidate than anyone else. He also vowed to secure new economic growth engines including artificial intelligence, to counter Trumps trade policies. Ahn fought the last three presidential elections, winning more than 21 of the popular vote in 2017, but dropping out and endorsing other candidates in the other two. He is not polling high enough to be included in most recent surveys. Kim and Ahn will join a wide open field of conservative candidates trying to overcome their partys second impeachment in as many presidencies. Conservative Park Geun-hye was impeached, removed from office, and imprisoned in 2017 over a corruption scandal. Lee Jae-myung, the populist leader of the liberal Democratic Party who lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in 2022, is a clear front-runner, but faces legal challenges of his own. These include multiple trials for charges such as violating the election law and bribery. Nevertheless, he is expected to step down as DP leader and declare his candidacy as soon as this week. A Gallup poll published on Friday showed 34 of respondents supported Lee as the next leader, while 9 backed Kim, 5 opted for former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, 4 chose Daegu mayor Hong Joon-pyo, and 2 plumped for Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon. Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court for violating his official duty by issuing a martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops in a bid to halt parliamentary proceedings. The law requires a new presidential election to be held within 60 days if the position becomes vacant. Yoon still faces criminal insurrection charges, with arguments in his trial to begin on April 14. South Korea has faced months of political turmoil since Yoon stunned the country by declaring martial law, triggering his impeachment by parliament and the impeachment of acting leader Han. Hans impeachment was later overturned by the Constitutional Court and he will stay in the role of acting president until the election. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 8, 2025 11:10 am",
        "content": "New Democratic Front (NDF) Parliamentarian Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, who was arrested over the alleged misappropriation of funds belonging to the Uva Provincial Council, has been granted bail. The order was issued by the Colombo Magistrates Court. Yesterday, he was remanded until 21 April by the Badulla Magistrates Court over a separate case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). The order was issued by the Colombo Chief Magistrate, Thanuja Lakmali. Yesterday, he was remanded until 21 April by the Badulla Magistrates Court over a separate case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). MP Dassanayake is accused of misappropriating a sum of Rs. 1 million of the Uva Provincial Council in 2016. Considering the submissions made by the prosecution and the defence, the Chief Magistrate ordered MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake to be released on a Rs. 50,000 cash bond and two surety bails amounting to Rs. 2 million each. He has also been imposed an overseas travel ban. Appearing for MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa then requested the magistrate to allow his client to attend Parliamentary sittings scheduled for today and tomorrow. Accordingly, the Magistrate announced that there is no impediment to permit him to attend Parliamentary sittings. The case will be taken up for hearing once again on 17 June. MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was taken into custody on March 27, over three separate corruption-related cases. The Colombo Magistrates Court previously granted bail in two of the cases but ordered him placed in remand custody over the third charge. The allegations stem from his tenure as Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016. According to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission filed the case against the MP, citing the government incurred a financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions.",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has personally written to United States President Donald Trump on ways to mitigate the impact and reduce the tariffs imposed recently, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha Fernando announced in Parliament. Deputy Minister Fernando said the White House has also acknowledged the letter sent by the Head of State. Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha stressed that the new government is focused on reducing the trade deficit with the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump. In response to a question raised by New Democratic Front (NDF) Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament today, Deputy Minister Fernando noted that data from the last five years indicate the trade deficit with the US is at 88 per cent. The Deputy Minister of Economic Development noted that apparel, food and three other items account for 85 per cent of the total exports to the United States. He said they are subject to tariffs and paratariffs, but the recent levies announced by President Donald Trump were calculated based on the trade deficit between countries and the US. Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha Fernando defended the actions of the incumbent government saying they took proactive and reactive measures to lessen the adverse impact of the tariffs on local businesses. The Deputy Minister confirmed another round of discussions will be held tonight (8) with the Office of the US Trade Representatives. Deputy Minister Fernando noted that the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US has been actively discussing with the Trump administration since February this year. He said discussions were held previously with US representatives where it was acknowledged that the on-going situation is not merely between Sri Lanka and the US. Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha Fernando said countries like India did not manage to reduce the tariffs as the calculation was made by a common formula. He said therefore the government will take pragmatic decisions to lessen the impact the tariffs will have on local businesses.",
