        "content": "Police have arrested four more suspects for aiding and abetting the wanted murder suspect, notoriously known as Booru Muna to escape from police custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. Wanted criminal Booru Moona, who is said to have been involved in 13 murders including the killing of a shop owner in Hanwella on December 18, 2022, had fled after escaping from police custody on February 24, following his arrest at the BIA. The suspect had been arrested by the airport police when he arrived at the airport to board a flight to Dubai using a forged passport. Police mentioned that the four suspects were arrested yesterday (March 13), on the charges of providing transport facilities for the suspect to flee, sheltering and providing food for the suspect. The arrested suspect, aged between 38 and 43 years, have been identified as residents of Katuwellegama, Negombo and Minuwangoda areas. In addition, two cars used by Booru Muna and other four suspects have also been taken into police custody. The arrestees will be produced before the Negombo Magistrates Court today.",

        "content": "Following the directives of Islamabad courts to arrest Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan, sources said the Islamabad police will visit Zaman Park in the next 24 hours to arrest the former prime minister, reported Geo News. Notably, a sessions court in Islamabad issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Mr Khan in a case of threatening a female judge belonging to a court in the federal capital. Mr Khan was booked in a case for threatening judicial magistrate Zeba Chaudhry and police officers at a rally in F-9 Park on August 20, to terrorise police officers and the judiciary, reported Geo News. Earlier in the day, Civil Judge Rana Mujahid Rahim released the three-page reserved verdict and issued non-bailable arrest warrants over Mr Khans repeated non-appearance. The former prime minister, instead of attending the hearing, filed a plea for an exemption from physically appearing before the judge, requesting permission for joining the court proceedings virtually via video link, reported Geo News. Desperate to put him behind bars, a police party from Islamabad earlier in the day flew by helicopter to Lahore to arrest the PTI chairman -- who was ousted as the prime minister last year in April. The sources told Geo News that several decisions were taken during a meeting between Islamabad and Lahores police officials -- as the law enforcers came to the city for the second time to arrest Mr Khan. The meetings participants decided that the Islamabad police would be completely supported and it will be ensured that the capitals cops reach Mr Khans Zaman Park residence with no hindrances, sources said.

Further, the Colombo Fort Magistrate has been ordered to refrain from taking any action against the former Head of State pertaining to the said private plaint, until a verdict is delivered following the writ application hearing. This order was given by a two-member judge bench comprising Appeals Court President, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar. The private plaint had been filed by Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini and a victim of the terror attacks against the former President over his failure to prevent the calamity despite receiving forewarnings from intelligence agencies. After taking into consideration this private plaint, the Fort Magistrate had issued summons to Sirisena, instructing him to appear before the court. Later, the former President lodged a writ application before the Appeals Court, alleging that the manner in which the summons were issued is unlawful, thus seeking a writ order revoking the summons.",

        "title": "Tech giants and Ottawas fight over paying for news could have global impacts: experts",
        "date": "March 14, 2023 01:03 pm",
        "content": "The stakes for Meta and Google in their stand-off with the federal Liberal government over sharing revenues with news publishers are bigger than just what happens in Canada. The fight over C-18, the Online News Act, will likely have international repercussions for the tech giants, industry watchers say. This is a game of chicken and so theyre asking now, is the government gonna blink? said Carleton University professor Dwayne Winseck. On Friday, MPs from all major political parties united in taking Google to task for blocking some Canadians access to news on the companys platforms. Google said it was a test, in anticipation of Bill C-18 becoming law, and would be ending after five weeks. Meta confirmed over the weekend it would remove news content from Facebook and Instagram if the Online News Act, as its currently written, becomes law. The legislation would require Google and Facebooks parent company Meta to reach commercial deals with publishers. Postmedia, publisher of the National Post, is in favour of the legislation, which is currently in front of the Senate. Other countries are in the process of developing similar legislation to Bill C-18, said McGill University media professor Taylor Owen. That means the tech giants are mindful of what precedents will be set in Canada. If its seen as working here, its going to be adopted and built on in half-a-dozen to a dozen other countries within the next year or two, he said. And that is a legitimate concern for them financially. Both companies have taken issue with language in Bill C-18 that they say will effectively force them to pay for links to news content. Google told a parliamentary committee Friday the bill puts a price on free links to webpages, setting a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundations of the open web and the free flow of information. Meta spokesperson Lisa Laventure said in an emailed statement that a legislative framework that compels us to pay for links or content that we do not post, and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platforms, is neither sustainable nor workable. She said the company is taking the same position it previously took in the United States. Given the international context, C-18 is a precedent that Google and Facebook want to avoid at all costs, Owen said. That might mean that theyre willing to go further than we might have thought, or that might seem reasonable or rational if it was just about the Canadian market, he said. Similar bills are underway in United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Brazil and other countries. If C-18 becomes law, Canada could become the second country in the world to pass news revenue-sharing legislation aimed at the two tech giants. The first was Australia, which experienced a similar face-off with Google and Facebook before making last-minute amendments to the legislation. The issue in the Australian case wasnt how the legislation treats links, but how companies are designated as entities covered by the act. If companies reach commercial deals with publishers, they are not designated as entities and the bargaining code does not come into force. Although the Australian legislation became law in 2021, the bargaining code hasnt actually been triggered to come into effect. Canadas Bill C-18 is based on a similar idea of forcing the companies to reach commercial deals, but differs in execution, and in that the Canadian regulations would be in effect no matter what. In Canada, the companies would avoid mandatory arbitration if the CRTC deems the commercial deals as fair. Critics say Bill C-18s premise that companies need to compensate publishers for making news available, including by including an index, aggregation or ranking of news content, effectively puts a value on links to news stories. Internet advocacy group OpenMedia has argued links and clicks are the only quantifiable criteria that can be used to determine value under the bill. But supporters of the bill take issue with how Meta and Google describe the issue of value for links, and note the legislation doesnt actually mention links. Paul Deegan, president of publishers group News Media Canada, said there is no link tax in C-18. If parties have concerns, they should be constructive and propose specific wording changes. Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said in an emailed statement C-18 has nothing to do with how Facebook makes news available to Canadians. All were asking Facebook to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work. This is part of a disappointing trend this week that tech giants would rather pull news than pay their fair share. Taylor said he doesnt see a potential compromise. The word link doesnt appear anywhere in the legislation. It has just been suggested, quite reasonably I think, that it could be one form of evaluating value or determining value, but its not dictated So I dont see what the compromise is on that. Winseck said the international precedent could also be a harmful one for the companies. Canada right now is amongst an international group who are working on these issues, he said. Google and Facebook can pound their chests all they want right now, but even if they were to be victorious here in Canada, it would be a pyrrhic victory. They would lose so much respect and possibly contracts in Canada, and theres other governments just waiting in line. Source - National Post -Agencies",

        "date": "March 14, 2023 02:17 pm",
        "content": "China will reopen its borders to foreign tourists for the first time in the three years since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted by allowing all categories of visas to be issued from Wednesday. The removal of this last cross-border control measure imposed to guard against COVID-19 comes after authorities last month declared victory over the virus. Tourist industry insiders do not expect a massive influx of visitors in the short run or significant boost to the economy. In 2019, international tourism receipts accounted for just 0.9 of Chinas gross domestic product. But the resumption of visa issuance for tourist marks a broader push by Beijing to normalise two-way travel between China and the world, having withdrawn its advisory to citizens against foreign travel in January. Areas in China that required no visas before the pandemic will revert to visa-free entry, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday. This will include the southern tourist island of Hainan, a long-time favourite destination among Russians, as well as cruise ships passing through Shanghai port. Visa-free entry for foreigners from Hong Kong and Macau to Chinas most prosperous province, Guangdong, will also resume, a boon particularly to high-end hotels popular among international business travellers. The announcement that China will resume issuing nearly all type of visas for foreigners from tomorrow is positive for Australian businesses whose executives would like to travel to here to visit their China-based teams, customers and suppliers and to explore new business opportunities in the mainland market, said Vaughn Barber, chairman of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in China. Chinese events open to foreign visitors - such as the China Development Forum in Beijing later this month and the Shanghai Autoshow in April - are gradually resuming. The once-every-four-years Asian Games will also take place in the eastern city of Hangzhou in September after being postponed last year due to Chinas COVID concerns. But prospective visitors might not immediately arrive in droves. Unfavourable views of China among western democracies have hardened due to concerns over human rights and Beijings aggressive foreign policy, as well as suspicions surrounding handling of COVID-19, a global survey by the Pew Research Center in September showed. In terms of tourism, China is no longer a hotspot destination, said an executive at China International Travel Services in Beijing, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Commercially, the wish of foreigners to run events in China also decreased after COVID, because too many things here are impacted by politics which has scared them off. GEOPOLITICS In a further relaxation of controls on outbound tourism, China added another 40 countries to its list for which group tours are allowed, bringing the total number of countries to 60. But the list still excludes Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States. Ties between those countries deepened as Washington faced off with Beijing over issues from Russia and Ukraine to Chinese military presence in the South China Sea. Its common to use tourist visas to come to China on business, but I dont know how enthusiastic institutional investors will be to do so, after all the drumbeat of scary news, said Duncan Clark, founder of BDA, a Beijing-based investment consultancy. In 2022, just 115.7 million cross-border trips were made in and out of China, with foreigners accounting for around 4.5 million. By contrast, China logged 670 million overall trips in 2019 before the arrival of COVID, with foreigners accounting for 97.7 million. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take necessary diplomatic steps to secure the early release of 16 fishermen apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy. He also requested the prime minister initiate steps for the release of a total of 102 fishing boats seized by the neighbours over the years. In his letter to PM Modi, Stalin cited the capture of the fishermen and their two mechanised fishing boats by the Sri Lankan Navy on March 12. This is the third incident of attackarrest of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan nationalsNavy within a month and as you are aware, these fishermen are solely dependent on their fishing activity for livelihood and such frequent incidents shatter the livelihood of poor fishermen and also create fear psychosis in their mind, he said. Stalin said he had brought the issue to the notice of the Ministry of External Affairs, which took up the matter with the Sri Lankan government. However, despite such moves, incidents like these continue to take place, Stalin added. Stalin sought PM Modis personal intervention in the matter to protect the traditional fishing rights of fishermen. As of now, 102 fishing boats of Tamil Nadu are under the custody of Sri Lanka and six fishing boats which Sri Lanka released are yet to be repatriated back to India, the letter noted.

        "content": "In an open letter to Sri Lankas official bilateral creditors and the Paris Club creditors, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested to foster the coordination required for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported programme. The President has also assured transparency and regular reporting on Sri Lankas indebtedness in the letter, President Wickremesinghe has praised the diligence and expressed his gratitude to the Paris Club creditors and Japan in particular, and to India and China for enabling the cooperation required to arrive at this point and explicitly delivering IMF-compatible financing assurances. He has conveyed gratitude for other creditor countries that answered the Paris Club creditors call to join them. Further, he has mentioned in the letter that the Sri Lankan government has deployed all efforts to demonstrate its commitment to the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) program and relentlessly engage on the path to reforms. Our administration has already implemented major reforms by way of prior actions agreed with the IMF, it added. The President also highlighted that this is an unprecedented critical period for the countrys economic well-being and future development. Thus, a robust reform agenda aimed at achieving debt sustainability, strengthening governance, widening the social safety nets supporting the most vulnerable, and ensuring the growth of an inclusive economy attractive to international business, has been introduced. He said this is how the government would improve peoples lives and ensure they are first in line to benefit from improvements in our economic conditions. The IMF-supported program will be critical to achieving this vision for our country, he claimed. Hence, this new era starts with the full implementation of the IMF-supported program and the resolution of Sri Lankas debt situation with the official bilateral creditors as longstanding partners, as well as with the commercial creditors. The Head of State also called on the Paris Club bilateral partners, Japan in particular, together with all other official bilateral partners, including India and China, to garner and foster coordination. We commit to communicating transparently with all of you on any debt treatment terms that are agreed with any creditor or group of creditors, before being formalized. In the same vein, we commit to reporting regularly on our indebtedness, ensuring no financial liabilities incurred by the country are undisclosed, he added. The relevant letter also ensured that Sri Lanka committed not to resume debt service to any creditor unless that creditor agrees on a comprehensive debt treatment in line with IMF-supported program parameters and the comparability of treatment principle. Further, the commitment to a comparable treatment of all external creditors, to ensure all-around equitable burden sharing for all restructured debts, is also reiterated in the presidents letter to the official bilateral creditors. We will not conclude debt treatment agreements with any official bilateral creditor or any commercial creditor or any group of such creditors on terms more favourable than those agreed under any multilateral platform put forward by our official bilateral creditors. Offering a debt treatment outside the perimeter set by the debt targets under the IMF program would risk making Sri Lankas debt unsustainable again, the President pointed out. He promised not to make any side arrangements with any creditor aimed at reducing the debt treatment impact on that creditor. Open Letter From President ... by Adaderana Online",

        "date": "March 15, 2023 07:39 am",
        "content": "A team of CID officers has brought back the notorious drug dealers and criminal figures Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu to the island this morning (March 15). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) dispatched a team to Madagascar earlier this week to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Kudu Salindu who were arrested while on a visit to the Indian Ocean island off the southeastern coast of Africa. After being extradited from Madagascar, the criminal duo was brought to Indias Mumbai International Airport and was supposed to be repatriated to Sri Lanka on Tuesday (March 14). The CID team was forced to defer the repatriation to today owing to a flight delay. Escorted by the CID team and two defence officials from Madagascar, Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) from Mumbai, at around 7.10 a.m. this morning. They were later escorted to the CID headquarters in Colombo, under tight security, for onward investigations. According to Ada Derana correspondent, security had been beefed up near the Katunayake airport ahead of the arrival of the notorious criminal duo. On March 08, the defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka of the arrest of 08 suspects including Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu. Foreign media reported that a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father were also among the suspects arrested in Madagascar on March 01. LExpress, a leading media network in Madagascar, mentioned that the suspects had been taken into custody at the Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo, Madagascar, while trying to fly out of the country. The arrests had been made in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. According to LExpress, five Sri Lankan suspects had landed in Nosy Be on a private jet on February 12. The group later travelled to Antananarivo on a domestic flight the following day. After staying at two hotels in Ivato and Ambohimangakely, the suspects reached the airport in two luxury cars. The gendarmes (paramilitary police officers in France or French-speaking countries) had recognized and arrested them with the help of the red notices previously issued by the INTERPOL. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata had posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others pretended to be his bodyguards. The two luxury cars and the mobile phones of the suspects were also seized by the Madagascar law-enforcement authorities. Further, a sum of Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 32 million found on the woman who claimed to be the wife of Harak Kata was also confiscated. Earlier, Sri Lankas Defence Ministry had said necessary measures were taken through the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles to extradite the arrestees from Madagascar, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission there. After being officially informed of the arrest of the suspects, a group of local law-enforcement authorities comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police attached to the CID departed for Madagascar, along with two Special Task Force personnel. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. The Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on October 03, 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation.",

        "title": "Only 13 countries, territories had healthy air quality in 2022  report",
        "date": "March 15, 2023 10:20 am",
        "content": "Only 13 of the worlds countries and territories had healthy air quality last year, according to a new report, as air pollution surged to alarming levels in 2022. The report by IQAir, a company that tracks air quality worldwide, found that average annual air pollution in roughly 90 of the countries and territories analyzed exceeded the World Health Organizations air quality guidelines, which are designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. IQAir analyzed average air quality from 131 countries and territories, and found that just six countries  Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand  and seven territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, including Guam and Puerto Rico, met the WHO air quality guidelines, which call for an average air pollution level of 5 micrograms per cubic meter or less. Seven countries  Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kuwait and India  had poor air quality that far exceeded the WHO guidelines with average air pollution over 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. When inhaled, the PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health problems including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. WHO tightened its annual air pollution guidelines in September 2021, cutting the acceptable amount of fine particulate matter from 10 to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to the UN agency. If the latest guidelines had been applied back then, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. Top 10 countries with the worlds worst air pollution Chad was the country with the worst air quality in the world in 2022. On average, Chad measured 18 times higher than the five microgram safety threshold, according to the World Health Organizations guidelines. All 10 are developing countries. The report also continues to highlight a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. Although Africa saw improvement in the number of countries included in this years report compared with 2021, the continent still largely remains the most underrepresented. According to IQAir, only 19 out of 54 African countries had sufficient data available from their monitoring stations. Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, said that each time it adds a new country that once lacked air quality data  as it did with Chad in 2021  those countries inevitably wind up at the top of the most-polluted list. If you look at whats called satellite or modeled data, Africa is supposed to be probably the most polluted continent on the planet, but we dont have enough data, Hammes told CNN. What that means is theres a whole lot more data thats needed in order for us to truly determine what are the most polluted countries and cities in the world. But one of the biggest barriers right now, she said, is the way that governments currently monitor air quality. Hammes said most governments tend to invest in instruments that fail to accurately measure fine particulate matter in the air. In the United States, the report found air pollution improved significantly last year compared with 2021 due to a relatively mild wildfire season. Major US cities with the worst air quality Columbus, Ohio, was the US city with the worst air quality in 2022. Its pollution levels were 2.6 times higher than the World Health Organizations safety threshold. Coffeyville, Kansas, had the worst air quality in the US last year, which IQAir attributed to a nearby oil refinery. Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta and Chicago topped the list of major US cities with the worst air quality, though the researchers also noted that California was home to 10 of the 15 worst major cities for air pollution, including Los Angeles and Sacramento. Around the world, researchers said, the main sources of air pollution last year were wildfires and the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and energy production, which wreaks havoc on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities. This is literally about how we as a planet are continuing this unhealthy relationship with fossil fuels, Hammes said. We are still dependent on fossil fuels and fossil fuels are responsible for the majority of air pollution that we encounter on this planet. China, which had for decades been near the top of the list for the worst air pollution, continued to show improved air quality in 2022. Nearly 64 of the 524 cities analyzed in mainland China saw reductions in annual PM2.5. Still, IQAir notes that the countrys coal usage continues to be a major climate and environmental concern, and that despite the improvement, none of the Chinese cities actually met the annual WHO guidelines. Climate change-fueled wildfires, Hammes said, also play a significant role in worsening air quality, especially in the US. The report notes that wildfires in recent years have been rapidly erasing air quality improvements that the US has made over the past decade. Wildfires are very much so a global warming issue, and it is creating essentially unsafe conditions, Hammes said. Hammes said countries must learn from each other, noting that the countries with best air quality, for example, are the ones taking on specific actions to transition away from polluting industries and into greener forms of energy, such as solar and wind. She adds it is also important to expand air quality monitoring networks, especially in predominantly disadvantaged regions. For instance, despite Russias ongoing war in Ukraine, the IQAir report shows that Ukraine expanded air monitoring networks, collecting data from nearly triple the number of cities in 2022 than in 2021. What weve learned is that what gets measured gets done, Hammes said. We need to collect more data. We need to inform folks of this information, and it does need to be free and available, so that they can make more informed choices. Source - CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "A countrywide 24-hour token strike launched by the Professionals Trade Union Alliance (PTUA) has affected a multitude of services today (March 15). The trade union action was launched in protest of the recent tax revision, electricity tariff hike, and several other unpopular decisions made by the incumbent government. Accordingly, a number of trade unions affiliated with health, ports, electricity, railway, postal, banking, and education have joined the one-day strike. Health: Health professionals including the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and the All-Ceylon Nurses Union have launched the strike at all hospitals across the country. The GMOA kicked off its trade union action on Monday, bringing the functions at hospitals in four provinces  Western, Southern, Eastern, and Central  to a standstill, and expanded it the following day to the remaining five provinces; North-western, Northern, North-central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva. Meanwhile, the employees of laboratory services as well as the junior staff members of hospitals have also joined the strike. Education: It is reported that a low student turnout was observed in many schools today, as the trade unions of teachers and principals including the Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) and the Principal Grade Officers Association, too, pledged support for the token strike. As a result, Provincial Educational Directors were directed on Tuesday to postpone the end-of-term tests at schools, which were scheduled for today. In addition, the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) and the Association of Educational Professionals, too, have joined todays token strike. Transport: The Locomotive Engine Operators Union and several other railway trade unions have joined the 24-hour token strike, in support of the multisectoral trade union action. However, some other trade unions in the sector including the Railway Guards Union, Station Masters Union, and Railway Controllers Association decided otherwise. Meanwhile, leave of all categories of staff in Sri Lanka Railways was cancelled with effect from Tuesday, until further notice. The General Manager of Railways, W.A.D.S. Gunasinghe said 20 trains in total were in operation this morning amid the token strike. He attributed this to the committed service of railway employees. Ada Derana correspondents said police and army personnel had been dispatched to railway stations to ensure the smooth operation of trains. However, privately-owned passenger buses are up and running today, as the Private Bus Owners Association decided not to support the token strike. Electricity and water supply: Multiple trade unions in the electricity sector including the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) and the CEB Employees Union have decided to be on sick leave today to support the token strike of the PTUA. In the meantime, the employees of the National Water Supply  Drainage Board (NWSDB) have decided to withdraw from maintenance work today. Postal: The Postal and Telecommunication Services Union and the United Postal Services Trade Union Front have bolstered their trade union action by launching a 24-hour token today at all post offices, sub-post offices, head offices, main control offices, and the Central Mail Exchange. Banking: Ceylon Bank Employee Union (CBEU) and the Central Banks Trade Union Alliance, too, joined the multisectoral token strike today. They also staged strikes on Tuesday against the conduct of the government. Ports: Freedom Workers Union of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and several other trade unions affiliated with the sector have also supported the token strike. Over the past few days, the port employees were on a work-to-rule campaign, which they said incurred a loss of nearly 75 from the revenue earned through the ports and the Customs.",

        "date": "March 15, 2023 02:00 pm",
        "content": "The UK government has held a series of events for its new trade preferences scheme  Developing Countries Trading Scheme in Sri Lanka (DCTS), which is expected to come into effect this year. In a press release, the British High Commission in Colombo said the new scheme DCTS was designed to grow free and fair trade with 65 countries, including Sri Lanka. The DCTS intends to create jobs and boost the economies of these countries, the statement read, adding that it offers one of the most generous sets of trading preferences in the world and demonstrates the UKs commitment to building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with countries like Sri Lanka. The statement further explained that the DCTS would replace the UK Generalised Scheme of Preferences and will come into force in 2023. Under the scheme, Sri Lanka is eligible for zero tariffs on 92 of products. Over 150 additional products will be brought into scope of the new scheme, including milled grains, pet food products and dairy products. The main event on the DCTS was attended by Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and senior officials from the Department of Commerce, Export Development Board (EDB) and the Board of Investment (BOI). The event has been delivered in partnership with the Council for Business with Britain  the UK-Sri Lanka bilateral trade association. The UK officials, promoting the DCTS, have showcased high potential value chains and products that can benefit from the new scheme. This was based on research into UK retailers and consumers buying considerations, as well as insights from Sri Lankan producers, trade programmes and policymakers. British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Sarah Houlton OBE, commenting in this regard, said the UKs new DCTS aims to provide Sri Lankan and UK businesses with a fresh opportunity to diversify and deepen supply chains and reduce the cost of exporting to the UK. We hope businesses will take advantage of the great opportunities we have highlighted through our events this week. Meanwhile, UK Minister of State at the Department for Business and Trade, Nigel Huddleston said: The Developing Countries Trading Scheme will support businesses by giving them the tools to export duty-free to the UK, opening up markets and boosting consumer choice. We want to go bigger and further with our global trade links and the DCTS enables the UK to achieve this with developing countries. In its statement, the British High Commission said, while Sri Lanka exports numerous high value products to the UK including textiles, tea and rubber, there has been a steady decline in trade volumes between Sri Lanka and the UK since 2018. Under UK trade preferences, Sri Lankan exports will benefit from generous tariff cuts and new products will be brought into scope, facilitating access to the UK market for Sri Lankan businesses across a wide range of industries, it read further. During the visit to Colombo, DCTS officials also met the Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Food Security, Hon. Nalin Fernando. They additionally delivered further information sessions and engagements in partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Department of Commerce, EDB, and BOI, Joint Apparel Association Federation, European Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Sri Lanka, and Rotary International. The sessions focused on sharing insights including current trends, UK market purchasing criteria, barriers to trade and what can be done to unlock Sri Lankas trade and investment potential. Attendees were also briefed about other key trade-related information including quality certification and customs requirements.",

The suspects mother Shirani Malkanthi Fernando had lodged the writ application before the Appeals Court today, raising concerns about potential threats to her sons life and seeking an interim order instructing the Criminal Investigation Department to ensure his safety. Representing the Attorney General, Deputy Solicitor General Shanil Kularatne raised objections when the writ application was called before a two-member bench comprising Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and A. Marikkar earlier today. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetti told the court that his client has informed him of the potential threats to the life of her son. Pointing out that slain underworld leader Makandure Madush and other such criminal figures had been shot dead by the Sri Lanka Police previously, under the pretext of escorting them to recover hidden weapons, the presidents counsel said the petitioner is deeply concerned that her son would suffer a similar fate. The Deputy Solicitor General, stressing that the particulars mentioned in the petition are baseless, requested the Appeals Court bench to dismiss the petition at first instance without taking it up for consideration. Taking into account the submission made by the two sides, the Appeals Court president decided to call the petition on March 20 and directed the Attorney General to convey the stance of respondents named in the petition on that day. The director and the DIG of the Criminal Investigation Department, the Inspector-General of Police, the Attorney General, the Defence Secretary and the Commandant of the Police Special Task Force have been named as respondents of this writ application. Kudu Salindu was brought back to Sri Lanka early this morning, along with the notorious criminal gang leader Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and six others after they were arrested in Madagascar on March 01.",

We shouldnt sabotage these necessary yet long overdue reforms for political reasons, Sabry said, emphasisng that although governments may come and go, the state must be preserved and protected. The Minister made these remarks in reference to a recent statement made by Duminda Hulangamuwa, the Vice Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and a Senior Partner and the Head of Tax at Ernst  Young on the countrys road to recovery. Speaking at the National Law Conference, Hulangamuwa stated that Sri Lanka may be the first country in the world to have recovered from an economic crisis in such a short time. We are now in sight of the IMF agreement approval and with it more positive economic sentiments like more FDI and better credit facilities will come Sri Lankas way If you take these positive factors into consideration Sri Lanka may be the first country in the world to have recovered from an economic crisis in such a short time, he said, comparing Sri Lankas economic crisis to those faced by Greece and Lebanon. Hulangamuwa further explained that owing to certain decisions taken by the government, although unpopular, several adversities faced by the people of Sri Lanka including fuel queues, extensive power cuts, gas shortages and rising inflation have disappeared, while the Sri Lankan Rupee too, has strengthened. He also attributed the recent appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar to the decisions taken by the incumbent government, stating that it is not an artificial scenario.",

        "date": "March 15, 2023 06:44 pm",
        "content": "Two Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions were filed before the Supreme Court today, challenging the recent electricity tariff hike. One petition was lodged by Asoka Abeygunawardana against several respondents, including the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and its members, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Lanka Electricity Company (LECO). Abeygunawardena filed the FR petition in his capacity as a citizen of Sri Lanka, as well as in the interest of the general public, and majorly challenged the process through which the members of PUCSL made the decision on the recent electricity tariff hike, excluding PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake. He claimed that the decision in question was ultra vires, unreasonable, irrational, arbitrary, evidently biased and in violation of legitimate expectations of his rights and other electricity consumers. The engineer, who currently serves as the Executive Director of the Energy Forum, further claimed that the tariff hike imposed for the lower units could cause irreparable damage to the low-income sectors, emphasizing that the PUCSL is bound to ensure that the interests of all consumers are being considered when approving such revisions. He stated this while explaining that increases such as 275 for units between 0  30, 270 for units between 31  60 and 162.5 for units between 61  90 could result in low-income earners, including himself, not being able to consume electricity at all. Abeygunawardanas FR petition will be instructed by Attorney-at-Law J D Ariyanayagam and supported by Presidents Counsel M. A. Sumanthiran, Attorney-at-Law Viran Corea. The second petition was filed by the Electricity  Renewable Energy Consumers Association, Ven. Matara Ananda Sagara Thero and four others, claiming that the electricity tariff revision approved by the PUCSL members on February 15 is arbitrary, wrongful, discriminatory, irrational and unreasonable. They stressed that the move disproportionately affects low-income people who consume between 0-90 kWh per month. The petitioners allege that the PUCSL and its members have approved the 2023 tariff revision proposed by the CEB in its entirety which makes no change to the energy charge for high-consumption users of electricity, and without subscribing to the statutory process specifically set out in the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009, which casts a duty on the PUCSL and its members to protect the interests of all consumers. This FR petition is supported by Presidents Counsel Saliya Pieris with Attorneys-at-Law Niranjan Arulpragasam and Suren Gnanaraj, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Manjula Balasooriya.",

The criminal duo was repatriated to the island from Madagascar this morning (March 15). The CID dispatched a team, comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police of the CID and two Special Task Force personnel, to Madagascar earlier this week to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Kudu Salindu who were arrested while on a visit to the Indian Ocean island off the southeastern coast of Africa. After being extradited from Madagascar, the criminal duo was brought to Indias Mumbai International Airport via Kenyas Nairobi and was supposed to be repatriated to Sri Lanka on Tuesday (March 14). The CID team was forced to defer the repatriation by one day due to a flight delay. Escorted by the CID team and two defence officials from Madagascar, Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) from Mumbai, at around 7.10 a.m. this morning. After being held at the airport for nearly 30 minutes, the duo was produced before the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of Colombo, before being escorted under tight security to the CID headquarters in Colombo for onward investigations. It was reported that the security had been beefed up near the Katunayake airport premises ahead of the arrival of the notorious criminal duo. On March 08, the defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka of the arrest of 08 suspects including Kudu Salindu, Harak Kata, a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father. They had been arrested in Madagascar on March 01, in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The INTERPOL had previously issued Red Notices against Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata had posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others pretended to be his bodyguards. The extradition process was coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. The Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on October 03, 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, 06 robberies and transnational drug trafficking. He has reportedly smuggled in nearly 670kg of heroin to Sri Lanka via sea routes. Meanwhile, Kudu Salindu is accused of orchestrating at least 09 murders and fatally injuring four others. Against this backdrop, the mother of Kudu Salindu filed a writ application before the Court of Appeal, raising deep concerns about the potential threats to her sons life. She has sought interim orders directing the CID to ensure her sons safety. When the writ application was called before the Appeals Court, the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General requested the judge bench to dismiss the petition at first instance, without taking it up for hearing.",

Booru Muna, accused of shooting a restaurant owner dead in Hanwella on December 18 last year, was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on February 24 while trying to board a flight to Dubai using a forged passport. However, he had fled police custody with the help of two Buddhist monks. At the time of his arrest, Booru Muna has confessed to taking shelter in a house located on Malwatta Road in Millaniya, Bandaragama, after the murder of the said restaurant owner. He is believed to have been the gunman in a number of killings. Meanwhile, an active serving member of the Sri Lanka Navy, his wife and four others are now under arrest for aiding and abetting Booru Muna following his escape last month.",

        "date": "March 16, 2023 09:34 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy shrank 7.8 in 2022 from the previous year, government data showed on Wednesday, as the country struggled with its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades. The islands fourth-quarter GDP contracted 12.4, according to the figures. Sri Lankas growth is expected to shrink by 3 this year, Moodys Investors Service said on Monday but growth is expected to rebound in 2024. Economic mismanagement coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic left Sri Lanka severely short of dollars for essential imports at the start of last year tipping the country into the worst financial crisis since Independence from the British in 1948. Sri Lanka is waiting for a 2.9 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be finalised on March 20. These numbers are broadly in line with expectations. In the last three months of 2022 Sri Lanka was hit by very high inflation, fuel shortages and high interest rates, said Sanjeewa Fernando, Senior Vice President Research at Asia Securities. For the rest of this year, with IMF funds expected, the central bank should be able to keep the currency strengthened, eventually reduce interest rates, and continue to see inflation ease. The state-run Census and Statistics Department said that the agriculture sector shrank 4.6, while industries contracted 16, and services dropped 2, from a year earlier. Sri Lankas economy shrank 11.8 in the July-September quarter from a year ago, the second-worst quarterly contraction ever for the country. Sri Lanka aims to announce a debt-restructuring strategy in April and step up talks with commercial creditors ahead of an IMF review of a bailout package in six months, its central bank governor told Reuters last Thursday.

        "content": "The collective of professionals trade unions has put a temporary halt to their strike actions from today (March 16), after their countrywide one-day token strike on Wednesday. The token strike on Wednesday was joined by at least 40 trade unions in multiple sectors including health, postal, ports, banking, education and electricity. Members of the public were afflicted as many services, notably in the health sector, were crippled by the one-day trade union action. However, after taking into account the assurances given by the Presidential Secretariat, the views and opinions of trade union members as well as the inconveniences caused to the general public, the Professionals Trade Union Alliance (PTUA) decided to temporarily call off the token strike. Accordingly, the island-wide 24-hour strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) at all government hospitals came to an end at 8.00 a.m. today. Calling a media briefing on Wednesday, GMOAs media spokesperson Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe said they would not continue their trade union actions until the demands are met. In the meantime, the railway services returned to normalcy today, after only about 20 trains were operated on Wednesday due to the token strike of the Locomotive Engine Operators Union and several other employee associations. The trade unions of teachers and principals have also decided to temporarily cancel their token strike from today, the chief secretary of Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Joseph Stalin said. Nevertheless, the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) president Prof. Shyama Banneheka said they would continue the trade union action as satisfactory solutions were not provided for their demands. Meanwhile, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya stressed that the countrys gross national product has incurred a loss of LKR 46 billion as a result of Wednesdays token strike.",

        "date": "March 16, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Fourteen people have died and several others are missing after floods swept through the streets of two cities in south-east Turkey devastated by last months earthquakes. Among the victims were quake survivors who had been living in container homes since the quakes. Cars tumbled on a torrent of floodwater through the streets of Sanliurfa, where 12 people died. A container housing two families in Adiyaman was caught up in the floods. A woman living in the container was among two people killed in the city. Several others were reported missing. Tents in the city were evacuated. The latest disaster came only five weeks after the twin earthquakes on 6 February in which 48,000 people were killed and many more left homeless. Search and rescue organisation Afad said that in one 24-hour period, 136mm (5.4in) of rain had fallen in one area of Adiyaman province and 111mm (4.4in) in Sanliurfa, which saw a third of its annual rainfall in the past two days. The governor of Sanliurfa, Salih Ayhan, said his province had never seen flooding like it and officials appealed to residents to evacuate the ground floor and basements of homes. The bodies of five people were found in a basement apartment and Turkish media said they were Syrians. Bodies were also recovered from an underpass at the major Abide road junction. Several people were dragged off in their vehicles by the current of the floodwaters and people who tried to help those stranded were themselves swept away. Dramatic footage emerged of a man being pulled out of the torrent in Sanliurfa by a local dangling a rope from a ground-floor window. A similar rescue took place at the Abide junction. Two of the missing were firefighters, said the governor, who appealed to residents to keep well away from the moving water. A hospital was flooded and 200 patients moved elsewhere. The rain is due to die down towards the end of the week. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is grappling with the aftermath of last months earthquake, is facing elections on 14 May. He has sent the interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, to the flood region. Leading opposition figures are also due to visit Sanliurfa, and have vowed to help meet the urgent needs of residents.

A group of individuals including the Minister of Public Security, the Defence Secretary, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province and the Director of the CID have been named as the respondents of the petition. The relevant writ petition has been filed by Nelson Mervin Wickremeratne, the father of Harak Kata, requesting the Appellate Court to immediately issue an order to the respondents to ensure his sons safety, who is currently detained by the CID. Moreover, the petitioning party seeks an order granting permission for Harak Katas lawyers and relatives to meet him. Furthermore, the petitioner, who seeks an order to be issued ordering the respondents not to take the detained suspect to outside locations for investigation purposes, has also requested the court to order that the suspects hands and feet be shackled if he is taken to any outside locations. The petitioner has further requested the Court of Appeal to issue another order to the respondents to take necessary steps to ensure the safety of his son if he is released on bail under any circumstances. The CID dispatched a team to Madagascar earlier this week to repatriate Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Kudu Salindu who were arrested during a visit to the Indian Ocean island off the southeastern coast of Africa. The criminal duo was later brought to Indias Mumbai International Airport via Kenyas Nairobi and was repatriated to Sri Lanka on Wednesday (March 15). Later, the CID obtained an order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) last evening to detain and interrogate the two suspects for a period of 90 days. Meanwhile, the mother of Salindu Malshika Gunaratna alias Kudu Salindu had lodged the writ application before the Appeals Court yesterday, raising concerns about potential threats to her sons life and seeking an interim order instructing the CID to ensure his safety. The Attorney General (AG) requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the writ application at the first instance, after the Court of Appeal ordered the AG to inform his stance regarding the petition. In addition, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetti told the court that his client has informed him of the potential threats to the life of her son, pointing out that slain underworld leader Makandure Madush and other such criminal figures had been shot dead by the Sri Lanka Police previously, under the pretext of escorting them to recover hidden weapons. The presidents counsel also said that the petitioner is deeply concerned that her son would suffer a similar fate. At the same time, the Deputy Solicitor General, stressing that the particulars mentioned in the petition are baseless, requested the Appeals Court bench to dismiss the petition at first instance, without taking it up for consideration. Taking into account the submission made by the two sides, the Appeals Court president decided to call the petition on March 20 and directed the Attorney General to convey the stance of respondents named in the petition on that day.",

        "date": "March 16, 2023 08:10 pm",
        "content": "The Association of Community Medical Specialists says that only one patient is confirmed to have been infected with Listeria so far in Sri Lanka. Joining a press briefing today (March 16), the media convener of the association Dr. Naveen de Soyza mentioned that some facts circulating on social media are not, in fact, true. Speaking further, Dr. Soyza emphasized that although these reports claimed that two other patients had died due to Listeria infections, it is yet to be confirmed that they were infected with the bacteria. Meanwhile, special studies are being carried out surrounding Sri Pada (Adams Peak) area where the incidents were reported, Dr. Soyza noted. The doctor, who points out that Listeria can be infected through contaminated food, highlighted that diarrhea, stomachache, and fever may appear as symptoms, once infected. Furthermore, the patients may experience unconsciousness after being infected with the bacteria, according to Dr. Soyza. He stated that washing hands properly, maintaining cleanliness, and following proper hygienic practices are adequate to avoid this disease. In the meantime, when inquired by Ada Derana, the Public Health Inspectors Association says that 10 more patients diagnosed with suspected food poisoning and bacterial infections have been reported so far. In addition, the president of the association Upul Rohana urged all devotees and pilgrims to follow safe and hygienic food practices properly. He also requested the general public to bring boiled water from home as much as possible while going on pilgrimages. Listeriosis, the scientific name for the infection of Listeria is a serious infection caused by the germ Listeria monocytogenes in which people usually become ill after eating contaminated food, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States. The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It is rare for people in other groups to get sick with Listeria infection. Listeriosis is usually a mild illness for pregnant women, but it causes severe disease in the fetus or a newborn. The CDC also mentions that Listeria can cause fever and diarrhea as symptoms, similar to other foodborne germs. The disease can be treated with antibiotics, as per the reports of the CDC.",

        "content": "The Parliament of Sri Lanka, together with the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and USAID launched a parliamentary internship programme, providing young professionals and students with practical experience in policy development and public service. The programme was launched on 01 March in Parliament under the patronage of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, and Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, Chief of Staff and Deputy Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera and Assistant Secretary General Tikiri Jayathilaka. Senior Resident Country Director of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) Thusitha Pilapitiya and a group of officials were also present at the occasion, while the keynote speech was delivered by the Speaker . Following outreach efforts to all the national universities in Sri Lanka, a group of interns was carefully chosen from the eight universities who responded. Accordingly, eight state Universities, namely, Colombo, Sri Jayawardenapura, Kelaniya, Peradeniya, Rajarata, Jaffna, Ruhuna, and Sabaragamuwa have collaborated for the internship programme with a group of 35 selected interns. The programmes selection criteria and structure ensure a comprehensive and tailored experience, with the curriculum designed to develop skills and knowledge for different career paths. NDI, in collaboration with the parliament, conducted a three-day residential orientation program aimed at providing a deeper insight into the intern role. The programme featured several sessions covering legislative development, engaging with Parliament, and various modes of interaction with Parliament, conducted by the heads of departments and sections of the Parliament. The programme concluded with a recap and evaluation session by students, followed by an open discussion where interns had the opportunity to raise questions. Following a three-day orientation programme, the interns have been allocated to their respective departments, and throughout their internship period, they will receive hands-on working experience with the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The programmes curriculum promotes inclusivity, diversity, and skill development for different career paths, with the aim of creating goodwill ambassadors for parliament toaddress the trust deficit between parliament and youth, promote democracy, and educate young people about Parliament of Sri Lanka. The programme highlights the Parliaments commitment to the Open Parliament Initiative and aims to address the trust deficit between Parliament and youth while safeguarding democracy.",

Speaking in this regard, the Executive Director of PAFFREL, Rohana Hettiarachchi, accused the government of acting in a manner that was inconsiderate of the courts orders. Hettiarachchi further stated that the question of concern as of now is whether the government accepts that holding elections at the right time is a democratic right of the people. If the government does not give people the opportunity to express their opinion, then they (the government) must also accept responsibility for the adverse consequences that arise when people exercise their rights outside of the democratic framework, he said in this regard.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court today (16 March) granted leave to hear the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) pertaining to the 2023 Local Government (LG) election. Accordingly, the petition will be heard on 27 June 2023, as per an order issued by the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Gamini Amarasekera and Janak de Silva. The petition was filed by CPA Executive Director Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, seeking a verdict that the fundamental rights of the general public have been violated as a result of the 2023 LG polls not being held as scheduled. Attorney-at-Law Viran Corea, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, pointed out to the court that while the rights of the people were violated by deferring the election initially scheduled for 09 March, holding the election on this date would also violate the rights of those currently serving in the local government bodies, as holding an election prior to the termination of their term is unjust. The term of office of the local government bodies is scheduled to end on 19 March 2023. Meanwhile, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana told the court that although members of the Election Commission have been named as respondents to the petition, the CPA has failed to name the Commission itself as a respondent, thereby creating a legal deficiency. Thus, he stated that the petition cannot be considered without the Election Commission present before the court. The Supreme Court bench, however, permitted for the petition to be heard on 27 June, after hearing the facts presented by both parties, and ordered for the respondents to file their objections, if any.",

This was stated by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who explained that the decision to do so was taken after several accusations were made by the public about the procedures followed in this regard. Speaking at a press conference held this afternoon (16 March), the Minister stated that strict monitoring will be in place, following claims that several of those accused for drug-related charges have been falsely accused for revengeful reasons. Certain samples may be mistaken occasionally. But sometimes, nearly 20 -30 samples sent by the Police are wrong  substances which arent narcotics are being sent to be sampled as narcotics. It is evident that the law is being misused, and that certain reforms need to be made, the Minister said, adding that there is an extent of truth to the allegations made by the public against the system. Even if a person who has crushed paracetamol in his possession is presented before the court, he is remanded as someone who was in possession of narcotics. When the results of the tests conducted on the sampled substance are obtained months later, it is evident that the substance in question had no trace of drugs, he said.",

        "date": "March 17, 2023 08:38 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will introduce new central bank legislation aimed at bolstering the banks independence, accountability and also price stability in the country via a new inflation target, its governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said on Thursday. Sri Lanka is waiting for a 2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be finalised on March 20, and establishing a fully independent central bank is one of the key criteria for receiving the aid package. Economic mismanagement coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic left Sri Lanka severely short of dollars for essential imports at the start of last year, tipping the country into its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. The new legislation will prioritise controlling inflation and introduce an inflation target, Weerasinghe said, adding that the finance minister and the central bank would together agree on what that target should be. A separate governing board, consisting of six members and the governor, will be formed in addition to the monetary policy board, he added. The main point of this legislation is to empower the central bank to make the right decisions, not popular decisions, Weerasinghe said in a public speech on the new bill. With this new law a central bank governor can work independently and make decisions that cannot be changed according to the whims of the government in power. The central bank will be required to issue an inflation report every six months and will need to provide explanations to a parliamentary committee on its performance as and when necessary, Weerasinghe said. The central bank will also be released from the mandatory buying of unsold treasury bills at primary auctions, which will reduce the amount of money it prints, the central bank chief noted. Sri Lanka will also eventually set up a separate entity to raise funds to settle its sovereign debt, removing that responsibility from the central bank, once the new legislation is passed, Weerasinghe said.

        "content": "The International Football Federation (FIFA) has approved the suspension of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) from the organization and extended the suspension of the Zimbabwe Football Federation (ZIFA). The decision on the results of the vote was taken at the long-awaited 73rd Congress of the world football governing body, on Thursday in Kigali, Rwanda. Close to 2,000 delegates including top football executives from FIFA met in Kigali for the Congress. The FIFA Congress, the supreme legislative body of FIFA, brings together top executives from FIFA, confederations and representatives from 211-member associations and other football stakeholders. On Thursday, the FIFA Council recommended that congress participants confirm the temporary suspension of the Sri Lankan football governing body. During the vote, out of 211 FIFA member associations, 197 voted in favour of upholding the suspension. The suspension means that the national team and club teams of the country are not eligible to participate in international competitions until the decision is reversed. In addition, no member or official of the federation can benefit from FIFA development programmes, courses, or training. On 21 January 2023, FIFA announced the suspension of FFSL until further notice due to political interference, pursuant to a decision taken by the Bureau of the FIFA Council. The FFSL thereby lost all of its membership rights defined in Article 13 of FIFA Statutes. Further, the Congress cast 199 votes to extend the suspension of ZIFA over government interference. FIFA first took the decision to suspend ZIFA on 24 February 2022 and was confirmed on 31 March 2022. Meanwhile, Gianni Infantino was re-elected as the FIFA president until 2027 for a third term, after standing unopposed at the Congress. The 52-year-old Swiss Italian lawyer was first elected to office in February 2016 and was re-elected in June 2019. -with inputs from agencies",

One person was taken into custody in Maradana on Wednesday (March 15), based on a complaint filed by a woman who was defrauded of Rs. 450,000 for an employment opportunity in Kuwait. The suspect was later released on a surety bail of Rs. 500,000 and a cash bail of Rs. 10,000 after being produced before the Gampola Magistrates Court. The magistrate also imposed a foreign travel ban on him and ordered that his passport be surrendered to the court. Further hearing of the case has been fixed for May 09. Meanwhile, the second suspect was arrested for defrauding a man of Rs. 550,000 by promising a job opportunity in Oman. He was taken into custody when he was summoned to the Foreign Employment Bureau on March 09 for interrogations pertaining to a complaint filed by the victim. He was granted bail after being produced before the Kesbewa Magistrates Court on March 10. The magistrate, releasing him on two surety bails of Rs. 600,000 each, fixed further hearing of the case for October 10. In light of the increasing number of similar job scams, the Foreign Employment Bureau has urged the members of the public to be on alert and to ascertain that the relevant foreign employment agencies are registered with the SLFBE before proceeding with any payments.

        "content": "New Zealand said on Friday it would ban TikTok on devices with access to the countrys parliamentary network due to cybersecurity concerns, becoming the latest nation to limit the use of the video-sharing app on government-related devices. Concerns have mounted globally about the potential for the Chinese government to access users location and contact data through ByteDance, TikToks Chinese parent company. The depth of those concerns was underscored this week when the Biden administration demanded that TikToks Chinese owners divest their stakes or the app could face a U.S. ban. In New Zealand, TikTok will be banned on all devices with access to parliaments network by the end of March. Parliamentary Service Chief Executive Rafael Gonzalez-Montero said in an email to Reuters that the decision was taken after advice from cybersecurity experts and discussions within government and with other countries. Based on this information, the Service has determined that the risks are not acceptable in the current New Zealand Parliamentary environment, he said. Special arrangements can be made for those who require the app to do their jobs, he added. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Speaking at a media briefing, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said New Zealand operated differently from other nations. Departments and agencies follow the advice of the (Government Communications Security Bureau) in terms of IT and cybersecurity policies ... we dont have a blanket across the public sector approach, Hipkins said. Both New Zealands defence force and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said on Friday they had already implemented bans on TikTok on work devices. A spokesperson for the New Zealand Defence Force said in an email to Reuters the move was a precautionary approach to protect the safety and security of personnel. On Thursday, Britain banned the app on government phones with immediate effect. Government agencies in the U.S. have until the end of March to delete the app from official devices. TikTok has said it believes the recent bans are based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics, adding that it has spent more than 1.5 billion on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations.

Jaishankar today (17 March) inaugurated the Sri Lankan exhibition Geoffrey Bawa; It is Essential To be There, at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi. Speaking at the event which was held to mark the 75 years of Indo-Lanka diplomatic relations, Dr. Jaishankar stated that renowned architect Geoffery Bawa was a name that often resonated with Sri Lanka. When I think of Sri Lanka, the names, the images, the associations, Geoffrey Bawa is a figure that very naturally comes to mind, he said in this regard, adding that architects work has gone beyond the borders of the island nation. Speaking on the crisis Sri Lanka is currently facing, Dr. Jaishankar stated that it was very natural for India to step forward at such a time, as blood is thicker than water. For us it was natural at a moment of difficulty, that we should see what we could do within our resources, our capabilities, our efforts to stand by Sri Lanka at this very difficult time, he said. The Minster further assured the audience of his strong belief that Sri Lanka will overcome this crisis, if they keep their real friends standing by them. He also noted that the cultural element of the Indo-Lanka relationship has been focused on extensively since of late, and that it is evident through the various grants given by India in this regard.",

        "title": "ICC judges issue arrest warrant for Russian President",
        "date": "March 17, 2023 09:09 pm",
        "content": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant on Friday against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. The bold legal move will obligate the courts 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory. Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces have committed atrocities during its one-year invasion of its neighbour and the Kremlin branded the court decision as null and void. Neither Russia not Ukraine are members of the ICC, although Kyiv granted it jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed on its territory. The tribunal has no police force of its own and relies on member states to make arrests. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia found the very questions raised by the ICC outrageous and unacceptable. Asked if Putin now feared travelling to countries that recognised the ICC, Peskov said: I have nothing to add on this subject. Thats all we want to say. Stephen Rapp, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues under former president Barack Obama, said: This makes Putin a pariah. If he travels he risks arrest. This never goes away. Russia cannot gain relief from sanctions without compliance with the warrants. Putin is the third serving president to be the target of an ICC arrest warrant, after Sudans Omar al-Bashir and Libyas Muammar Gaddafi. Reuters reported earlier this week that the court was expected to issue warrants. DEPORTATION OF CHILDREN In its first warrant for Ukraine, the ICC called for Putins arrest on suspicion of unlawful deportation of children and unlawful transfer of people from the territory of Ukraine to the Russian Federation since Feb. 24, 2022. Hundreds of Ukrainian children have been taken from orphanages and childrens homes to Russia, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement on Friday. Many of these children, we allege, have since been given up for adoption in the Russian Federation. The alleged acts demonstrate an intention to permanently remove these children from their own country. At the time of these deportations, the Ukrainian children were protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Khan said his office will continue looking for additional suspects and will not hesitate to submit further applications for warrants of arrest when the evidence requires us to do so. Ukraines top prosecutor, Andriy Kostin, hailed the ICC move as a a historic decision for Ukraine and the entire international law system. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it was just the start of holding Russia accountable for its crimes and atrocities in Ukraine. Some Russians saw the hand of the United States in the ICC decision, although Washington, like Moscow, is not a state party. Yankees, hands off Putin! wrote parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, a close ally of the president, on Telegram, saying the move was evidence of Western hysteria. We regard any attacks on the President of the Russian Federation as aggression against our country, he said. The court also issued a warrant on Friday for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russias Commissioner for Childrens Rights, on the same charges. She responded to the news with irony, according to RIA Novosti agency: Its great that the international community has appreciated the work to help the children of our country. Ukraine has said more than 16,000 children have been illegally transferred to Russia or Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine. A U.S.-backed report by Yale University researchers last month said Russia has held at least 6,000 Ukrainian children in at least 43 camps and other facilities as part of a large-scale systematic network. Russia has not concealed a programme under which it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, but presents it as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. The ICCs Khan opened the investigation into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine a year ago. He highlighted during four trips to Ukraine that he was looking at alleged crimes against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The first consignment of eggs imported from India will reach Sri Lanka tomorrow (March 19), the State Trading (General) Corporation says. The shipment will carry two million eggs in total, according to a spokesperson of the corporation. The Sri Lankan government decided to import eggs in a bid to control the soaring prices of eggs and to address the shortage in the local market. However, imported eggs will not be sold at stores for general consumption. It has been decided that these eggs be sold at Rs. 40 or less for food manufacturers, as a preventive measure to avert bird flu from entering and spreading in the country. Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera recently gave directives to the relevant officials to expeditiously prepare a series of guidelines on how imported eggs should be handled in the bakery industry. It is recommended that gloves are used when handling imported eggs in the bakery industry and eggshells are safely discarded, ensuring that the remaining eggshells are not dumped on the environment under any circumstances. Meanwhile, ahead of the arrival of the first batch of imported eggs, the special commodity levy imposed on imported eggs has also been revised. Accordingly, the levy per egg was reduced from Rs. 50 to Rs. 1 for a period of three months, effective from February 21. The first shipment of imported eggs was scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka in late February, however, it was delayed due to certification matters.",

The suspect, who had been wanted for several murders, was arrested in Avissawella on Friday (March 17). On February 24, Booru Muna fled police custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake after he was barred from boarding a flight to Dubai owing to a travel ban previously issued by the court. Booru Muna had attempted to fly out of the country using a forged passport. However, two Buddhist monks had reportedly aided and abetted the suspects escape after he was taken into custody at the airport. At the time of his arrest, he had confessed to taking shelter at a house located on Malwatta Road in Millaniya, Bandaragama, after the murder of the said restaurant owner. Booru Muna, who is accused of shooting a restaurant owner dead in Hanwella on 18 December 2022, is also believed to have been the gunman in a number of killings. Following his escape, Avissawella High Court on March 15 once again barred the foreign travels of Booru Muna after taking into the submissions presented by the Western Province South police division. He is believed to have been the gunman in a number of killings. Meanwhile, an active serving member of the Sri Lanka Navy, his wife and four others are currently under arrest for aiding and abetting Booru Muna following his escape last month.",
