        "title": "iPhone owners get 92 payouts from Apple in phone-throttling settlement",
        "date": "January 9, 2024 02:52 pm",
        "content": "US-based iPhone users are finally getting long-awaited payments to compensate them for Apples decision to throttle the performance of iPhones with degraded batteries. Apple agreed to settle with iPhone users in March 2020, but class-action lawsuits and settlements often take years to be resolved and paid out. This case took a few years because the settlements court approval was temporarily vacated on appeal but later reinstated. The settlement was for a minimum of 310 million and a maximum of 500 million, including attorneys fees of 80.6 million and the costs of distributing the settlement fund. Apple agreed to provide 25 payments to affected users for each eligible iPhone, though that amount could have increased or decreased based on the number of approved claims. It seems the standard payment increased, as various people reported getting 92.17 payments this past weekend. I was one of the people who received an email notice stating I was eligible for the settlement about 3.5 years ago, and I submitted a claim on July 24, 2020. I received a 92.17 deposit to my bank account on Saturday that was labeled IN RE APPLE INC Payouts. iPhone owners were required to submit their claims by October 6, 2020. The payments were for US-based owners of an iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, or SE who experienced diminished performance on their devices while running affected versions of iOS before December 21, 2017. Why it took over three years As the most recent update on the settlement website notes, the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has dismissed the last remaining appeal in the In re Apple Inc. Device Performance Litigation, and the Effective Date of the Settlement, as described in the Settlement Agreement, occurred on November 6, 2023. Payments were scheduled for January 2024 based on the timeline that was set forth in the settlement. So what happened in the three-plus years since Apple agreed to the settlement? Heres a summary. After all iPhone owners claims were submitted in 2020, the US District Court for the Northern District of California heard arguments on the named plaintiffs motion for final approval of the settlement. The district court judge granted that final approval in March 2021. Several parties objected to the settlement, requiring the 9th Circuit appeals court to hear challenges. One appellant, called Best Companies, Inc., claimed that the district court provided inadequate notice of the settlement to nonnatural persons such as private companies. Best Companies is an Oklahoma-based construction company that said it bought at least 10 iPhones subject to the settlement for its employees. The construction companys objections were rejected by the 9th Circuit in its October 2022 order. A panel of judges agreed with the district court that the free media coverage and individual notice to device users was more than adequate to reach nonnatural persons. The October 2022 ruling also handled an appeal filed by several individuals who objected to the settlement. They didnt succeed in changing the settlement in any significant way, but their appeal forced the district court to fix problems in its original order. Court cited wrong legal standard The individual objectors argued that the settlement shouldnt have been limited to the subset of iPhone owners who could attest that they experienced the alleged defects. The appeals court rejected that argument, finding that the attestation requirement agreed upon by Apple and the plaintiffs was a reasonable compromise. But the appellants convinced the appeals judges that the district court erred in other ways, forcing the lower court to try again. The appellants argued that the district court improperly applied a presumption of reasonableness to the settlement instead of using heightened scrutiny. Because the district court applied the wrong legal standard when reviewing the settlements fairness, we vacate the orders granting final settlement approval and awarding fees, expenses, and incentive awards, and we remand for application of the correct standard, the appeals court ruling said. Despite that, appeals court judges said the analysis performed by the district court seemed to be thorough enough to meet the heightened scrutiny standard. Unfortunately, the district court cited the wrong legal standard. Here, while the district courts probing analysis suggests that it may have applied heightened scrutiny, its written order relied on a flawed legal standard, the appeals court said. Appellants also objected to the size of attorneys fees, accusing the district court of abusing its discretion by awarding attorneys fees based in part on the hours that counsel spent on parallel litigation in a California state court. The appeals court expressed no opinion on whether including that work was reasonable but said it agreed with objectors that the district courts explanation for considering the related work conflicted with the courts overall rationale for its fee award. District court re-approves settlement Ultimately, the appeals lengthened the process without changing the core terms of the settlement. The district court complied with the appeals court instructions in a February 2023 order that provided additional explanations for the attorneys fees while maintaining the original amount of 80.6 million. The district court also found that the settlement terms were fair under the required standard of heightened scrutiny. The appeal was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs, and the case was closed in August 2023. Apple admitted slowing down iPhones with degraded batteries in December 2017, after iPhone users conducted tests suggesting the phones throttled performance to preserve battery life or to avoid unexpected shutdowns. Apple explained at the time that lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge, or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components. For that reason, Apple said it released a feature for older iPhones to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. The class-action lawsuit alleged that Apple made materially false statements and omissions concerning the iOS software. As is typical in settlements, Apple didnt admit any wrongdoing. Apple is still fighting a similar lawsuit in the United Kingdom, as a BBC article noted today. Meanwhile, US-based Apple customers who bought MacBooks with defective butterfly keyboards between 2015 and 2019 will be getting payments from a 50 million settlement fund. MacBook buyers had to make their claims by March 6, 2023, and it is not yet known when the payments will be distributed. The claims review and validation process is ongoing, the MacBook Keyboard Litigation Settlement website says. Source: ARS Technica --Agencies",

        "date": "January 9, 2024 05:16 pm",
        "content": "Emmanuel Macron appointed 34-year-old Education Minister Gabriel Attal as his new prime minister on Tuesday, as the French President seeks to breathe new life into his second mandate ahead of European parliament elections. The move will not necessarily lead to any major political shift, but signals a desire for Macron to try to move beyond last years unpopular pension and immigration reforms and improve his centrist partys chances in the June EU ballot. Opinion polls show Macrons camp trailing far-right leader Marine Le Pens party by around eight to ten percentage points. Attal, a close Macron ally who became a household name as government spokesman during the COVID pandemic, will replace outgoing Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. One of the countrys most popular politicians in recent opinion polls, Attal has made a name for himself as a savvy minister, at ease on radio shows and in parliament. He will be Frances youngest prime minister and the first to be openly gay. Gabriel Attal is a bit like the Macron of 2017, said MP Patrick Vignal, referring to the point at which the President first took office as the youngest leader in modern French history, at the time a popular figure among voters. Vignal, who belongs to Macrons Renaissance party and first met Attal more than ten years ago, added that the education minister is clear, he has authority. Attal and Macron would have a combined age just below that of Joe Biden, who is running for a second mandate in this years U.S. presidential election. Macron has struggled to deal with a more turbulent parliament since losing his absolute majority shortly after being reelected in 2022. The Macron-Attal duo can bring a new lease of life (to the government), said Harris Interactive pollster Jean-Daniel Levy. But opposition leaders were quick to say they did not expect much from the change in prime minister, with Macron himself taking on much of the decision-making. Elisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal or someone else, I dont care, it will just be the same policies, Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told France Inter radio. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

There, the Supreme Court also ordered the petitioning party to hand over the copies of Sinhala language translations related to the case, to the Attorney General. On September 27, 2017, the Jaffna High Court, which heard the case filed over the abduction, gang rape and murder of 18-year-old schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vidya, gave the death penalty to the 07 accused including the chief suspect in the case Swiss Kumar. Delivering the much-anticipated verdict after the widely publicised trial came to an end, the three-member judge bench had sentenced the 07 suspects to death and also ordered them to pay Rs. 1 million as compensation to the victims family. In addition to the death penalty, the suspects were also sentenced to a further 30 years in prison. Sivaloganathan Vidya, an 18-year-old schoolgirl from Punkudutivu, was abducted, gang-raped and murdered in Jaffna, while returning home from school on May 13, 2015.

The decision was taken at a special discussion held at the Temple Trees regarding the implementation and recovery of the Aswesuma welfare benefit scheme, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) said in a statement. At the meeting presided over by PM Dinesh Gunawardena, it was also decided to call for new appeals for the second round by the first week of February, to set up a special appeals unit for each divisional secretariat and to appoint an officer for it at the village level. Addressing the attendees, the Prime Minister said: A large number of people had doubts and fears that they would not get Aswesuma benefits. Everyone, including the district governors, implemented the resolution well, despite many problems. All the concerned officers including the district coordination committee chairpersons and village officials supported it. There were technical flaws. The Board of Directors worked to clarify them. The Aswesuma appeals program allows for several opportunities for future appeals. District governors and divisional secretaries resolve the problems arising during the appeal hearings. The technical problem came from the beginning. The capacity is not enough. Now there is a proper plan for the relief program. There are specific steps. In the two months of October and November, the village officials finished preparing all the voter registers. According to the constitution, there is a date on which the voting lists must be announced, so the village officials took steps to finish all the work on the voter registers accordingly. The relief program also needs such support. So far, the governments poverty alleviation program has made great progress.

        "content": "Cubas cash-strapped government announced Monday that fuel prices will soar by more than 500 percent beginning February 1, part of a series of economic measures aimed at reducing the deficit. The cost of a liter of regular gasoline will rise from 25 pesos (20 US cents) to 132 pesos, while the price of premium gasoline will jump from 30 to 156 pesos, Minister of Finance and Prices Vladimir Regueiro said on state television. Authorities also said tourists to the struggling island nation will pay for fuel in foreign currency. Cubas government, which subsidizes almost all essential goods and services, announced a series of measures in late December aimed at cutting the deficit at a time of severe economic crisis across the country. According to official estimates, the Cuban economy shrank by two percent in 2023, while inflation has reached 30 percent. Late last month Economy Minister Alejandro Gil acknowledged that the government could no longer sell fuel at subsidized prices, with the Communist-led country short of foreign currency and still under a punishing decades-long US embargo. The country can not maintain the price of fuel, which is the cheapest in the world compared to prices in other countries, Gil said. Cuban gasoline is very cheap, but if you compare it with salaries in the country, gasoline is very expensive, economic Omar Everleny Perez told AFP, adding that the new price structure will affect the whole of society. The government on Monday also announced a 25 percent increase in electricity prices for major consumers in residential areas, as well has hikes in costs for natural gas. It also said the Central Bank was studying a potential new exchange rate against the dollar. The peso has been devalued twice since 2021. The island of 11 million people is experiencing its worst economic crisis since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the 1990s, due to consequences of the pandemic, tightening of US sanctions in recent years, and structural weakness.

The overseas travel ban was imposed on them by the court based on a previous request made by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) seeking an order prohibiting six doctors involved in the incident from going overseas as the investigations have revealed that they are capable of flying out of the country. As per the submissions made by the CCD to the court, the doctors at the private hospital in question had performed nephrectomy on a group of low-income people who were brokered by a man and a woman residing in the Bloumendhal area. The surgically removed kidneys had subsequently been sold to affluent people from Sri Lanka and foreign countries at a rate ranging between Rs. 12 million and Rs. 15 million, the CCD said further.",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 12:02 pm",
        "content": "The governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says good faith negotiations are in progress with commercial creditors to reach an in-principle agreement as soon as possible. Addressing a special media briefing at the CBSL premises this morning (Jan.10), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said the agreement is expected to reach within the next two months. Sri Lanka reached in-principle agreements with Chinas Export-Import (Exim) Bank and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) in late 2023 on the financial terms of debt treatment. The OCC was formally formed on May 09 with 17 countries to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for debt treatment. It is co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as the chair of the Paris Club). It was established following the launch of a common platform in April 2023 for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Agreement with the Chinese Exim Bank was reached in October 2023, covering approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. It was followed by the debt deal struck with the OCC which covers USD 5.9 billion of outstanding debt. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) later said the two agreements are consistent with the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement provided to Sri Lanka. The global lender in March 2023 had approved a USD 2.9 billion bailout package for the island nation to ride out its adverse economic situation. IMFs Executive Board completed its first review of the EFF program for Sri Lanka, paving the way for the disbursement of the much-anticipated second tranche of the loan which amounted to USD 337 million. This brought the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far to USD 670 million. The in-principle deals with the Chinese Exim Bank and the OCC had set the scene for the IMFs Executive Board to consider clearing the first review. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of USD 2.9 billion in March 2023, the island nation has managed to partly stabilise its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. The EFF program supports Sri Lankas efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms.",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 03:39 pm",
        "content": "A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing. The findings were made by Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which is part of the US Department of Energy. Scientists say the material could potentially reduce lithium use by up to 70. Since its discovery the new material has been used to power a lightbulb. Microsoft researchers used AI and supercomputers to narrow down 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than a week - a screening process that could have taken more than two decades to carry out using traditional lab research methods. The process from inception to the development of a working battery prototype took less than nine months. The two organisations achieved this by using advanced AI and high-performance computing which combines large numbers of computers to solve complex scientific and mathematical tasks. Executive vice president of Microsoft, Jason Zander, told the BBC one of the tech giants missions was to compress 250 years of scientific discovery into the next 25. And we think technology like this will help us do that. This is the way that this type of science I think is going to get done in the future, he said. The problem with lithium Lithium is often referred to as white gold because of its market value and silvery colour. It is one of the key components in rechargeable batteries (lithium-ion batteries) that power everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to smartphones. As the need for the metal ramps up and the demand for EVs rises, the world could face a shortage of the material as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency. It is also expected that demand for lithium-ion batteries will increase up to tenfold by 2030, according to the US Department for Energy, so manufacturers are constantly building battery plants to keep up. Lithium mining can be controversial as it can take several years to develop and has a considerable impact on the environment. Extracting the metal requires large amounts of water and energy, and the process can leave huge scars in the landscape, as well as toxic waste. Dr Nuria Tapia-Ruiz, who leads a team of battery researchers at the chemistry department at Imperial College London, said any material with reduced amounts of lithium and good energy storage capabilities are the holy grail in the lithium-ion battery industry. AI and supercomputing will become crucial tools for battery researchers in the upcoming years to help predict new high-performing materials, she said. But Dr Edward Brightman, lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, said the tech would need to be treated with a bit of caution. It could throw up spurious results, or results that look good at first, and then turn out to either be a material that is known or that cant be synthesised in the lab, he said. This AI-derived material, which at the moment is simply called N2116, is a solid-state electrolyte that has been tested by scientists who took it from a raw material to a working prototype. It has the potential to be a sustainable energy storage solution because solid-state batteries are safer than traditional liquid or gel-like lithium. In the near future, faster charging solid-state lithium batteries promise to be even more energy-dense, with thousands of charge cycles. How is this AI different? The way in which this technology works is by using a new type of AI that Microsoft has created, trained on molecular data that can actually figure out chemistry. This AI is all based on scientific materials, database and properties, explained Mr Zander. The data is very trustworthy for using it for scientific discovery. After the software narrowed down the 18 candidates, battery experts at PNNL then looked at them and picked the final substance to work on in the lab. Karl Mueller from PNNL said the AI insights from Microsoft pointed them to potentially fruitful territory so much faster than under normal working conditions. We could modify, test and tune the chemical composition of this new material and quickly evaluate its technical viability for a working battery, showing the promise of advanced AI to accelerate the innovation cycle, he said.

        "title": "2023 was worlds hottest year on record: EU scientists",
        "date": "January 10, 2024 04:36 pm",
        "content": "Last year was the planets hottest on record by a substantial margin and likely the worlds warmest in the last 100,000 years, the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Tuesday. Scientists had widely expected the milestone, after climate records were repeatedly broken. Since June, every month has been the worlds hottest on record compared with the corresponding month in previous years. This has been a very exceptional year, climate-wise... in a league of its own, even when compared to other very warm years, C3S Director Carlo Buontempo said. C3S confirmed 2023 as the hottest year in global temperature records going back to 1850. When checked against paleoclimatic data records from sources such as tree rings and air bubbles in glaciers, Buontempo said it was very likely the warmest year in the last 100,000 years. On average, in 2023 the planet was 1.48 degrees Celsius warmer than in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, when humans began burning fossil fuels on an industrial scale, pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent global warming surpassing 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), to avoid its most severe consequences. The world has not breached that target - which refers to an average global temperature of 1.5C over decades - but C3S said that temperatures had exceeded the level on nearly half of the days of 2023 set a dire precedent. Professor of Climate Change at Newcastle University Hayley Fowler said the record-breaking year underlined the need to act extremely urgently to reduce emissions. The speed of change in the political world and the will to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not matching the speed of change of extreme weather and warming, she said. Despite the proliferation of governments and companies climate targets, CO2 emissions remain stubbornly high. The worlds CO2 emissions from burning coal, oil and gas hit record levels in 2023. Last year, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rose to the highest level recorded, of 419 parts per million, C3S said. It was also the first year in which every day was more than 1C hotter than pre-industrial times. For the first time, two days - both in November - were 2C warmer than in the pre-industrial period. Last year was 0.17C hotter than 2016, the previous hottest year - smashing the record by a remarkable margin, Buontempo said. Alongside human-caused climate change, in 2023 temperatures were boosted by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean and contributes to higher global temperatures. What scientists do not know yet is whether 2023s extreme heat is a sign that global warming is accelerating. Whether theres been a phase shift or a tipping point, or its an anomalously warm year, we need more time and more scientific studies to understand, C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said. Each fraction of temperature increase exacerbates destructive weather disasters. In 2023, the hotter planet aggravated deadly heatwaves from China to Europe, extreme rain which caused floods killing thousands of people in Libya and Canadas worst wildfire season on record. Comparable small changes in global temperatures have huge impacts on people and ecosystems, Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who co-leads the World Weather Attribution global research collaboration, said. Every tenth of a degree matters, she added. The economic consequences of climate change are also escalating. The U.S. suffered at least 25 climate and weather disasters with damages exceeding 1 billion, while droughts ravaged soybean crops in Argentina and wheat in Spain. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has stated that the United States shares the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) with regards to the ongoing antidrug operation Yukthiya. While acknowledging that combatting drug trafficking is essential, Ambassador Chung noted that it remains crucial that law enforcement operations uphold the principles of the rule of law and its due process. Striking that balance is vital for justice and maintaining public trust, she said in this regard. On 08 January, the HRCSL released a statement on Operation Yukthiya, raising concerns that the operation has become associated with reports of widespread injustice, making its very title Yukthiya (meaning justice), a misnomer. They further highlighted that every Sri Lankan reserves the right to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as per Article 11 of the Constitution, and emphasised that this right, along with several others including the right to life, freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention and the right to not be deprived of liberty except on the order of a judge, as per provisions of the Constitution, remain absolute and inalienable, and may not be restricted under any circumstances. The primary challenge in terms of justice in Sri Lanka today is its culture of impunity, exemplified by the lack of accountability of law enforcement officers for torture, custodial and encounter deaths, and arbitrary arrests and detention, despite findings of responsibility by the countrys apex court, the HRCSL state, and thereby urged the Ministry of Public Security, the President and the Government of Sri Lanka to pay more attention to the current approach to law enforcement and focus instead on meaningfully reforming law enforcement institutions. Earlier, on 06 January, the BASL raised alarms about what it deemed a rise in arbitrary arrests and criminal activity. The BASL also underscored the utmost significance of adhering to due process and upholding the rule of law. The association deemed police raids, including the demolition of property carried out without valid search warrants andor valid search orders, whilst flagrantly violating established legal protocols, render them unlawful. It noted that such unwarranted actions not only undermine the bedrock principles of justice but also erode public confidence in the integrity of law enforcement agencies. Attached below is the full statement issued by both, the HRCSL and BASL:",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 05:15 pm",
        "content": "At an Invest Maldives forum in a southern Chinese port city, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu shook hands and exchanged words with smiling local officials on a China visit set to deepen bilateral ties as the archipelagic nation pirouettes away from India. After the forum in Fuzhou on Tuesday, Muizzu and his delegation will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing during his week-long visit, where pacts from infrastructure to tourism are expected to be signed. Muizzu became president of the Indian Ocean nation in November after winning on his India Out campaign platform under which he called New Delhis huge influence a threat to sovereignty. His government has since asked dozens of locally based Indian military personnel to leave. And in an apparent snub to India, Muizzu is in China this week, before any visit to his countrys giant neighbour. In Fuzhou, the Chinese city designated as the start of Chinas maritime Silk Road, Muizzu said China remained one of his countrys closest allies and developmental partners, according to a statement released by his office. Increasing export of fish products to China under the two countries free trade agreement will be a key priority, Muizzu added. Fishing is the largest source of employment in the Maldives, where 99 of its territory comprises the sea. Aquatic products account for over 98 of exports by volume and value. Muizzu also said his government was keen to explore partnerships under Xis Belt and Road Initiative, including the expansion of the countrys central airport and commercial port. Under the Belt and Road Initiative aimed at building a global trade and infrastructure network, China has already helped expand the Velana International Airport in Male and built the cross-sea China-Maldives Friendship Bridge. Chinese firms have invested 1.37 billion in the Maldives since its decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative in 2014, data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank shows. TOURISM In 2019, Chinese tourists represented 19.7 of foreign visitors, making them the biggest tourist group, but slipped to third position by 2022 during the pandemic. The Maldives is also a popular destination among Indian nationals, whose presence has grown more prominent when Chinas pandemic restrictions kept Chinese visitors away. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was snorkelling last week in Lakshadweep, an archipelago of atolls and reefs off the coast of Kerala, a visit that some viewed as an attempt to draw tourists away from the nearby Maldivian islands. Modis Lakshadweep visit prompted three Maldivian government officials to call him names including a clown, leading some Indian tourists to share screenshots of cancelled bookings of Maldivian holidays. ExploreIndianIslands became a trending hashtag in India on X. One of Indias largest travel platforms suspended flight bookings to the tourism-dependent Maldives on Monday . Indias strained relations with certain countries in South Asia can be attributed to its perception of being the regional boss, Chinas Global Times reported on Monday, citing analysts. And, the newspaper added, quoting a Chinese academic, Indias current nervousness about Muizzus visit to China showed its lack of confidence. DEBT TRAP But the World Bank, in a report in October, warned further cosying up to China could spell trouble in the Maldives, since the 1.37 billion it already owes the Asian giant represents around 20 of its public debt. China is the Maldives biggest bilateral creditor, ahead of Saudi Arabia and India, which it owes 124 million and 123 million, respectively. Former president Mohamed Nasheed in 2018 called Beijings lending a debt trap. Beijing rejects accusations its lending practices in developing economies are predatory. Male spent 162.3 million on interest payments between January to August 2023, the World Bank report said, up 15 from a year earlier and far exceeding the annual average between 2014-2019 of 85 million. The World Bank cautioned a build-up of sovereign exposure had taken place during the pandemic and that there was a lack of domestic investment opportunities, despite Muizzus appeal for fresh Chinese funding. The Invest Maldives website lists opportunities across 10 sectors, including tourism, renewable energy, banking and finance, and agriculture. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Accordingly, the seven suspects were remanded until 17 January, on orders of the Maligakanda Magistrates Court. Chandragupta was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on 18 December, after he arrived to give a statement regarding the controversial substandard Human Immunoglobulin import issue. On 14 December, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama declared that the court finds the actions of the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health with regard to the process of purchasing the batch of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as suspicious. Thus, the Magistrate also ordered that all responsible parties be arrested and produced before the court irrespective of their positions, for the administration of justice over the providing of substandard medicine to the public. Several high-profile arrests have so far been made in connection with the case including the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the relevant company which is said to have imported the batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents.",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 06:51 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Finance, Ranjith Siambalapitiya, emphasised the strict enforcement of laws to eradicate the trade mafia generating profits without registering with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). He also outlined the governments plan to expand the tax base, anticipating a rise in the direct tax percentage to 40. These remarks were made during his participation in a special VAT awareness conference at the Ministry of Finance yesterday (09 Jan.), organized by Saman Ratnapriya, the Director General of Presidential Trade Unions, for the benefit of civil society activists, government officials, political activists, trade union leaders, and journalists. Expressing his views State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya further said; These challenging times affect everyone, regardless of their economic status, as incomes decrease and expenses rise. The government acknowledges these difficulties and recognizes the necessity of its ongoing program to address the countrys problems. Increasing government revenue is crucial for economic development, and to achieve this, the government aims to expand the tax base. The direct tax percentage has already risen from 20 to 30, with plans to further increase it to 40. The government also enforces strict laws to combat the trade mafia, preventing them from making unfair profits through fake bills without proper registration with the Inland Revenue Department. Additionally, there is potential to reduce indirect taxes in the future. Tax Consultant of the Finance Ministrys Finance Department Tanuja Perera said; Businesses are required to remit VAT to the Inland Revenue Department monthly, with the amount charged from the 1st to the 31st of January due by the 20th of February. Failure to do so may result in legal action under the VAT Act by the Ministry of Finance. Displaying the Inland Revenue Departments issued license is mandatory for shops eligible to charge VAT. Invoices, following a format set by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, must be issued to consumers after VAT is applied. Strict enforcement is in place against fraudulent businesses collecting money without proper VAT registration, with penalties and collected VAT funds pursued by the government. Saman Ratnapriya, Director General of Trade Unions to the President expressing his views said; The VAT amendment has sparked heated discussions in todays society, particularly since President Ranil Wickremesinghe introduced it in the 2024 budget in his capacity as the Finance Minister. This budget serves as the economic blueprint for the current year, and without meaningful societal discussions, turning its proposals into reality becomes challenging. Thats why seminars on VAT are organized. Numerous misconceptions surround this VAT amendment, notably the increase from 15 to 18. While the tax has risen by 3 for existing goods, some items have gone from 0 to 18. Additionally, due to tax adjustments, certain products experience a lower-than-expected VAT increase at 18. To navigate these complexities, a thorough societal discourse on this VAT amendment is crucial. K. K. I. Eranda from the government revenue unit of the Presidents Office said; Government inefficiencies in VAT collection have been identified, impacting the potential contribution to the economy. Proper VAT collection could add 6 to the gross domestic product, but currently, only 2 is realized. Three primary areas of tax leakage have been uncovered: businessmen not remitting collected taxes, irregularities by officials, and losses due to tax exemptions. Addressing these leakages is crucial for stabilizing the economy. In the first half of 2019, VAT was at 15, reduced to 8 in 2020, and maintained for the next three years. However, the economic downturn persisted, indicating that the VAT reduction alone did not stimulate growth. To revitalize the collapsed economy, a VAT increase to 18 is proposed. Currently, around thirteen thousand businesses are registered for VAT collection, with the government aiming to increase this number to fifty thousand in the future.",

        "date": "January 10, 2024 07:22 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said that a new social security program covering the entire workforce of the country will be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers within the next three months and a common social security system will be prepared by combining all the social security systems that have been implemented so far. The Minister said the first meeting of the committee that was established related to the implementation of this social security program met recently and it was decided to submit its report to the Cabinet within the next three months. Minister Nanayakkara made this remark during the meeting held today (10) with the plumbers and painters under the Garu Saru program initiated by the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment to give respect and protection to the labour of all those employed in the informal sector in Sri Lanka. Minister Nanayakkara added that in future they hope to implement a common program for all working people in the country instead of so many separate funds called EPF, a separate fund called ETF, as well as so many insurance schemes, agricultural insurances and other different insurance systems. Furthermore, he said that all necessary arrangements are being made for that and that the Ministry officials are working to prepare these within three to four months. During his speech the Minister also said: When decisions are taken from inside the rooms and taken to the people, it is difficult to plant them on the ground as they are not practical. Thats why we are working to launch programs like this to take peoples opinions and provide answers to their problems. Accordingly, the Garu Saru program was implemented. Under this program, we expect to create professional dignity and safety in the entire workforce. We launched this program to give respect and protection to all the people in informal sector jobs who have not received proper respect and protection for a long time. We have been blaming politicians for 75 years for not giving due respect to the people working in the informal sector for so long. But blaming them will not make any difference and therefore we must change this. We are doing this to create the necessary environment towards accomplishing this goal. But it is not going to do any change by having titles like Mr. or Sir before the names to give respect. For that, what needs to be done is to create a proper system. We still dont have a method to grade or a standard for plumbers. Until such a standard is implemented, these professions will not get the due respect they deserve. Also, if we want to paint, we bring a few people to paint, but there is no method to find out what is the suitability of that person to do it. I recently received an invitation from a foreign country to provide painters for employment. They also said that they have the ability to earn about Rs. 1.2 million rupees in Sri Lankan money as monthly wages. I called for an interview accordingly. Painters from across our country came for it. But none of those people were selected because we have not adapted to the level of training or standards that they expect to do that job. In fact, we are a little behind in terms of the methods we follow. So if we can create standards in this regard then your profession will be able to get proper respect. We need to build your career to that level. But that is not something that is in the scope of our ministry. They should be prepared through other institutions. Everyone has a collective responsibility here. Also, as the Minister of Labour, I have a responsibility to treat all the workers of this country equally. We are first talking about twenty areas as a pilot program under the Garu Saru program. However, with your participation, we hope to establish an organization similar to the Lawyers Association, the Medical Association and the Architects Association. This is a professional association recognized by the government. But the most important thing we need to understand is that this is not just another trade union. And the laws related to this have been prepared under the new Employment Insurance Act. Also, a separate chapter for professional dignity has been introduced under the new act. The Board that you form today will determine your standards. We are working to provide them to other government institutions. We have been able to create a situation where an architects signature is required during construction and who is doing the wiring to be stipulated at the same time as the plan is approved. With that, we have worked to give respect to the skilled workers who are involved in the wiring profession. Our hope is to create respect for you in the same way. Therefore, if you use someone from somewhere to install the pipes, it will not give respect to your profession. You are the one who makes the rules and standards related to this. After giving them to me, they will be gazetted and work will be done to give them legal status. You can also arrange to introduce a licensing system. You have to decide the necessary qualifications for that too. That way anyone cant engage in your profession. Then only someone who has a license will be able to practice your profession. These established committees or organizations do not have officials from government institutions. Only you are in them. Also, the program has now started to bring together all working people who do not contribute to a social security system into a social security network. The first meeting of the related committee was held recently. After three to four months, we have to present to the Cabinet a system for including the entire Sri Lankan workforce in a social security system. We are currently doing related activities on this matter. We are working to establish an insurance system to cover those in case of job loss, a system to take care of those when they are unemployed due to old age and physical disabilities. For this purpose, we have to do a good study of the working methods of foreign countries like Indonesia, America, Australia, and we are prepared to take appropriate decisions by getting the support of the International Labour Organization.",

The visiting royals engaged in friendly conversation with President Wickremesinghe and Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe. Princess Anne marked the occasion by signing the special guest commemorative book at the Presidents House. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Health State Minister Dr. Sita Arambepola, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, and Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva were also present at the event. The Princess Royal and her spouse arrived in Sri Lanka this afternoon for a three-day visit. The visit comes as Sri Lanka and the UK mark 75 years of diplomatic relations. During the visit, The Princess Royal is scheduled to undertake engagements in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna. Earlier today, The Princess Royal toured the MAS Holdings Nirmaana facility and heard about their innovative excellence in product creation and development for strategic international partners, including British brands like Marks  Spencer.

According to the World Bank, the countrys economy is estimated to have recorded a negative growth of 3.8 percent in 2023. Although the output in Sri Lanka is also estimated to have declined in the 2022-2023 financial year, progress has been made in sovereign debt restructuring, said the World Bank. However, it said the outlook for Sri Lanka remains uncertain amid debt restructuring negotiations, particularly with private creditors.

        "date": "January 11, 2024 07:29 am",
        "content": "Ahead of Sri Lankas Presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled this year, Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman affirmed support for sitting President Ranil Wickremesinghe and backed him to be re-elected, saying that he stabilised the country and lifted the economy from dire straits. This country went into a very big economic crisis a crisis of debts. None of the politicians came forward to take over this country and take it forward. The President of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the responsibility. He has stabilised the economy, and the country is returning to normalcy. But if there is a change in the government, then what will happen is this entire development is going to go back to where it started and the people will have to bear the brunt of the economic hardships again, he said. On the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for securing the third tranche of loans for the economic bailout and recovery, Thondaman said the President was working with the global agency to obtain the necessary funding and support and the country was well and truly on the road to recovery. The majority of the people in Sri Lanka think that President Ranil Wickremesinghes government will return and take the country forward in the next five years. They are of the belief that this government will stabilise the national economy and make it stronger. The President is working with the IMF very closely and we are following all their guidelines. We are confident that our nation will recover at the earliest. Sri Lanka has been reeling under a severe economic crisis in the recent past, with Covid-induced lockdowns wrecking the countrys economic backbonetourism. Mounting bad loans also added to nations woes, putting the economy under severe stress and on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, a foreign exchange crisis, heavy Chinese debts, and a failed move to shift the countrys agriculture to 100 per cent organic had intensified the countrys troubles. However, at a time when the country, also known as the Emerald Isle, was staring at an economy abyss, with riots breaking out and the previous Rajapaksa government collapsing in the face of mounting public anger, India came out in its support and extended a helping hand to its southern neighbour. New Delhi not only opened a line of credit for the embattled nation but also extended timely assistance on various fronts to help the island nation recover from the crippling economic crisis.

        "title": "Israel to face Gaza genocide charges at World Court",
        "date": "January 11, 2024 09:58 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Israel prepared to defend itself on Thursday at the top U.N. court against accusations of genocide in Gaza, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly rebuffed for the first time calls by some right-wing ministers to permanently occupy the enclave. As Israels war in Gaza continued to rage, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, also known as the World Court, was to hold hearings on Thursday and Friday in a case brought by South Africa in December claiming Israels war against Hamas militants in Gaza violates the 1948 Genocide Convention. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said on Wednesday: Tomorrow, the State of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice to dispel South Africas absurd blood libel, as Pretoria gives political and legal cover to the Hamas Rapist Regime. The hearings will deal exclusively with South Africas request for emergency measures ordering Israel to suspend its military actions in Gaza while the court hears the merits of the case - a process which could take years. Colombia and Brazil expressed their support of South Africa late Wednesday. Israel launched its offensive after Hamas fighters carried out an Oct. 7 cross-border rampage in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 abducted. Since then, Israeli forces have laid much of Gaza to waste, and nearly all its 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes at least once, causing a humanitarian catastrophe. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed. On the eve of the hearings, Netanyahu for the first time publicly stated opposition to calls from right-wing members of his government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, making way for Israelis to settle there. While the stance has been Israels official policy, Netanyahus prior comments on permanent occupation of Gaza have been inconsistent and at times opaque. I want to make a few points absolutely clear: Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population, Netanyahu said on social media platform X. Potentially timing his comments ahead of the ICJ hearings, he added: Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law. Jordan and Egypt warned on Wednesday against any Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and appealed for uprooted residents to be allowed to return to their homes as Jordans King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi met. U.N. DEMANDS HOUTHIS STOP SHIP ATTACKS On the ground in Gaza, the fighting appeared as intense as ever. Israeli strikes in southern and central Gaza intensified on Wednesday despite a pledge by Israel that it would pull out some troops and shift to a more targeted campaign, and pleading from its ally Washington to reduce civilian casualties. Israels chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing late on Wednesday that the military was focusing its operations on Khan Younis and the refugee camps in the centre of the strip. In the latest sign of the three-month-old war spreading, U.S. and British warships in the Red Sea fended off the biggest attack yet from Yemens Houthi movement, which says it is acting to support Gaza. Washington and London said they shot down 21 drones and missiles aimed at shipping lanes. No one was hurt. The U.N. Security Council late Wednesday approved a resolution demanding the Houthis immediately cease the shipping attacks. Israel had said this week it was planning to begin drawing down troops, at least from the northern part of Gaza, after weeks of U.S. pressure to scale down its operations and shift to what Washington says should be a more targeted campaign. The World Health Organization cancelled a planned medical aid mission to Gaza due to security concerns, the sixth such cancellation in two weeks. The Palestinian Red Crescent said four of its staffers were killed when their ambulance was hit by an Israeli strike on the main road near Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. Two passengers in the ambulance were wounded and later died. Palestinian health officials at Abu Youssef An-Najar Hospital in Rafah, said four Palestinian children were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Rafah. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his fourth trip to the region since the war began, went to Ramallah in the Israeli occupied West Bank on Wednesday and met Palestinian leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The State Department said Blinken expressed support for a Palestinian state and discussed efforts to protect and aid civilians in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority said Abbas told Blinken no Palestinians should be displaced from Gaza or the West Bank. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

These discussions aim to thoroughly analyse and determine the ideas generated in the workshop. She also disclosed that the compilation of the 3rd National Action Plan of the Open Government Partnership, based on these discussions, is anticipated to be submitted for Cabinet approval in February. Mrs. Chandima Wickramasinghe further highlighted that, upon receiving approval from the Cabinet, the plan is set to be implemented as a National Action Plan, fostering collaboration between government and civil society stakeholders. During the discussions, there was also a review of the civil society analysis report on governance in Sri Lanka. This report encompasses proposals to enhance the transparency and accountability of current systems, strategies for improving macro-political and economic sustainability and recommendations for structural changes. The event saw the participation of approximately 110 government officials from various Ministries and Departments, along with representatives from civil organizations. The Presidential Secretariat, serving as the National Focal Point of Open Government Partnership, played a leading role in coordinating this collaborative effort. --PMD--",

This must stop tonight, he added. Extra police were being moved into Port Moresby from regional areas, Commissioner of Police David Manning said in a statement. Police in the Pacific Island nation have struggled with a surge in violent crime over the past year, and Prime Minister James Marape has said boosting security would help to attract foreign investment in PNGs burgeoning gold and copper resources sector. Marape said his goal is to expand the nations economy to 200 billion kina (55 billion) by 2029, more than doubling its gross domestic product since he took office in 2019, with the help of five gas and mining projects. Media showed fires burning in the city on Wednesday, with the PNG Post Courier newspaper reporting firefighters had been threatened as they tried to do their jobs. The guard house at parliament had also been burnt, the Post Courier reported. Defence forces were entering the city, Parkop said, and police could be seen returning to the streets.

        "date": "January 11, 2024 03:34 pm",
        "content": "Army personnel have been deployed to ensure that daily functions at hospitals remain uninterrupted after a series of strikes were launched by the health sector trade unions. The measure was taken after a request was made by the Health Ministry from the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage, said the Media Division of Sri Lanka Army. Accordingly, army troops have been deployed to the national hospitals in Colombo and Kandy; teaching hospitals in Kalubowila, Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Peradeniya and Kurunegala; and the government hospitals in Matara, Balangoda, Eheliyagoda, Nawalapitiya, Badulla, Gampola and Mirigama hospitals. Nearly 500 personnel of the army have reportedly been assigned to carry out the services at the hospitals while the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army instructed all the commanders of the defence forces to arrange for dedicated troops to be deployed to hospitals in case of an emergency. Earlier today, it was reported that the army personnel had stepped up to cover the duties at the Badulla Hospital. Accordingly, despite the token strike launched by the health sector trade unions, the services of the doctors, nurses and issuance of medicinal drugs remained uninterrupted, Ada Derana correspondent said. When inquired by Ada Derana, Director of the Badulla Hospital, Dr. Palitha Rajapakshe stated that the junior health staff of the hospital had left after completing their night shifts and that the rest of the staff had not reported for duty in the morning. Nevertheless, the emergency treatment services will continue as usual, the hospitals director said further, adding that all doctors of the Badulla Hospital have been deployed for 24-hour service. Furthermore, Dr Rajapakshe emphasized that this measure only intends to save the lives of the people and not to sabotage the trade union action. He also urged the public to bring the patients in critical condition to the hospital immediately, without keeping them at home due to the ongoing strike action. Against this backdrop, the day-to-day functions of many hospitals across the island have come to a standstill, owing to the trade union action launched by several health sector employees demanding an allowance of Rs 35,000. Several health sector trade unions, including the hospital administration and junior health staff, launched a joint strike action effective from 06.00 a.m. today (Jan. 11) protesting the governments decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs 35,000 and failure to provide them with a similar allowance. Meanwhile, the trade unions affiliated with the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) launched a 48-hour strike last morning (Jan.10). The token strike which commenced at 8:00 a.m. was joined by the Public Health Inspectors Union (PHIU), Association of Sri Lanka Ophthalmologists, Family Health Services Union, Government Nursing Officers Association and several other trade unions as well. The professionals in Supplementary Medical Service also engaged in a 24-hour token strike on Tuesday (Jan. 09) in protest of the governments move to not grant the allowance increase to them. The professionals in paramedical and supplementary medical services have vowed to resort to a continuous strike if the government fails to address the issue. On Monday (Jan.08), the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.",

        "title": "UN court hears South Africa genocide case against Israel",
        "date": "January 11, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "The UNs International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The submission also calls on the court to order Israel to stop military operations there. The ICJ will deliver only an opinion on the genocide allegation as the case is not a criminal trial, although it is being closely watched. Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as baseless. There were angry scenes outside the ICJs Peace Palace on Thursday as Dutch police struggled to keep groups of Palestinian and Israeli supporters apart. Hundreds of people waving Palestinian flags gathered outside the ICJ, calling for a ceasefire. Israeli supporters set up a screen showing images of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza. South Africa will present its case on Thursday and Israel its defence on Friday. In its submission, South Africa says Israels actions are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group. It says Israels actions include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction. It calls for provisional measures to be implemented by the court as a matter of urgency, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza. The ICJ is the UNs top court, based in the Hague in the Netherlands. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. In 2022, the court ordered Russia to immediately suspend military operations in Ukraine, an order that was ignored. Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. On Wednesday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ. Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations atrocious and preposterous. We will be in the International Court of Justice and we will present proudly our case of using self-defence under humanitarian law, he said. He added that the Israeli army was doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africas request for Israel to suspend its military campaign - but a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take years. William Schabas, a professor of international law who chaired a UN committee investigating Israels conflict with Hamas in 2014, said there is a low bar for the court to issue an injunction against Israel. He told the BBC that South Africa needs to demonstrate that there are elements that support its case, for the court to issue an order, although this would not involve making a definite decision as to whether or not genocide is actually taking place. South Africa has been highly critical of Israels military operation in Gaza, and its governing African National Congress has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the countrys black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. In Gaza, more than 23,350 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war began in the aftermath of Hamass 7 October attacks on southern Israel. In those attacks some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 11, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "South Indian actress Nayantharas Tamil film Annapoorani has been removed from the streaming platform Netflix, sparking a wave of controversy and legal issues. The decision comes just weeks after the digital premiere of the movie and follows a police complaint filed against the actors, filmmakers, and the streaming service, alleging the films derogatory portrayal hurt Hindu sentiments. Directed by Nilesh Krishnaa, Annapoorani tells the story of an ambitious young woman from an orthodox Brahmin family, navigating her path through the culinary world despite facing resistance from her priest father. The film, initially released on December 1 to mixed reviews, made its way to Netflix on December 29. How Did The Annapoorani Controversy Begin? The trouble began on January 6 when Ramesh Solanki, a Hindu activist and founder of Hindu IT Cell, filed an FIR in Mumbai against various stakeholders, including actors Nayanthara and Jai, director Nilesh Krishnaa, producers from Zee Studios, and Netflixs head in India, Monika Shergill. The complaint accused the film of hurting Hindu sentiments, specifically citing a scene where a Hindu priests daughter is shown offering namaz to cook chicken biriyani. The allegations extend to claims of promoting Love Jihad and objectionable statements made by a character named Farhan in the film, who asserts that Lord Ram and Sita were meat-eaters. These accusations led to widespread social media outrage, with calls for the films removal from Netflix. Zee Studios Issues Apology Responding to the controversy, Zee Studios, one of the co-producers of Annapoorani, issued a letter to Vishwa Hindu Parishad on January 9, expressing their intent to collaborate with Netflix and Trident Arts to remove the film from the platform until edited. Today, Netflix complied with the decision, removing Annapoorani from its library. However, the fate of a potentially edited version and its re-release remains uncertain. The film features an ensemble cast, including Nayanthara, Sathyaraj, Jai, Achyuth Kumar, KS Ravikumar, Karthik Kumar, and others. Despite the legal turmoil, fans have stood by Nayanthara, questioning the criticism of a film already certified by the CBFC. Source: Economic Times --Agencies",

        "title": "Not prepared to grant tax concessions that exclusively favour a selected few - President",
        "date": "January 11, 2024 06:06 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his commitment to propel significant advancements in Sri Lankas gem industry within the next two years. To achieve this goal, he intends to implement a new program. Emphasizing the programs positive impact on both the national economy and industry stakeholders, the President highlighted plans for extensive modernization within the gem and jewellery sector. President Wickremesinghe underscored the importance of not only providing tax concessions but also transforming the gem and jewellery industry into a pivotal sector that contributes significantly to the countrys foreign exchange earnings. The President conveyed these aspirations during his attendance at the opening ceremony of the Gem Sri Lanka 2024 Gem and Jewellery Exhibition organized by the China Fort Gems and Jewellery Trade Association today (11). The exhibition, hosted at the Bentota Cinnamon Bay Hotel, will run until January 13. President Wickremesinghe, inaugurating the event, actively participated in exploring trade stalls and engaging in friendly conversations with gem industrialists to better understand their challenges. The China Fort Gems and Jewellery Association presented a souvenir to the President during the occasion. Addressing the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for a new economic system in the country that is geared towards exports, aiming to generate foreign exchange and foster economic growth. Addressing the event President Wickremesinghe further said; Welcoming delegations from around the globe to this gathering is truly a pleasure. Beruwala, renowned as the hub for gems in Sri Lanka, takes pride in hosting this distinguished audience. Our special focus on advancing the gem industry reflects our commitment to its development, a sentiment echoed in my recent budget speech where I highlighted the formulation of a comprehensive policy framework. In the forthcoming two months, diligent efforts are underway to craft this policy framework, signalling a significant stride toward the prosperity of our nations gem industry. Sri Lanka, with its vast potential in gems, stands poised for remarkable progress. As Ian Fleming once immortalized diamonds by saying diamonds are forever, we proudly affirm that Sri Lankas gems, including the enduring sapphires, share a timeless legacy. Reflecting on the global landscape, its notable that the Chinese market, particularly represented by the Shenzhen Jewellery Association, is still in its early stages. Recalling my visit to Shenzhen in 1979, where there was only a paddy field, witnessing its transformation into a diverse economic powerhouse today is remarkable. However, there is a reciprocal learning opportunity. The governments focus on gem re-export, value addition, and augmenting foreign exchange inflows necessitates a modernized gem industry. Recognizing the associated challenges, its crucial to address them strategically. While tax relief has been a customary request, merely granting concessions without substantial sectoral growth is inadequate. The key lies in concurrent development and strengthening of economic foundations for everyone involved in the industry, alongside fostering knowledge enhancement for gem polishers. I strongly oppose the proposal to grant tax exemptions merely for individuals to amass personal wealth. My objective is to foster substantial growth in the industry over the next two years, with a particular focus on benefiting the communities in Beruwala, Ratnapura and Laggala. This approach should not only contribute to the national welfare but also ensure widespread prosperity within the industry. Reflecting on the challenges our nation faced two years ago, including a severe economic downturn, fuel shortages, fertilizer scarcity and difficulties in obtaining food, we have successfully overcome those hurdles. The restoration of essential services, facilitated by foreign exchange, marks a significant achievement. However, its crucial to note that this foreign exchange is sourced from institutions like the World Bank and the support of nations, such as the American governments provision of fertilizers in 2022. While such external assistance has been valuable, relying on it consistently is not a sustainable approach. The country must actively strive to earn the foreign exchange it requires. This necessitates the development of a robust export-oriented economy. Leveraging the potential for high income, particularly from the gem industry, we must transition towards economic self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on external aid. Merely making promises is insufficient; a proactive strategy is needed to create a new economy that can generate foreign exchange for the countrys sustained growth. Furthermore, there exists the potential for revenue generation within the tourism industry. Spanning from Beruwala, Aluthgama to Galle, the fishing industry in this region is a global player, competing on an international scale. This model should extend to the rest of our nations planning. As we propel forward as a nation, the imperative is to secure foreign exchange through our collective endeavours. While words may be spoken, tangible outcomes are indispensable. Setting a target of 2 economic growth for the current year, albeit modest, its crucial to recall that the countrys economy contracted by a staggering minus 7 in the preceding year. We are now on a gradual upward trajectory, with an ambition to elevate economic growth to 5 by 2025. Subsequently, we aim for a more ambitious target of 7  8. Executing these plans meticulously could facilitate the recovery of the country within a span of five years. Presently, citizens across the country grapple with the challenge of the rising cost of living. I firmly believe that a collective understanding of the countrys actual situation can pave the way for overcoming this predicament within the next two years. The advantage of shaping the future of our nation lies with the youth community. It is crucial to emphasize that we are diligently crafting a robust economy for the prosperity of the upcoming generation. Expressing his views at this event State Minister Chamara Sampath noted; Many individuals within the gem and jewellery industry currently grapple with tax-related issues. The President is actively addressing and working towards resolving these challenges, leveraging his role as the finance minister, which uniquely positions him to engage in discussions about taxes. There is optimism that the Presidents intervention will not only resolve issues within the industry but also elevate the gem sector to a significant contributor to foreign exchange earnings. While some individuals in suits aspire to assume the presidency, their ability to offer solutions to these specific problems remains limited. The President stands as the sole figure capable of providing effective resolutions to the issues at hand. Reflecting on the past, the country faced a situation where diesel was unavailable, prompting people to protest by barricading petrol stations. The President successfully navigated and resolved this crisis. With the commitment to steering the nation to a better state, the President assures that the country will be handed over in an improved condition. Ministers of State Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Piyal Nishantha de Silva, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, former Minister A. H. M. Fowzie, Members of Parliament Wajira Abeywardena, Rajitha Senaratne, President of China Fort Gems and Jewellery Trade Association, Member of Parliament Marjan Faleel were present on this occasion. Mr. Hilmi Casim, President of the Gem Sri Lanka 2024 Exhibition, Mr. Rizwan Naeem, Vice President, foreign ambassadors, Chinese representatives and a group of local and foreign guests attended this event. --PMD--",

        "date": "January 11, 2024 09:11 pm",
        "content": "A controversial spiritual leader, whose supporters believe he is the reincarnation of Buddha, has been arrested in Nepal over sexual abuse charges, according to local police. Ram Bahadur Bomjan, popularly called Buddha Boy in local media, was arrested Tuesday evening while absconding in the case of sexual exploitation of a minor, the police said in a statement. An arrest warrant against him was issued in 2020, according to the statement, in the case of sexual abuse of a minor girl, who was allegedly living as a nun at his ashram in the Bara district, south of the capital Kathmandu. CNN has been unable to reach Bomjan for comment and was not able to determine if he has a lawyer. Acting on a tip off, police say they tracked the 34-year-old to the outskirts of Kathmandu and arrested him while he was trying to flee, the statement added. They say they also seized more than a dozen mobile phones, five laptops and tablets, and more than 200,000 in Nepali and foreign currencies at his home. This comes nearly two decades after he first gained international attention. In 2005, at the age of 15, he retreated into the jungle to pray for 10 months, local media reported at the time. His followers once claimed that he did so without food, sleep or water. Those claims were never independently verified, but it led some to laud him as the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in Nepal some 2,500 years ago, and later became known simply as Buddha, meaning enlightened one. Bomjans Buddha Boy moniker helped to further his fame, as thousands from across the country and neighboring India traveled to see him while he was in the jungle. Bomjan began preaching about two years later attracting an audience of about 3,000 people during his first sermon, according to his website. He and his supporters then set up a network of ashrams around Nepal dedicated to his teachings. But in recent years, Bomjan has been dogged by allegations of wrongdoing. His ashram was raided in 2019 while investigating the disappearance of four of his followers. Police on Wednesday said further investigations and searches are being conducted regarding the followers who have disappeared from Bomjans ashram at various times. The sexual abuse charges relate to a nun, who in 2018 publicly accused him of raping her at one of his ashrams when she was a minor. At the time, officials at Bodhi Shrawan Dharma Sangha, the organization that manages Bomjans ashrams, denied the rape allegations in a news conference, calling them completely made-up.

        "title": "US, British militaries launch massive retaliatory strike against Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen",
        "date": "January 12, 2024 07:48 am",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden said Thursday that a series of strikes in Yemen targeting Iran-backed Houthi rebels was meant to demonstrate that the U.S. and its allies will not tolerate the militant groups ceaseless attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said the U.S. and its allies only made the move after attempts at diplomatic negotiations and careful deliberation. These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea  including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history, Biden said in a statement. These attacks have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation. WASHINGTON (AP)  The U.S. and British militaries were bombing more than a dozen sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Thursday, in a massive retaliatory strike using warship-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets, several U.S. officials told The Associated Press. The military targets included logistical hubs, air defense systems and weapons storage and launching locations, they said. Associated Press journalists in Yemens capital, Sanaa, heard four explosions early Friday local time but saw no sign of warplanes. Two residents of Hodieda, Amin Ali Saleh and Hani Ahmed, said they heard five strong explosions hitting the western port area of the city, which lies on the Red Sea and is the largest port city controlled by the Houthis. Explosions also were heard by residents of Taiz, a southwestern city near the Red Sea. The strikes marked the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. And the coordinated military assault comes just a week after the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. The officials confirmed the strikes on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. Members of Congress were briefed earlier Thursday on the strike plans. The warning appeared to have had at least some short-lived impact, as attacks stopped for several days. On Tuesday, however, the Houthi rebels fired their largest-ever barrage of drones and missiles targeting shipping in the Red Sea, with U.S. and British ships and American fighter jets responding by shooting down 18 drones, two cruise missiles and an anti-ship missile. And on Thursday, the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Gulf of Aden, which was seen by a commercial ship but did not hit the ship. The rebels, who have carried out 27 attacks involving dozens of drones and missiles just since Nov. 19, said Thursday that any attack by American forces on its sites in Yemen will spark a fierce military response. The response to any American attack will not only be at the level of the operation that was recently carried out with more than 24 drones and several missiles, said Abdel Malek al-Houthi, the groups supreme leader, during an hour-long speech. It will be greater than that. The Houthis say their assaults are aimed at stopping Israels war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But their targets increasingly have little or no connection to Israel and imperil a crucial trade route linking Asia and the Middle East with Europe. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Wednesday that demanded the Houthis immediately cease the attacks and implicitly condemned their weapons supplier, Iran. It was approved by a vote of 11-0 with four abstentions  by Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique. Britains participation in the strikes underscored the Biden administrations effort to use a broad international coalition to battle the Houthis, rather than appear to be going it alone. More than 20 nations are already participating in a U.S.-led maritime mission to increase ship protection in the Red Sea. U.S. officials for weeks had declined to signal when international patience would run out and they would strike back at the Houthis, even as multiple commercial vessels were struck by missiles and drones, prompting companies to look at rerouting their ships. On Wednesday, however, U.S. officials again warned of consequences. Im not going to telegraph or preview anything that might happen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a stop in Bahrain. He said the U.S. has made clear that if this continues as it did yesterday, there will be consequences. And Im going to leave it at that. The Biden administrations reluctance over the past several months to retaliate reflected political sensitivities and stemmed largely from broader worries about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. The White House wants to preserve the truce and has been wary of taking action in Yemen that could open up another war front. The impact on international shipping and the escalating attacks, however, triggered the coalition warning, which was signed by the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Separately, the U.S. called on the United Nations Security Council to take action against the Houthis and warned their financier Iran that it has a choice to make about continuing to provide support to the rebels. Transit through the Red Sea, from the Suez Canal to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, is a crucial shipping lane for global commerce. About 12 of the worlds trade typically passes through the waterway that separates Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, including oil, natural gas, grain and everything from toys to electronics. In response to the attacks, the U.S. created a new maritime security mission, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, to increase security in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, with about 22 countries are participating. U.S. warships, and those from other nations, have been routinely sailing back and forth through the narrow strait to provide protection for ships and to deter attacks. The coalition has also ramped up airborne surveillance. The decision to set up the expanded patrol operation came after three commercial vessels were struck by missiles fired by Houthis in Yemen on Dec. 3. The Pentagon increased its military presence in the region after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict, including by the Houthis and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.

        "content": "The joint token strike launched by multiple trade unions in the health sector demanding an allowance of Rs.35,000 was called off around 8:00 a.m. today (Jan.12). Hospital services came to a standstill over the past few days after paramedical and supplementary health services trade unions resorted to token strikes in protest of the governments decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. A 24-hour strike was launched by the professionals affiliated with supplementary medical services on Tuesday (Jan.09), followed by the 48-hour strike initiated by the trade unions attached to the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) on Wednesday (Jan.10). The paramedical services strike was joined by the Public Health Inspectors Union (PHIU), the Association of Sri Lanka Ophthalmologists, the Family Health Services Union, the Government Nursing Officers Association and several other trade unions. Against this backdrop, hospital secretaries, administration officers, and healthcare assistants also engaged in a one-day token strike from 6:00 a.m. on Thursday (Jan.11). However, as of this morning, the health sector trade union actions have come to a halt, allowing hospital services to resume as usual. Speaking in this regard, the president of the Joint Council for Professions of Supplementary Medicine, Ravi Kumudesh said they would resort to stringent measures if the President does not intervene to provide satisfactory solutions. Meanwhile, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and the All-Ceylon Nurses Union are slated to engage in a discussion focusing on the issue. The nurses union said its members intend to hand over a letter detailing their proposals to the lawmaker. The Doctors Union Alliance for Medical and Civil Rights complained that many discrepancies have emerged in the healthcare system due to the governments sticking-plaster solutions to address the issues. On Thursday, nearly 500 personnel of the army were deployed to multiple hospitals to ensure that the services remain unaffected. Accordingly, dedicated troops were assigned to national hospitals in Colombo and Kandy; teaching hospitals in Kalubowila, Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Peradeniya and Kurunegala; and the government hospitals in Matara, Balangoda, Eheliyagoda, Nawalapitiya, Badulla, Gampola and Mirigama hospitals at the request of the Health Ministry.",

        "content": "Satellite images captured striking changes in the coastline of Japans Noto Peninsula following a massive earthquake on New Years Day. A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Japan on Jan. 1 around 2:10 a.m. EST (0710 GMT, or 4:10 p.m. local time in Japan), prompting orders for residents to evacuate affected coastal areas that experienced significant uplift. Satellite imagery of the area before and after the quake shows that the intense uplift extended the coastline by up to 820 feet (250 meters), which is greater than the length of two American football fields. Images of Japans Noto Peninsula shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Nahel Belgherze show coastal areas where the seafloor has risen above the water, creating newly exposed beaches. The photos capture the coastline changes after the earthquake and tsunami had already subsided, leaving some ports completely dry and inaccessible to boats. During a field investigation along the northwest coast of the Noto Peninsula, we found evidence at 10 locations, from Kaiso to Akasaki sites, of coseismic coastal uplift related to the Noto Peninsula Earthquake (M7.6), researchers with the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo said in a statement on Jan. 4. The pattern of estimated coseismic coastal uplift appears to be decreasing southward from Kaiso to Akasaki, they added. The area near Akasaki port also experienced nearly 14-foot-high (4.2 meters) tsunamis, according to the universitys field investigations that revealed water stains on building walls. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agencys (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) also captured the coastal uplift caused by the earthquake. Satellite images compare the coastline from June 2023 to Jan. 2, showing how the shoreline shifted seaward in multiple areas, including Nafune port, Wajima city and Minazuki bay, according to a statement from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan. While the satellite images capture significant changes following the Jan. 1 earthquake, investigations along the coast are still ongoing, according to the statement. Source: Space.com",

        "date": "January 12, 2024 11:34 am",
        "content": "State Minister Geeta Kumarasinghe says surveillance cameras will be set up inside all passenger transport service buses in a bid to prevent incidents of violence against women. Addressing a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (Jan.11), the State Minister for Women and Child Affairs spoke of the measures afoot to enhance the safety of women using public transport services. Necessary instructions in this regard are given to Provincial Governors, Transport Minister, National Transport Commission and the Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority, Kumarasinghe added. Speaking further, she said a program would be initiated this year to provide a full meal for breakfast for all preschool children across the island. Additionally, she highlighted that the proposed Gender Equality Bill aims to affirm and protect gender equality rights. State Minister Geeta Kumarasinghe further commented: Ensuring a nutritious breakfast for 120,000 pre-school children posed a significant challenge. To address this, a request has been submitted to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to increase the allocated amount from Rs. 60 to Rs. 100 per child. Given the high prevalence of malnutrition among children in Sri Lanka, the focus is on providing a protein-rich meal. As a response, measures are underway this year to provide a full morning meal for all pre-school children across the island. The initiative aims to encompass all Regional Secretariats, covering approximately 120,000 non-estate and 35,000 estate pre-school children, totalling 155,000 beneficiaries. Furthermore, plans are underway to distribute nutrition pack to pregnant mothers. The initiative aims to provide 220,214 pregnant mothers with nutrition pack for duration of 10 months, each valued at Rs. 4,500 per month. Additionally, there is a plan to introduce a training program for pre-school teachers. Currently, there are 18,333 pre-school teachers registered under the National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development, representing every district in Sri Lanka. While a monthly payment of Rs 2500 is provided to enhance the quality of the pre-school sector and evaluate the work of pre-school teachers, it is recognized that this amount falls short for their livelihoods. Therefore, there is a proposal to further increase this payment. Furthermore, The Ministry has outlined plans to propose and enact three new bills aimed at safeguarding the rights of children and women. Specifically, efforts are underway to solidify gender equality rights through the Gender Equality Bill. This initiative includes the establishment of a Gender Equality Council, encompassing representation for the LGBTIQ community. Within this council, endeavours are on-going to hire Gender Focal Point officers for various government institutions. Additionally, there are plans to revise the minimum age limit of children left behind when women go abroad for work from 2 years to the previous limit of 5 years. Steps have been initiated to collect data at the Divisional Secretariat level to ascertain the number of mothers with children under 5 years who have migrated abroad. To enhance the safety of women in public passenger transport services, measures are being taken to inform all Provincial Governors, the Minister of Transport, the National Transport Commission, and the Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority. The objective is to install CCTV cameras in all passenger transport service buses, aiming to reduce incidents of violence against women. Moreover, it is anticipated that the installation of cameras in public passenger transport services will contribute to reducing violence against women. As a result, our emphasis has been on submitting a proposal to the relevant authorities to make the installation of cameras a mandatory license condition for passenger transport service buses in their annual licensing process. --PMD",

        "title": "Court bans foreign travels of self-proclaimed Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva",
        "date": "January 12, 2024 03:38 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on Friday (Jan.12) imposed a travel ban on Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. Kodituwakku is accused of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings. He returned to Sri Lanka recently and was welcomed by his supporters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) upon arrival. Earlier this week, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) seeking an investigation on the self-styled Bodhisattva. Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted mass suicide through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide. Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, claimed that this self-proclaimed Bodhisattva had sexually abused his daughter before leaving his house while calling it Abinishkramanaya (Great Departure). Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings on the path to becoming Buddhas but postpone reaching nirvana to help humanity.",

        "title": "IMF board approves 700 mln loan as part of Pakistan bailout",
        "date": "January 12, 2024 04:12 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Funds board has approved a roughly 700 million loan for Pakistan under a 3 billion bailout, the fund and the finance ministry said on Thursday. The IMFs completion of its first review of the programme and the boards decision brings the total disbursements under the Standby Arrangement (SBA) to about 1.9 billion, the fund said. There are now tentative signs of activity picking-up and external pressures easing, said in a statement Antoinette Sayeh, a deputy managing director at the fund. Continued strong ownership (of the program) remains critical to ensure the current momentum continues and stabilization of Pakistans economy becomes entrenched. The South Asian country is operating under a caretaker government and the IMF loan programme, approved in July, helped avert a sovereign debt default. Ahead of the bailout, Pakistan had to undertake a slew of measures demanded by the IMF, including revising its budget, a hike in its benchmark interest rate, and increases in electricity and natural gas prices. Continuing with regularly-scheduled adjustments and pushing cost-side power sector reforms are vital to improving the sectors viability and protecting fiscal sustainability, Sayeh said. An IMF mission led by Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter concluded its visit in November. It reviewed whether Pakistan was on track to meet benchmarks set under the SBA agreed in July and signed a staff level agreement. Under the bailout deal, the IMF also got Pakistan to raise 1.34 billion in new taxation to meet fiscal adjustments. The measures fuelled all-time high inflation of 38 year-on-year in May, which is still hovering above 30. The fund said that despite elevated inflation, with appropriately tight policy it could fall to 18.5 by end-June. It added the exchange rate has been broadly stable. IMF funding along with recent inflows from multilateral lenders will further help the Pakistani rupee, that is fairly stable (over the) last few months, said Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. He added that this new tranche would help Pakistan in getting rollovers from friendly countries like the United Arab Emirates, China and Saudi Arabia and ease external debt repayment pressure. Pakistans international bonds, which had already clocked healthy gains earlier on Thursday, soared after the announcement. The 2036 issue enjoyed the biggest gains, jumping 3.5 cents to trade at 62.59 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed. Pakistans caretaker government, under interim Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, is meant to oversee a general election. Caretaker governments are usually limited to overseeing elections, but Kakars set-up is the most empowered in Pakistans history thanks to recent legislation that allows it to make policy decisions on economic matters. The legislation is aimed at keeping on track the conditions for the bailout secured in June. At a time where there are uncertainties on Pakistans upcoming elections, this IMF board decision will provide some confidence to other lenders and markets, said Sohail. Elections in the politically and economically troubled country have been scheduled for Feb. 8 after several delays. Last week the senate passed a non-binding resolution to further delay the elections, citing security concerns and a harsh winter in northern areas. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "January 12, 2024 05:01 pm",
        "content": "The Second Reading of the Online Safety Bill is scheduled to be debated on January 23 and 24, as per a decision taken by the Committee on Parliamentary Business today (Jan.12). The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. Several petitions were filed soon after the Bill was presented in parliament, by numerous parties including social activist and independent journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara; Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith; the Socialist Youth Union (SYU); General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara; SJBs Rehan Jayawickrama; former BASL presidents Saliya Peiris and Geoffrey Alagaratnam; National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris, challenging various provisions included in the legislation, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution.",
