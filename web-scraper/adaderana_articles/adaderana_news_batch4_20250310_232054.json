It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us, Priscilla Presley said. Lisa Marie, also a singer, was rushed to hospital earlier on Thursday. Media reports say she had cardiac arrest. She was found unresponsive at her home in Calabasas, California, sources told US outlet TMZ. She was the most passionate, strong and loving woman I have ever known, Priscilla Presley said in a statement. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss, Her mother gave no details about the possible cause of death. Sources close to Lisa Marie Presley told TMZ that she had suffered a full arrest before a bystander administered epinephrine - commonly known as adrenaline - to help her regain a pulse. Born in 1968, Lisa Marie went on to follow in her fathers footsteps and forged a career in music. The star released three albums, with her 2003 debut studio album selling hundreds of thousands of copies and receiving generally positive reviews. The star was also well known for a series of high-profile marriages to pop legend Michael Jackson, actor Nicholas Cage and musicians Danny Keough and Michael Lockwood. She had three children, including the actress Roxy Keough. Presleys son, Benjamin Keough, killed himself in 2020.

        "title": "Sri Lanka finalises regulations for offshore oil  gas exploration",
        "date": "January 13, 2023 11:41 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is preparing to issue two-year oil and gas exploration licenses for as many as 900 offshore blocks for foreign firms to scout for energy resources and bring in vital investments to the crisis-hit country, a top official told Reuters on Thursday. Starting up oil production is part of President Ranil Wickremesinghes plan to attract foreign investment as he seeks to stabilise the economy amid the countrys worst economic crisis in seven decades. The new regulations were finalised by the government this week and set a framework for companies to sign an expression of interest (EOI) for exploring offshore assets around the country, Surath Ovitigama, director general of the state-run Petroleum Development Authority, told Reuters in a phone interview. The rules for oil exploration will be made public this month and the government hopes to start issuing licences for some of the 900 blocks within weeks, he said. In the coming months we expect to recommence oil and gas exploration with the first set of credible entities. We believe this will boost investor confidence and serve to attract the next wave of EOIs this year, Ovitigama told Reuters. Previous attempts by Sri Lanka to start up oil production have mainly focused on the countrys northern coast but this time the government has mapped assets surrounding all sides of the island. The Mannar Basin, which lies between southern India and northwestern Sri Lanka, may hold around 260 billion worth of oil and gas resources, Sri Lankas former energy minister told parliament in 2021. Sri Lankan authorities hope that exploration work could start as early as March and any success in the initial exercise will lead to production sharing agreements for gas and oil, Ovitigama said. Two companies have already expressed serious interest and requests for proposals (RFPs) will be issued shortly, leading to negotiations for exploration licenses, he said. Ovitigama declined to name the companies since ongoing discussions were confidential. However, a source with direct knowledge of talks said ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the overseas arm of Indias state-run oil explorer, is a front runner seeking to explore multiple blocks off Sri Lankas north and north-west shoreline. OVL is the company that has made the most efforts, appealed the most and has followed up with meetings. They have made representations at every level, the source said, asking not to named because discussions were confidential. An OVL spokesman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. As Sri Lanka closes in on a 2.9 billion loan deal from the International Monetary Fund and its economy starts to stabilise, India is seeking to land ambitious long-term investments worth over 1 billion, including in the energy sector, with an eye on countering the influence of regional rival China. ONE MILLION BARRELS Soaring global oil prices early last year worsened Sri Lankas financial crisis that was brought on by a severe foreign exchange shortage, leaving it with limited dollars to fund imports of fuel, food and medicine. The shortages led to violent protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country in July. Sri Lanka is currently completely dependent on imported fuel, which cost the cash-strapped country around 4.2 billion in 2022. However, the government, based on seismic surveys, estimates that a 30,000 square kilometre area off the north coast of the country holds over one million barrels of oil resources. Sri Lanka held its first international licensing round for petroleum exploration in 2007, with one exploration block awarded to an Indian firm that pulled out in 2015 when oil prices plunged. In 2019, the country brought in French major Total and Norways Equinor to study the potential of two blocks for oil production.

        "date": "January 13, 2023 03:16 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk has broken the world record for the largest loss of personal fortune in history. From November 2021 to December 2022 he lost around 165bn, Guinness World Records said in a blog on its website. The figures are based on data from publisher Forbes, but Guinness said other sources suggested Mr Musks losses could have been higher. It follows a fall in value of shares in Mr Musks electric car firm Tesla after he bought Twitter last year. His 44bn (36bn) takeover of the social media company has sparked concerns among investors that Mr Musk is no longer giving Tesla enough attention. Mr Musks losses since November 2021 surpass the previous record of 58.6bn (47bn), suffered by Japanese tech investor Masayoshi Son in 2000. The estimated loss is based on the value of his shares, which could regain their value, meaning Mr Musks wealth would increase again. In December, the Tesla boss lost his position as richest person in the world to Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of French luxury goods company LVMH, which owns fashion label Louis Vuitton. The value of Tesla shares dropped around 65 in 2022, in part because of Teslas performance. The firm delivered just 1.3 million vehicles during the year, falling short of Wall Street expectations. However, Mr Musks takeover of Twitter - where he has sparked controversy by firing large numbers of staff and changing content moderation policies - is behind most of the share slump. Many Tesla investors believe he should be focusing on the electric vehicle company as it faces falling demand amid recession fears, rising competition and Covid-linked production challenges. Long-term fundamentals at Tesla are extremely strong. Short-term market madness is unpredictable, Mr Musk tweeted after the stock markets closed for the year in December 2022. Mr Musk is now worth about 178bn (152bn), according to Forbes, while Bernard Arnault has an estimated value of 188bn (155bn). Source - BBC - With input from agencies",

Accordingly, ministerial secretary Neil Bandara Hapuhinna, who was summoned by the election body today, has apologized if any inconvenience caused by the said letter. On January 09, Hapuhinna, in a letter addressed to all Returning Officers, instructed them to stop accepting the deposits placed by the candidates for the local government election, until further notice, citing a decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, in a video statement issued the following day, slammed the efforts to postpone the local government election and called on the government not to play with the peoples right to vote. Hapuhinna, who found himself in hot water over the matter, recalled the letter just a day after it was issued. Later, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) also condemned the move, stressing that any attempt to interfere with the exercise of the franchise and any attempt to prevent people from exercising their sovereign right to choose their representatives is a blatant attack on the rule of law and democracy of Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "January 13, 2023 08:52 pm",
        "content": "Indias External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar will travel to Sri Lanka next week, sources told The Hindu. This will be his first trip to the country since President Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn-in last July after street protests forced out the previous Rajapaksa regime. Officials said that while a full review of bilateral ties is on the agenda, the visit comes amidst efforts by the Sri Lankan government to get written financial assurances from their closest and biggest creditors  India and China  on restructuring their debt. This is needed to make progress on their bailout plan being discussed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mr. Jaishankars two-day visit to Colombo, scheduled for January 19-20, will follow a visit by a ministerial delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The visits, coming back-to-back, are crucial for Colombo to avail itself of the USD 2.9 billion IMF package under its Extended Fund Facility. The Sri Lankan government has said that it hopes to borrow more money once the IMF programme kicks in, to set its economy on a path to recovery following last years crushing meltdown. China, Japan, and India are Sri Lankas three largest bilateral creditors, and Colombo is counting on their cooperation for economic revival. On Friday, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo announced that a high-level delegation of the CPC led by the International Department Vice Minister Chen Zhou will visit Sri Lanka 14-18 January, the first official visit of the CPC to the island in the new year of 2023 and after its 20th National Congress. India has been involved closely in assisting Sri Lankas economic recovery programme after a near-debt default last year, and has been coordinating with other partners like the US and Japan, both on a bilateral level and at the Quads meetings, in order to find ways to help Sri Lanka overcome its financial crisis. However, strategic ties hit a block over the Sri Lankan governments decision to allow a Chinese satellite tracking vessel into Hambantota port last August, a development that both India and the US formally protested against. In another indicator of the growing faultlines in Sri Lanka, U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung told the BBC news service on Thursday that China should not play spoiler, and that Beijing must provide the necessary financing assurances without delay for the sake of the Sri Lankan people. The Indian External Affairs Minister was last in Colombo in March 2022, as India announced an unprecedented 4 billion assistance package to help Sri Lanka at the height of its crisis. He earlier met with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on the sidelines of the ASEAN conference in Cambodia in August, assuring him of Indias commitment to be a dependable friend and reliable partner to Sri Lanka. Mr. Jaishankar will also discuss trade and transit ties with Indias neighbour. New Delhi and Colombo are in talks to enhance ferry connectivity, following the restart of Chennai-Jaffna flights last month, for the first time after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wickremesinghe government has committed to resuming negotiations on the stalled Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement as well. Mr. Jaishankars visit comes even as Mr. Wickremesinghe is holding talks with Sri Lankas Tamil political leadership on a durable political solution. The Tamil parties have expressed concerns over the absence of any tangible action on their demands pertaining to land grabs in the north and east, the release of political prisoners and answers to families of disappeared persons. These are issues that the External Affairs Minister had raised last year, in talks with the then-Rajapaksa administration. Source: The Hindu",

        "date": "January 13, 2023 10:52 pm",
        "content": "The leader of Sri Lankas Catholic Church on Friday praised a Supreme Court decision to order the former president and four officials to pay compensation for the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 260 people. The civil case brought by families of the victims charged that lax security led to the attacks which targeted three churches and three luxury hotels. The church itself was not party to the lawsuit. But Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told reporters he hoped the case would be escalated against former president Maithripala Sirisena and his top security officials. Based on this verdict we expect this case to be taken forward, Cardinal Ranjith said. Justice for the victims will only happen when the entire truth comes out. This decision is just a milestone in that journey. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ordered Sirisena, his police chief, two senior intelligence officials and a senior defence ministry official to pay a total of LKR 310 million (about 850,000) from their personal funds as compensation to the families of the victims of the bombings who had brought the civil case before the court. The court said the former president and his officials had failed to prevent the attacks, among the worst in Sri Lankas turbulent history. Several tourists were also killed and more than 500 people wounded, mostly belonging to the islands minority Christian community. Sirisena and the others involved in the case have made no public comment on the ruling and he did not respond to Reuters requests for reaction. In November, Sri Lanka put on trial 24 men accused of carrying out the attacks. Police filed over 23,000 charges against those suspects, including conspiring to murder, aiding and abetting the attacks, and collecting arms and ammunition. The group includes Mohammad Naufer, who officials say masterminded the attacks and is linked to Islamic State. Source: Reuters",

        "date": "January 14, 2023 08:05 am",
        "content": "A proper system should be implemented to collect taxes properly on non-cash benefits starting from the President of the country to all ministers, members of parliament and officials, the chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) MP Harsha De Silva says. Explaining that non-cash benefits include vehicles, houses, employees, etc. owned by a person holding a certain position, the COPF chairman pointed out that these taxes should be carefully looked into, considering all elements. MP De Silva made these remarks when the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) was summoned by the COPF recently (Jan. 10) to discuss the Road Map for Tax Collection for the year 2023. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue pointed out during the discussion that the amount of tax collected in the year 2022 is Rs. 860 billion and the amount of tax expected to be collected for the year 2023 is Rs. 1,667 billion in total. Accordingly, compared to last year, it is expected to receive Rs. 922 billion more tax money this year, he added. The largest amount of anticipated tax revenue in 2023, amounting to Rs. 603 billion, is expected from corporate income tax. The local revenue officials also indicated that an income of Rs. 553 billion is expected from the value-added tax (VAT). The committee also discussed at length the strengthening of this tax collection program and the IRD gave information about the problems including the delay in the cases in the court related to tax payment defaults. The chairman of the committee said that the COPF will intervene to review these problems and provide solutions. Accordingly, the COPF chairman informed the Inland Revenue Department to report to the committee in February about the progress of tax collection. The attention of the committee was also drawn to some media reports, that taxes were levied on the pension of disabled war heroes. The officials of the Inland Revenue Department pointed out that no such tax is levied on a pension in any way. The regulations in Gazette No. 230712 under the Import and Export Control Act were also submitted to the committee for approval. This gazette was published to ease the import restrictions imposed on sports items, railway spare parts, and certain items in the cosmetics industry. The committee approved the gazette and stressed that it is preferable to allow the import of products required for industries such as tourism and cosmetics under the recommendations of the relevant institutions by charging a higher tax. Otherwise, it was discussed in the committee, that the black market businesses cannot be prevented in this regard. Furthermore, the Committee approved the orders under the Foreign Exchange Act published in Gazette No. 230851.",

        "date": "January 14, 2023 07:21 pm",
        "content": "Iran has executed a British-Iranian national who once served as its deputy defence minister, its judiciary said on Saturday, defying calls from London for his release after he was handed the death sentence on charges of spying for Britain. Britain, which had declared the case against Alireza Akbari as politically motivated and called for his release, condemned the execution. Akbari, 61, was arrested in 2019. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called it a callous and cowardly act carried out by a barbaric regime with no respect for the human rights of their own people. The Iranian judiciarys Mizan news agency reported the execution without saying when it had taken place. Late on Friday, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly had said Iran must not follow through with the sentence - a call echoed by Washington. The execution looks set to pile more pressure on Irans long strained ties with the West which have deteriorated further since talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal hit deadlock and as Tehran unleashed a deadly crackdown on protesters last year. In an audio recording purportedly from Akbari and broadcast by BBC Persian on Wednesday, he said he had confessed to crimes he had not committed after extensive torture. Alireza Akbari, who was sentenced to death on charges of corruption on earth and extensive action against the countrys internal and external security through espionage for the British governments intelligence service...was executed, Mizan said. The Mizan report accused Akbari of receiving payments of 1,805,000 euros, 265,000 pounds, and 50,000 for spying. Sunak said on Twitter he was appalled by the execution. Cleverly said in a statement it would not stand unchallenged. We will be summoning the Iranian Charge dAffaires to make clear our disgust at Irans actions. British statements on the case have not addressed the Iranian charge that Akbari spied for Britain. Iranian state media, which have portrayed Akbari as a super spy, broadcast a video on Thursday that they said showed that he played a role in the 2020 assassination of Irans top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed in an attack outside Tehran which authorities blamed at the time on Israel. In the video, Akbari did not confess to involvement in the assassination but said a British agent had asked for information about Fakhrizadeh. Irans state media often airs purported confessions by suspects in politically charged cases. Reuters could not establish the authenticity of the state media video and audio, or when or where they were recorded. Akbari was a close ally of Ali Shamkhani, now the secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, who was defence minister from 1997 to 2005, when Akbari was his deputy as part of the administration of reformist President Mohammad Khatami. He fought during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s as a member of the Revolutionary Guards. It marks a rare case of the Islamic Republic executing a serving or former senior official. One of the last occasions was in 1984, when Iranian navy commander Bahram Afzali was executed after being accused of spying for the Soviet Union. 3,500 HOURS OF TORTURE Reflecting Irans worsening ties with the West, London-Tehran relations have deteriorated in recent months as efforts have stalled to revive the nuclear pact, to which Britain is a party. Britain has also been critical of the Islamic Republics crackdown on anti-government protests, sparked by the death in custody of a young Iranian-Kurdish woman in September. Iran has issued dozens of death sentences as part of the crackdown, executing at least four people. A British foreign office minister said on Thursday that Britain was actively considering proscribing Irans Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation but has not reached a final decision. In the audio recording broadcast by BBC Persian, Akbari said he had made false confessions as a result of torture. With more than 3,500 hours of torture, psychedelic drugs, and physiological and psychological pressure methods, they took away my will. They drove me to the brink of madness... and forced me to make false confessions by force of arms and death threats, he said. An Iranian state TV report broadcast on Saturday - details of which Reuters could not independently verify - said he was arrested on espionage charges in 2008 before being freed on bail and leaving the country. It said in 2009 he went to Austria under the pretext of medical treatment, then to Spain and eventually to England. In an interview with BBC Persian broadcast on Friday, Akbaris brother Mehdi said he had returned to Iran in 2019 based on an invitation from Shamkhani. Source: Reuters",

Accordingly, authorities of the Réunion Island of France repatriated 46 Sri Lankan nationals to Sri Lanka by air last evening. The group, comprising 43 males, three females and a young boy, had set aboard a multiday fishing trawler from Negombo on 02 December 2022, and were apprehended on 24 December 2022 upon their attempt to illegally enter the Réunion Island of France. While being identified as residents of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Batticaloa, Chilaw and Negombo, aged between 13 and 53, the Sri Lanka Navy reported that the group is due to be handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for onward legal action. The smugglers who facilitated the illegal migration attempt have also been identified as residents of Dehiwala the Navy stated, adding that fees ranging from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 4,500,000 had been charged from each individual. Thus, the Sri Lanka Navy warned the general public to remain vigilant of such scams, emphasizing that the French government does not entertain such illegal activities and that those who attempt to enter the country illegally will be repatriated upon apprehension.",

        "title": "Soledar: Russia claims victory in battle for Ukraine salt mine town",
        "date": "January 14, 2023 09:22 pm",
        "content": "Russias military says it has captured the Ukrainian salt-mine town of Soledar after a long battle, calling it an important step for its offensive. The victory would allow Russian troops to push on to the neaby city of Bakhmut, and cut off the Ukrainian forces there, a spokesman said. This was a very confident and ambitious statement from Moscow. But Ukrainian officials said the fight for Soledar was still going on and accused Russia of information noise. The battle for Soledar has been one of the bloodiest of the war. The town is relatively small, with a pre-war population of just 10,000, and its strategic significance is debatable. But if it is confirmed that Russian forces have seized control of it, then there will likely be a big sigh of relief in the Kremlin. Divisions have emerged between regular Russian forces and the notorious Russian Wagner paramilitary group throughout the battle, with a jealous turf-war developing over who should take credit for the advance. Barely any walls in Soledar remain standing, Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week. Describing almost apocalyptic scenes, he spoke of the nearby terrain as scarred by missile strikes and littered with Russian corpses. Speaking during his nightly address from Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky said the battle in the region continued to rage, but avoided any reference to Russias claims of control over Soledar. Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defence and security forces - are defending the state, the Ukrainian leader said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, compared the fight for Soledar and Bakhmut to one of the bitterest battles of World War One, at Verdun. Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday that 559 civilians including 15 children remained in Soledar and could not be moved out. The towns significance for the Russian military is disputed by military analysts because of its relatively small size. The US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said while it was likely that Russian forces had captured Soledar, it did not believe they would then be able to go on to encircle Bakhmut. Nevertheless, if it becomes clear that Russia has taken it, then that will be seen in Moscow as progress - even a victory. That is exactly what President Vladimir Putin needs as Russia has failed to capture a single town in Ukraine since July 2022. Since then, Moscows forces have suffered a whole series of embarrassing defeats. Ukraines successful counter-attack pushed Russia almost completely out of Kharkiv region in the north-east. In October, Russias Kerch bridge came under attack, with Russian forces retreating from the city of Kherson the following month. The southern port city had been the only regional capital that Russia had managed to seize since the invasion began. Capturing Soledar would be something for Moscow to present as some good news to the Russian people and the troops on the wintry front line. But Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraines eastern military command, denied Soledar was in Russian hands: We wont give any more details as we do not want to reveal the tactical positions of our fighters. Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, said fighting had been hot in Soledar overnight. Ukrainian fighters were bravely trying to hold the defence, she added, in what was a difficult stage of the war. Western and Ukrainian officials have said much of the fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut is being done by the notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group. Its leader, 61-year-old Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed repeatedly over the past few days that his forces are the only units on the ground in Soledar. He said on Tuesday night that his mercenaries had seized the town, only to be contradicted by Russias defence ministry the next morning. Daily updates from the Russian defence ministry have made no mention whatsoever of Wagner, and Fridays briefing was no exception. The military said that paratroopers had played a key part in the capture of the town. Mr Prigozhin then released a statement saying he was surprised to read the defence ministry briefing. There wasnt a single paratrooper in Soledar, he insisted, warning against insulting his fighters and stealing others achievements. And on Friday evening, Mr Prigozhin accused officials who want to stay in their places of being the biggest threat to his groups advance in Ukraine. In a later statement, the defence ministry praised the mercenaries courageous and selfless actions during the fighting, but again emphasised the leading role of regular Russian forces. Analysts have long spoken of tensions between the military and Mr Prigozhins Wagner group. The Russian oligarch has publicly criticised senior military leaders, including Gen Valery Gerasimov, appointed two days ago as overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. While Russia has mobilised some 300,000 reservists for the war since the end of September, Prigozhin has looked to recruit extra numbers from Russias prisons. Andriy Yermak told French daily Le Monde that Russian criminals had been sent straight to their deaths on the front line: Soledar is a scene of street battles, with neither side really in control of the town.

Despite having made a decision to provide the required amounts of naphtha only upon payment of the relevant fee by the CEB, the CPC yesterday (13 Jan.) supplied the petroleum corporation with 2,300 metric tonnes of naphtha. The engineers belonging to CEB, however, noted that the stock would last only three and a half days, highlighting that if a permanent supply of naphtha is not secured, the Kelanitissa Combined Cycle Power Station would have to be shut down after Tuesday (17 Jan.). They were also of the opinion that if CPC provided the petroleum product at its original cost of Rs. 82, as opposed to the Rs. 164 that CPC sells naphtha to CEB for, the cost of generating electricity, too, could be greatly reduced. CPC trade unions today (14 Jan.) noted, however, that in the event CEB is unable to settle their existing debts, this would be a potential risk to the importation of crude oil into Sri Lanka as well.",

        "date": "January 15, 2023 11:23 am",
        "content": "Mexico has brought into force one of the worlds strictest anti-tobacco laws by enacting a total ban on smoking in public places. The step, which was first approved in 2021, also includes a ban on tobacco advertising. Several other Latin American countries have also passed legislation to create smoke-free public spaces. However, Mexicos legislation is considered to be the most robust and wide-ranging in the Americas. It amounts to one of the most stringent anti-smoking laws in the world. Mexicos existing 2008 law - which created smoke-free spaces in bars, restaurants and workplaces - is now extended to an outright ban in all public spaces. That includes parks, beaches, hotels, offices and restaurants. There will also be a total ban on the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products, meaning that cigarettes cannot even be on show inside shops. Vapes and e-cigarettes are also subject to tighter new restrictions, particularly indoors. The Pan American Health Organisation has welcomed the step and applauded the Mexican government for implementing the ban. The organisation says that tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, responsible for nearly a million deaths in the Americas each year, either through direct consumption or exposure to second-hand smoke. However, some smokers are dismayed at the draconian nature of the new law. In essence, it means that many will only be allowed to smoke in their homes or other private residences. Others have raised questions about the practicalities of enforcing the law. With police corruption so rampant in Mexico, many fear that rather than issuing real fines or punishments for smoking in public, some officers will use it as a pretext for taking bribes.

The plane had five Indians, four Russians, one Irish, two South Korean, one Australian, one French and one Argentinian national onboard, a Nepal airport official said. The plane was 15 years old, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. The ATR72 is a widely used twin engine turboprop plane manufactured by a joint venture of Airbus and Italys Leonardo. Yeti Airlines has a fleet of six ATR72-500 planes, according to its website. Air accidents are not uncommon in Nepal, home to eight of the worlds 14 highest mountains, including Everest, as the weather can change suddenly and make for hazardous conditions. Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has called an emergency cabinet meeting after the plane crash, a government statement said. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 15, 2023 07:58 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro climbed to 21 on Sunday, as rescue workers raced to dig through a huge pile of debris in search of survivors. At least 35 people were still missing and 73 were injured, Mykola Lukashuk, head of the regional council, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Burn in hell, Russian murderers, he wrote. The building in Dnipro, a city in east-central Ukraine, was partly destroyed during a series of attacks on Saturday, Russias largest wave of strikes in two weeks. On the ground, fighting was still focused on the towns of Soledar and Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region. Rescuers toiled through the night searching for survivors. On Sunday morning, they could be seen punching and kicking through heaped mounds of smashed concrete and twisted metal. In a statement on Sunday on the strikes the previous day, the Russian defence ministry did not mention Dnipro as a specific target. All assigned objects were hit. The targets of the strike have been achieved, it said. Emergency workers said they had heard people screaming for help from underneath piles of debris and were using moments of silence to help direct their efforts. Two rooms on the second floor remain practically intact but buried, Oleh Kushniruk, a deputy director of the regional branch of Ukraines State Emergency Service, told Ukrainian television. Lukashuk, the regional council chief, said 38 people had been rescued as of Sunday morning, including six children. Ukraines top military command said on Sunday that Russia launched three air strikes, 57 missile strikes and carried out 69 attacks from heavy weapon rocket salvo systems on Saturday. Ukrainian forces shot down 26 rockets. A spokesperson for Ukraines southern command also told local television on Sunday that Russia had fired only half of the cruise missiles it had deployed to the Black Sea during Saturdays attacks. This indicates that they still have certain plans, said the spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk. We must understand that they can still be used. The strikes on Saturday also hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv and other places. Officials warned this would restrict power supply for the capital and large swathes of the country over the next few days. Russia, which invaded Ukraine last February, has been pounding the countrys energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since October, causing sweeping blackouts and disruptions to central heating and running water. APPEAL FOR MORE WEAPONS In his evening video address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a fresh appeal to his Western allies for more weaponry to end Russian terror and attacks on civilian targets. Saturdays attack came as Western powers consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv and ahead of a meeting of Ukraines allies in Ramstein in Germany next Friday, where governments will announce their latest pledges of military support. On Saturday, Britain followed France and Poland with promises of further weapons, saying it would send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks as well as other advanced artillery support in the coming weeks. The first despatch of Western-made tanks to Ukraine is likely to be viewed by Moscow as escalation of the conflict. The Russian Embassy in London said the tanks would drag out the confrontation. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24, saying Kyivs ties with the West threatened Russias security. Ukraine and its allies call it an unprovoked war to seize territory. The conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and turned many cities into rubble. BATTLE FOR SOLEDAR In Ukraines eastern Donbas region - the focal point of Russias drive to capture more territory - Ukraines forces were battling to keep control of the small salt-mining town of Soledar. Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraines eastern command, told Ukrainian television that Russian forces had shelled the area around Soledar and Bakhmut 234 times in the past 24 hours. Russia said on Friday that its forces had taken control of Soledar, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, in what would be a minor advance but one that would have psychological importance for Russian forces, who have seen months of battlefield setbacks. Ukraine insisted on Saturday that its forces were battling to hold the town, but officials acknowledged the situation was difficult, with street fighting raging and Russian forces advancing from various directions. Our soldiers are constantly repelling enemy attacks, day and night, Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Saturday. The enemy is sustaining heavy losses but is continuing to carry out the criminal orders of their command. Reuters could not immediately verify the situation in Soledar. Putin said what he calls the special military operation was showing a positive trend and that he hoped Russian soldiers would deliver further gains after Soledar. The dynamic is positive, he told Rossiya 1 state television. Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "India scripted history during the third ODI against Sri Lanka on Sunday in Thiruvananthapuram by registering the largest margin of victory (by runs) in 50-over international cricket. India thrashed Sri Lanka by 317 runs, going past New Zealands 290-run win over Ireland in Aberdeen in July 2008. Previously, Indias biggest victory by margin of runs was its 257-run win over Bermuda during the 2007 World Cup in Port of Spain. Chasing Indias mammoth 391, Sri Lanka was bowled out for 73 in 22 overs. The visitors had only nine wickets to play with as Ashen Bandara didnt come out to bat after getting injured during fielding. He was involved in a collision with Jeffrey Vandersay at the square-leg boundary. Vandersay was replaced by concussion substitute Dunith Wellalage. Mohammed Siraj was responsible for wrecking Sri Lanka with figures of four for 32 in 10 overs. Mohammed Shami (two for 20) and Kuldeep Yadav (two for 16) did the rest of the damage. Indias win was set up by Virat Kohlis 46th ODI century and Shubman Gills second as the Men in Blue posted an intimidating 390 for five in 50 overs. Kohli struck an unbeaten 110-ball 166 while Gill gave India the perfect platform with 116 off 97 balls. This was Sri Lankas fourth-lowest total in ODI cricket after scores of 43 (vs South Africa), 55 (vs West Indies) and 67 (vs England). It was also the third lowest total against India in ODIs, after Bangladeshs 58 all out and Zimbabwes 65 all out. Source - SPORTSTAR -Agencies",

        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena says that he will have to pay the compensation ordered by the Supreme Court in relation to the Easter Sunday attacks, by collecting funds with the help of his close friends. Joining an event held in the Nittambuwa areas today (Jan. 15), the former president expressed that he is not a person who is rich enough to pay an amount of Rs. 100 million in compensation. Spiking out for the first time with regard to the verdict of the Supreme Court, he said:  the first thing is to respect the law. I am a person who bows my head to the courts decisions, he said. Former President Sirisena mentioned that he was abroad and receiving treatment at a hospital in Singapore, at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks, adding that none of the officials of the security forces notified him regarding the matter, despite receiving intelligence information in advance. Nearly 85 pages of this judgment include that although the officials had received information, the president had not been informed in any way regarding the matter, Mr. Sirisena claimed. The compensation was ordered to be paid with regard to a violation of fundamental human rights, he said, pointing out that the Supreme Courts judgment has mentioned that if the officials appointed by the President committed any mistake, the President should also take responsibility for the mistakes committed by the said officials. The IGP is appointed by the President and the Defense Secretary is appointed by the President, but the Director of Intelligence Service is appointed by the IGP, not the President. However, I have also been ordered to pay Rs. 100 million compensation, that I was also responsible for the non-fulfilment of the responsibilities by them. I am not a person who has an economy to pay a compensation of Rs. 100 million. Me and my friends have decided that we will collect money from our close friends. At the time, I asked them if I should go beg under the Bodi tree in Colombo Fort. The Former President, who alleged that he has no income, also highlighted that he has submitted his assets declaration to Parliament each year, within the five years of his presidency. So, anyone can see my assets declaration under the Right to Information Act and if you need, you can check what I own. Therefore, as one of my friends has decided, I hope to get the necessary support from my friends in this matter. I personally say that for me, no matter what kind of challenges come my way, I dont get hurt. I face any challenge with a smile.",

Jaishankars visit to Colombo on Thursday will focus on supporting Sri Lanka in its current economic crisis, government sources said, adding that talks are ongoing in the field of energy security, food security, currency swap arrangements as well as talks about restructuring Sri Lankas debt. The two-day visit is expected to see some announcements. India is expected to give a positive response to Sri Lankas requirements, in keeping with Indias support last year as well, said a source, citing Indias combined package of about 4 billion including loans, credit lines for the purchase of essentials and a loan deferment through the Asian Clearing Union. In addition, talks are expected on two possible MoUs on the Trincomalee development project and the long-pending plan for a cross-strait transmission line that would allow Sri Lanka access to Indias plans for an energy grid along with other countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The sources stressed that while assisting Sri Lanka with its current economic difficulties is a priority, Mr. Jaishankars visit, his first with the six-month-old government in Colombo, would see a comprehensive review of bilateral ties. Meanwhile, diplomatic sources said that the support, in the form of written financial assurances from India would be critical for Sri Lanka as it works with its other creditors to resolve the economic crisis. Announcing the visit by EAM Jaishankar, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he had discussed the need for the debt restructuring programme with all Sri Lankas creditors, including the 22-nation Paris Club of 22 developed nations that hold much of the global debt and discuss solutions to debt crisis together. Japan and the Paris Club, two of our major creditors, have expressed their willingness to assist. We have already begun talks with India and China. According to the discussions with China Exim Bank recently, were currently debating on how to restructure our debt. The Chinese side has agreed to move quickly, Mr. Wickremesinghe told a group of businessmen last week. He said that Sri Lankas only option was to seek the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for nearly three billion dollar bailout, and was also hopeful of a package from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We discussed with Chinas EXIM Bank this week and by now we have commenced exchanging views on it. Indias Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on the 19th to discuss the debt restructuring process. We are proceeding with these activities gradually, the Sri Lankan President said to a separate group of trade union representatives, indicating the visit by Japanese State Minister of the Cabinet Office Satoshi Fujimaru and the ongoing visit of Chen Zhou, Vice Minister of the International Department, the Communist Party of China Central Committee. After Mr. Chens meeting with President Wickremesinghe, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka said the talks were friendly and fruitful, and quoted Mr. Wickremesinghe as saying that he looked forward to Chinas support in restructuring Sri Lankas debt at the moment and our economy in the near future. Sri Lanka had hoped to finalise its IMF bailout package, but missed a December deadline due to the delay in concluding debt restructure talks. It now hopes to complete the talks in the first quarter of 2023. Source - The Hindu -Agencies",

It is reported that a final agreement will be reached between the parties regarding the submission of nominations for the upcoming Local Government (LG) elections. However, it is also reported that the SLFP is likely to leave the alliance, as a proposal has reportedly been made to contest the LG election alone by leaving the alliance. Several rounds of discussions have been held among the SLFP representatives in this regard yesterday (Jan. 16), and they have reportedly discussed whether to proceed with the new alliance or not. Thus, the General Secretary of the SLFP, Dayasiri Jayasekara stated that the relevant decisions taken at the discussions in this regard will be announced by the representatives of the party in the special executive committee meeting of the Freedom Peoples Alliance, which will be held today. Meanwhile, former Western Provincial Council member Gamini Thilakasiri claims that the SLFP will not leave the Freedom Peoples Alliance.",

        "title": "IMF says fragmentation could cost global economy up to 7 of GDP",
        "date": "January 16, 2023 10:32 am",
        "content": "A severe fragmentation of the global economy after decades of increasing economic integration could reduce global economic output by up to 7, but the losses could reach 8-12 in some countries, if technology is also decoupled, the International Monetary Fund said in a new staff report. The IMF said even limited fragmentation could shave 0.2 off of global GDP, but said more work was needed to assess the estimated costs to the international monetary system and the global financial safety net (GFSN). The note, released late Sunday, noted that the global flows of goods and capital had leveled off after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and a surge in trade restrictions seen in subsequent years. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russias invasion of Ukraine have further tested international relations and increased skepticism about the benefits of globalization, the staff report said. It said deepening trade ties had resulted in a large reduction in global poverty for years, while benefitting low-income consumers in advanced economies through lower prices. The unraveling of trade links would most adversely impact low-income countries and less well-off consumers in advanced economies, it said. Restrictions on cross-border migration would deprive host economies of valuable skills while reducing remittances in migrant-sending economies. Reduced capital flows would reduce foreign direct investment, while a decline in international cooperation would pose risks to provision of vital global public goods. The IMF said existing studies suggested that the deeper the fragmentation, the deeper the costs, with technological decoupling significantly amplifying losses from trade restrictions. It noted that emerging market economies and low-income countries are likely to be most at risk as the global economy shifted to more financial regionalization and a fragmented global payment system. With less international risk-sharing, (global economic fragmentation) could lead to higher macroeconomic volatility, more severe crises, and greater pressures on national buffers, it said. It could also weaken the ability of the global community to support countries in crisis and complicate the resolution of future sovereign debt crises. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The report of the five-member committee appointed to look into the issues pertaining to the Sri Lanka cricket teams conduct during its tour in Australia for the T20 World Cup has been forwarded to the Attorney General for advice on legal action, the Sports Ministry said. A five-member committee was appointed on December 02, in order to inquire into the incidents reported against Sri Lanka cricket players during their recent tour in Australia for the ICC T20 World Cup. The committee was appointed by Minister of Sports  Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe pursuant to Article 39(3) of the Sports Law No. 25 of 1973. Sri Lankas inglorious exit from the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia was accompanied by players partying at casinos, corruption and the influence of a fake prophet, the inquiry showed on Thursday (Jan. 12). Batsman Danushka Gunathilaka was arrested hours after Sri Lankas tournament prematurely ended and has been charged with four counts of sexual assault on a woman in Sydney. An independent panel which investigated Sri Lankas off-field behaviour during the World Cup in October-November revealed a litany of wrongdoing among players, officials and associates. Sri Lanka, the Asian champions, were stunned by Namibia in their opening match and failed to progress to the knockout rounds after finishing fourth in their Super 12 group. Bowler Chamika Karunaratne was involved in a brawl at a casino along with six team-mates when he objected to a fellow punter taking his picture, the panels 63-page report said. Karunaratne was fined and given a suspended ban last year. Meanwhile, the five-member panel recommended that casinos be off-limits for players on overseas tours and that wives be allowed in their hotel rooms  a practice permitted until 2016  to ensure they do not stray out and violate team discipline. A former high-performance manager, Jerome Jayaratne, had no role with the team but was reportedly sent to Melbourne for 10 days and paid 7,000. Jayaratne contributed nothing to the team on the trip and spent time with his sister instead, the panel reported. Former skipper Mahela Jayawardene travelled as a consultant coach at the cricket boards expense but opened a branch of his upmarket Ministry of Crab restaurant chain in Australia, the panel reported. The investigators, led by retired Supreme Court Justice Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena, called for a comprehensive audit of the Sri Lanka Cricket board and urged the sports minister to seize board documents to ensure evidence was not destroyed. A man claiming to be a prophet had established considerable influence over some team members and key officials, the panel said, calling for a wider investigation. Under his influence the bowler Karunaratne left an oil lamp burning in his room, despite hotel warnings of a fire hazard, it added. There was no immediate comment from Sri Lanka Cricket, but Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe had said he will study the report and act on it to ensure team discipline and stamp out corruption. The panel had also called for better physical fitness among national players. -With Agencies Inputs",

The suspects and the fishing trawlers have been escorted to the Colombo Port today (Jan. 16), the Navy said. The apprehension has been made based on information revealed by the suspects of a local fishing trawler which was held during a special operation carried out by the Navy, in waters west of Beruwala on January 05. The same operation, which was carried out by SLNS Wickrama II had also led to the seizure of 22 packages of heroin weighing 23kg and 235g, which were smuggled by those suspects. The Navy has held 05 suspects and the drug-carrying trawler during the apprehension. During the interrogation, the suspects aboard those trawlers have admitted that they had thrown the stocks of narcotics overboard in the presence of the Navy.

        "date": "January 16, 2023 07:08 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide 10kg of rice per month to 02 million low-income families including Samurdhi beneficiaries for a period of two months. Accordingly, the government will purchase 61,600 metric tons of paddy to meet the requirement of 40,000 Metric Tons. This program is proposed to be implemented by District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries with the assistance of small and medium-scale paddy mills, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Under the District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, rice will be distributed among the identified Samurdhi beneficiaries including low-income earners using the existing system and the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment will coordinate the District Secretaries and issue necessary instructions to them, the PMD mentioned. The total estimated cost is Rs.8,040 million, which includes Rs.6,200 million for paddy purchase, Rs.290 million for rice drying, Rs.590 million for milling charges, Rs.200 million for packing costs, Rs.160 million as additional payment to mill owners, and Rs.600 million for transportation, it added. However, the programs estimated cost will vary depending on market fluctuations, and a budget provision of around Rs.10,000 million will be allocated to be used if the need arises. According to data from the Departments of Agriculture and Agrarian Development, the land extent used for paddy cultivation in the 20222023 Maha season is approximately 732,201 hectares, and the expected yield is 3.3 million metric tons, while approximately 2.2 million metric tons of rice can be produced. Given the countrys monthly rice requirement of approximately 210,000 metric tons, it has been observed that the next Maha season may see a paddy surplus. As a result, in order to protect both the paddy farmer and the consumer, the government must intervene in the purchase of a specific amount of paddy during the 202223 season, according to the PMD. Furthermore, due to the countrys extremely difficult economic situation, it is necessary to protect low-income groups of society from the negative effects of the crisis by assisting them in maintaining a good nutritional level. This group consists of approximately 2 million families, including Samurdhi beneficiaries, said the PMD. It also expressed that although the government has provided additional funds for this group until April 2023, there is a need to care for these low-income earners for a further period. Because the paddy harvest in this season of 20222023 is expected to be higher than the previous Maha season, it is appropriate to use a portion of the paddy to provide additional support to identified low-income earners in order to maintain their standard of living. This program will benefit both farmers and low-income groups in the country. The Treasury Secretary, officers of the Presidential Secretariat, the Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, the Secretary to the Ministry of Women, and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, all District Secretaries, the Department of Samurdhi Development, and other related institutions will participate in the discussions on the method of implementing the proposed program. It is also expected to discuss and decide on the proposed rice distribution mechanism. In addition, the production cost of rice varieties to be purchased by farmers, a certified price for rice, paddy owner participation, transportation methods, and paddy milling charges will be discussed in depth, according to the PMD.",

        "title": "German defence minister resigns amid criticism, pressure over Ukraine arms",
        "date": "January 16, 2023 11:55 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht resigned from Chancellor Olaf Scholzs government on Monday, the culmination of growing doubt about her ability to revive Germanys armed forces against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. Her decision dealt a blow to Scholz at a time when Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germanys defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. The pressure to find a successor is mounting also because U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is expected in Berlin on Thursday and will attend a conference on Friday at the U.S. military base in Ramstein, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to discuss further support for Ukraine, including whether to send German-built battle tanks. Lambrecht asked Scholz to dismiss her, as formally required, and he has approved, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic (SPD)-led coalition government said. During a visit to arms manufacturer Hensoldt, Scholz thanked Lambrecht for her service and said he would act fast to replace her. I have a clear idea and it will be known very quickly for everyone how this should proceed, he told reporters. Citing government sources, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said a successor would be announced on Tuesday. Among the candidates mooted by German media are Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces Eva Hoegl, junior defence minister Siemtje Moeller, SPD party chief Lars Klingbeil and Labour Minister Hubertus Heil. Scholz has promised to staff his cabinet with equal numbers of men and women. If a man should succeed Lambrecht, this could result in further reshuffling. PERFORMANCE CRITICISED Lambrecht was blamed by critics for failing to get the German armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, back in shape quickly, despite a 100-billion-euro (108.11 billion) special fund being agreed for that purpose after Russia invaded Ukraine. Economy Minister Robert Habeck praised Lambrecht for her ambition to reform the Bundeswehr and said her decision would not have been taken lightly. It shows the kind of pressure she is under, but also how she is trying to keep the office from being damaged, Habeck said at an energy conference in Berlin. Lambrecht was most recently criticised by media and opposition figures for posting a New Years message on social media in which she thanked servicemen and women, but struggled to be heard against background noise from firecrackers and seemingly mixed up the war in Ukraine with pleasant personal encounters. What kind of a year was 2022? It confronted us with many incredible challenges. There is a war raging in the middle of Europe. Associated with this were for me many special impressions, many encounters with interesting, great people, Lambrecht said in the video. Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of Germanys parliamentary defence committee and a member of Scholzs junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), called for her successor to be installed quickly. I now expect the Social Democrats to name a successor as soon as possible who is assertive towards the ministry, does not abuse the defence ministry for other political ambitions and, above all, brings with them an understanding and heart for the soldiers, she said in remarks carried by the Funke media group.
