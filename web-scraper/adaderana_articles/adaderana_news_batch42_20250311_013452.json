        "title": "The Barbie bonanza continues at the box office, Oppenheimer holds the No. 2 spot",
        "date": "July 31, 2023 01:10 pm",
        "content": "A week later, the Barbenheimer boom has not abated. Seven days after Greta Gerwigs Barbie and Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. Barbie took in a massive 93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Oppenheimer stayed in second with a robust 46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43 and 44, respectably  well shy of the usual week-two drops. Barbenheimer has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed 1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, call it a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters. Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each others fortunes  both box-office wise and it terms of their profile  I dont know if theres a comp for this in the annals of box-office history, said Dergarabedian. Theres really no comparison for this. Following its year-best 162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of Barbie saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolans The Dark Knight to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever. Barbie has rapidly accumulated 351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day its played, Barbie has made at least 20 million. And the Barbie effect isnt just in North America. The film made 122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached 775 million. Its the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives. Thats a crazy number, said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. Theres just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world. Amid the frenzy, Barbie is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12 of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again. For a movie industry that has been trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing  and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes  the sensations of Barbie and Oppenheimer have showed whats possible when everything lines up just right. Post-pandemic, theres no ceiling and theres no floor, Goldstein said. The movies that miss really miss big time, and the movies that work really work big time. Universal Pictures Oppenheimer, meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking. Nolans drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued 174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional 72.4 million in international cinemas, Oppenheimer has already surpassed 400 million globally. Showings in IMAX have typically been sold out. Oppenheimer has made 80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the films run through Aug. 13. The weeks top new release, Walt Disney Co.s Haunted Mansion, an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the Barbenheimer blitz. The film, which cost about 150 million, debuted with 24 million domestically and 9 million in overseas sales. Haunted Mansion, directed by Justin Simien (Dear White People, Bad Hair) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews. Talk to Me, the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with 10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95 fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest 4.5 million. While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, its been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with Top Gun: Maverick. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I, which debuted the week before the arrival of Barbenheimer, grossed 10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed 139.2 million domestically and 309.3 million oveseas. Instead, the sleeper hit Sound of Freedom has been the best performing non-Barbenheimer release in theaters. The Angel Studios release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made 12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly 150 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Barbie, 93 million. 2. Opppenheimer, 46.2 million. 3. Haunted Mansion, 24.2 million. 4. Sound of Freedom, 12.4 million. 5. Mission: Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part One, 10.7 million. 6. Talk to Me, 10 million. 7. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, 4 million. 8. Elemental, 3.4 million. 9. Insidious: The Red Door, 3.2 million. 10. Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, 1.6 million.

Addressing a demonstration organised by the NPP in Colombo today (31), the MP claimed that his party is ready to take on the responsibility of governing the country. The protest march was organized by the NPP in Colombo today urging the government to stop the alleged looting of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). However, the Fort Magistrates court had issued an order restricting the movement of the protesters holding demonstrations near 18 locations including the Presidential Secretariat, Presidents House and the Ministry of Finance. As such, the National Peoples Power held their protest in front of the Fort Railway Station, which was attended by senior members of the NPP including its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Do we have to wait until the government loots the funds deducted from our salaries? We should not allow that to happen, the NPPs leader said. Commenting further, Dissanayake questioned what the government has done with loans obtained under the guise of construction projects, while accusing that they have completed the projects by utilizing 25 of those funds, while looting the remaining 75. That is why this country has been bankrupted. After bankrupting the country, they are attempting to loot the EPF and ETF of the people, he alleged. How much further should we be patient? The working people must take lead against these actions. My request to the government is simple. Please leave now without further deteriorating this country. The National Peoples Power is ready to take the responsibility of leading this country along with the people, Dissanayake said.",

        "date": "August 1, 2023 09:16 am",
        "content": "An Afghan branch of the Islamic State group on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Pakistan that killed at least 54 people at a pro-Taliban partys election rally, in one of the regions worst attacks in recent years. Islamic State in Khorasan Province made the claim in a statement posted on its Amaq website. It said the attacker detonated an explosive vest, and that the bombing Sunday in the northwestern town of Bajur was part of the groups continuing war against forms of democracy it deems to be against Islam. Hours earlier, hundreds of mourners in Bajur carried caskets draped in colorful cloths to burial sites following the previous days attack at the election rally for the Jamiat Ulema Islam party. Officials said the bombing killed 54 people, including at least five children, and wounded nearly 200. The attack appeared to reflect divisions between Islamist groups, which have a strong presence in the district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan. The Jamiat Ulema Islam party has ties to the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. At least 1,000 people were crowded into a tent near a market for the rally ahead of fall elections, according to police. People were chanting God is Great as the leaders arrived, said Khan Mohammad, a local resident who said he was standing outside the tent, and that was when I heard the deafening sound of the bomb. Mohammad said he heard people crying for help, and minutes later ambulances arrived and began taking the wounded away. Police had suggested in their initial investigation that Islamic State in Khorasan Province was a suspect. The group is based in neighboring Afghanistans Nangarhar province and is a rival of the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaida. Pakistan security analyst Mahmood Shah also previously had said that breakaway factions of the Pakistani Taliban could be possible suspects, though the group distanced itself from the attack. The Pakistani military spent years fighting the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in Bajur before declaring the district clear of militants in 2016. But the Jamiat Ulema Islam party, headed by hard-line cleric and politician Fazlur Rehman, has remained a potent political force. On Monday, police recorded statements from some of the wounded at a hospital in Khar, the districts principal town. Female relatives and children wailed and beat their chests at family homes Monday as the dead were taken for funerals, following local customs. Hundreds of men followed the caskets to mosques and open areas for special funeral prayers and then into the hills for burial. As condolences continued to pour in from across the country, dozens of people who had lesser injuries were discharged from hospital, while the critically wounded were taken to the provincial capital of Peshawar by army helicopters. The death toll continued to rise as some critically wounded people died in hospital, physician Gul Naseeb said. Gul Akbar, the father of an 11-year-old boy who was wounded in the attack, told The Associated Press that his entire family was in a state of shock after hearing about the bombing Sunday. He said he first went to the scene of the attack, and later found his son Taslim Khan being treated in a hospital in Khar. What would I have done if he had also been martyred? Five children died in this barbaric attack, and we want to know what our children did wrong, he said. Rehmans party is preparing to contest elections, which are expected in October or November. Abdul Rasheed, one of the partys senior leaders, said the bombing was aimed at weakening the party but that such attacks cannot deter our resolve. Rehmans party is part of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifs coalition government, which came to power in April 2022 by ousting former Prime Minister Imran Khan through a no-confidence vote in the legislature. Sharif called Rehman to express his condolences and assure the cleric that those who orchestrated the attack would be punished. Khan condemned the bombing Sunday, as did the U.S. and Russian embassies in Islamabad. The Pakistani Taliban also distanced themselves from the bombing, saying that it was intended to set Islamists against each other. Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, wrote in a tweet that such crimes cannot be justified in any way. The bombing came hours before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng arrived in Islamabad, where he signed new agreements to boost trade and economic ties to mark a decade of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a sprawling package under which China has invested 10 billion in Pakistan over 10 years, according to Sharif. We will not tolerate any obstacles in the way of friendship with China, Sharif said, as he stood next to He. But the government canceled a cultural event that had been arranged in honor of He, according to Sharif, while the nation mourns. Some Chinese nationals have also been targeted by militants in northwestern Pakistan and elsewhere. Rehman, who has long supported Afghanistans Taliban government, survived at least two known bomb attacks in 2011 and 2014, when bombings damaged his car at rallies. Sundays bombing was one of the worst in northwestern Pakistan in the last decade. In 2014, 147 people, mostly schoolchildren, were killed in a Taliban attack on an army-run school in Peshawar. In January, 74 people were killed in a bombing at a mosque in Peshawar.

        "date": "August 1, 2023 10:34 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) published its inaugural Monetary Policy Report (MPR) on Monday (July 31). The publication of the Monetary Policy Report marks an important step towards improving the transparency of monetary policy and is expected to promote engagement with all stakeholders of the economy through the dissemination of information that was considered by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the formulation of monetary policy decisions, the Central Bank said in a statement. The MPR presents the Central Banks assessment of the future trajectory of inflation and other key macroeconomic variables based on the analysis of the current macroeconomic developments on the domestic and global fronts, and their outlook. The MPR also aims to provide an assessment of the balance of risks to the projections on inflation and economic growth considering the ongoing and expected developments. Such assessment would help provide greater clarity to all stakeholders on the thinking of the Monetary Board when arriving at monetary policy decisions. The Central Bank said it would publish the MPR in January and July each year in line with the major monetary policy review cycles that update medium-term projections. In doing so, the Central Bank would provide data-driven and forward-looking information to all stakeholders in a timely manner. This would enhance the transparency and accountability of the monetary policy making of the Central Bank, while assisting in the anchoring of inflation expectations of the general public. The MPR will complement the existing communication on the monetary policy process of the Central Bank, including the Monetary Policy Review press release, press conference proceedings, and other communiqués featured on the official website and social media of the Central Bank.",

        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says the first fuel cargo of Sinopec, Chinas leading international petroleum company, has commenced the discharging process, while the second cargo is slated to reach the island tomorrow (Aug 02). In a Twitter message, Wijesekera expressed that the entry of new retail suppliers to the domestic market will ease the foreign exchange requirements for petroleum products as the suppliers will bring in products on a 12-month financing facility from their principal investors with no forex requirements from the domestic financial institutes. Accordingly, Sinopec will commence retail petroleum operations with 150 fuel stations island-wide, once the agreements with fuel station dealers are signed and finalized, he added. Sinopec Energy Lanka (Pvt) Limited  the Beijing-based companys subsidiary in Sri Lanka  signed an agreement with the Board of Investment (BOI) on July 14 to operate and set up filling stations for fuel distribution on the island nation. Sinopec has invested USD 100 million in the project, which includes import, storage and sales of fuel. In addition, Sinopec will establish 50 new filling stations in the country. The agreement inked by Sinopec and the BOI allows the project to operate for 20 years under the oversight of Sinopec Energy Lanka, in accordance with the Sri Lanka BOI Act No. 17. Sinopec will sell various petroleum products, including 92 and 95 Octane Petrol, 500 PPM Diesel, Diesel 10 COPPM, petroleum jet fuel, and other diesel and petroleum products. Sinopec is the largest oil and petrochemical products supplier and the second-largest oil and gas producer in China, the largest refining company, and the third-largest chemical company in the world. Its total number of gas stations ranks second place in the world. It ranked 5th on Fortunes Global 500 List in 2021. In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lankas fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations. In October the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy. Later, in March 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted the approval to award licenses to Chinas Sinopec, Australias United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell PLC, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the nod to several proposals tabled by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms in a bid to streamline the role of coroner and make it more efficient. Coroners are appointed in Sri Lanka on Korala basis, municipal division basis and hospital basis. The government says people find it difficult to get the services of coroners due to the inability to identify the boundaries of the relevant jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the large number of vacancies in some districts due to the non-appointment of a coroner for a long time is another reason that inconveniences the people. In order to resolve those issues and provide a more efficient and regular service to the people, the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has prepared a fixed manual clearly stating the provisions including the qualifications, responsibilities and roles of the coroners. In accordance with the provisions of the said manual, the ministry has planned to assign all currently appointed coroners to Divisional Secretariats and identified hospitals, to appoint bilingual inspectors for bilingual Divisional Secretariats, and to make new recruitments to fill the remaining vacancies.",

        "content": "A former childcare worker in Australia has been charged with sexually abusing 91 children in what has been described as one of the worst child sex abuse cases in the countrys history. The 45-year-old man has been accused of 1,623 separate offences, including 136 counts of rape, 110 counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and 613 counts of producing child exploitation material, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said on Tuesday. The alleged crimes were carried out at 12 different childcare centres in Sydney, Brisbane and overseas between 2007 and 2022, police said. The man, who police said passed background checks required for his job, alleged to have recorded himself abusing his victims, all of whom were pre-pubescent girls. Police said they believe that all 87 Australian children recorded in the child exploitation videos have been identified and they are working with international partners to identify four children abused overseas. Investigators had been searching for the man since discovering a collection of child exploitation images and videos circulating on the dark web in 2014. The accused man, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, has been in custody since he was arrested and charged with a number of child exploitation offences in August 2022. The man, who has not been named, is scheduled to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on August 21. While I am extremely proud of law enforcements persistence and their unwavering dedication to identify this alleged offender, and stop further abuse, this is chilling news, AFP Northern Assistant Commissioner Justine Gough said. It is with a heavy heart that the AFP and other law enforcement dedicate so much time and resources to prevent and take action against individuals who commit heinous crimes against children. New South Wales state police Assistant Commissioner Michael Fitzgerald described the case as one of the most horrific cases of alleged child abuse our detectives have seen. Alongside our partner agencies, we are absolutely committed to prosecuting anyone who goes after our communitys most vulnerable, Fitzgerald said. Source  Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "date": "August 1, 2023 03:44 pm",
        "content": "Land connectivity is essential for the growth of ties between India and its neighbouring island, said the Sri Lankan high commissioner to India, pitching for connectivity projects resembling the Channel tunnel from the U.K. to Europe as a possible future initiative if environmental concerns are cleared. Speaking about Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to India in July, where the two countries unveiled an Economic Partnership Vision statement that includes maritime, air, energy, trade and people-to-people connectivity, High Commissioner Milinda Moragoda said Sri Lankas hopes of benefiting from Indias economic growth and coming out of its current economic crisis hinged on being able to build causeways, bridges, pipelines, electricity transmission lines and landing infrastructure so as to increase travel to and from India. Building any causeway or highway across the streets will require environmental impact assessments, and there is a process for that, Mr. Moragoda told The Hindu in an interview. If Sri Lanka is looking at this idea of piggybacking on Indias growth story we have to have land connectivity, he added. 13th amendment When asked why concerns expressed by India over implementation of the 13th amendment for devolution of power to Tamil majority areas was not, however, included in the joint statements made during the visit, the Sri Lankan envoy said President Wickremesinghe had discussed his latest proposals with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Prime Minister Mr. Modi expressed his views and President Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed Sri Lankas position. So that conversation will continue, said Mr. Moragoda, pointing out that eventually the resolution of the Tamils issue would have to be found within Sri Lanka. The vision statement released after President Wickremesinghe met Mr. Modi in Delhi on July 21 refers to plans for a feasibility study on land connectivity at an early date. Both leaders have decided to establish land connectivity between Sri Lanka and India for developing land access to the ports of Trincomalee and Colombo, propelling economic growth and prosperity in both Sri Lanka and India, and further consolidating millennia-old relationship between the two countries, it said. However, the envoy declined to comment on whether this would involve using the Ram Sethu, or the Adams Bridge that connects Tamil Nadu to Mannar Island, which has been the focus of protests by religious and environmental groups, in any way. Private investments In addition, the envoy said that as Sri Lanka doesnt have refining capabilities, an oil pipeline could help the islands needs, especially if connected to the oil tank farms in Trincomalee which are also part of the MoUs signed during President Wickremesinghes visit. The projects agreed to during the visit most closely mirror a number of MoUs signed during Mr. Wickremesinghes previous visit in 2017, when he was Prime Minister under then Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. Those MoUs, including the plan for India to refurbish energy and port facilities in the eastern city of Trincomalee eventually did not make headway and were delayed due to internal political turmoil in Sri Lanka. When asked about timelines for the execution of the projects agreed to during this visit, Mr. Moragoda said the emphasis now is on encouraging private investments. When you talk of timelines for initiatives like this in democracies, its more complicated. One understanding between the two leaders is to try to encourage the private sector to be more engaged on both sides, which could be more time-sensitive and successful, he explained. He added that the purpose of the Sri Lankan Presidents visit, the first to India since he took over in June 2022, to chart the way forward for Sri Lankas economic recovery, as the economic vision statement had done, and to thank Mr. Modi and India for the support to Sri Lanka during its debt crisis. In the past week, Colombo has received visits from French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and an official from the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, all of whom also offered to help Sri Lanka as it works out a debt restructuring programme with the International Monetary Fund by the end of the year. Mr. Moragoda said economic revenue streams would have to be upgraded for a recovery, and hoped particularly for Indian investment and Indian tourists to contribute to that.

        "content": "Former Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been pardoned in five of 19 charges brought against her by the military. The pardon, part of a seasonal amnesty, will reduce her 33-year jail sentence by six years. Former president Win Myint, who was ousted along with Ms Suu Kyi, also received a reduced jail sentence after getting two of his charges pardoned. Periodic amnesties have been announced before, but this is the first time they have included Ms Suu Kyi and Mr Myint. The military junta has made other concessions in what appears to be an effort to revive stalled diplomacy efforts. Last week, Ms Suu Kyi was moved from prison to house arrest in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. The 78-year-old Nobel laureate has been detained by the military since February 2021 following the coup that ousted her. The coup triggered civil war in the country, and has led to the deaths of thousands of people. The military junta has also been accused of unleashing disproportionate violence against those opposing its rule. Some countries, notably China and Thailand, have started a dialogue with the junta, but these initiatives have been criticised for excluding Ms Suu Kyis party which won a huge majority in 2020 elections. The extent of the win led the military to allege election fraud - which they then used as a justification for the coup. Any negotiations of a compromise with the international community would almost certainly require the involvement of Ms. Suu Kyi. She has, however, been kept isolated since her arrest after the coup. Almost no news had emerged about her condition for more than two years. Ms Suu Kyi is appealing the convictions to the other offences, which ranges from election fraud to corruption, All the charges - which she has denied - were brought against her in closed-door, military-run trials. Rights groups have condemned the court trials as a sham. The military junta on Monday postponed an election promised to be held by August this year following its coup two years ago.

        "content": "A Sri Lankan asylum seeker in Australia has initiated a 1000km-long journey on foot from Ballarat to Sydney, in a bid to bring the attention of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to refugee families living in limbo and to seek permanent residency in Australia. Neil Para has been living in the regional Victorian city of Ballarat in Australia for more than 8 years with no visa. He is one of approximately 12,500 people who have been living in Australia for more than a decade but are ineligible to apply for permanent residency under the new Resolution of Status visa  about 2,500 have no visa at all, according to foreign media. Para fled Sri Lanka in 2008 amidst the civil war, to Malaysia, leaving his wife, Sugaa, behind. In 2012, along with his eight-month pregnant wife, and two kids, Para travelled by boat to Christmas Island, an Australian external territory, via Indonesia. The family spent time in a detention centre in Darwin, then community detention, before being released on a bridging visa in September 2013, when they moved to Ballarat. Para was able to work while on a bridging visa for four months, until their application for protection was rejected and their visa was revoked. The family has relied on community members to pay their rent and cover bills for almost nine years, while lodging appeals against the rejection and applications for ministerial intervention. Para has said not having access to Medicare had deprived her children of their childhood, as she did not allow them to do things that carried the risk of getting hurt. The youngest daughter is now an Australian citizen, however, the family faces deportation at any time. Para is planning to walk about 30 kilometres each day with the goal to arrive by September 09. More than 100 volunteers are expected to be part of the journey, driving his support vehicle and offering him a place to stay each night. Para has gathered more than 11,500 signatures on an online petition to deliver to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on arrival in Sydney. A spokesperson for Australias Department of Home Affairs said in a statement it would not comment on individual cases due to privacy obligations. The spokesperson said each case was assessed on its merits, taking into account individual circumstances and the most current and relevant country of origin information. -with inputs from agencies",

        "date": "August 1, 2023 11:58 pm",
        "content": "Nasa has picked up a heartbeat signal from its Voyager 2 probe after it lost contact with it billions of miles away from Earth, the space agency said. Last month, the spacecraft - exploring the universe since 1977 - tilted its antenna to point two degrees away from Earth after a wrong command was sent. As a result, the probe stopped receiving commands or sending data. But on Tuesday, Nasa said a signal from Voyager 2 was picked up during a regular scan of the sky. Where is Voyager 2 now? Voyager 2 is more than 12.3 billion miles (19.9 billion km) from Earth, where it is hurtling at an estimated 34,390mph (55,346kmh) through interstellar space - the space between the stars. Since 21 July, the probe has been unable to receive commands or send back data to Nasas Deep Space Network - an array of giant radio antennae across the world - and the spacecraft is not receiving commands from ground controllers. However, there is hope for the probe, with contact - albeit limited - now re-established. Given that the space-craft is almost 20 billion kilometres (more than 12 billion miles) away, that signal will have taken around 18 hours to reach earth. Nasa said the news confirms Voyager 2 is still broadcasting and is in good health. Earlier on Monday, the space agency said its huge dish in Australias capital, Canberra, was trying to detect any stray signals from Voyager 2. The antenna has also been bombarding Voyager 2s area with the correct command, in the hope of making contact with the probe, said Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the Voyager missions. While fuller communication is not yet established, Voyager 2 is programmed to reset its orientation multiple times each year to keep its antenna pointing at Earth. The next reset is due on 15 October, which Nasa says should enable communication to resume. In the meantime, Nasa expects the spacecraft laden with science instruments to remain on its planned trajectory through the universe. The probe has been floating in space since 1977 when it was launched to study the outer solar system. Voyager 2 and its twin Voyager 1 are the only spacecraft ever to operate outside the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the Sun. They reached interstellar space in 2018 and 2012 respectively. The probes were designed to take advantage of a rare alignment of outer planets, which occurs about every 176 years, to explore Jupiter and Saturn.

        "title": "Indian grant will be used for education, health sectors in estate areas - Jeevan",
        "date": "August 1, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "The recently announced Indian grant of INR 75 crore, for development projects targeting Sri Lankas hill country (Malaiyaha) Tamils, will be used primarily for the education and health sectors in the islands long-neglected tea estate region, says Jeevan Thondaman, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development. We want to use this grant for transformative change rather than aesthetic change in the lives of the Indian-origin Tamil community here. It is important that we create conditions for long-term impact, said the 28-year-old Cabinet minister, who is also the General Secretary of the Ceylon Workers Congress, the party of his late great grandfather Savumiamoorthy Thondaman. Speaking to The Hindu at his Colombo office on Tuesday, Minister Thondaman outlined the governments plan for upgrading old creches in the estates into early childhood development centres, converting virtually defunct medical dispensaries into cluster hospitals to provide better healthcare for workers, and setting up a university. The grant, amounting to roughly USD 9 million, was among the announcements made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi on July 21. It adds to Indias relatively recent engagement in Sri Lankas hill country. The Indian-origin Tamils or Malaiyaha Tamils, as some in the community prefer to identify, has a population of over a million, out of which about 1.5 lakh continue to work and reside in the tea estates, two centuries after their south Indian ancestors were brought down by the British as labourers. Enduring deprivation Highlighting the acute economic deprivation in the estate areas, Mr. Thondaman said: If you look at malnutrition or stunted growth, it is the highest among the children in the estates. That is why I say we need to transform their reality, and that means focusing on crucial sectors like education and health. The Ministry will consult all stakeholders, voices from the opposition and civil society, to decide on the course of developmental initiatives, he said. The proposed, Indian grant-backed projects will be in addition to Indias ongoing housing programme in the hill country, aimed at building 14,000 homes  apart from the 50,000 houses built in the war-affected north and east  for families residing on the estates. While appreciating the need for housing, the Minister expressed his reservations about any scheme building homes for people, seeing it as limited in its scope to create broader livelihood opportunities for families. Personally, I think it is more important to ensure land rights for the people. All the same, with nearly 4,000 units having been completed in the estates, the Ministry will focus on launching phase one of building the remaining 10,000 homes, whose construction has been delayed due to a host of factors, including the plantation companies refusal to provide the required land. Duty of care Mr. Thondaman, who was part of President Wickremesinghes delegation to New Delhi, subsequently met Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in Chennai, and discussed prospects for investment and collaboration, especially in education. I conveyed to the Chief Minister our commemoration of the 200th year of Indian Origin Tamils arrival in Sri Lanka. As much as the Sri Lankan government has a responsibility towards our community, the governments of India and Tamil Nadu, too, owe a duty of care to us, he said, referring to the SirimaShastri Pact of 1964. The significant population of the community residing in Tamil Nadu, he said, was living proof of the past injustices faced by the community. Meanwhile, commenting on power devolution and the 13th Amendment that India unfailingly flags in talks with the Sri Lankan side, Mr. Thondaman said: It is really the failure of our southern Sinhalese leadership to pitch the 13th Amendment as something that devolves powers to all provinces, and not as something that gives greater power to only Tamils. That is the reason that the Sinhalese see it as India-imposed, when what India really did around the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 was facilitate democracy. In his view, the political developments of the last 50 years have strained the historically close ties shared by the neighbours. No two countries on this planet have ties as close as India and Sri Lanka spanning centuries, he remarked. There is, however, a shift in perception more recently, he said. The humanitarian help that India provided us during the economic crisis has made it amply clear to all Sri Lankans that India is a true friend. Moreover, the foreign policy of PM Modi and Mr. Jaishankar, batting for the Global South, is setting a precedent in the region, he added. Source: The Hindu -Agencies",

        "title": "Trump indicted for efforts to overturn 2020 election and block transfer of power",
        "date": "August 2, 2023 07:45 am",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trump was indicted on felony charges Tuesday for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the violent riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol, with the Justice Department acting to hold him accountable for an unprecedented effort to block the peaceful transfer of presidential power and threaten American democracy. The four-count indictment, the third criminal case against Trump, provided deeper insight into a dark moment that has already been the subject of exhaustive federal investigations and captivating public hearings. It chronicles a months-long campaign of lies about the election results and says that, even when those falsehoods resulted in a chaotic insurrection at the Capitol, Trump sought to exploit the violence by pointing to it as a reason to further delay the counting of votes that sealed his defeat. Even in a year of rapid-succession legal reckonings for Trump, Tuesdays indictment, with charges including conspiring to defraud the United States government that he once led, was stunning in its allegations that a former president assaulted the bedrock function of democracy. Its the first time the defeated president, who is the early front-runner for next years Republican presidential nomination, is facing legal consequences for his frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power. The attack on our nations Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy, said Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, whose office has spent months investigating Trump. It was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government: the nations process of collecting counting and certifying the results of the presidential election. The Trump campaign called the charges fake and asked why it took two-and-a-half years to bring them. Trump was the only person charged in Tuesdays indictment. But prosecutors obliquely referenced a half-dozen co-conspirators, including lawyers inside and outside of government who they said had worked with Trump to undo the election results. They also advanced legally dubious schemes to enlist slates of fake electors in battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden to falsely claim that Trump had actually won them. The indictment accuses the defeated president and his allies of trying to exploit the violence and chaos by calling lawmakers into the evening on Jan. 6 to delay the certification of Bidens victory. It also cites handwritten notes from former Vice President Mike Pence that give gravitas to Trumps relentless goading to reject the electoral votes. Pence, who is challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, declined overtures from a House panel that investigated the insurrection and sought to avoid testifying before the special counsel. He appeared only after losing a court fight, with prosecutors learning that Trump in one conversation derided him as too honest to stop the certification. Trump is due in court Thursday, the first step in a legal process that will play out in a courthouse situated between the White House he once controlled and the Capitol his supporters once stormed. The case is already being dismissed by the former president and his supporters  and even some of his rivals  as just another politically motivated prosecution. Yet the case stems from one of the most serious threats to American democracy in modern history. The indictment centers on the turbulent two months after the November 2020 election in which Trump refused to accept his loss and spread lies that victory was stolen from him. The turmoil resulted in the riot at the Capitol, when Trump loyalists violently broke into the building, attacked police officers and disrupted the congressional counting of electoral votes. In between the election and the riot, Trump urged local election officials to undo voting results in their states, pressured Pence to halt the certification of electoral votes and falsely claimed that the election had been stolen  a notion repeatedly rejected by judges. Among those lies, prosecutors say, were claims that more than 10,000 dead voters had voted in Georgia along with tens of thousands of double votes in Nevada. Each claim had been rebutted by courts or state or federal officials, the indictment says. Prosecutors say Trump knew his claims of having won the election were false but he repeated and widely disseminated them anyway  to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, to create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and to erode public faith in the administration of the election. The document carefully outlined arguments that Trump has been making to defend his conduct, that he had every right to challenge the results, to use the courts, even to lie about it in the process. But in stark detail, the indictment outlines how the former president instead took criminal steps to reverse the clear verdict voters had rendered. The indictment had been expected since Trump said in mid-July that the Justice Department had informed him he was a target of its investigation. A bipartisan House committee that spent months investigating the run-up to the Capitol riot also recommended prosecuting Trump on charges, including aiding an insurrection and obstructing an official proceeding. The indictment includes charges of conspiring to defraud the U.S., conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and violating a post-Civil War Reconstruction Era civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to violate rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution  in this case, the right to vote. The mounting criminal cases are unfolding in the heat of the 2024 race. A conviction in this case, or any other, would not prevent Trump from pursuing the White House or serving as president, though Trump as president could theoretically appoint an attorney general to dismiss the charges or potentially try to pardon himself. In New York, state prosecutors have charged Trump with falsifying business records about a hush money payoff to a porn actor before the 2016 election. The trial is set to begin in March. In Florida, the Justice Department has brought more than three dozen felony counts, accusing him of illegally possessing classified documents after leaving the White House and concealing them from investigators. That trial begins in May. Prosecutors in Georgia are also investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to reverse his election loss to Biden there. The district attorney of Fulton County is expected to announce charging decisions within weeks. Smiths team has cast a broad net as part of his federal investigation, with his team questioning senior Trump administration officials, including Pence, before a grand jury in Washington. Prosecutors also interviewed election officials in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and other battleground states won by Biden who were pressured by the Trump team to change voting results. Rudy Giuliani, a Trump lawyer who pursued post-election legal challenges, spoke voluntarily to prosecutors. Giuliani was not named in the indictment, but appears to match the description of one of the co-conspirators. A spokesman for Giuliani said Tuesday night that Trump had a good-faith basis for the actions he took. Attorney General Merrick Garland last year appointed Smith, an international war crimes prosecutor who also led the Justice Departments public corruption section, as special counsel to investigate efforts to undo the election as well as Trumps retention of classified documents at his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago. Although Trump has derided him as deranged and called him politically motivated, Smiths past experience includes overseeing significant prosecutions against high-profile Democrats. The Justice Departments investigations began well before Smiths appointment, proceeding alongside separate criminal probes into the rioters themselves. More than 1,000 people have been charged in connection with the insurrection, including some with seditious conspiracy. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to receive second Sinopec fuel cargo today",
        "date": "August 2, 2023 08:49 am",
        "content": "The second fuel cargo of Sinopec, Chinas leading international petroleum company, is scheduled to reach Sri Lanka today (Aug 02). Meanwhile, the discharging process of the first fuel cargo is in progress, according to Minister of Power  Energy Kanchana Wijesekera. Chinese Embassy in Colombo said the first batch contains a total of 45,000 metric tonnes of fuel. In a Twitter message on Tuesday (Aug 01), Wijesekera said that the entry of new retail suppliers to the domestic market will ease the foreign exchange requirements for petroleum products as the suppliers will bring in products on a 12-month financing facility from their principal investors with no foreign exchange requirements from the domestic financial institutes. Accordingly, Sinopec will commence retail petroleum operations with 150 fuel stations island-wide, once the agreements with fuel station dealers are signed and finalized. Sinopec Energy Lanka (Pvt) Limited  the Beijing-based companys subsidiary in Sri Lanka  signed an agreement with the Board of Investment (BOI) on July 14 to operate and set up filling stations for fuel distribution on the island nation. Sinopec has invested USD 100 million in the project, which includes import, storage and sales of fuel. In addition, Sinopec will establish 50 new filling stations in the country. The agreement inked by Sinopec and the BOI allows the project to operate for 20 years under the oversight of Sinopec Energy Lanka, in accordance with the Sri Lanka BOI Act No. 17. Sinopec will sell various petroleum products, including 92 and 95 Octane Petrol, 500 PPM Diesel, Diesel 10 COPPM, petroleum jet fuel, and other diesel and petroleum products. Sinopec is the largest oil and petrochemical products supplier and the second-largest oil and gas producer in China, the largest refining company, and the third-largest chemical company in the world. Its total number of gas stations ranks second place in the world. It ranked 5th on Fortunes Global 500 List in 2021. In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lankas fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations. In October of the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy. Later, in March 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted the approval to award licenses to Chinas Sinopec, Australias United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell PLC, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "August 2, 2023 09:20 am",
        "content": "State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage says during the first seven months of this year, Sri Lanka welcomed a significant influx of 763,000 tourists, contributing to a substantial income of approximately USD 800 million. She highlighted the success of President Ranil Wickremesinghes program aimed at strengthening the national economy through the growth of the tourism industry. This accomplishment has played a crucial role in bolstering Sri Lankas foreign reserves, the lawmaker commented further. Sri Lankas tourism industry suffered a huge setback last year due to the economic crisis, Gamage said, noting that after Wickremesinghe took office as the President, the era of queues in the country came to an end, while the economy slowly bounced back. At the same time, a favourable situation was created for the tourism industry, she added. Gamage shared these remarks during a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), themed Collective Path to a Stable Country. She emphasized the importance of introducing new approaches and adopting innovative strategies to enhance the tourism industry, while underscoring the necessity of developing vibrant and active cities to attract tourists, stating that visitors do not seek out lifeless destinations or dead cities. In line with its efforts to boost tourism, the State Ministry of Tourism in Sri Lanka has undertaken a new program to promote the country as an attractive tourist destination, Gamage said adding that Sri Lanka hosted the final round of the Miss Tourism World pageant, with contestants from 30 countries visiting and exploring the beauty of the island. Meanwhile, a significant milestone is set to take place at the end of this year, as Sri Lanka plans to host the final competition of the World Travel Awards (WTA) in December, according to Gamage, who said this prestigious event is expected to see the participation of 117 countries, further elevating Sri Lankas status as a global tourism destination. Speaking further, the state minister underscored the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard the interests of both tourists and the tourism sector. In this regard, the government has taken steps to implement a system that evaluates the quality of accommodations, such as Air BB, homestays, provided to tourists. By maintaining high-quality facilities and services, Sri Lanka can attract more tourists and enhance the overall tourism experience, she explained. Addressing the speculations regarding the cultivation of hemp (cannabis), Gamage said the focus is not on its use as an intoxicant. Cannabis, indeed, is classified as a drug, but it also has significant potential for medical and industrial purposes. In fact, there are 22 varieties of cannabis in Sri Lanka and numerous numbers of medicinal products that can be derived from hemp, presenting a significant opportunity for Sri Lanka to capitalize on its cultivation and exports. Pointing out that hemp cultivation is gaining prominence globally, and Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leader in this industry, the state minister said there are lucrative investment prospects in producing medicines from hemp, which can yield substantial economic benefits for the country. A ten-acre hemp plantation alone has the potential to generate around US 200 million. The state minister went on to highlight the vitality of implementing a night economy system in order to boost the tourism industry. Tourists seek destinations that provide them with the freedom to enjoy life to the fullest. Closing tourist destinations early, such as at 10 pm, would discourage tourists from visiting. To attract tourists, it is essential to create vibrant and lively environments, not dead cities (areas with limited nightlife). She said it is crucial to extend the operating hours of tourist destinations, allowing visitors to have a more enjoyable experience to attract more tourists. This may involve keeping certain places open later into the night, providing various entertainent options, and facilitating activities that appeal to tourists. Furthermore, establishing direct flight services with international airlines, such as Chinese and Italian airlines, will enhance accessibility and convenience for tourists, Gamage commented that these partnerships can help bring in more visitors and contribute to the growth of Sri Lankas tourism sector.",

        "date": "August 2, 2023 02:21 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has issued a clarification on the misrepresentations of facts circulated with regard to the Indian Rupee (INR). A media release issued by the CBSL emphasized that the authorization of the Indian Rupee as a designated currency does not make it a legal tender in Sri Lanka for domestic paymentssettlements. Any transaction executed between or among residents in Sri Lanka shall be in LKR, being the legal tender in Sri Lanka. The CBSL clarified that the main purpose of authorizing foreign currencies as designated currencies is to promote trade and investment relations between the two countries. Further, it is expected to reduce the additional transaction costs associated with dual conversion and will support promoting trade transactions through the formal banking channel. The CBSL noted that the legal tender in Sri Lanka for domestic payments and settlements will remain as LKR. The statement says trade between Sri Lanka and India has grown rapidly after the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which came into force in March 2000. In view of the expanding economic activities between India and Sri Lanka, particularly in promoting existing trade relations between the two countries, on several occasions the CBSL has communicated to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Monetary Authority of India, its willingness to authorize INR as a designated foreign currency in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, in August 2022, with the concurrence of RBI, INR was authorized by the CBSL as a designated foreign currency in Sri Lanka. However, the use of INR as a designated foreign currency in Sri Lanka is subject to any restrictions imposed by RBI, the CBSL added. Authorising INR as a designated foreign currency stands to bring many advantages to Sri Lanka including the facilitation of smooth banking transactions relating to INR especially for small-scale traders, encouraging traders to use banking channels for trade transactions over informal channels, reducing additional transaction costs associated with the dual conversion of INR into USD and thereafter into LKR and vice-versa. Moreover, since India remains a large source country for tourism in Sri Lanka, authorizing INR as a designated foreign currency for banking transactions would add more convenience to Indian tourists, according to the CBSL. The media release read that the CBSL from time to time, authorizes selected foreign currencies as designated foreign currencies with a view to facilitating international trade and cross-border banking transactions. Commencing May 1979, the CBSL has occasionally recognized designated foreign currencies. According to the CBSL, at present, 16 currencies  Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Danish Kroner, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, New Zealand Dollar, Norwegian Kroner, Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Kroner, Swiss Franc, Thai Bhat and US Dollar  have been authorized as designated foreign currencies under the provisions of the Banking Act and the Foreign Exchange Act, with the latest inclusion being the INR in August 2022.",

        "date": "August 2, 2023 10:09 pm",
        "content": "The second Coconut Triangle would be launched in the Northern Province this year consisting of the Jaffna, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in conjunction with World Coconut Day on September 02, Minister of Plantation Industries and Minister of Industries Dr. Ramesh Pathirana stated. He expressed these views today (02) during a press conference themed One Year of Progress held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Additionally, according to Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, 290 million kilograms of tea are planned to be exported this year, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The Minister emphasized that Sri Lankan tea price per kilogram in the international tea market is stable and that in order maintain it, the quality of Sri Lankan tea must be preserved, according to the PMD. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana further commented; Due to the fertilizer problem, exports from the plantation industry decreased last year. Fertilizer crisis and bad weather affected the plantation industry greatly. A bundle of 50 kilograms of urea went up to Rs. 30,000, last year. As of today, the government has worked to bring down the price of a 50kg bundle of urea to Rs. 9,000. By the end of this year, 300 million kilograms of tea are expected to be exportable under these circumstances. The sale of tea to the global tea market through the online system has already commenced. We will export tea worth 500 million USD to Iran in place of the fuel we received. It is anticipated to revive the Iranian tea industry through this strategy. Their capacity to obtain tea is declining as a result of the conflict situation in nations like Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, and Iraq, which are consumers of tea in Sri Lanka. Although the price of Sri Lankan tea is consistent on the global market, the enthusiasm of the tea-consuming nations is dwindling. Cabinet approval has now been received to provide a portion of 10 perches of land to the tea plantation workers. Accordingly, the relevant land ownership is to be given to them in the future. After that, they have been given the opportunity to get credit facilities to build the houses they need. In the last two years, it was possible to get an income of Rs. 1 billion from the export of rubber products. Due to the ability to purchase rubber for the manufacture of gloves during the last corona pandemic, it was possible to generate a sizable export income. But the demand for rubber goods is presently declining as a result of the global economic crisis. Therefore, it has been estimated that this years rubber-related export revenue will be around 900 million USD. Additionally, coconut export revenue has significantly increased in recent years. The range of goods that can be found in our coconuts has led to an increase in demand. This year, it is anticipated that exports of coconut-related goods will bring in 700 million USD. It is anticipated that exports of goods related to coconuts would generate 2 billion USD in revenue during the next ten years. Thus, it is envisioned that Sri Lanka will develop a second coconut triangle. The Northern Provinces Jaffna, Mannar, and Mullaitivu regions will be included in this second coconut triangle. Local consumption accounts for two thirds of coconut production. One third is used for export. To increase export potential, this situation needs to be altered. The GI certificate needed for cinnamon cultivation has finally been obtained. It is possible to generate a sizable amount of cash from exports because only Sri Lanka and Madagascar produce the greatest cinnamon in the world. As a result, a formal program is being carried out as a ministry to encourage the cinnamon cultivation. The revival of coffee as a crop in Sri Lanka has received attention as it grows to be the most popular crop in the world. Despite the fact that Sri Lanka began cultivating coffee before tea, farmers were forced to abandon the crop due to a fungus-related illness. However, it has been proposed to increase coffee cultivation in Sri Lanka due to the substantial potential for the crop on the global market. As a result, plans have been made to begin a 1000-acre coffee plantation.",

        "title": "Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and wife separate after 18 years of marriage",
        "date": "August 3, 2023 08:18 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie said on Wednesday they were separating in an unexpected announcement that appeared to mark the end of the couples 18-year high-profile marriage. The couple had talked frankly in the past about difficulties in their relationship and in recent years were seen less often together in public. Trudeau, 51, and Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, 48, were married in May 2005 and have three children, aged 15, 14 and nine. On their anniversary in 2020, he described her as my rock, my partner, and my best friend. For Trudeau, there are also painful historical parallels. His father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, separated from his wife, Margaret, in 1977, when he was in office. The development is one of the biggest personal crises for Trudeau since he became prime minister in 2015, especially since he often stresses the importance of family life. The couple made the announcement a week after Trudeau unveiled a massive cabinet shuffle in a bid to boost the fortunes of his Liberal Party, which is trailing in the polls. Aides said he was determined to lead the Liberals into the next election, which must be held by October 2025. Sophie and I would like to share the fact that after many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate, Trudeau said on Instagram. Gregoire Trudeau posted an almost identical message on her own Instagram account. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp said Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, one of Trudeaus closest allies, would brief members of the cabinet later on Wednesday. The CBC also said Trudeau was likely to speak publicly about the separation this week. Trudeaus office said the two had signed a legal agreement, stressing that the couple would focus on raising their children. The family will go on vacation together next week. Gregoire Trudeau will be moving into separate accommodation in Ottawa but plans to spend plenty of time with the children in Rideau Cottage, the prime ministers official residence, to ensure they have as normal an upbringing as possible, said a source familiar with the situation. The source, who requested anonymity because of the extreme sensitivity of the situation, said the couple would have joint custody of the children. MEDIA DARLINGS Gregoire Trudeau, an advocate for gender equality who studied commerce at university, was working as a reporter when she met Trudeau in 2003. They married two years later. Trudeau was only 43 when he became prime minister in late 2015 and the sharply-dressed couple quickly captured the attention of the world media. In October 2015, the New York Post dubbed her the hottest first lady in the world. Vogue magazine ran a glowing profile of the two in its January 2016 issue, complete with photos of them embracing. A long piece in the magazine about Trudeau said he shocks some with his public displays of affection toward his wife. In the early years after Trudeau took office, he and Sophie were often seen together at social functions and on foreign trips. In February 2018, during a visit to India, the two of them dressed in colorful costumes most days, prompting derisive comments back home. Trudeau, though, made clear even before he became prime minister that the two had faced challenges, writing in his autobiography Common Ground in 2014 that our marriage isnt perfect, and we have had difficult ups and downs. In recent years, Gregoire Trudeau has curtailed joint appearances with her husband and signs of stress were clear. On their wedding anniversary last year, she said in a social media post that we have navigated through sunny days, heavy storms, and everything in between and it aint over. She went on: long-term relationships are challenging in so many ways. The two of them did travel to London in May for the coronation of King Charles and were together when U.S. President Joe Biden visited in late March. As recently as Monday, Trudeau was still wearing his wedding ring. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Authorities have stepped up scrutiny of drugmakers after some cough syrups made in India were linked to deaths of dozens of children overseas. Riemann Labs did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. It is the fourth Indian cough syrup maker to stop production after regulators found lapses. Rajesh Bhatia, one of the three directors at Riemann Labs, had told Reuters previously he was not aware of the matter. Regulators inspected the companys production unit in Madhya Pradesh state and issued a notice after finding lapses, said Sudam Khade, the states drugs controller. Some violations in good manufacturing practices and good lab practices were found, Khade said, without specifying what the violations were. Samples of all of the companys products had been sent for testing and further action would be decided based on the results, Khade said. The government told parliament on Tuesday that Riemann was directed to stop manufacturing after inspections by federal and state regulators. Riemann has been identified as the maker of Naturcold cough syrup, Khade said. A batch of it was linked to the death of at least six children in Cameroon by authorities there. Some media, however, reported the deaths of 12 children. Reporting by Shivam Patel in New Delhi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman Source - Reuters - Agencies",

The petitioners who claim that 93 of the money deposited in the EPF and 86 of the money deposited in the ETF have been invested in government treasury bills and central bank bonds, also allege that the working community of around 20 million are being unfairly treated by the government waiving off the loans obtained from their EPFs and ETFs.

        "date": "August 3, 2023 07:01 pm",
        "content": "India on Thursday said it will impose a licensing requirement for imports of laptops, tablets and personal computers with immediate effect, a move that could hit hard the likes of Apple, Dell and Samsung and force them to boost local manufacturing. Current regulations in India allow companies to import laptops freely, but the new rule mandates a special licence for these products similar to restrictions India imposed in 2020 for inbound TV shipments. Industry executives said a licensing regime would mean prolonged wait times for each new model they launch, and would come just ahead of a festive season in India when sales typically surge. The government in its notification gave no reason for the move, but Prime Minister Narendra Modis government has been promoting local manufacturing and discouraging imports under his Make in India plan. Indias electronics imports, which include laptops, tablets and personal computers, stood at 19.7 billion in the April to June period, up 6.25 year-on-year. Research firm Counterpoint estimates Indias laptop and personal computer market to be worth 8 billion annually, with two third of those imported. The intent seems to be substitution of certain goods that are imported heavily, said Emkay Global economist Madhavi Arora. Apple, Dell and Samsung did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. They, along with Acer, LG Electronics, Lenovo and HP Inc, are some of the key sellers of laptops in the Indian market. A government source, who did not want to be named, told reporters shipments that have been ordered will be allowed without licences until Aug. 31. The move is expected to benefit contract manufacturers like Dixon Technologies, whose shares rose more than 7 on the news. The moves spirit is to push manufacturing to India. Its not a nudge, its a push, said Ali Akhtar Jafri, former director general at electronics industry body MAIT. India has extended a deadline for companies to apply for a 2 billion incentive scheme to attract investments in IT hardware manufacturing. The scheme is key to Indias ambitions to become a powerhouse in the global electronics supply chain, with the country targeting annual production worth 300 billion by 2026. The country has imposed high tariffs in the past on products like mobile phones to catalyze domestic output. SECURITY CONCERNS Besides boosting local manufacturing, the government move is aimed at curbing supplies from China, as it has security concerns from such products, a second government source said. The restriction will help India to import such hardware only from trusted partners, the first government source added. Half of Indias restricted items are shipped from China, with whom Delhis relationship has soured since border clashes in 2020, leading to several anti-China steps to curb investment and trade from Indias neighbour.

        "date": "August 4, 2023 12:02 am",
        "content": "(AP)  The U.S. military is considering putting armed personnel on commercial ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, in what would be an unheard of action aimed at stopping Iran from seizing and harassing civilian vessels, four American officials told The Associated Press on Thursday. Since 2019, Iran has seized a series of ships in the strait, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, as part of its efforts to pressure the West over negotiations regarding its collapsed nuclear deal with world powers. Putting U.S. troops on commercial ships could further deter Iran from seizing vessels  or escalate tensions further. The contemplated move also would represent an extraordinary commitment in the Mideast by U.S. forces as the Pentagon tries to focus on Russia and China. America didnt even take the step during the so-called Tanker War, which culminated with the U.S. Navy and Iran fighting a one-day naval battle in 1988 that was the Navys largest since World War II. While officials offered few details of the plan, it comes as thousands of Marines and sailors on both the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan and the USS Carter Hall, a landing ship, are on their way to the Persian Gulf. Those Marines and sailors could provide the backbone for any armed guard mission in the strait, through which 20 of all the worlds crude oil passes. Irans mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP about the U.S. proposal. Four U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the proposal, acknowledged its broad details. The officials stressed no final decision had been made and that discussions continue between U.S. military officials and Americas Gulf Arab allies in the region. Officials said the Marines and Navy sailors would provide the security only at the request of the ships involved. Earlier Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the Navys Mideast-based 5th Fleet, met with the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The six-nation bloc includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. While a statement from the GCC about the meeting did not hint at the proposal, it did say that Cooper and officials discussed strengthening GCC-U.S. cooperation and working with international and regional partners. The Bataan and Carter Hall left Norfolk, Virginia, on July 10 on a mission the Pentagon described as being in response to recent attempts by Iran to threaten the free flow of commerce in the Strait of Hormuz and its surrounding waters. The Bataan passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea last week on its way to the Mideast. Already, the U.S. has sent A-10 Thunderbolt II warplanes, F-16 and F-35 fighters, as well as the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner, to the region over Irans actions at sea. The deployment has captured Irans attention, with its chief diplomat telling neighboring nations that the region doesnt need foreigners providing security. On Wednesday, Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard launched a surprise military drill on disputed islands in the Persian Gulf, with swarms of small fast boats, paratroopers and missile units taking part. The renewed hostilities come as Iran now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal. International inspectors also believe it has enough enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs if it chose to build them. Iran maintains its program is for peaceful purposes, and U.S. intelligence agencies assess Tehran is not pursuing an atomic bomb. The U.S. also has pursued ships across the world believed to be carrying sanctioned Iranian oil. Oil industry worries over another seizure by Iran likely has left a ship allegedly carrying Iranian oil stranded off Texas as no company has yet to unload it. Source: AP --Agencies",

It appeared to be the militant groups first official announcement on his fate since Turkeys President Tayyip Erdogan said in April that Turkish intelligence forces had killed him in Syria. Erdogan said the Turkish national intelligence organization had pursued Quraishi for a long time. Quraishi was killed during a gun battle with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main Islamist group that holds sway in the last opposition bastion in northwest Syria, the spokesman said. The Sheikh (Quraishi), may God have mercy on him, was killed after they (HTS) tried to take him captive. He clashed with them with his arms until he died of his wounds, the spokesman said, accusing the rival Islamist group of acting as agents of Turkish intelligence. Islamic State, a shadow of the organisation that once ruled a third of Iraq and Syria, gave no details about the new leader. The movement reached its peak in 2014 when its then head, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the territory it controlled a caliphate. It was beaten back by adversaries in both countries including a U.S.-led coalition, and Baghdadi was killed during a U.S. military operation in Syria in 2019. Abu Hussein al-Husseini al-Quraishi took over in November 2022 after his predecessor was killed, also in Syria. Islamic State militants continue to wage insurgent attacks in both Syria and Iraq. Its remaining thousands of militants have in recent years mostly hid out in remote hinterlands of both countries, though they are still capable of carrying out hit-and-run attacks. The U.S.-led coalition alongside a Kurdish-led alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is still carrying out raids against Islamic State in Syria. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Speaking at an event held in Kandy, Amaraweera said that all relevant state institutions including the Department of Agriculture, Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority as well as the Meteorology Department should take responsibility for not forewarning the farmers regarding the possible drought condition and water shortage.",

        "title": "Govt will heed advice on debt optimization only from parliament - President",
        "date": "August 4, 2023 03:02 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the governments financial accountability to Parliament, making it clear that they will only adhere to the instructions and orders of the Parliament in the debt optimization program. He asserted that he is committed to preventing the country from descending into anarchy by avoiding out-dated political practices, and he remains devoted to developing Sri Lanka, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. These statements were made during the 29th annual meeting of the Coconut Growers Association, held today (04) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. At the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed gratitude for the invitation to attend and acknowledged the historical significance of coconut cultivation for Sri Lankan businesses. He highlighted that until 1970, the Sinhalese people held a significant amount of coconut land, but this changed with the land reform of 1972-73, leading to a decline in the capital of Sinhala businessmen. He further mentioned that during the presidency of J.R. Jayawardena, efforts were made to develop the coconut industry with assistance from the Asian Development Bank. However, he acknowledged that the coconut industrys progress over the last 50 years has not been satisfactory, contrasting it with other countries such as Brazil and Vietnam that have rapidly advanced in coconut cultivation, the PMD said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the current situation of coconut farmers in Sri Lanka, with 82 of them owning less than 20 acres of land, while only 18 are engaged in large-scale cultivation. Comparatively, India, which started coconut cultivation with approximately 20 million acres of land in 1950, now has around 45 million acres dedicated to coconuts. He pointed out the significant difference in coconut yield between Sri Lanka and neighbouring regions like Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal. While Sri Lankas coconut production stands at 7000 nuts per acre, these regions are achieving much higher yields, such as 11,400 coconuts per acre in Tamil Nadu and 10,000 coconuts per acre in Telangana, it added. President Ranil Wickremesinghes address at the event indicated his concern for the coconut industrys development in Sri Lanka and his commitment to fostering progress in the sector to match the advancements seen in other countries. In the Andhra region, coconut cultivation yields approximately 15,000 coconuts per acre, which is twice the output we achieve here. A proposal has been put forth to merge three coconut-related institutions, and it seems appropriate to combine the Coconut Research Institute with the Agricultural University, thereby streamlining the process. The government has already initiated an agriculture modernization program with the aim of creating a highly competitive economy through agriculture. To achieve this, we must also focus on advancing the coconut industry. Increasing coconut production and marketing it effectively are crucial. Relying solely on price control will not lead to successful business development. Instead, the key lies in boosting production and enhancing the value of coconuts. Investments should be encouraged in the coconut industry. Currently, 55 of total coconut production comes from the Coconut Triangle, and the plan to establish a second coconut triangle in dry areas is a promising step forward. Despite the countrys financial challenges, the current government possesses the capability to address these issues and move forward. Loan optimization activities are underway, and discussions have taken place with leaders from various countries. The goal is not to default on outstanding loans but to gain more time to repay them while finding ways to pay off debts incurred for necessary imports. This necessitates a shift towards a highly competitive export economy. The loan optimization work is in progress, with proposals presented in the cabinet and discussions held with the International Monetary Fund and major creditor countries. After parliamentary discussions and amendments, the proposal has been submitted for acceptance. The State Finance Committee of the Parliament has actively participated in this process, working diligently regardless of party differences. The President expresses gratitude to the State Finance Committee for their support and hopes that the opposition would also back the initiative. Regrettably, internal issues between opposition parties have hindered their support, but the President remains thankful for the backing received from everyone. The aim is to complete the loan optimization work by September or October this year, according to the PMD. Despite not receiving support from the opposition initially, many members from opposition parties later backed the continuation of this program without objection. However, some groups sought to disrupt the program, resorting to street protests, which were ultimately unsuccessful in garnering public support. Now, they are attempting to utilize the court for their political agenda, seeking prohibitory orders. Halting this program could have negative consequences, as foreign countries might be less inclined to engage in business with us. The country is already facing issues such as fuel pollution and farmers losing access to necessary fertilizers, it said. The control of public finances lies with the Parliament, and this program has already been approved by it. The Parliament, being the custodian of the sovereign power of the people under Article 04 of the Constitution, exercises all the necessary powers. The government operates within the framework set by the laws of the Parliament, and decisions can only be changed or continued with the Parliaments notification. The President emphasizes the need for unity in moving the country forward and warns against the destructive influences of old politics. He is committed to the responsibility of developing the country and works in tandem with the Parliament, particularly in the loan optimization program, where their accountability lies. Minister Ramesh Pathirana highlighted the significant increase in coconut export income in recent times, driven by the growing demand for various coconut products like milk, substrate, and activated carbon. This year, exports related to coconut products are expected to generate 700 million dollars, and the goal is to achieve a 2 billion dollar export income within the next decade. To support this, a second coconut triangle is planned to be established, covering areas in the Northern Province like Jaffna-Point Pedro, Mannar, and Mullaitivu, the PMD said. Currently, two-thirds of coconut production is utilized locally, leaving only one-third for exports. The plan is to increase opportunities for exports by altering this situation. The event was attended by the President of the Coconut Growers Association, Jayantha Samarakoon, Secretary Shakila Wijewardanayana, and many others, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "August 4, 2023 04:12 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas inflation rate, which dropped to single digits for the first time in months in July, may still face headwinds from rising water, food and energy prices, analysts say, in a challenge for a crisis-hit country seeking to foster growth. Inflation has dropped sharply in recent months from the 69 hit last September, partly due to the statistical base effect, but also due to a stronger currency and better harvests. A severe foreign exchange crunch triggered Sri Lankas worst financial crisis in seven decades last year, triggering the inflation surge. But figures released Monday showed its key inflation rate nearly halved to 6.3 from 12 in June. Economic stability has improved since March after a 2.9 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, the country needs to focus on reducing losses at state enterprises and to pass on energy prices as per IMF conditions which may boost inflation, analysts warned. The high base effect issue will finish off in the next two months and beyond that we might actually see a slight upward push in inflation with the currency depreciation and possibly a bit of food inflation coming into play, said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital. There could be some volatility in the last quarter and inflation could end the year at the 6-8 range. Sri Lankas currency has appreciated about 10 this year but analysts are concerned it could come under pressure from stronger import demand in the last quarter. A government decision to raise water tariffs by as much as 50, higher global commodity prices and severe dry weather in some rice growing regions will also pressure prices, several analysts said. Higher global cooking gas costs could also have an impact, Muditha Peiris, head of the state-run LPG company said on Friday, but ruled out immediate price hikes. The countrys central bank remains confident in the downward trend. It expects the rate to fall within the 4-6 target band and even dip below it in the next two months. But in the medium term we expect inflation will stabilise within the target range of 4-6, P.K.G. Harischandra, head of research at the central bank told reporters on Thursday. Following the rapid decline in inflation, Sri Lankas central bank cut policy rates by 450 basis points in June and July this year, after raising them a record 1050 basis points from April 2022 to March. The central bank is expected to continue easing interest rates in the second half, Harischandra said. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "August 4, 2023 04:27 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court of India has suspended opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhis conviction in a defamation case, an order that will allow him to return to parliament and contest national elections due next year. Gandhi was convicted in March in a case brought by Purnesh Modi, a legislator from the western state of Gujarat belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over comments he made in 2019 when he asked why all thieves have Modi as their common surname. Gandhi had then referred to three well-known and unrelated Modis in the speech: a fugitive Indian diamond tycoon, a cricket executive banned from the Indian Premier League (IPL), and the prime minister. But the remarks were deemed insulting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other people surnamed Modi, including the BJP legislator. The surname is associated with the lower rungs of Indias caste hierarchy. Gandhi, 53, scion of a dynasty that has given India three prime ministers, was sentenced to two years imprisonment but the jail term was put on hold and he was granted bail. He also lost his parliamentary seat following the conviction, since politicians sentenced to jail terms of two years or more are automatically disqualified. Lower courts and the high court in Gujarat  Modis home state where the BJP holds power  had rejected appeals by Gandhi to suspend the conviction, causing him to appeal to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court judge Justice B R Gavai said the lower court which sentenced Gandhi to two years in jail had not given any reasons for handing down the maximum sentence of two years which led to his disqualification from parliament. While Gandhis comments were not in good taste and he ought to have been more careful while making public speeches, the conviction not only punished Gandhi but also voters who had elected him to represent their constituency, said Gavai, who headed a bench of three judges which suspended the conviction. Gandhis 731-page submission to the Supreme Court said his speech was made in the course of democratic political activity. His sentence was gravely detrimental to democratic free speech, added the document. There was no immediate reaction to the order from Gandhi but Congress members broke out into celebration, shouted slogans and distributed sweets at the party headquarters in New Delhi. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of Congress in the lower house of parliament, said he would write to the speaker on Friday itself seeking Gandhis reinstatement. Rahul Gandhi has got relief from the false allegations that were made against him, Chowdhury told reporters. This is the victory of truthit will cost Modi heavily. There was no immediate reaction to the court ruling from Modis BJP. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

Speaking at the meet which took place under the US chairmanship of the body, Indian ambassador to UN Ruchira Kamboj highlighted, even in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, India provided food aid in the form of thousands of metric tonnes of wheat, rice, pulses, and lentils to several countries, including in our neighbourhood and Africa, to strengthen food security. Highlighting the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Ambassador Kamboj pointed to Indias decision to donate 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat to the Afghan people. Similarly, New Delhi continued its humanitarian support to Myanmar, offering a grant of 10,000 tonnes of rice and wheat. Additionally, Sri Lanka received essential food assistance from India during its difficult times. According to UN estimates, 362 million people in 62 countries require humanitarian aid which is a record high. The Covid pandemic, followed by Russia-Ukraine conflict, has put increased the prices of food, fuel and fertiliser prices which has especially pinched the global south.

The state minister pointed out that the program for harvesting abandoned paddy lands is being implemented through the Department of Agrarian Development, and the government has allocated Rs. 420 million for this purpose. He expressed these views today (Aug 03) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). State Minister Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva, further commented: The export of rice has been temporarily halted by Pakistan and India in order to deal with a potential future global food crisis. Some nations are also experiencing a rice crisis as a result of India stopping the export of rice. Therefore, as a country, we must likewise get ready to deal with this calamity. The government cannot improve the countrys agriculture industry alone. Support from everyone is necessary for that. As a result, the government has chosen to replant the nations abandoned paddy lands. Under the initial phase, the Department of Agrarian Development is working to cultivate 11,000 acres. The government has allocated 420 million rupees for this purpose. The agricultural sector is responsible for 7.5 of this nations GDP. As an agricultural country; there is an opportunity to raise this contribution to the countrys GDP to a higher value. Developing the agricultural sector is another way to boost the national economy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has given many concessions for the farmers of this country. There are subsidies for fertilizers. The government offers farmers insurance free of charge. As a result, there is some increase in rice production in this country compared to the past. Additionally, necessary steps have been taken to streamline the farmers paddy purchasing mechanism. The annual rice requirement of this country is about 2.4 million metric tons. This year, it is predicted that 2.7 million metric tons of rice will be harvested. As a result, it is feasible to maintain a surplus of 300,000 metric tons of rice. Furthermore, I do not believe that the nation will experience a food crisis in future. Additionally, the President has issued directives prohibiting the release of rice reserves for beer manufacturing. The government has focused on enhancing the cultivation of new crops in addition to expanding rice production. The budget declaration from President Ranil Wickremesinghe states that the program to bring contemporary technologies to the agricultural sector has already commenced. The establishment of agricultural villages for young entrepreneurs is another ongoing initiative with the goal of orienting the youth community in the agricultural sector. Additionally, measures have been taken to allow youth access to government-owned land that is not being used for agriculture. Also, the work of drafting the National Agriculture Policy with amendments is in the final stage. It will eventually be presented to the Cabinet. Through the National Agriculture Policy, it is possible to do a great deal for the advancement of the agricultural sector in this country.",
