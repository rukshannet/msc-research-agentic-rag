        "content": "The health sector trade unions have decided to temporarily call off the ongoing island-wide strike action by 06.30 a.m. on Saturday (Feb. 03). A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector resorted to a one-day strike across the country last morning (Feb.01), which continued for the second day straight today, urging the government to address the issues concerning allowances without delay. The doctors unions and the All Ceylon Nurses Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government. In response to the island-wide strike, tri-force personnel were deployed to the state hospitals across the country, depending on the requirements at each facility to ensure uninterrupted provision of essential medical services to the public.",

        "title": "Ahead of election, Pakistan seals plan to sell national airline",
        "date": "February 2, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "Ahead of elections next week, Pakistans caretaker administration is making binding plans for a new government to sell loss-making Pakistan International Airlines, according to the minister in charge of the process and other officials. In the past, elected governments have shied away from undertaking unpopular reforms, including the sale of the flag carrier. But Pakistan, in deep economic crisis, agreed in June to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 3 billion bailout. The government decided to privatise PIA just weeks after signing the IMF agreement. The caretaker administration, which took office in August to oversee the Feb. 8 election, was empowered by the outgoing parliament to take any steps needed to meet the budgetary targets agreed with the IMF. Our job is 98 done, Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad told Reuters when asked about the plan to sell the airline. The remaining 2 is just to bring it on an excel sheet after the cabinet approves it. Fawad said the plan, drawn up by transaction adviser Ernst  Young, will be presented to the cabinet for approval before the tenure of the administration ends following the election. The cabinet will also decide whether to sell the stake by tender or through a government-to-government deal, Fawad said. What we have done in just four months is what past governments have been trying to do for over a decade, Fawad said. There is no looking back. Details of the privatisation process have not been previously reported. PIA had liabilities of 785 billion Pakistani rupees (2.81 billion) and accumulated losses of 713 billion rupees as of June last year. Its CEO has said losses in 2023 were likely to be 112 billion rupees. Progress on the privatisation will be a key issue if the incoming government goes back to the IMF once the current bailout programme expires in March. Caretaker Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar told reporters last year that Pakistan would have to remain in IMF programmes after the expiry. Two sources close to the process told Reuters that a 51 stake with full management control would be offered to buyers after parking the airlines debts in a separate entity, under the 1,100 page report from Ernst  Young. Reuters could not independently confirm the contents of the report. Fawad did not give specific details of the size of the stake to be sold, but confirmed the plan involved the carriers debts being spun off into a separate entity. Ernst  Young did not respond to requests for comment. PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan said the airline was assisting the privatisation process, extending full cooperation to the transaction adviser. FAST-TRACKED Besides operational and technical measures for PIAs divestment, the caretaker government has also amended a 2016 law that had blocked selling off its majority shares, according to a draft posted on the Pakistan parliaments website. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is tipped by analysts to win the election with support from the powerful military. Its main political rival has been decimated by the arrest of its leader Imran Khan and a crackdown on its members. Sharifs close aide Ishaq Dar, who has been his finance minister previously and has been named by the party to retain the portfolio if it forms the next government, told Reuters that the sale of PIA will be fast-tracked. It will, God willing, move ahead with fast speed, he said. In a report in mid-January, the IMF expressed satisfaction over the measures initiated by the caretaker government to accelerate reforms of state-owned enterprises, specifically mentioning the amendment of the PIA privatisation law. Under the privatisation plan submitted by Ernst  Young to the government on Dec. 27, government-guaranteed legacy debt and payables - which are held by a consortium of seven domestic banks - will be parked in a holding company, Fawad and two sources involved in the process said. Fawad said the government and the consortium had an agreement in place regarding the settlement of the legacy debt, which includes negative equity of 825 billions rupees in loans, creditors money and the losses. He provided no further details. The sources had earlier said the banks wanted a five-year bond issued against the debt with a 16.5 coupon on the paper, while the finance ministry was offering only 10. The banks have not commented on the deal. Besides its losses and debt, PIAs governance and safety standards have been questioned by global aviation authorities for some years. In early 2020, Czech and Hungarian air force jets were scrambled to intercept a PIA flight with 300 people on board as it went astray due to an avoidable human error by its pilot, according to a previously unreported confidential report by a PIA inquiry board, which was reviewed by Reuters. In May that year, the crash of a PIA plane in Karachi killed nearly 100 people and a fake pilot licence scandal erupted later in 2020. The scandal led to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banning the airline from flying to its most lucrative routes in Europe and the UK. The 2020 ban is still in place and has cost the airline nearly 40 billion rupees in revenue annually, according to government records presented in parliament. The airline has been pleading with EASA to lift the ban even provisionally, but to no avail, according to correspondence between it and PIA reviewed by Reuters. Pakistans financial crisis has also led to seizure of PIA aircraft by creditors in recent months, according to the airline. One aircraft was taken at Kuala Lumpur airport for non-payment of lease fees, and another in Toronto for non-payment of ground handling, PIA said. While the airline awaits the governments decision on a sale, it continues to need financial support: 23.7 billion rupees are required to keep it afloat for another five to six months before control is given to a new buyer, three government and PIA sources said. CHALLENGING SALE Not everyone agrees with pressing ahead speedily with the sale. Three senior airline officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said a fast sale could devalue the airlines worth, and that it would not be a transparent transaction without due diligence. We are not against its privatisation, and all we want is that you dont just throw it away, said one of the officials. But Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said PIA is in dire straits: the plan submitted to the government was essentially the only option to save the airline. The privatisation will be challenging and a sale is likely not possible unless it first undergoes a deep restructuring and the debts are cleared, he said. PIAs assets include key slots at the worlds busiest airports and air routes to top European destinations, the Middle East and North America. PIA has air service agreements with more than 150 countries and generates about 280 billion rupees annually in revenues despite the EU ban, airline records show. It has 10 slots at Heathrow, which, according to two PIA officials, are currently worth 70 billion rupees annually. It has a further nine slots at Manchester and four at Birmingham. Turkish and Kuwaiti airlines have been operating 70 of the slots under a business arrangement with PIA that also allows the airline to retain them, the PIA officials said. Separately, PIAs physical assets, which include aircraft, hotels in Paris and New York and other properties, are worth 105.6 billion rupees (375 million) as per book value, according to the airlines annual report for 2023. PIA officials, however, said the market value of the assets could be above 1 billion. In any case, the hotels and other properties would not be up for sale, they said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 2, 2024 07:43 pm",
        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was arrested on Friday evening (Feb.02) in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The arrest comes hot on the heels of mounting pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists who have been calling for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. The current Environment Minister arrived at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) premises on Friday morning, complying with a court order issued yesterday. He was grilled for nearly 10 hours. The former health minister was supposed to make an appearance before the CID on Wednesday (Jan.31), but he failed to do so on account of attending the proceedings of a case heard before the Colombo High Court, as well as a ministerial sub-committee meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat. Thus, Rambukwella had requested the CID to fix another date for him to provide his statement. On Thursday (Feb.01), the Maligakanda Magistrate ordered the former health minister to appear before the CID to record a statement on his alleged involvement in the substandard medicine procurement scandal. Additionally, the lawmaker was slapped with a foreign travel ban. Meanwhile, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Saman Ratnakaye was grilled by the CID officers for nearly 10 hours on Wednesday. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Reportedly, funds to the tune of Rs. 144 million have been misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG. Seven suspects including former Secretary to the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta were later arrested in connection with the scam, however, the fifth accused in the case is now out on bail on the orders of the Maligakanda Magistrates Court. The former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, remain in custody on remand. After the scam came to light, Rambukwella was given the portfolio of Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October last year. Accordingly, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries.",

        "date": "February 2, 2024 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Two British teenagers were ordered to be detained for life on Friday for the sadistic knife murder of a 16-year-old transgender girl that shocked the country. Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, killed Brianna Ghey in Warrington, northwest England, in February last year, in what the judge called a planned frenzied and ferocious assault. Ghey was stabbed 28 times in the head, neck, back and chest after believing she was going to meet a friend. Her body was discovered by dog walkers in a park. Jenkinson and Ratcliffe were just 15 at the time. You both took part in a brutal and planned murder which was sadistic in nature, judge Amanda Yip told the pair as she handed down the sentence at Manchester Crown Court. Yip said that Jenkinsons primary motivation had been a desire to kill, but the pair had also been motivated in part by Gheys transgender identity. The judge ruled that Jenkinson must serve a minimum of 22 years before being considered for release, while Ratcliffe must serve at least 20 years. If you remain a danger you will serve very much longer than the minimum term and may never be released, she warned. Yip had earlier taken the rare step of lifting a ban on identifying the juveniles after media outlets challenged the restriction. Under-18s are typically granted anonymity in UK courts, but Yip ruled that their names could be reported at Fridays sentencing hearing owing to the gravity of the case. A jury of seven men and five women convicted Jenkinson and Ratcliffe in December after nearly five hours of deliberations, following a four-week trial. The court heard how Jenkinson and Ratcliffe had discussed killing Ghey in the days and weeks before the attack. Jenkinson, referred during the trial as girl X, had downloaded an internet browser app that allowed her to watch videos of the torture and murder of real people, in red rooms on the dark web. Life torn apart She had developed an interest in serial killers, making notes on their methods, and admitted enjoying dark fantasies about killing and torture, the court was told. The pair drew up a kill list of four other youths they intended to harm, until Ghey had the misfortune to be befriended by Jenkinson, who became obsessed with her, according to prosecutors. During the trial, Jenkinson and Ratcliffe had blamed each other for instigating the stabbing. Ghey had thousands of followers on the social media platform TikTok but in person was a withdrawn, shy and anxious teenager who struggled with depression and rarely left her home, the jury heard. Deputy chief crown prosecutor Ursula Doyle said after the verdict that the case had been one of the most distressing that she had ever dealt with. The planning, the violence and the age of the killers is beyond belief, she noted. Before Yip announced her sentence, Gheys parents made emotional witness statements. Her father Peter Spooner said his world had been torn apart by his daughters murder and no amount of time spent in prison will be enough for these monsters. I cannot call them children as that makes them sound naive or vulnerable which they are not, they are pure evil. Brianna was the vulnerable one, he said. The victims mother, Esther Ghey, recalled that she had been pleased when Brianna sent a text message on the day she died to say she was going to meet a friend. I thought that she would have a wonderful time, hanging around with her friend and getting some fresh air. When all that time she was being lured to her death, she said in a statement read by prosecutors. The prosecution had claimed that the killers had been motivated in part by Ghey being transgender, but defence lawyers denied this. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "February 3, 2024 10:04 am",
        "content": "The U.S. military launched an air assault on dozens of sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Friday, in the opening salvo of retaliation for the drone strike that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan last weekend. The massive barrage of strikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities that were connected to the militias or the IRGCs Quds Force, the Guards expeditionary unit that handles Tehrans relationship with and arming of regional militias. And President Joe Biden made it clear in a statement that there will be more to come. The U.S. strikes appeared to stop short of directly targeting Iran or senior leaders of the Revolutionary Guard Quds Force within its borders, as the U.S. tries to prevent the conflict from escalating even further. Iran has denied it was behind the Jordan attack. It was unclear what the impact will be of the strikes. Days of U.S. warnings may have sent militia members scattering into hiding. With multiple groups operating at various locations in several countries, a knockout blow is unlikely. Though one of the main Iran-backed militias, Kataib Hezbollah, said it was suspending attacks on American troops, others have vowed to continue fighting, casting themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause while the war in Gaza shows no sign of ending. Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing, Biden warned, adding, let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond. He and other top U.S. leaders had been saying for days that any American response wouldnt be just one hit but a tiered response over time. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the targets were carefully selected to avoid civilian casualties and based on clear, irrefutable evidence that they were connected to attacks on U.S. personnel in the region. He declined to detail what that evidence was. The strikes took place over about 30 minutes, and three of the sites struck were in Iraq and four were in Syria, said Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, director of the Joint Staff. U.S. Central Command said the assault involved more than 125 precision munitions, and they were delivered by numerous aircraft, including long-range B-1 bombers flown from the United States. Sims said weather was a factor as the U.S. planned the strikes in order to allow the U.S. to confirm it was hitting the right targets and avoiding civilian casualties. Its not clear, however, whether militia members were killed. We know that there are militants that use these locations, IRGC as well as Iranian-aligned militia group personnel, Sims said. We made these strikes tonight with an idea that there there would likely be casualties associated with people inside those facilities. Syrian state media reported that there were casualties but did not give a number. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 18 militants were killed in the Syria strikes. Iraqi army spokesman Yahya Rasool said in a statement that the city of al-Qaim and areas along the countrys border with Syria had been hit by U.S. airstrikes. The strikes, he said, constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government, posing a threat that will pull Iraq and the region to undesirable consequences. Kirby said that the U.S. alerted the Iraqi government prior to carrying out the strikes. The assault came came just hours after Biden and top defense leaders joined grieving families to watch as the remains of the three Army Reserve soldiers were returned to the U.S. at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Just Friday morning, Irans hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi reiterated earlier promises by Tehran to potentially retaliate for any U.S. strikes targeting its interests. We will not start a war, but if a country, if a cruel force wants to bully us, the Islamic Republic of Iran will give a strong response, Raisi said. In a statement this week, Kataib Hezbollah announced the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government. But that assertion clearly had no impact on U.S. strike plans. Harakat al-Nujaba, one of the other major Iran-backed groups, vowed Friday to continue military operations against U.S. troops. The U.S. has blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a broad coalition of Iran-backed militias, for the attack in Jordan, but hasnt narrowed it down to a specific group. Kataib Hezbollah is, however, a top suspect. Some of the militias have been a threat to U.S. bases for years, but the groups intensified their assaults in the wake of Israels war with Hamas following the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The war has led to the deaths of more than 27,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and has inflamed the Middle East. Iran-backed militia groups throughout the region have used the conflict to justify striking Israeli or U.S. interests, including threatening civilian commercial ships and U.S. warships in the Red Sea region with drones or missiles in almost daily exchanges. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said this is a dangerous moment in the Middle East. He said the U.S. will take all necessary actions to defend its interests and people, and warned, At this point, its time to take away even more capability than weve taken in the past. As of Tuesday, Iran-backed militia groups had launched 166 attacks on U.S. military installations since Oct. 18, including 67 in Iraq, 98 in Syria and now one in Jordan, according to a U.S. military official. The last attack was Jan. 29 at al-Asad airbase in Iraq, and there were no injuries or damage. The U.S., meanwhile, has bolstered defenses at Tower 22, the base in Jordan that was attacked by Iran-backed militants on Sunday, according to a U.S. official. While previous U.S. responses in Iraq and Syria have been more limited, the deaths of the three service members in Jordan crossed a line, the official said. That attack, which also injured more than 40 service members  largely Army National Guard  was the first to result in U.S. combat deaths from the Iran-backed militias since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out. Tower 22 houses about 350 U.S. troops and sits near the demilitarized zone on the border between Jordan and Syria. The Iraqi border is only 6 miles (10 kilometers) away. Also Friday, the Israeli military said its Arrow defense system intercepted a missile that approached the country from the Red Sea, raising suspicion it was launched by Yemens Houthi rebels. The rebels did not immediately claim responsibility. And a U.S. official said the military had taken additional self-defense strikes inside Yemen Friday against Houthi military targets deemed an imminent threat. Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said British and American forces conducted three strikes in the northern Yemeni province of Hajjah, a Houthi stronghold.

        "date": "February 3, 2024 03:02 pm",
        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella has been remanded until 15 February on the orders of Maligakanda Magistrates Court. The current Environment Minister was produced before Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama this morning (Feb.03). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested the lawmaker on Friday (Feb.02) in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. During todays court proceedings, Rambukwella was also listed as the 8th suspect in the ongoing case on substandard human immunoglobulin procurement. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand. Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, speaking on behalf of the prosecution today, accused the former health minister of amending the procurement process that governs the import of medicine. She alleged that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process. Presenting to the Magistrate a Cabinet paper previously tabled by Rambukwella, the Deputy Solicitor General pointed out that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former health minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases for a list of certain medicinal drugs. She also emphasized the fact that no document was uncovered during the investigations to corroborate the need to prepare the Cabinet paper in question. The lack of such corroborating evidence reportedly prompted concerns within the courthouse. Responding to a query put forward by the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General mentioned that while recording a statement with the CID yesterday Rambukwella had revealed that the list of medicines was given to him by the Medical Supplies Division (MSD). He had further claimed that the Cabinet memorandum was not prepared by him. It was further revealed that a staggering amount to the tune of over Rs. 144 million had been paid for the procurement and that the money credited to the account of the first suspect had been withdrawn within just 3 days. As such, the prosecution argued that Rambukwellas bail application should be rejected since he has been charged under the Public Property Act. Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratna, representing the accused, said all Cabinet ministers should thus be brought forward for questioning. He also cast doubts as to how the entire Cabinet of Ministers were misled by a single document. Commenting on the lost document, the defence counsel, noting that the authorities should go after the person who lost the documents without making allegations against the minister, urged the Magistrate to grant bail to Rambukwella, while highlighting his clients medical conditions. After taking into account all the submissions made, the Maligakanda Magistrate said Rambukwella, as the then-health minister, must be responsible for all actions carried out by the ministry beyond just signing a document. In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. After the human immunoglobulin scandal came to light, Rambukwella was stripped of health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries.",

        "date": "February 3, 2024 03:32 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation (SLADC) has made Rs. Rs. 195 million in profits in 2023, marking the highest-ever figure the institution has recorded since 2017, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said on Friday (Feb.02). This achievement marks a significant turnaround for the SLADC, highlighting the positive impact of the new managements strategies, the lawmaker commented further addressing a press briefing held at the Presidents Media Centre (PMC). The state minister, emphasizing the remarkable progress made by the SLADC under its new leadership. He attributed this success to the implementation of effective measures by the new management, which have revitalized the corporations operations and financial standing. Further addressing the press briefing, Jayakody said government-owned vacant lands are being repurposed for cultivating medicinal plants, adding that this program holds multiple benefits  (1) addresses the concerns of government employees seeking higher income by offering them the opportunity to cultivate these plants, potentially earning more than their salaries; (2) fosters commercial cultivation of medicinal plants, contributing to a stronger domestic supply chain and potentially boosting profits. Jayakody noted that this initiative is further bolstered by the success story of the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation. Once incurring losses, it achieved a remarkable turnaround under new management, securing a profit of Rs. 195 million in 2023. The state minister also spoke of the launch of a program to cultivate 01 million indigenous herbs across the island in celebration of the 76th National Independence Day. This national initiative will be jointly launched by the State Ministry of Indigenous Medicine, Department of Ayurveda and Ministry of Public Administration, with the aim of boosting domestic production of medicinal herbs and to reduce reliance on imports. The programs first phase began on 02 February and will continue until the 07 April. It focuses on all Grama Niladhari (GN) Divisions across the country, ensuring widespread participation and impact, the state minister said further. This initiative recognizes the abundance of medicinal plants in Sri Lanka and aims to address the long-standing issue of importing indigenous medicines. By promoting domestic cultivation, the program seeks to establish indigenous medicine as a viable commercial industry. It also aims to reduce the cost of imported raw materials used in medicine production, ultimately saving valuable resources and strengthening Sri Lankas self-reliance in the healthcare sector. Further, the state minister commented on the need to enhance the traditional indigenous medicine system in order to boost the revenue of our tourism industry. By incorporating the indigenous medical system, we can maximize the profitability of the existing tourist hotels in our country. It is observed that tourists visiting our country tend to spend less money and often only visit a particular destination once or twice without returning.",

        "content": "In Sri Lankas pursuit of transforming into a high-income country by 2048 involving trade negotiations with countries like Thailand, the Sri Lanka Thailand Free Trade Agreement (SLTFTA), was signed, during the visit of Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and his delegation of business dignitaries today (03) at the Presidential Secretariat. This move aims to enhance market opportunities, with negotiations covering various aspects such as Trade in Goods, Investment, Customs Procedure, and Intellectual Property Rights. Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Food Security, Mr. Nalin Fernando, represented Sri Lanka by signing the agreement, while Phumtham Wechayachai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce, represented Thailand by signing the accord. Thailand, the 37th exporting destination of Sri Lanka, holds significant economic importance, with a GDP of USD 495 billion in 2022 and is one of the largest outward investors in ASEAN. Thailand has brought over USD 92 Million worth of FDI to Sri Lanka during the period from 2005 to 2022. In 2018, it was anticipated tripling the existing bilateral trade value (USD 550 Mn) to USD 1.5 Billion within four years. One of the main objectives of entering into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Thailand is to enhance market opportunities for Sri Lanka with possible expansion. The SLTFTA, having undergone extensive negotiations, has received legal clearance and is set to further strengthen economic ties between the two nations. In a related development, the Governments of Sri Lanka and Thailand signed a new Bilateral Air Services Agreement, providing for liberalized services between the two countries. The agreement, which supersedes the 1950 agreement, reflects the commitment to enhance aviation relations and regulatory frameworks. On behalf of Sri Lanka, the Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation, Mr. Nimal Siripala de Silva, signed the agreement, while representing Thailand, Mr. Jakkapong Sangmanee, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed the document. Meanwhile, the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI) of Sri Lanka and the Gem and Jewellery Institute of Thailand (GIT) solidified their commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which also took place at the Presidential Secretariat. Representing Sri Lanka, Mr. B.G.R.W. Gamlath, Director General (Actg) of the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI), and representing Thailand, Mr. Sumed Prasongpongchai, Director of the Gem and Jewellery Institute, signed the Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of the two countries. The Gem and Jewellery industry, deeply rooted in Sri Lankas history, has flourished due to its production of high-quality gems, positioning the country uniquely in the global market. Thailand, currently holding a distinctive position in the international Gem and Jewellery industry, recognizes the importance of collaboration. With the shared goal of developing and promoting the industry in both nations, the MOU focuses on information exchange, scientific and technical research, and training activities. The agreement stems from the 2018 strategic economic cooperation MOU between the governments of Sri Lanka and Thailand. GJRTI and GIT will collaborate on gem deposit and exploration research, value addition to gemstones, and jewellery manufacturing. The exchange of gem-related rock samples and minerals between the two institutes will be facilitated under the laws and regulations of both countries. GIT will offer training courses in gemmology, jewellery designing and manufacturing, contributing to the skill development in Sri Lanka. The collaboration aims to increase economic returns from the Gem and Jewellery industry by sharing information on gem materials and deposits. --PMD-- A new Bilateral Air Services Agreement was signed on Feb. 03, 2024, to provide for liberalized services between Sri Lanka and Thailand. An MoU was signed between Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI) of Sri Lanka and Gem and Jewellery Institute of Thailand (GIT) on Feb. 03, 2024.",

The President sought Thailands support for Sri Lankas bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), underlining the formal request made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the untapped potential for trade and investment between the two countries. Opportunities for Thai investments in luxury hotels in the Colombo Port City and participation in the privatization of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) were discussed. Both leaders emphasized the importance of strengthening maritime cooperation, with a special focus on Thailands proposed land bridge project across the Isthmus of Kra. The President expressed gratitude for technical assistance from Thailand, particularly through the Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA). Areas of potential cooperation include packaging, ICT, agriculture, tourism, and support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). He also acknowledged Thailands past gifts of tuskers and pledged the safety and welfare of remaining elephants in Sri Lanka. Technical assistance from TICA on elephant welfare was also discussed. Cooperation in the fisheries sector, including investment opportunities in supply chains, and collaboration in agriculture were also proposed during the meeting. The leaders emphasized the need for close defence and security cooperation, sharing information and intelligence to curb transnational crimes. President Wickremesinghe also proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Defence Cooperation. Both leaders discussed enhancing Buddhist religious tourism, promoting maritime tourism, and improving air connectivity. Plans for a visa-free travel arrangement for normal passport holders were also on the agenda. Collaboration in regional fora such as BIMSTEC, IORA, ACD, and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was acknowledged. Sri Lanka looks forward to strengthening IORA under its chairmanship. President Wickremesinghe sought assistance from Thailand in repatriating Sri Lankan victims of human trafficking in Myanmar. In closing, President Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas commitment to consolidating bilateral relations with the Kingdom of Thailand. The comprehensive discussions pave the way for deeper economic, cultural, and strategic cooperation between Sri Lanka and Thailand, marking a new chapter in their historic relationship. Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakkapong Sangmanee and Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka Paitoon Mahapannaporn graced the occasion, representing Thailand. On Sri Lankas side, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and a delegation of ministers, along with Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake and Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aruni Wijewardena, were in attendance. --PMD",

        "date": "February 3, 2024 08:56 pm",
        "content": "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Khan were sentenced to seven years in prison and fined on Saturday by a court that ruled their 2018 marriage broke the law, his party said. It was the third ruling against Khan this week and comes ahead of national elections on Thursday that he is barred from contesting. Khan, 71, has in recent days been sentenced to 10 years for leaking state secrets and 14 years along with this wife for illegally selling state gifts. His representatives say he will launch appeals in all three cases. It was not immediately clear if his various sentences would run concurrently. Khan is in prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, while his wife will serve her sentence at their hilltop mansion in nearby Islamabad. He already faces a 10-year disqualification from holding public office. After hours of rushed hearings at court, no cross examination of witnesses, and no due process - a mockery of the law, Khans party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said in a statement. With the way these trials are being conducted, there will be a huge question mark on the February 8th elections. This is a test case for Pakistans higher judiciary. The couple were each fined 500,000 rupees (1,800), ARY News reported. Bushra was accused of not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called Iddat, after divorcing her previous husband and marrying Khan. The Khans signed their marriage contract, or Nikkah, in January 2018 in a secret ceremony seven months before the former cricket superstar became prime minister for the first time. There was controversy over whether they had wed before the period was complete. After initial denials of the marriage, PTI confirmed it weeks later. The Khans both denied wrongdoing. Can say Im a witness in the Nikkah and its a categorically yet another fake case, Khans media advisor Zulfi Bukhari told Reuters. From witnesses to the evidence to the procedure. CRIMINAL COMPLAINT Bushras ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, to whom she was married for about 30 years, brought a criminal complaint against the Khans, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Khan has often called Bushra his spiritual leader. She is known for her devotion to Sufism, a mystical form of Islam. Born Bushra Riaz Watto, she changed her name to Khan after her marriage. Her husband and followers commonly refer to her as Bushra Bibi or Bushra Begum, titles that denote respect in Urdu. It was not clear when or how Khan met Bushra, but former aide Aun Chaudhry said Khan was impressed with her spirituality. Khan, who had acquired a playboy image in the 1990s as his cricket career took off, has said he is keenly interested in Sufism. Khans two previous marriages - to Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of tycoon James Goldsmith, and television journalist Reham Nayyar Khan - ended in divorce. Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022. He says his removal was backed by the powerful military with whom he fell out while in office. He and his party say they have been subjected to a military-backed crackdown, including arrests of hundreds of supporters, party members and key aides. The military, which has for decades held sway over Pakistans politics, denies the claims. NAB, the anti-graft agency that put Khan on trial, has at various times investigated, tried and jailed all prime ministers to have served since 2008, including Nawaz Sharif, whose party is considered the frontrunner in next weeks election.

The President announced the signing of a ground-breaking free trade agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and Thailand, marking the second FTA with an ASEAN country. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the historic trade relationship between the two nations, which predates even the Sukhothai Kingdom. He urged a revival of this connection, considering the strategic positions of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean and Thailand in the Asia Pacific. The President also acknowledged the cultural ties, including shared traditions like the Ramayana and Theravada Buddhism, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. President Wickremesinghe welcomed Thailands Prime Minister and expressed enthusiasm for the proposed land bridge of Krah Canal, connecting Sri Lankan ports to the Asia Pacific. He highlighted the potential for regional logistics centres and discussed collaborative efforts in renewable energy, agriculture modernization, and fisheries development. The President lauded the commitment to commercial Durian cultivation, with the Prime Minister offering assistance to modernize agriculture. Tourism also took centre stage, with plans to provide land and historic buildings for development in strategic areas. President Wickremesinghe concluded by urging both nations to seize the opportunities presented and work collaboratively for mutual benefit, the statement mentioned. Expressing his views at the Business Forum, the Prime Minister of Thailand Srettha Thavisin highlighted potential collaborations in Sri Lankas growing hospitality industry, covering food and beverages, hotel supplies and skills development through cooperation between academies and hospitality institutes. Emphasizing the cultural and religious bonds between the nations, he mentioned Thai Airways Internationals resumption of daily flights between Bangkok and Colombo commencing from the 31st of March.

He also urged increased tourism, suggesting Thai companies capitalize on Sri Lankas infrastructure projects and tourist advantages in markets like India, UAE, and the EU, the PMD said. In terms of maritime connectivity, he identified Sri Lanka as a crucial partner in Thailands ambition to become a logistics hub in Southeast Asia, citing a land bridge project to connect the Andaman Sea with the Gulf of Thailand. Additionally, he welcomed Indonesias high-crystal ocean project in the coming years. The Prime Minister assured that Thailand is open for business year-round, inviting collaboration to foster economic growth and move into an exciting future, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "February 3, 2024 09:53 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says that the cumulative deficit in Sri Lankas trade account narrowed to USD 4.9 billion from USD 5.2 billion within last year, the lowest recorded since 2010. However, the CBSL also stated that the countrys trade deficit widened in December 2023 compared to the trade deficit recorded a year earlier. The Central Bank made those disclosures while presenting its latest reports on the performance of the external sector of the countrys economy. In December, Sri Lankas merchandise exports revenue declined by 6.2 to USD 1 billion from a year earlier, due to a decline in earnings from industrial exports and mineral exports, while an increase was recorded in agricultural exports in December 2023. The Central Bank said cumulative export earnings during the period from January to December also declined by 9.1 compared to 2022, to USD 11.91 billion. Meanwhile, expenditure on merchandise imports increased to USD 1.48 billion in December 2023, compared to USD 1.42 billion in the same month in 2022. The year-on-year increase in imports were mainly led by imports of investment goods and consumer goods amidst the relaxation of import restrictions. A Central Bank report said the cumulative import expenditure in 2023 declined by 8.1 to USD 16.8 billion over the corresponding period of 2022. Meanwhile, workers remittance increased notably to USD 570 million in December 2023 compared to USD 537 million in November 2023. The same figure in December a year earlier stood USD 476 million. As a whole, Workers remittances in 2023 amounted to USD 5.97 billion, compared to USD 3.789 billion in 2022, recording a year-on-year growth of 57.5.

        "date": "February 3, 2024 10:24 pm",
        "content": "Indonesia and Sri Lankas foreign ministers called on the European Union to be consistent in its approach to the conflict in Gaza as it has with Ukraine, as ministers from Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathered for meetings in Brussels on Friday. ASEAN and the EU should be at the front line in respecting values and principles of international law, the respect should also be applied to Palestine, to Gaza, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a forum of Indo-Pacific and European ministers. I do believe that the EU and all of us, as firm supporters of upholding international law, will also have a consistent position when it comes to Gaza, she added. Ali Sabry, Sri Lankas foreign minister, echoed the sentiment, telling reporters, We represent the sentiment of the Global South, that theres double standards when it comes to the Middle East. There is this ongoing debate when it comes to Palestinian peoples plight and the plight of Ukrainians. People are asking, you have to be true to your heart and do the right thing by everybody because all human beings matter, Sabry said. He noted younger European politicians understand that the credibility of the Western world is at stake unless you treat all of them equally. Ministers from over 70 countries and regional bodies of the Indo-Pacific and Europe gathered for the 3rd EU-Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum in the morning, followed by the 24th EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in the afternoon. Although the agenda of both meetings ranged from collaboration and sustainability to security, Israels continuing offensive in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and kidnappings in Israel overshadowed the events. In a news conference, European High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell acknowledged that every time we have a meeting with our international partners... this is a permanent issue. Some countries in the 27-member bloc strongly support a cease-fire while others do not, meaning the EU is only able to have a minimum common position to support humanitarian pauses in fighting and the release of hostages, Borrell said. Meanwhile, ASEAN has been calling for an immediate cease-fire. My role is to try to put together different approaches, there is no double standard but there are different positions, Borrell said. He said he had told a recent European Council meeting that the perception around the world is, in some cases, different from ours, and said he will raise the issue again. A joint statement following the EU-ASEAN meeting sought to emphasize common ground. We agreed to condemn all attacks against civilians and we noted the call of some of us for a durable cease-fire, it said. There were common positions on rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all those in need, for all parties to protect civilians and abide by international law, and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. We took note, and some of us underlined the importance of, the order on provisional measures issued by interim ruling by the International Court of Justice, it stated, referring to the Jan. 26 orders for Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza and take immediate steps to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches civilians. The EU is seeking to deepen engagement with the fast-growing economies of the Indo-Pacific in a multitude of areas, including environment, security and international rule of law. Dharmendra Kanani, chief spokesperson of Brussels-based think tank Friends of Europe, said more political clout and measurable actions need to come out of the Indo-Pacific forum, if were not to be too late in addressing an increasingly fragile and unstable region with far-reaching global security issues. While he welcomed some important outcomes such as coordinated maritime presence in the Indian Ocean, including joint naval exercises and strengthening the safety of port infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, most of the outcomes have been about reaching agreements but not practical measures, he said. China and the U.S. did not take part in the Indo-Pacific forum, though the U.S. attended last years forum. There is still no strategy to link the EUs Indo-Pacific strategy more forcefully to the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and of course no connection to the Quad, its just very much in the air, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, senior research fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. The Quad refers to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, made up of the U.S., Japan, India and Australia. Unless there is a triangular approach with the U.S. and India, Europe cant go anywhere with this, she said. An EU spokesperson declined to comment on whether Beijing was invited, but told reporters on Tuesday that there are other events, such as the EU-China summit in December, where the EU engages with China fully and completely. You havent heard China talk about the Indo-Pacific as a concept they would like to engage with, the spokesperson said. Source: Nikkei Asia --Agencies",

        "title": "US, Britain wage strikes against Iran-linked Houthis in Yemen",
        "date": "February 4, 2024 11:17 am",
        "content": "The United States and Britain launched strikes against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday, in the second day of major U.S. operations against Iran-linked groups following a deadly attack on American troops last weekend. The strikes hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations across the country. It was the latest sign of spreading conflict in the Middle East since war erupted between Israel and Hamas after the militant Palestinian groups deadly assault on Israel on Oct.7. This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the U.S. strikes will not pass without a response and consequences. The Yemen strikes are running parallel to an unfolding U.S. campaign of military retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan. On Friday, the U.S. carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40 people. While Washington accuses Iran-backed militias of attacking U.S. troops at bases in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, Yemens Iran-linked Houthis have been regularly targeting commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza. But the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade. Faced with mounting Red Sea violence, major shipping lines have largely abandoned the critical trade route for longer routes around Africa. This has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while sapping Egypt of crucial foreign revenue from shippers sailing the Suez Canal to or from the Red Sea. Bidens emerging strategy on Yemen aims to weaken the Houthi militants but stops well short of trying to defeat the group or directly attack Iran, the Houthis main sponsor, experts say. The strategy blends limited military strikes and sanctions, and appears aimed at punishing the Houthis while attempting to limit the risk of a broad Middle East conflict. The U.S. has carried out more than a dozen strikes against Houthi targets in the past several weeks, but these have failed to stop attacks by the group. Sarea, the Houthi military spokesperson, suggested in a statement on social media that the groups intervention in the Red Sea would continue. These attacks will not deter us from our ethical, religious and humanitarian stance in support of the resilient Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, Sarea said. Just hours before the latest major wave of strikes from the sea and air, the U.S. militarys Central Command issued statements detailing other, more limited strikes in the past day that included hitting six cruise missiles the Houthis were preparing to launch against ships in the Red Sea. Around 4 a.m. in Yemen (0100 GMT), the U.S. military also struck a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile that was poised to launch. This is not an escalation, said British Defence Minister Grant Shapps. We have already successfully targeted launchers and storage sites involved in Houthi attacks, and I am confident that our latest strikes have further degraded the Houthis capabilities. The United States said Sundays strikes had support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. U.S. Central Command said that beyond missile capabilities, the strikes targeted drone storage and operations sites, radars and helicopters. Despite the strikes against Iran-linked groups, the Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either. U.S. Republicans have been ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to deal a blow to Iran directly. It was unclear how Tehran would respond to the strikes, which do not directly target Iran but degrade groups it backs. Irans foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement the attacks in Iraq and Syria represented another adventurous and strategic mistake by the United States that will result only in increased tension and instability. Iraq summoned the U.S. charge daffaires in Baghdad to deliver a formal protest after strikes in that country.

Independence Day of Sri Lanka is a national holiday in the South Asian island country that commemorates Sri Lankas 76th political independence from British rule on February 4, 1948. Google released the doodle marking this occasion that spans the region of Sri Lanka over its visibility. The doodle depicts Sri Lankan flag with Google written at the bottom. SIGNIFICANCE This day holds immense significance for the people of the country as it marks the culmination of decades of struggle and aspirations for self-determination. HISTORY Sri Lankans led a number of movements and legislative actions to achieve freedom from colonial rule. The Sri Lanka Independence Movement was a political initiative. The movement for self-governance educated the middle-class and encouraged a peaceful transfer of power. In 1942, State Council passed a resolution demanding complete independence. The Soulbury Commission was formed in 1944, to create a variety of new constitutional and legal reforms. Other significant events in Sri Lankan history include the formation of Ceylon National Congress in 1884 which is the first major political party that advocated for self-governance. Donoughmore Commission that granted limited self-government was formed in 1931. Early 20th century was marked by boycotts, strikes, and other forms of non-violent resistance that gained momentum during this period. CELEBRATIONS Independence Day is marked by flag hoisting ceremony by the President in Colombo. The day begins with flag raising ceremony followed by Presidents speech that is nationally televised. A military parade marks an integral part of the celebrations with aircraft flyover and tank display. Cultural performances including traditional dances and music are performed throughout the country. Citizens of the country celebrate with fireworks, picnics and family gatherings. Source - Livemint - Agencies",

        "date": "February 4, 2024 05:31 pm",
        "content": "The United States and Britain launched strikes against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, in the second day of major U.S. operations against Iran-linked groups following a deadly attack on American troops last weekend. The strikes late on Saturday hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations across the country. They are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting a war that has drawn in an array of armed groups backed by Tehran. Residents said the strikes shook buildings in Houthi-controlled Sanaa. The groups military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the U.S. strikes will not pass without a response and consequences. The group did not announce any casualties. Houthi-run media called these the most violent strikes yet. The Yemen strikes are running parallel to an unfolding U.S. campaign of retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan a week ago. On Friday, the U.S. carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40. The violence has added to concerns of the potential for further escalation. Iran has so far avoided any direct role in the conflict, even as groups it backs have entered the fray from Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Mahjoob Zweiri, Director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, did not expect a change in Irans approach even after the latest U.S. strikes. They keep the enemy behind the borders, far away. They are not interested in any direct military confrontation which might lead to attacks on their cities or their homeland. They will maintain that status quo, he told Reuters. Irans foreign ministry said the latest attacks on Yemen were a flagrant violation of international law by the United States and Britain, warning the continuation of such attacks was a worrying threat to international peace and security. The Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either. U.S. Republicans have been putting pressure on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to deal a blow to Iran directly. HOUTHIS SAY WONT BE DETERRED The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza. But the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade. Major shipping lines have largely abandoned Red Sea shipping lanes for longer routes around Africa. This has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while denying Egypt crucial foreign revenue from use of the Suez Canal. Bidens emerging strategy on Yemen aims to weaken the Houthi militants but stops short of trying to defeat the group or directly attack Iran - the Houthis main sponsor, experts say. The strategy blends limited military strikes and sanctions, and appears aimed at punishing the Houthis while attempting to limit the risk of a broad Middle East conflict. The U.S. has carried out more than a dozen strikes against Houthi targets in the past several weeks. Sarea, the Houthi spokesperson, suggested in a statement on social media that the group would press on. These attacks will not deter us from our ethical, religious and humanitarian stance in support of the resilient Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, Sarea said. Just hours before the latest major wave of strikes from the sea and air, the U.S. militarys Central Command issued statements detailing other, more limited strikes in the past day that included hitting six cruise missiles the Houthis were preparing to launch against ships in the Red Sea. Around 4 a.m. in Yemen (0100 GMT) on Sunday, the U.S. military also struck a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile poised to launch. OMANI CONCERN This is not an escalation, said British Defence Minister Grant Shapps. We have already successfully targeted launchers and storage sites involved in Houthi attacks, and I am confident that our latest strikes have further degraded the Houthis capabilities. The United States said Sundays strikes had support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. U.S. Central Command said that beyond missile capabilities, the strikes targeted drone storage and operations sites, radars and helicopters. The Houthi military said the United States and Britain carried out a total of 48 airstrikes on Yemen, with 13 of them in the capital Sanaa and Sanaa Governorate. Another 11 strikes were on Taiz Governorate and nine were on Hodeidah Governorate. Oman Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad bin Hamoud Al-Busaidi said that Oman has grave concerns over the continuous escalation in the region. In a statement, he criticized the effectiveness of retaliatory U.S. attacks in Iraq and Syria, noting that such actions compromise the regions safety, stability, and efforts to tackle challenges like violence and extremism.

        "date": "February 4, 2024 06:19 pm",
        "content": "Namibias President Hage Geingob, 82, died in hospital early on Sunday, the presidency said, weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer. Geingob had been in charge of the thinly populated and mostly arid southern African country since 2015, the year he announced he had survived prostate cancer. Vice President Nangolo Mbumba takes the helm in Namibia - a mining hotspot with significant deposits of diamonds and the electric car battery ingredient lithium - until presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of the year. A presidency post on social media platform X did not give a cause of death, but late last month the presidency said he had travelled to the United States for a two-day novel treatment for cancerous cells, after being diagnosed following a regular medical check-up. Born in 1941, Geingob was a prominent politician since before Namibia achieved independence from white minority-ruled South Africa in 1990. He chaired the body that drafted Namibias constitution, then became its first prime minister at independence on March 21 of that year, a position he retained until 2002. CHAINS OF INJUSTICE In 2007, Geingob became vice president of the governing South West Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO), which he had joined as an agitator for independence when Namibia was still known as South West Africa. SWAPO has remained in power in Namibia unchallenged since independence. The former German colony is technically an upper middle-income country but one with huge disparities in wealth. There were no textbooks to prepare us for accomplishing the task of development and shared prosperity after independence, he said in a speech to mark the day in 2018. We needed to build a Namibia in which the chains of the injustices of the past would be broken. Geingob served as trade and industry minister before becoming prime minister again in 2012. He won the 2014 election with 87 of the vote but only narrowly avoided a runoff with a little more than half the votes in a subsequent poll in November 2019. That election followed a government bribery scandal, in which officials were alleged to have awarded horse mackerel quotas to Icelands biggest fishing firm, Samherji, in exchange for kickbacks, according to local media reports. The resultant outcry led to the resignation of two ministers. The following year, Geingob lamented that Namibias wealth still remained concentrated in the hands of its white minority. Distribution is an issue, but how do we do it? Geingob said in a virtual session at an event organised by international organisation Horasis. We have a racial issue here, a historical racial divide. Now you say we must grab from the whites and give it to the Blacks, its not going to work, he said. His comments came after the government rescinded as unworkable a policy that would have made it mandatory for white-owned businesses to sell a 25 stake to Black Namibians. Geingob died at Lady Pohamba Hospital in Windhoek, where he was receiving treatment from his medical team, the presidency said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

Security personnel at the entrance of the cemetery had reportedly attempted to prevent the group from entering into the premises. Despite their attempt, however, the group had entered the premises and staged a protest against the highly controversial Online Safety Bill, which came into effect earlier this month. The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech. The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects. The Sri Lankan government says the Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters.",

        "date": "February 4, 2024 10:18 pm",
        "content": "The United States intends to launch further strikes at Iran-backed groups in the Middle East, the White House national security adviser said on Sunday, after hitting Tehran-aligned factions in Iraq, Syria and Yemen over the last two days. The United States and Britain unleashed attacks against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, a day after the U.S. military hit Tehran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan. We intend to take additional strikes, and additional action, to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, when our people are killed, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told NBCs Meet the Press program on Sunday. The strikes are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting war. Tehran-backed groups declaring support for the Palestinians have entered the fray across the region: Hezbollah has fired at Israeli targets at the Lebanese-Israeli border, Iraqi militias have fired on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis have fired on shipping in the Red Sea and at Israel itself. Iran has so far avoided any direct role in the conflict, even as it backs those groups. The Pentagon has said it does not want war with Iran and does not believe Tehran wants war either. Sullivan declined to be drawn on whether the United States might attack sites inside Iran, something the U.S. military has been very careful to avoid. Speaking to CBS Face the Nation program moments earlier, he said Fridays strikes were the beginning, not the end, of our response, and there will be more steps - some seen, some perhaps unseen. I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign, he said. Saturdays strikes in Yemen hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations. The Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the strikes will not pass without a response and consequences. Another Houthi spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, indicated the group would not be deterred, saying Yemens decision to support Gaza would not be affected by any attack. Residents described being shaken by powerful blasts. The building I live in shook, said Fatimah, a resident of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, adding that it had been years since she had felt such blasts in a country that has suffered years of war. The Houthis did not announce any casualties. The Yemen strikes are running parallel to the unfolding U.S. campaign of retaliation over the killing of three American soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan. IRAN SEEN AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION On Friday, the U.S. carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria more than 85 targets linked to Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40. Mahjoob Zweiri, Director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, did not expect a change in Irans approach even after the latest U.S. strikes. They keep the enemy behind the borders, far away. They are not interested in any direct military confrontation which might lead to attacks on their cities or their homeland. They will maintain that status quo, he told Reuters. Irans foreign ministry said the latest attacks on Yemen were a flagrant violation of international law by the United States and Britain, warning the continuation of such attacks was a worrying threat to international peace and security. Andreas Krieg, Associate Professor at Kings College, London, noted that while U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria had marked an escalation in terms of their breadth and the amount of ordinance dropped, they had not hit targets in Iran or Iranians. The US has stepped away from that, because it would have led to further escalation, he said. I think we will see a response by these militias or by Iran on U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq, but that response will be measured as well, he said. U.S. Republicans have been putting pressure on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to deal a blow to Iran directly. BAGHDAD FUNERAL MARCH While the Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians, the U.S. and its allies characterize them as indiscriminate and a menace to global trade. The U.S. has carried out more than a dozen strikes against Houthi targets in the past several weeks. Major shipping lines have largely abandoned Red Sea shipping lanes for longer routes around Africa. T his has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while denying Egypt crucial foreign revenue from use of the Suez Canal. The U.S. strikes in Iraq were the deadliest in years. Hundreds of people attended a Baghdad funeral procession for 17 members of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) killed in the strikes. The PMF is a state security force containing several Iran-backed armed groups. Hadi al-Ameri, a senior Iraqi politician close to Iran, said it was time to oust U.S. forces, 2,500 of whom are in Iraq in a mission to help prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. Their presence is pure evil for the Iraqi people, he said. Iraq and the United States last month initiated talks about ending the U.S.-led coalitions presence in the country.

        "date": "February 4, 2024 11:09 pm",
        "content": "A delegation of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a MarxistLeninist communist party which led an anti-India campaign in 1987-90 against the Indo-Lanka Accord, will on Monday (05 Feb.) start on an official visit to India. The delegation of JVP, the largest party under the broad entity National Peoples Power (NPP), is to leave Colombo tomorrow (Monday) for India on an official invitation of the Indian government, a statement from the party said. The delegation to India comprises JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, senior legislator Vijitha Herath, Secretary Nihal Abeysinghe and executive committee member Prof Anil Jayantha, the statement said. The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord, signed in Colombo on July 29, 1987, between Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene, was expected to resolve the Sri Lankan Civil War by enabling the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Under the terms of the agreement, Colombo agreed to a devolution of power to the provinces, the Sri Lankan troops were to be withdrawn to their barracks in the north and the Tamil rebels were to surrender their arms. The JVP has continuously led in at least one public opinion poll while the NPP broader front has led in surveys, leaving the island nations main parties trailing. The surveys claim that in the post-economic crisis phase since 2022, the NPP has gained significantly in public support, particularly in anti-corruption perceptions. Dissanayake has already declared his candidacy for the next presidential election to be held later this year. Analysts, however, remain sceptical if the party could raise its current three percent vote base to 50 percent plus one vote required to win the presidency. The JVP has a checkered record having led two bloody rebellions in 1971 and 1987-90. Source  PTI - Agencies",

        "date": "February 5, 2024 10:00 am",
        "content": "Intense forest fires burning around a densely populated area of central Chile have caused at least 46 deaths, Chiles president said Saturday evening, and officials said at least 1,100 homes had been destroyed. In a nationally televised address, President Gabriel Boric warned that the death toll could worsen as four large fires burn in the region of Valparaiso, where firefighters have struggled to reach the most threatened neighborhoods. Boric urged Chileans to cooperate with rescue workers. If you are told to evacuate dont hesitate to do it, he said. The fires are advancing fast and climatic conditions have made them difficult to control. There are high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity. Interior Minister Carolina Tohá said earlier Saturday that 92 forest fires were burning in the center and south of the country, where temperatures have been unusually high this week. The deadliest of the fires were in the Valparaíso region, where authorities urged thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Meanwhile, residents in areas farther away from the fires were told to stay at home so that fire engines, ambulances and other emergency vehicles can get about on the roads with greater ease. Tohá said two fires near the towns of Quilpué and Villa Alemana had burned through at least 8,000 hectares (19,770 acres) since Friday. One of the fires was threatening the coastal resort town of Viña del Mar, where some neighborhoods had already been hit hard. In Villa Independencia, a hillside neighborhood on the eastern edge of the town, several blocks of homes and businesses were destroyed. Burned cars with broken windows lined the streets, which were covered in ash. Ive been here 32 years, and never imagined this would happen, said Rolando Fernández, one of the residents who lost his home. He said he first saw the fire burning on a nearby hill Friday afternoon and within 15 minutes the area was engulfed in flames and smoke, forcing everyone to run for their lives. Ive worked my whole life, and now Im left with nothing, Fernández said. Three shelters were set up in the Valparaíso region, and 19 helicopters and more than 450 firefighters were brought into the area to help battle the blazes, Tohá said. The fires were burning on mountains that are hard to reach, such as neighborhoods built precariously on the edge of Viña del Mar. Officials reported power blackouts as a result of the fire, and Tohá said that in the Valparaíso region, four hospitals and three nursing homes for the elderly had to be evacuated. The fire also destroyed two bus terminals, the interior minister said. The El Niño weather pattern has caused droughts and hotter-than-usual temperatures along the west of South America this year, increasing the risk of forest fires. In January, more than 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forests were destroyed in Colombia by fires that followed several weeks of dry wea Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "February 5, 2024 02:38 pm",
        "content": "Police made arrests and fired tear gas as opposition supporters protested President Macky Salls decision to postopne elections in Senegal. Clashes erupted on Sunday as federal lawmakers prepared to debate a bill to formalise the delay of the February 25 vote. Demonstrators rallied in the capital Dakar after leading opposition figures and candidates in the presidential election rejected Saturdays announcement and called on citizens to defend democracy. Meanwhile, ECOWAS, West Africas regional bloc, called for dialogue. Among those arrested as the protests spread was former Prime Minister Aminata Toure, as well as Anta Babacar Ngom, one of the candidates in the postponed vote. The government cut the signal of private television channel Walf as it broadcast the protest live. The New York-based non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the move in a post on social media platform X, urging Senegalese authorities to ensure that journalists can work without hindrance. Ahead of the postponement, Senegal had already been embroiled in political tension as the disqualification of two opposition candidates had triggered deadly clashes. Salls call to delay the vote cited a dispute between the judiciary and parliament over the final list of candidates. At least two of the 20 candidates said they would proceed with their campaign scheduled to kick off on Sunday. Salls tenure is scheduled to end on April 2. However, Senegals electoral code requires 80 days notice for a ballot, suggesting that the earliest that a vote could now take place is the last week of April. Repealing the decree that had set the electoral process in motion, Sall cited the dispute between the judiciary and federal lawmakers over the disqualification process and the reported dual nationality of some of the qualified candidates. Opposition leaders argue that the Senegalese leader lacks the power to delay the vote. Salls announcement followed a request to postpone the vote by the opposition Senegalese Democratic Party, whose candidate Karim Wade had been disqualified. Wade has accused two judges of corruption in the disqualification process and said that postponing the vote would make it possible to repair the damage suffered. The constitution empowers the Constitutional Council, Senegals highest election authority, to reschedule the election in certain circumstances including in the case of the death, permanent incapacity or withdrawal of candidates.

        "date": "February 5, 2024 03:29 pm",
        "content": "The cricket boards of Pakistan and Sri Lanka are locked in a financial dispute over who should bear the additional 3-4 million burden incurred due to the shifting of the Asia Cup to the island nation last year. Hybrid Model and Unforeseen Costs With the BCCI unwilling to send its team to Pakistan, the original host, due to geo-political tensions, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) decided on a hybrid model and roped in Sri Lanka to host the majority of the matches. This resulted in extra expenses being incurred on chartered flights, hotel bookings, venue hiring fees and travel, among others. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) made it clear during the ACC council meeting in Bali last week that it was not willing to take the financial burden as it did not earn extra and was also not the official host of the tournament. The expenses also reportedly soared because the former PCB chairman, Zaka Ashraf, changed the venue of the first match from Lahore to Multan. The PCB is also making a case for the ACC to pay for the additional expenses as the continental cricket governing body took the decision to take away Pakistans hosting rights and split the event. A source in the know of things said that during the Bali meeting, ACC chief Jay Shah made it clear that it was the PCB which insisted on hosting four matches after the ACC board had decided to move the entire tournament to Sri Lanka. When the financial dispute was discussed by the acting chairman of the PCB, Khawar Shah, and CEO Salman Naseer (in Bali), Jay Shah and the SLC were on the same page, the source said. He said that Shah explained to the officials that since Pakistan remained the host of the event and Sri Lankas venue and facilities were used, SLCs dues should be cleared by PCB. Unresolved Financial Dispute The source added that SLC president Shami Silva expressed concern to the ACC that PCB had still not cleared the bills for hotel stay and chartered flights. Shah advised Silva to deal directly with the PCB. Naseer, however, has assured Silva that some bills pertaining to hotel stay and venue rental were in the process of verification and would be cleared soon by the PCB. However, the issue of expenses incurred on chartered flight remains unresolved, with the PCB insisting that the flights were booked through Classic Travel, a non-prequalified Sri Lankan company. Apparently, the PCB has so far paid an upfront amount of 281,700 and agreed to give SLC 2,069,885 for the venues. But, now, the PCB is insisting the ACC, being the parent body, share some of the additional costs and pay the hosting fee of 2.5 million dollars. Source: PTI --Agencies",

President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a ceremony at Rangiri Dambulu Stadium this afternoon (05), where 10,000 freehold titles were awarded to farmers as part of the first phase of the Urumaya program. The President highlighted that granting land rights to foreigners under the Government Land Ordinance Act would not have been an impediment to providing the same rights to the people. As part of the 2024 budget proposals, President Ranil Wickremesinghes eighth proposal aims to grant full ownership of government lands to farmers, which were disposed of under the Land Development Ordinance Act of 1935 through permits and conditional grants. Fulfilling a longstanding aspiration of the nation, the Urumaya program, aimed at granting freehold rights to land, will be rolled out nationwide under the Presidents guidance, benefiting an estimated 02 million farming families. The 2024 budget proposal allocates Rs. 02 billion for the Urumaya programs implementation. Applicants seeking full ownership of land through the Urumaya program will receive freehold titles in three main stages. To streamline the process and address community concerns promptly, a Urumaya National Operations Secretariat has been established under the Presidential Secretariat, coordinating relevant institutions. Symbolically, President Ranil Wickremesinghe personally distributed land deeds to farmers. Additionally, he inaugurated the Centre of Excellence at Dambulla Stadium as part of the National Cricket Development Pathway program, designed to offer equal opportunities to cricketers with natural talents for national team representation. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe opened a new swimming pool on the stadium premises and actively observed the pools practical activities. President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the innovative stadium lighting system. Furthermore, during the ceremony, he laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Media Centre, the new auditorium, and the indoor stadium at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium and the Centre of Excellence. President Wickremesinghe, addressing the ceremony, added: This is our homeland, the place of my birth, the nation that defines my heritage. Today marks a significant occasion as we gather to address a longstanding struggle faced by the people of our beloved nationthe quest for land rights. What we are witnessing today is a transformative moment, a revolution, as we grant land rights to 02 million individuals. This monumental step empowers our citizens to exercise control over their land without the need for constant approvals from authorities. I urge everyone to cherish and safeguard this right, not just for themselves but for future generations. Let us capitalize on this opportunity for progress and development. While many parts of the world have witnessed revolutions to secure land rights, our country is distinguished by achieving this milestone without the need for such upheavals. Many deemed this impossibility, but our government made the decisive choice. Specifically, those engaged in farming and those who have built houses will now hold the rights to that land. I extend my gratitude to all involved in agricultural activities. Your support in the last Maha and Yala seasons played a crucial role in revitalizing the countrys economy, leading to a successful harvest. Additionally, I acknowledge those who have constructed homes on these lands. It is in appreciation of their contributions that we grant this freehold land right. This marks a historic moment, as even during the Sinhalese dynasty, there was no established deed system. Lands were allocated to the privileged and Nilames through letters, while others received land for cultivation without permanent deeds. The Waste Land Act designated all such lands to the government, leaving the people with nothing. Mr. D.S. Senanayake initiated efforts to allocate land to people for farming under the Land Development Ordinance Act of 1935. The Land Acquisition Act was utilized to acquire land for village expansion, but ownership rights were not granted. Subsequently, settlements were established in arid regions, accompanied by the commencement of paddy cultivation. Mr. Philip Gunawardena introduced the Paddy Act to enhance paddy fields in the wet zone where the majority existed, facing considerable opposition. However, the initiative persevered. During the Mahaweli movement, Mr. J R Jayawardena allocated additional acres to the people. We are now launching a similar program. In the past, Mr. Gayantha Karunathilaka faced legal challenges when initiating this program, accused of introducing a new law. However, this time, I did not encounter such opposition. If the Government Land Ordinance could grant land to white individuals and provide free land rights to investors, there is no reason why the same rights cannot be extended to the general public. Today, we are granting free land rights to everyone using the same ordinance that facilitated land allocation to investors. No legal hurdles need to be overcome again. This program is historic and revolutionary. Land rights have only been granted in Asia by Japan and South Korea, and today, the people of our country have acquired this right. I have instructed the swift implementation of this initiative in every divisional secretariat. I urge all Members of Parliament to unite without party distinctions for the success of this endeavour. It must be acknowledged that the current government in Sri Lanka is unprecedented, with individuals from various parties coming together to take on responsibilities during challenging times. Despite the complexities of forming a government with contributions from different parties, we faced the task of rebuilding the country. While our nation is gradually recovering, I recognize the hardships endured by the people. Efforts have been made to provide relief through programs such as the Aswesuma program and salary increases for government employees. Emerging from a state of bankruptcy, the next step involves granting free land rights to the people. Despite economic challenges, undertaking these initiatives raises the question of what cannot be achieved in the future with a strengthened national economy. Continuing on the path we have embarked upon, there is the potential to achieve a 5 economic growth in 2025. Our collective efforts, transcending party politics, have contributed to the success achieved so far. I urge everyone to unite in carrying forward this work, keeping the future of our people in mind. We have already granted land rights to 02 million people and provided benefits to another 02 million, along with salary increases for 1.5 million. The development of the tourism sector has also created new income streams. If such significant accomplishments can be achieved with parliamentary unity, envision the possibilities if all members collaborate. This is the direction we must take. Anticipating further legislative measures to foster the countrys development, let us advance together. An extensive agricultural revolution is underway, transforming the landscape through agricultural modernization. We must avoid falling into debt again and prevent becoming a nation of beggars. Safeguarding our pride is crucial, and we must embark on this journey together. Today, each one of you is a stakeholder in this country. I encourage everyone to act with pride and wish you all the best. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena acknowledges the historical significance of the city of Dambulu and its role in preserving the countrys heritage. This presents an opportunity to bestow the Urumaya that began with the struggle to overcome such challenges upon 02 million people. In achieving the Presidents objectives, commendable efforts were made by all officials, including the Minister of Lands. Highlighting the unparalleled historical importance of Dambulu, enriched by landmarks like Dambulla and Sigiriya, the Prime Minister emphasizes the responsibility of recipients of government land to contribute to vital tasks, particularly in ensuring food self-sufficiency. Today, we are commemorating our rich heritage. This is a source of pride for our land. During a period when people across the country were grappling with food shortages, the farmers, with the Presidents invitation and intervention, played a crucial role in restoring self-sufficiency to our nation. As recipients of government land, it is expected that you will vigorously continue these vital tasks. The responsibility lies with all of you to wholeheartedly commit to this cause. Do not underestimate the significance of the deed you receive today. Minister of Tourism, Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs, Mr. Harin Fernando, paid respectful homage to past land ministers, notably highlighting the efforts of Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka. In 2015, Minister Karunathilaka proposed a cabinet paper advocating for land rights for the people, a vision that, though unrealized at the time, has now materialized under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Minister Fernando proclaimed today as a historic day that merits a place in the records of the countrys history. On that day, Mr. D.S. Senanayake solidified the land rights of the countrys people, and later, Mr. J.R. Jayawardena recognized the significance of granting land rights to the citizens. This can be noted as a unique instance when freehold land was acquired. I extend my gratitude to all those who devoted themselves to this historic endeavour. The event was attended by Religious leaders led the Maha Sangharatna, Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Prasanna Ranatunga, Tiran Alles, Douglas Devananda, Mahinda Amaraweera, State Ministers Pramita Bandara Thennakone, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Rohana Dissanayake, Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Members of Parliament Janaka Bandara Thennakone, S. M. Chandrasena, Vadivel Suresh, Vajira Abeywardena, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Nalaka Kottegoda, UNP Chief Organizer of Matale Priyan Wijeratne, Governors including Central Province Governor Lalith U Gamage, senior Adviser to the President on National security and the chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Land Commissioner General Bandhula Jayasinghe, Director General of Trade Unions to the President  Saman Rathnapriya and a large number of officials, including Ministry Secretaries, Provincial Secretaries, District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries, and land title holders. --PMD",

        "date": "February 5, 2024 07:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka expects to attract about US5 billion in foreign funds in the next two years once it is able to finalise the restructuring of its overseas debt, the countrys foreign minister said on Monday (Feb 5). The nation defaulted on its overseas debt in May, 2022 after a severe shortage of foreign exchange reserves triggered the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Sri Lanka has since made progress on about US11 billion of bilateral debt restructuring and hopes to have agreements in place with all key creditors, including bondholders, by May at the latest, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Reuters. It will then focus on kick-starting major infrastructure projects suspended during the crisis, including a highway, an expansion of the main airport near Colombo and a US2 billion light railway project with Japan. We are looking at, within the next 12 to 24 months, somewhere in the region of about US5 billion worth of foreign currency infusion into the country in terms of projects and also from the sale of some state-owned enterprises, Sabry said in an interview. Sri Lankas private creditors account for about US16 billion of debt, including international sovereign bonds, Sabry said. If we reach an agreement with them then we can...start lifting the moratorium on the foreign debt payments. That would make it easier for investment to flow into Sri Lanka, including US1.5 billion committed for Colombos Chinese-funded Port City, as well as renewable energy and port terminal projects by Indias Adani Group. There is a bag of big projects lined up, hopefully it will...start once we finalise the debt restructuring, Sabry said. Sri Lanka secured a US2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last March, helping to temper inflation, increase state revenue and rebuild foreign exchange reserves. Its national carrier and main telecommunications company are on a list of state-owned enterprises to be revamped with private investment under the IMF programme. Jio Platforms, a unit of Indias Reliance Industries, is among the bidders for the latter. REUTERS --Agencies",

        "content": "Thailands Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has called a meeting with the newly appointed CEO and board chairman of PTT Plc, the state-owned listed oil and gas company, to discuss support for Thai startups and investing in Sri Lankas solar farm. Srettha, in his capacity as finance minister, invited PTT CEO Kongkrapan Intarajang and PTT board chairman Chatchai Promlert, to Government House on Monday. The Finance Ministry is a major shareholder of PTT Public Company Limited or simply PTT, Thai media reported. After the meeting, Srettha told the media that he had discussed investment opportunities with the PTT CEO and board chairman. He said he urged the two executives to seek investment opportunities overseas, especially in Sri Lankas floating solar farm, which requires more funding. Srettha returned from a state visit to Sri Lanka on Sunday. After returning, I invited the chairman to talk about PTTs investment opportunities abroad, such as the solar floating farm in Sri Lanka that is open to investment from Thailand, the premier said. Srettha added that he also told the two PTT executives that it should consider supporting Thai startups as well as local sports associations. I believe PTT can leverage itself from an energy firm into a corporation that provides good opportunities to Thais, he was quoted as saying by The Nation Thailand. --Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2024 12:37 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - At least 10 police personnel were killed and six others injured in a pre-dawn attack on Monday by militants on a police station in northwest Pakistan, police said, as violence escalated ahead of general elections this week. At around 3 a.m. local time (2200 GMT Sunday) militants attacked the police station with sniper fire and then entered the building, said police officers in Pakistans Draban region in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. After entering the building, the terrorists used hand grenades which caused more casualties to the police, said Malik Anees ul Hassan, the deputy superintendent of police in Draban. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack and whether it was related to the election. A national assembly candidate was shot dead on Wednesday elsewhere in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. On the same day, another political leader was shot dead in his partys election office in Balochistan province. On Tuesday, a bomb attack following an election rally killed four people in Balochistan. Islamic State claimed responsibility. Draban lies in an area considered a stronghold of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party. The conservative religious partys leader, Maulana Fazal Ur Rehman, travelled last month to Afghanistan to meet the Talibans supreme spiritual leader, local media reported, one of his few known meetings with foreign dignitaries. The party has also called for a delay in Pakistans polls due to security concerns. At least 23 soldiers were killed in December when a six-man suicide squad drove an explosive-laden truck into a military camp, set up in a police station complex, also in Draban. Pakistan has seen a resurgence of attacks by Islamist militants, especially those targeting security personnel, since 2022, when a ceasefire between the Pakistani Taliban and the government broke down.

        "title": "King Charles diagnosed with cancer",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 06:54 am",
        "content": "Britains King Charles III has been diagnosed with a form of cancer and will postpone public engagements to undergo treatment, Buckingham Palace said on Monday, but added he remained wholly positive about the scare less than 18 months into his reign. Charles, 75, who became king in September 2022 following the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth, has begun a series of treatments, the palace said, adding he was looking forward to returning to fulltime duties as soon as possible. The cancer revelation comes after Charles spent three nights in hospital last month where he underwent a corrective procedure for a benign enlarged prostate. The palace said a separate issue of concern had been spotted during that hospital stay, but did not given any further details beyond saying tests had revealed the king had a form of cancer. No further details are being shared at this stage, except to confirm that his majesty does not have prostate cancer, the palace said. Throughout this period, his majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual. As such, Charles will continue to have meetings with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, while his wife Queen Camilla will continue with her engagements. SMILING On Sunday, the king gave no indication of the diagnosis when he was pictured smiling and waving to onlookers as he attended a church service with Camilla. It was his first public outing since he and his daughter-in-law Kate left the same London hospital a week ago where they had both undergone planned treatments. Kate, the Princess of Wales and wife to heir to the British throne Prince William, spent two weeks at the London clinic following abdominal surgery for an unspecified but non-cancerous condition. She will not be returning to royal duties until after Easter. William, who has been looking after their three children as she recovers, will carry out his first public engagement since her operation on Wednesday. While the royals usually closely guard details of their health, regarding it as a private matter, Charles has been open about his recent treatment. His Majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer, Buckingham Palace said. Sunak sent his best wishes to the King on X. I have no doubt hell be back to full strength in no time and I know the whole country will be wishing him well, he said. BIDEN CONCERN The leaders of Australia and Canada, where Charles is also head of state, expressed their best wishes and hopes for the king to make a speedy recovery, while U.S. President Joe Biden said he was concerned by the news and planned to call Charles later. Navigating a cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship takes hope and absolute courage, Biden said. Jill and I join the people of the United Kingdom in praying that His Majesty experiences a swift and full recovery. The monarch told his immediate family personally about his cancer diagnosis, and Prince Harry, his younger son, will travel to the UK to see him in the coming days, a source close to the Duke of Sussex said. Harry now lives in California with his American wife Meghan and their two children after the couple stepped down from royal duties in 2020. After waiting longer than any heir in British history to become king, Charles first year on the throne was dominated by his coronation  Britains biggest ceremonial event for generations, full of pomp and pageantry. While before he became sovereign there were suggestions that the long-time environmental campaigner would bring a radical overhaul of the monarchy, Charles has generally followed in the style of his mother, while trying to add some of his own touches. Polls suggest most Britons have a favourable view of his reign so far, although younger generations appear much less enthusiastic about the royal family in general. Prior to his recent health issues, the biggest shadow over the royals was the ongoing fallout between his son Harry and the rest of his family, most notably Harrys elder brother Prince William. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said that for Charles, a workaholic who often worked until midnight on his papers, his recent health issues would mean he would have to take it more slowly now. His body will tell him he has to, and Camilla certainly will, she said. I think hes mentally exhausted since the death of the queen. Its been non-stop for him since then. While Queen Margrethe II of Denmark abdicated last month in favour of her son King Frederik X after 52 years on the throne, Seward said there was no chance Charles would follow suit. Absolutely not, 100 no, she said. Source: Reuters",

        "content": "The health sector trade unionists and Finance Ministry representatives are slated to meet later today (Feb.06) do discuss the concerns of the health workers regarding allowances. Health Trade Union Alliances convenor Ravi Kumudesh said the meeting is scheduled to start at noon under the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers have engaged in strikes on multiple occasions demanding an allowance hike for them. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers approved President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. This compelled the other health workers to resort to trade union actions. Later, on January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. In response, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) announced the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24, but it was later called off the planned trade union action, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.",

        "date": "February 6, 2024 10:12 am",
        "content": "Volunteers in central Chile tried to remove charred metal, broken glass and other debris Monday from neighborhoods devastated by wildfires over the past several days, as officials raised the death toll to 122. Hundreds of people remain missing. The fires appeared to have diminished by Monday morning after burning intensely since Friday on the eastern edge of the city of Viña del Mar. Two other towns in the Valparaíso region, Quilpé and Villa Alemana, also have been hit hard, and President Gabriel Boric said Sunday that at least 3,000 homes had been burnt down in the area. An additional 10 victims were added to the death toll on Monday afternoon, bringing it to 122, said Marisol Prado, the director of Chiles Forensic Medical Service. Prado said that many bodies were in bad condition and difficult to identify, but added that forensic workers would be taking samples of genetic material from people who have reported missing relatives. Viña del Mars Mayor Macarena Ripamonti said that at least 370 people have been reported missing in the city of about 300,000 residents. The fires ravaged several neighborhoods that had been precariously built on the mountains that loom to the east of Viña del Mar, which is also a popular beach resort. Officials have suggested that some of the wildfires around the city could have been intentionally provoked. Dry weather, strong winds and low humidity helped the fires spread faster, Boric said. Priscila Rivero, a chef from the neighborhood of Alto Miraflores, said that it took about 15 minutes for the flames to travel from a neighboring hill to her home. She said she rushed her children to safety when she saw the fire approaching, but by the time she returned to salvage some of her posessions her house was burning, with licks of flame emerging from the windows. Its the place where we have lived all our lives Rivero said. Its so sad to see it destroyed, and to lose our memories, our photos, the pictures from my parents wedding, but some of that will remain in our hearts. Later Monday, a statement from U.S. President Joe Biden said Jill and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by the ongoing wildfires in Chile. My administration is in contact with our Chilean partners, and the United States is ready to provide necessary assistance to the Chilean people, he said. Schools and other public buildings in Viña del Mar and in the capital city of Santiago are currently serving as depots, where people are taking donations of water, food, candles and shovels for the victims of the fires. In Viña del Mar and the nearby towns of Villa Alemana and Quilpé, police have asked people who have not been affected by the fires to stay at home so that rescue crews can move around with more ease. Hundreds of people affected by the fires returned to their homes on Monday to search through the debris. Many have said they prefer to sleep near their homes in order to prevent looters from taking what is left of their possessions, or from claiming the land their homes were built on. In the neighborhood of Villa Independencia, on Viña del Mars eastern periphery, Marco Delgadillo tried to clear rubble from his home, which he built 25 years ago, when the area was first settled haphazardly by workers without construction permits. The furniture in Delgadillos house had been devoured by the flames and the walls were blackened by smoke, but they still stood. The construction worker said he would rebuild and urged the municipal government to help him fix the collapsed roof of his home before winter starts in the southern hemisphere. We dont have any other choice, Delgadillo said. Buying a new plot of land is unaffordable right now. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "The Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament will be ceremonially declared open by President Ranil Wickremesinghe tomorrow (Feb.07). This was communicated by the Legislative Services Department of the Parliament last week, while announcing the business of the House of Parliament for the first sitting week of February 2024, as decided by political party leaders. Sri Lanka Parliament was prorogued with effect from midnight on 26 January, marking the closure of the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament. The prorogation was announced via a proclamation published in the government gazette by virtue of the powers vested in the President by Article 70 of the Constitution. When a new session kicks off, the President has the opportunity preside over the ceremonial opening of the Parliament and to present the governments policy statement. In the past, the policy statement was referred to as the Throne Speech and was presented by the Governor. The adjournment debate on the governments policy statement is scheduled to be held over two days, on Thursday (Feb.08) and Friday (Feb.09), from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Meanwhile, the Resolution under the Essential Public Services Act is scheduled to be approved without a debate on 08 February, before continuing the adjournment debate on governments policy statement. When the Parliament is prorogued, the questions and motions that have not been considered by the Parliament until then are abolished, and the Members of Parliament thus have to take it up again in accordance with the Standing Orders. In addition, all other committees except the Liaison Committee of Parliament, Committee on High Posts, Select Committees and Sectoral Oversight Committees, should be re-constituted following the beginning of the new session. The first session of the Ninth Parliament was held from 20 August 2020 to 12 December 2021, and the second session from 18 January 2022 to 28 July 2022. The third session of the Ninth Parliament was held from 03 August 2022 to 27 January 2023. By the time the session ended midnight on 26 January, the Parliament had met for 106 days.",

        "content": "The Ukraine-born winner of the Miss Japan beauty pageant has given up her crown after a tabloid report revealed her affair with a married man. Karolina Shiino, 26, was crowned Miss Japan two weeks ago but her win sparked public debate due to her heritage. While some welcomed the naturalised citizens crowning, others said she didnt represent traditional Japanese beauty ideals. Amid the furore, a local magazine published an expose alleging an affair. The article in the Shukan Bunshun reported that Ms Shiino had engaged in a relationship with a married influencer and doctor. The man has not provided any public comment. In its initial response to the report last week, the pageant organisers defended Ms Shiino, saying she hadnt known the man was married. However on Monday, organisers said she had confessed to knowing about the mans marriage and family. She had apologised for being misleading and organisers had accepted her title resignation, the Miss Japan Association said. Ms Shiino also apologised to her fans and the general public in a statement on Monday, where she said she had acted out of fear and panic in response to the report. I am truly sorry for the huge trouble I have caused and for betraying those who supported me, she said. The Miss Japan title will now remain vacant for the rest of the year, although there were several runner-ups. The competition had crowned Ms Shiino on 22 January - the first person of European descent to be given the honour. She was born in Ukraine before moving with her mother to Japan when she was five and taking on her step-fathers Japanese last name. She speaks and writes fluent Japanese and became a naturalised citizen in 2022. Upon receiving the title, she had said in her speech: I had not been accepted as Japanese many times, but I am filled with gratitude to have been recognized as Japanese today.

He further emphasised that President Wickremesinghes reappointment is essential in order for Sri Lanka to further develop, and fully recover from the worst economic crisis the country has seen since independence in 1948. Other people can also try contesting, but the way I see it, this President needs another chance if we are to save the country, because he saved this country from bankruptcy in such a short term, probably the shortest period in which such a change has been made by a president. Yes, people are facing difficulties, but when a patient is on his deathbed, bitter medicine and difficult procedures must be given. It is painful and difficult, but it works, and thats what Sri Lanka is like too. Thus, we have hope. So far, the Presidents medicine has turned our country towards betterment, we have now moved from the ICU to a normal room, but the people also have the power to put this patient back in the ICU and kill it, the Minister opined.",

Accordingly, he had submitted his letter of resignation as the Minister of Environment to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has accepted the resignation. The former Health Minister was remanded on 03 February, following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on 02 February, in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Later that day he was admitted to the Prison Hospital on medical recommendation. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand. In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. After the human immunoglobulin scandal came to light, Rambukwella was stripped of health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to import 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell since the countrys annual requirement of cashew nuts in shell has not been met due to the fact that the crops have not been harvested as expected in the last season. Joining the Cabinet press conference held in Colombo today (06), Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that the countrys annual requirement of cashew nuts in shell is around 25,000 Metric Tonnes. However, currently only 12,500 tonnes of cashew nuts can be procured locally and the cashew industry in the country is facing a very unfortunate situation as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season, according to the Minister. Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation to import a maximum of 15,000 tonnes of cashew nuts in shell for this year and then to import a quantity determined by a committee consisting of senior officials of the relevant ministries during the period from December to April when the local cashew harvest is not available in the next 4 years.",

        "title": "Gazette issued confirming Keheliyas resignation from minister post",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 04:44 pm",
        "content": "A gazette notification has been published, confirming the resignation of Keheliya Rambukwella as the Environment Minister. He was arrested last week in connection with the substandard human immunoglobulin procurement scandal. Earlier today, reports revealed that the former health minister had tendered his resignation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who in return, had accepted it. The SLPP parliamentarian was arrested on February 02 after he arrived at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement. He was reportedly interrogated for nearly 10 hours before being placed under arrest. The following day, Rambukwella was remanded until February 15 and admitted to the Prison Hospital house later. During the court proceedings that day, the prosecution told the Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process. The magistrate also heard that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former health minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases for a list of certain medicinal drugs. The former health ministers arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who have been protesting time after time against the law enforcement authorities failure to put him behind bars. Prior to Rambukwellas apprehension, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand. In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Soon after the human immunoglobulin scandal became a hot topic, Rambukwella was stripped of the health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October 2023. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was thus appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries.",
