        "title": "UK to ban American Bully XL dogs",
        "date": "September 18, 2023 10:13 am",
        "content": "There will not be a cull of American bully XLs, the UKs chief veterinary officer has said, after Rishi Sunak announced the dogs will be banned. Christine Middlemiss said, instead there will be an amnesty, where owners will have to register their dogs and take actions including a muzzle in public. The UK prime minister announced the ban on Friday after the death of a man following a suspected attack. Many have welcomed the move but others say a breed-specific ban will not work. A 52-year-old man, named as Ian Price, died after suffering multiple injuries in an attack by two suspected American bully XLs near Walsall on Thursday. A 30-year-old man arrested in connection with his death has been released on conditional bail, police said. Prof Middlemiss told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: There will be an amnesty. So people that already have these dogs - and some of them will be well socialised, well managed, well trained - you will need to register and take certain actions. Your dog will need to be neutered. It will need to be muzzled when out in public and on a lead and insured. But if you comply with these actions, and that means well know where these dogs are, which will be a massive benefit, then yes, absolutely you will be able to keep your dog. Mr Sunak said on Friday that the dogs were a danger to our communities and would be banned by the end of the year. But environment minister Mark Spencer, whose department has responsibility for adding dogs to the banned list, said it will take a while to ban the dogs. Were going to have to go through the process of identifying the characteristics of that dog, of that type of dog, and make sure that we dont encapsulate the wrong sort of dog in that process, he told BBC Radio 4s Any Questions?. So its going to take a while, but we are, you know, were committed to doing it. And well try and get that that balance right between getting rid of those nasty dogs with the horrible characteristics, but protecting peoples pets. Mr Sunak said he was ordering work from police and experts to legally define the breed so it can then be banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: There has been a clear case for banning them for a long time. What I say to the government is good, get on with it, and the sooner we can do this the better. The XL is the largest type of the American bully dog and can weigh more than nine stone (60kg). However, it is not recognised by the main British dog associations, such as the Royal Kennel Club. The type has been involved in several high-profile attacks. A 60-year-old man was arrested earlier this week after an 11-year-old Ana Paun was attacked by an American XL bully and Staffordshire bullterrier cross in Birmingham on Saturday. Two men who went to her aid were also injured and needed hospital treatment. That attack sparked a debate on whether the type of dog should be prohibited, with Home Secretary Suella Braverman saying she was taking urgent advice on the matter. Four-year-old Luna-Ann, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, needed 40 stitches and plastic surgery after she was bitten in the face by what her mother believes was American bulldog crossed with an bully XL at a neighbours house in April. Her mother Amy, 32, said told BBC Breakfast that she wanted the ban, but if that did not happen then at the very least they should all be muzzled and a licence put in place. However, some owners and animal groups argued a breed-specific ban was not the solution. Sophie Coulthard, owner of bully XL dog Billy, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that it was wrong to put any blame towards the dog instead of the circumstances, saying more responsibility should be on the owner. There are many people just like me who have a bully breed and their dog is exactly what the dog should be. A family pet - a well-trained, well-socialised, well-behaved animal that fits into their family life, and people are devastated, she said. The Dog Control Coalition - a group which includes the RSPCA, Battersea Dogs Home and the Royal Kennel Club - said: The biggest priority for everyone involved is to protect the public - but banning the breed will sadly not stop these types of incidents recurring. The groups statement said the Dangerous Dogs Act had in fact coincided with an increase in dog bites and the recent deaths show that this approach isnt working. The government must tackle unscrupulous breeders, who are putting profit before welfare, and the irresponsible owners whose dogs are dangerously out of control, a spokeswoman said, adding the coalition was deeply concerned about the lack of data behind this decision. Police are recording more offences in which an out-of-control dog causes injury, with a BBC investigation in March finding that almost 22,000 such offences were recorded in 2022. A 34 increase from 16,000 in 2018. Any ban would have to come via the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A government source told the BBC the department had already been working on plans to outlaw the type of dog. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy has brought ashore 03 distressed fishermen who were aboard a local fishing trawler, which had capsized after drifting into Indian waters north of Sri Lanka. The fishermen were rescued by a Merchant Vessel before the Sri Lanka Navy brought them ashore, through the coordination of the Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre (MRCC) Colombo yesterday (Sep 17). The distressed trawler OFRP-A-1604 TLE had been at sea for a routine fishing expedition, having left from Hambantota on 02nd September and unfortunately capsized after drifting towards Indian waters, as a result of mechanical failure. Meanwhile, MV INTERSEA VOYAGER passing through the sea area has spotted the distress and disseminated it to MRCC Chennai which in response had directed the Merchant Vessel to save the fishermen of the distressed fishing vessel. Subsequently, MRCC Colombo was alerted about the incident, according to the Navy. Coordinated by MRCC Colombo, MV INTERSEA VOYAGER brought the fishermen off Hambantota Harbour and the Sri Lanka Navy sent out the Fast Attack Craft P 421 belonging to the 4th Fast Attack Flotilla to bring ashore the fishermen carried by MV INTERSEA VOYAGER. Upon being brought ashore, the fishermen were rushed to the District General Hospital, Hambantota for medical attention, the Navy said.",

        "date": "September 18, 2023 11:58 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message on the birth anniversary of the late President J. R. Jayawardene said if Sri Lanka had been able to sustain the socio-economic reforms initiated by Jayawardene in 1977, the nation would be a developed country today. President Wickremesinghe conveyed this sentiment on the occasion of Mr. Jayawardenes 117th birth anniversary, while he is currently on an official visit to the United States of America to attend the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported During the late Presidents birth anniversary commemoration held today at the Jayawardene Center in Colombo 07, former speaker Karu Jayasuriya delivered the keynote address. The Presidents message was presented by Mrs. Chamika Mummullage, Senior Assistant Secretary to the President, highlighting J. R. Jayawardenes revolutionary impact on the nations socio-economic landscape. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that challenges such as riots, terrorism and a failure to fully grasp the philosophy hindered the complete success of these reforms. He also noted that neighbouring countries like India, China and Vietnam, which transitioned from closed and socialist economic practices, studied Mr. Jayawardenes approach and prospered by adapting their policies to the changing times, the PMD said. J. R. Jayawardene embarked on his political journey in 1938 as an active member of the Sri Lanka Congress Party. In 1946, he switched his allegiance to the United National Party and assumed the role of Finance Minister in Sri Lankas inaugural cabinet. Following the passing of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake in 1973, J. R. Jayawardena assumed leadership of the United National Party. In the 1977 elections, J. R. Jayawardena was elected as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. During his tenure, he introduced the executive presidential system through a national constitution. In 1978, he became the first Executive President and relocated to Jayewardenepura, the legislative capital of Colombo. He dedicated his life to advancing social justice, promoting culture, and education and fostering economic development in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, late President Jayawardenes political and economic reforms played a pivotal role in modernizing Sri Lankas social system, transforming it into a modern state, President Wickremesinghe said further, adding that his significant contributions extended beyond national borders as he served as the sixth Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, leaving an indelible mark on the international stage. Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said; As an impartial observer, I am delighted to partake in this occasion today. J.R. firmly believed in the privatization of financially struggling public institutions, a vision championed by Mr. Jayawardena. He also advocated for the reevaluation of these institutions. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of collaboration between government and private entities to create job opportunities for the nations youth, a model exemplified by Chinas economic success through such joint ventures. At certain junctures, the executive presidential system had the authority to appoint and dismiss leaders of the nation. Mr. Jayawardena was known for his resolute decision-making, rarely altering his choices unless compelled by populist pressures. The Japanese people hold Mr. Jayawardena in high esteem, as he once represented Japan on the international stage. His leadership during his tenure fostered a cadre of talented young individuals, empowering them to contribute to the countrys progress. Moreover, Mr. Jayawardena significantly advanced the education sector in Sri Lanka, showcasing exemplary leadership qualities that serve as a model for contemporary political leaders. Despite his dedicated service to the people, JR remained humble, eschewing personal fame. He was also the architect of the Colombo Plan, a testament to his visionary leadership. During his tenure, Sri Lanka achieved notable milestones in healthcare, transportation and infrastructure development, including the establishment of hydroelectric power plants. His adept diplomacy with foreign nations greatly benefited the country, fostering stronger trade relations worldwide, particularly through the Colombo Plan. JR is remembered as a prominent leader and we pay our respects to Mr. Jayawardena for his remarkable contributions to our nation. The Governing Board Member of the JR Jayawardena Center, his senior grandson Mr. Pradeep Jayawardena; This commemorative ceremony is taking place today during a challenging period in the country, as we actively seek solutions to the ongoing crisis. Some segments of our society attribute the current situation to the executive presidential system. However, its worth noting that, with the exception of one administration, all previous governments successfully completed their terms due to the executive presidential system. This system played a pivotal role in bringing an end to the northern conflict and maintaining stability in the country. The present government has demonstrated its commitment to addressing numerous challenges facing our nation. We commend President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his resolute decisions in this regard. We wholeheartedly endorse President Ranil Wickremesinghes agenda for nation-building. As he holds executive authority, it is imperative that the President receives the support of all citizens to propel our country forward. This event was attended by esteemed individuals including Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Minister Bandula Gunawardena. Sabaragamuwa Provincial Governor Naveen Dissanayake, Member of Parliament Tissa Attanayake, Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, UNP Policy and Research Committee Chairman Karunasena Kodithuvakku, JR Jayawardenas grandson Rukshan Jayawardena, Amrik Jayawardena, Presidential Liaison Secretary A. P. Dayaratne, Senior Professor U. G. Puswewala and members of the Jayawardena Center, as well as family members and other distinguished attendees, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "September 18, 2023 12:35 pm",
        "content": "Australias government said Monday the online dating industry must improve safety standards or be forced to make changes through legislation, responding to research that says three-in-four Australian users suffer some form of sexual violence through the platforms. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said popular dating companies such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge have until June 30 to develop a voluntary code of conduct that addresses user safety concerns. The code could include improving engagement with law enforcement, supporting at-risk users, improving safety policies and practices, and providing greater transparency about harms, she said. But, Rowland added, if the safety standards are not sufficiently improved, the government will use regulation and legislation to force change. What we want to do in this sector is not stifle innovation, but balance the harms, she told reporters. The government is responding to Australian Institute of Criminology research published last year that found three-in-four users of dating apps or websites had experienced some form of sexual violence through these platforms in the five years through 2021. Online dating is actually the most popular way for Australians to meet new people and to form new relationships, Rowland said. The government is concerned about rates of sexual harassment, abusive and threatening language, unsolicited sexual images and violence facilitated by these platforms, she added. The Australian Information Industry Association, which represents the information and communications technology industry in Australia but not the online dating sector, welcomed the governments approach as very measured. Thats the way the government should regulate technology, the associations chief executive, Simon Bush, said. Point out where theres an issue, get the industry together and get the industry to look to see if they can resolve these issues first before pulling the regulatory trigger. Bumble declined to comment. Tinder and Hinge did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kath Albury, an online dating researcher at Melbournes Swinburne University of Technology, said safety improvements could include a clearer sense of how quickly a user could expect feedback after reporting an unwanted or threatening contact. One of the things that dating app users are concerned about is the sense that complaints go into the void or theres a response that feels automated or not personal responsive in a time when theyre feeling quite unsafe or distressed, Albury told Australian Broadcasting Corp.

        "title": "Ongoing abuses undercut purported goals of truth and reconciliation commission: HRW",
        "date": "September 18, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments ongoing abuses are undermining the purported goals of its newly proposed truth and reconciliation commission, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says. This was mentioned in a 39-page report published today (Sept. 18), titled We Raise Our Voice They Arrest Us: Sri Lankas Proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The New York-based human rights watchdog notes that the victims of past violations, their families, and human rights defenders have rejected the governments initiative because the government has not consulted them, ignores evidence gathered by past commissions, and it exposes them to security force abuses and re-traumatisation if they participate. According to HRW, the report has documented abusive security force surveillance and intimidation of activists and campaigners from minority Tamil families of those who disappeared during Sri Lankas civil war. The rights group accused the Sri Lankan authorities of using draconian counterterrorism laws to silence dissenting voices, including those calling for truth and accountability, while government-backed land grabs target Tamil and Muslim communities and their places of worship. Sri Lanka profoundly needs truth and accountability, but a credible process requires the support of victims families and an end to government abuses against them and their communities, said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW. She emphasized that the latest commission is seemingly aimed at deflecting international pressure over continuing impunity, rather than revealing the face of the disappeared or bringing those responsible to justice. HRW said its report is based on over 80 interviews in Sri Lanka in June 2023, with relatives of victims of enforced disappearance, other victims of abuses, human rights defenders, activists, and journalists in Sri Lankas predominantly Tamil north and east. Although President Wickremesinghe announced in June 2023 that he intended to pass legislation to establish the commission by August, and told parliament that the Truth Seeking Mechanism has been established and a Director has been appointed, the human rights watchdogs report says the Sri Lankan government has yet to publish the details about the new National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (commonly referred to as a truth and reconciliation commission or TRC). With regard to local authorities seeking the support of foreign governments including South Africa, Switzerland and Japan, as well as UN agencies, HRW said, President Ranil Wickremesinghes office hopes the initiative will convince governments that there is no need for further scrutiny by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which has established an expert team to collect evidence of international crimes committed in Sri Lanka for use in future prosecutions. The HRW is deeply concerned that the governments targeting of those campaigning for justice undermines the credibility of the latest initiative. It also drew attention to the joint statements issued by civil society organizations and victims groups, making it clear that while a process to deliver truth and justice is urgently needed, the current initiative lacks credibility and risks further harm to victims and their families. International law obligates governments to prosecute those responsible for war crimes and other serious international crimes by all sides. Failing to do so fuels further rights violations and undermines prospects for a durable peace. HRW also referred to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türks remarks in a report on Sri Lanka to the Human Rights Council dated September 00, that for any transitional justice process to succeed, truth-seeking alone will not suffice. It must also be accompanied by a clear commitment to accountability and the political will to implement far-reaching change. The rights group said the Sri Lankan government should make progress toward achieving credible justice by genuinely engaging with victims and affected communities. It recommended that the government build on the evidence collected and recommendations made by past commissions. It should support a fair, credible investigation and prosecution of international crimes; immediately end ongoing abuses against past victims, their families, and human rights defenders and activists; and order state agencies to halt land grabs targeting minority communities. HRW urged foreign governments, including South Africa, Switzerland, and Japan, not to finance or otherwise endorse a truth and reconciliation commission that victims reject and puts them at risk. International partners, including the European Union, should continue to press the government to meet its commitments to end violations committed using counterterrorism laws, it said further. President Wickremesinghe promotes reconciliation while his government threatens the victims of past abuses and their families and minority communities, Ganguly added. Instead of creating yet another commission to give the appearance of progress, the government should take steps to gain credibility for a genuine truth and justice process that Sri Lanka desperately needs.",

        "date": "September 18, 2023 01:47 pm",
        "content": "A woman who claims she was tricked into having sex without a condom with a Sri Lankan cricketer has told a court there were moments during intercourse she feared for her life. Danushka Gunathilaka is facing a judge-alone trial at the Downing Centre District Court after pleading not guilty to one charge of sexual assault without consent. The international cricket player walked into the court complex holding hands with a blonde woman, who is not the complainant, ahead of the expected four-day trial in front of Judge Sarah Huggett on Monday morning. He is facing trial over an incident on November 2 last year, where Crown Prosecutor Gabrielle Steedman told the court the 32-year-old met up with a woman at Sydneys Opera Bar after matching on Tinder. At the time, the batsman was in Australia to play in the T20 World Cup. It is not in dispute that the pair had chatted several times through Tinder, Instagram and video called on WhatsApp from October 31 before their meeting three days later. CCTV footage played to the court shows the pair hugging as they meet at Opera Bar, with further footage showing the pair kissing while waiting for a ferry back to the womans home. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence via AVL on Monday where she told the court the kiss was forceful and that it didnt feel nice. They returned to the womans home in the eastern suburbs about 11pm when the alleged sexual assault occurred, the court was told. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence via AVL on Monday morning where she told the court she poured herself and Mr Gunathilaka a glass of wine before he began kissing her on her couch quite forcefully. He was on top of me, I remember him kissing me quite forcefully, the woman said. I remember asking him can we please take this slow, because things were moving quite quickly and I wasnt comfortable. I remember him looking me in the eye as I said that and not saying anything in response. The woman told the court the pair moved to her bedroom where she asked Mr Gunathilaka to use a condom but he said he didnt want to because he didnt like them. She told him she wanted to use a condom because she didnt want to get pregnant or a sexually transmitted disease. He said dont worry I wont get you pregnant darling, dont you trust me?, the woman said. I remember him saying that he hated them, he said something like I hate using condoms I dont like them, it doesnt feel good you should trust me. The woman said Mr Gunathilaka hesitated before putting the condom on, which made the woman become uncomfortable. Ms Steedman, in her earlier opening address, told the court the intercourse lasted for about 15 minutes and was quite rough. During her evidence, the woman said there were multiple times she feared for her life. I remember that Danny choked me and he put one hand on my neck and the other hand was on the bed and he choked me for 20-30 seconds, the woman said. She told the court the choking happened at least three times and at one point her breath was really constricted and tried removing his hands. The woman said she noticed Mr Gunathilaka had been smirking while he was choking her. The woman told the court at points during the encounter Mr Gunathilaka had the weight of his body on her, which made her feel trapped and powerless. I felt at that point, fearful for my life, because I couldnt get away and I really wanted it to stop, she said. Mr Gunathilaka then stood up from the bed, where the woman realised the condom was on the ground and he hadnt been wearing it. In her opening address, Ms Steedman said the alleged victim was shocked and didnt feel safe about saying anything for what she says was fear of retribution. During her evidence, the woman said she felt too afraid to continue to ask him to use a condom. The main issue in the trial is Mr Gunathilakas state of mind as to whether or not he removed the condom without the womans knowledge, which is known as stealthing. Ms Steedman told the court the woman had consented to protected sex. The court was told the woman called Mr Gunathilaka a taxi about 12.45am, and after he left she began to feel frozen and in shock. I remember being very aware of what was happening but my body felt really frozen, the woman said. In the days following, the woman felt overwhelmingly anxious and began crying uncontrollably in public. She told the court: A sense of feeling like I had been violated and sexually assaulted and realising also after speaking to a counsellor...that I realised again that the reason for me at times not being able to voice my non-consent was due to overwhelming fear. The court was told the woman later told friends she wasnt sure what happened but she thought it was something bad. Mr Gunathilakas barrister, Murugan Thangaraj SC, told the judge the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client removed the condom against the womans will. In his brief opening address, Mr Thangaraj said the cricketer is a man of excellent character was cooperative with police. He argued the complainants evidence was not credible and in order to prove the case, the judge would need to accept the woman as a credible witness. Mr Thangaraj said in the womans first conversations with friends she said she was unsure if Mr Gunathilaka removed the condom, but she had a feeling he did. He told the court it was only when the woman spoke to police that her version of the story crystallised. The trial continues before Judge Huggett. Source: news.com.au",

        "date": "September 18, 2023 03:32 pm",
        "content": "More than 10 of Japans population is now age 80 or older, the government said Monday, the latest worrying milestone in the rapidly graying countrys demographic crisis. According to figures released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the proportion of Japans elderly, defined as age 65 and above, is also at a record high, comprising 29.1 of the population  the highest rate in the world. The ministry released the figures to mark Respect for the Aged Day, a public holiday in the country, which also faces a plummeting birth rate and shrinking workforce that could impact funding for pensions and health care as demand from the aging population surges. Japans population has been in steady decline since its economic boom of the 1980s, with a fertility rate of 1.3  far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration. Deaths have outpaced births in Japan for more than a decade, posing a growing problem for leaders of the worlds third-largest economy. The country also has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, contributing to the ballooning elderly population. To cope with the growing labor shortage and in the hopes of reinvigorating a stalling economy, the Japanese government has encouraged more seniors and stay-at-home mothers to re-enter the workforce in the past decade. To some extent, that messaging has worked: there are now a record 9.12 million elderly workers in Japan, a number that has grown for 19 consecutive years. Workers age 65 and up now make up more than 13 of the national workforce, the internal affairs ministry said Monday. Japans elderly employment rate is among the highest across major economies, it added. But even encouraging elderly workers isnt enough to offset the social and economic impacts of the demographic crisis, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning in January that Japan is on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions. He added that child-rearing support was the governments most important policy, and solving the issue simply cannot wait any longer. Nearby, China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan are experiencing similar crises, struggling to encourage young people to have more children, in the face of rising living costs and social discontent.

Speaking at a press conference held at the Department of Government Information (DGI) today (18), the state minister emphasized that 36 ragging incidents have been reported within the last 12 months, while 57 students in connection with the incidents have been suspended. We held discussions for about 8 months and formed a new National Anti-Ragging Committee by looking at several angles including social, structural, political and management. The government can make laws and establish structural institutions by utilising all available resources. But the final responsibility lies with university lecturers and vice-chancellors, State Minister Raghavan claimed. Furthermore, he revealed that there is sufficient evidence proving that the political parties and supporters, who have embraced acts of violence as their principle and ideology, are still carrying out acts of ragging within universities. Raghavan also expressed that the President, Prime Minister and also the Minister of Education are committed to bringing a stop to this uncivilized system.",

Meanwhile, the police also stated that detention orders have been obtained to hold them for a period of 90 days for questioning. The organized criminal gang leader known as Harak Kata, had reportedly attempted to flee from the custody of the CID on September 10. According to the CID, Harak Kata had been aided by a certain Police Constable, who had fled soon after the incident. Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with aid of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom, the CID reported, and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  the Constable, and another Sub-Inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed, and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene of the incident upon hearing the commotion, and detained Harak Kata in their custody, while the missing Police Constable had reportedly fled the scene during this altercation.",

The General Assemblys president is convening heads of state and government for the SDG Summit on September 18 and 19 at UN headquarters in New York during the UNGA high-level week. With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at midpoint, world leaders are expected to carry out a comprehensive review of the state of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), respond to the impact of multiple and interlocking crises facing the world, and provide high-level political guidance on transformative and accelerated actions towards the target year of 2030. UN says for the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects. Thus, the SDG Summit serves as a rallying cry to recharge momentum, for world leaders to come together, to reflect on where we stand and resolve to do more. The SDG Summit is the centerpiece of the high-level week of the General Assembly. It will respond to the impact of multiple and interlocking crises facing the world and is expected to reignite a sense of hope, optimism, and enthusiasm for the 2030 Agenda. Through the Summit, countries, both individually and collectively, have an opportunity to place the world on a sustainable development path. UN says the international community can seize this opportunity to make significant transformations for integrated SDG implementation and how societies produce, consume and share benefits and risks, while leaving no one behind. The Summit is envisaged to be forward-looking and action-oriented, with the aim of accelerating international action to improve peoples lives and reinvigorating the sense of hope, optimism and enthusiasm that characterized the adoption of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.

        "content": "The President of the World Bank, Ajay Banga on Monday (Sept. 18) commended Sri Lankas commitment to reforms, emphasizing the importance of credibility in the countrys approach. During a cordial meeting with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr. Banga assured that the World Bank is actively involved in advisory work and encouraged the island nation to rely on their support. The Sri Lankan delegation, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, engaged in high-level discussions with the World Banks president and other officials at the World Bank Headquarters (UNHQ). The meeting has focused on a range of critical topics, including economic reforms, agriculture, tourism, and digitization. The World Bank chief also praised Sri Lankas focus on tourism, highlighting its job creation potential. He mentioned discussions about ports and trade and offered assistance in digitization, renewable energy and education. Mr. Banga also mentioned potential collaboration on power grid connectivity with India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal. These are topics we understand well. When I was in India we discussed the power interconnection idea and I was told that ADB is already working on this and we have connected up with ADB and if there is any way we could be helpful with India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, connecting up their power grids, it will be to your benefit in the short term and also once you produce more energy, for your long term as well. I know ADB is there working with you, but you should know we are there if you need us. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe expressed gratitude for the vital financial support provided by the World Bank during challenging times, stating, The money was available at least for the basics and that helped us tide through the most difficult months. Now its a matter of finalizing the debt restructuring and moving on from there. He emphasized the need for fast and sustained economic growth. Regarding economic sectors, the Sri Lankan leader highlighted the immediate focus on tourism, food security and agricultural modernization. So, now we are planning it and the first is the total package of economic reforms that have to be done. We will not have this window of opportunity. Crisis gives you a window of opportunity and we will not have that again. So we will drive that as far as possible. And then focus immediately on the different sectors. We are starting with tourism, which is the lowest-hanging fruit. Then, food security and agricultural modernization. These two would be the ones that we start with. Thereafter, we will be going into the other areas, the traditional exports. Agriculture would mean modernization and the whole gamut of things. With regard to the education and technology sectors, President Wickremesinghe expressed his desire for additional technological universities and renewable energy development, which would significantly impact the northern region of Sri Lanka. He also mentioned plans for a climate change university. Further, President Wickremesinghe elaborated on the expansion of Colombos port and the benefits of transshipment, creating a significant cargo hub. He discussed the potential for industrialization in South India and Sri Lankas plans to phase out certain subsidies while providing grants to universities and students. The conversation further explored the significance of digitization, with Mr. Banga emphasizing transparency and trust-building through the digitization of governance. He also suggested the adoption of a school system digitization model he witnessed in India. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry highlighted the importance of agriculture in Sri Lankas workforce and the need for increased productivity. Agriculture is high on the Presidents agenda because 27 of the workforce is in agriculture but they only contribute 8.7 to the GDP. So, we need to uplift that standard in terms of yield and productivity and value-added manufacturing. President Wickremesinghe mentioned upcoming bills focused on womens rights, gender equality and violence against women. World Bank president commended the Sri Lankan leaders vision, particularly his focus on job creation for the younger generation and improving quality of life. He assured the World Banks commitment to supporting these goals in alignment with Sri Lankas plans. President Wickremesinghe also invited Mr. Banga to visit Sri Lanka, to which he responded positively. The meeting between President Wickremesinghe and World Bank President Banga underscored the importance of collaboration and reforms for Sri Lankas economic growth and development.",

        "content": "State Minister of Highways Siripala Gamlath says the government has initiated plans to resume construction of Sri Lankas halted road system. Funding will be allocated in the upcoming budget, ensuring swift completion and delivery to the public, he commented further during a news conference at the Presidential Media Centre on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country on Monday (Sept. 18). He underscored that a robust road network is pivotal for a manufacturing economy and enhancing peoples quality of life, necessitating strategic road widening efforts without relying on foreign funding. Further expressing his views, the state minister said: When I took office as State Minister, most of the countrys highway projects had come to a standstill, with significant outstanding payments to contractors totaling approximately Rs.180 billion, equivalent to less than a years road project budget. Weve already disbursed Rs.151 billion, with Rs. 29 billion left to pay, encouraging some contractors to restart projects. Additionally, weve settled a substantial backlog of unpaid arrears accumulated over several years. Our focus in road development is on projects managed by the Road Development Authority, encompassing 12,225 kilometers of roads, 312 kilometers of highways, 5,432 bridges, 12 flyovers, boats and 9 bridge ferries annually. A robust road network is pivotal for a manufacturing economy and enhancing peoples quality of life, necessitating strategic road widening efforts without relying on foreign funding. Substantial annual investments are also directed toward maintaining small bridges and highways. Highways are indispensable for the country, although the dollar issue impacted the Central Expressways construction. The Mirigama-Kurunegala road is now completed and work on the initial 13 kilometers of the Potuhera-Galagedara road, spanning 31 kilometers, is progressing as planned. In 2019, the critical port access route project began, financed by the Asian Development Bank, featuring a special road running from the New Kelani Bridge to Galle Face. This initiative aims to alleviate traffic congestion in busy areas like Colombo Fort and Harbour, with plans to transfer the port entrance flyover into public ownership by 2024. In tandem with the national road system construction, significant progress has been made, with 85 completion of the Kohuwala flyover and 35 of the Peradeniya flyover, supported by a Hungarian loan. Out of the 13,160 roads targeted for construction, 5,201 are already completed. The comprehensive project envisions constructing approximately 17,850 kilometers of roads, with an estimated budget of Rs.231 billion. Of this, Rs.160 billion has already been disbursed for completed projects, leaving Rs. 70 billion pending. Plans include allocating funds in the upcoming budget to maintain existing roads and resume stalled projects, suggesting a promising outlook for timely completion.",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 10:07 am",
        "content": "At least 24 people have been killed after a bus in Peru veered off a mountainous road and plunged down a slope. The bus had been travelling north from Ayacucho in the south-central part of the country to Huancayo, the capital of the Junin region, when it crashed around 1:30am local time (06:30 GMT) on Monday. Local media reported that the bus flipped several times as it tumbled down the rugged mountain terrain in the area of Huancavelica. Manuel Zevallos Pacheco, the mayor of the Anco district, told the news outlet RPP that the bus fell at least 150 metres (492 feet). The regional government of Ayacucho reported that it had attended to 11 injured passengers at the Huanta Support Hospital. The newspaper La Republica estimated that as many as 36 people could be wounded. Perus transportation authority, SUTRAN, issued a statement on Monday offering condolences for the dead and pledging to probe what happened. It added that, according to preliminary investigations, the bus had the proper authorisation to transport passengers: It had its mandatory accident insurance and had passed a vehicle inspection. At this time, SUTRAN is continuing its investigations, as established within the framework of its powers, the agency wrote, underscoring its commitment to supervising compliance with federal regulations. The company that operates the bus route, Molina Union, confirmed the death toll to the Reuters news agency on Monday but declined to offer further details. Mondays crash is the latest deadly incident on Perus roadways, many of which have been built on the steep terrain of the Andes Mountains. In January, a bus carrying 60 passengers dove off a cliff in northern Peru, killing at least 24 passengers, according to preliminary reports. In 2021, a string of crashes occurred within a span of four days, including two involving buses. One plunged into a ravine in the countrys southeast, while another toppled off a cliff some 60km (37 miles) from the capital Lima. Authorities investigating the latter said recklessness and high speed were contributing factors. Experts also have questioned whether the bus drivers navigating these winding mountain roads received proper training. Meanwhile, in an interview with RPP, Mayor Zevallos Pacheco expressed frustration with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, which he accused of not looking into a recent avalanche that took place on the same roadway where Mondays crash took place. Practically as a result of this, we have an accident, he told RPP. The news outlet reported that traffic accidents have increased in Peru in recent years, with injuries climbing from 38,447 in 2020 to 53,544 last year. Traffic-related deaths also rose to 3,311 for 2022. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

Transparency and efficiency in approving foreign direct investment (FDI) have been emphasized as key drivers of domestic economic growth and foreign investment attraction. The United States underscored the importance of adopting robust anti-corruption measures and Sri Lanka provided updates on its proposed anticorruption legislation, seeking technical assistance and training from the U.S. government. The Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to workers rights was also highlighted and Sri Lanka outlined its ongoing labour law reform efforts. The United States stressed the importance of consulting relevant stakeholders and ensuring public review and comment in the process. Sri Lanka detailed its procedures for labour law reforms, with the United States expressing readiness to support these efforts. Both nations discussed the reduction of agricultural trade barriers to enhance food security in Sri Lanka. The United States advocated for greater market access for its exports of agricultural products, including animal feed. Biotechnologys role in sustainable agriculture and food security was also explored. Intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement were affirmed as crucial for bilateral trade and innovation. Sri Lanka shared updates on its IP legislative reforms and the United States offered capacity building support. The meeting concluded with both governments committing to making sustained progress on trade issues, looking ahead to the next TIFA Council Meeting scheduled for 2024. The fourteenth TIFA Council Meeting served as a testament to the United States and Sri Lankas dedication to strengthening their economic ties and fostering mutual prosperity.",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 10:44 am",
        "content": "MP Uddika Premaratne has claimed that the existing system within the country was the reason behind the recent shooting that targeted him. Speaking in Parliament in this regard today (19 Sep.), MP Premaratne said that while he believed the system was the cause behind the recent shooting outside his residence, it is also the reason why the country is in the state it is today. Rather than who committed the shooting, I think the existing system is why that attack was made. We all know this system is not right. The people of our country know that this system is wrong. Our social system is wrong, our politics are wrong. It is because of this blemish that the country is in the state it is today, he said in Parliament. At around 10:35 p.m. on Sunday (Sept. 17), a group of unidentified gunmen had opened fire at the Premaratnes car soon after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura. The parliamentarian had managed to escape unharmed. The perpetrators, who had arrived in a car, had targeted the parliamentarian who was walking towards the house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratnes car was damaged in the shooting incident for which the gunmen were believed to have used a pistol. Anuradhapura police initiated investigations soon after the incident was reported and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were deployed to beef up the security near the MPs house. Later, investigations into the matter were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",

        "title": "Five US citizens jailed in Iran freed in USD 6bn prisoner swap deal",
        "date": "September 19, 2023 11:04 am",
        "content": "Five Americans jailed for years in Iran and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to the United States. The last pieces in a controversial swap mediated by Qatar fell into place when 6bn (4.8bn) of Iranian funds held in South Korea reached banks in Doha. It triggered the departure of the four men and one woman in Tehran, who are also Iranian citizens, on a chartered flight to Qatars capital. They were met by senior US officials and are now on their way to Washington. The Americans include 51-year-old businessman Siamak Namazi, who has spent nearly eight years in Tehrans notorious Evin prison, as well as businessman Emad Shargi, 59, and environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, 67, who also holds British nationality. The US has said its citizens were imprisoned on baseless charges for political leverage. In the first indication a deal was reached, they were moved in mid-August from Evin to a safe house in Tehran. Five Iranians imprisoned in US jails, mainly on charges of violating US sanctions, are also being granted clemency as part of this swap. Not all of them are expected to return to Iran. They have been named by Iran as Reza Sarhangpour, Kambiz Attar Kashani, Kaveh Lotfolah Afrasiabi, Mehrdad Moein Ansari and Amin Hasanzadeh. Today, five innocent Americans who were imprisoned in Iran are finally coming home, US President Joe Biden said after their plane landed in Doha. He said all five had endured years of agony, uncertainty, and suffering. Mr Biden also announced fresh US sanctions targeting the former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Iranian ministry of intelligence for what he said was their involvement in wrongful detentions. Siamak Namazi said in a statement: I would not be free today, if it wasnt for all of you who didnt allow the world to forget me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you for being my voice when I could not speak for myself and for making sure I was heard when I mustered the strength to scream from behind the impenetrable walls of Evin Prison. He also praised President Biden for making some incredibly difficult decisions to rescue us and ultimately putting the lives of American citizens above politics. The deal comes after months of indirect talks mediated by Qatar, which began in February last year. A source said that there were at least nine rounds of discussions in Doha. Senior Qatari officials also shuttled between Tehran and Washington. I think theres a little bit of a win for both sides, Iranian-born Professor Mehran Kamrava, who now teaches at Georgetown University in Qatar, told the BBC. For Biden, heading into the election, hes bringing Americans home and for Iran, theres the release of Iranians in prison in the United States, but its that six billion dollars thats a big win. Iranian officials have repeatedly declared they will spend their money as they wish. But sources involved in this process insist these funds will be strictly controlled. No funds will go into Iran, they emphasised. Only humanitarian transactions, including food, medicine, agriculture, paid to third party vendors, transaction by transaction. Sources told the BBC this money was not part of Iranian assets frozen by sanctions. The money in South Korea, revenue from Iranian oil sales, had been available to Tehran for bilateral and non-sanctioned aid, but was not spent for various reasons including difficulties of currency conversion. Leading US Republicans have denounced the deal as a ransom payment and sanctions relief. The Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, castigated the US government for transferring funds to the worlds top state sponsor of terrorism. Who are the American prisoners?  Morad Tahbaz: Arrested in 2018 along with eight other Iranian conservationists. They had been using cameras to track critically-endangered wild Asiatic cheetahs, but were accused of spying. Denied the charge but sentenced to 10 years in prison  Siamak Namazi: Dubai-based oil executive arrested in 2015. His elderly father, Baquer, was detained the following year, after Iranian officials allowed him to visit his son. Both sentenced to 10 years in prison for co-operating with a foreign enemy, which they denied. Iran let Baquer leave for medical treatment in 2022  Emad Shargi: Detained in 2018 while working for an Iranian venture capital fund. Released on bail and later told he had been cleared of spying charges. Informed by a court in 2020 that he had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Released ahead of an appeal and reportedly detained in 2021 while trying to cross Irans western border illegally  The two others wish to remain anonymous The enormous relief that some prisoners are finally coming home is tempered by the knowledge that more may be seized in future. There are still other dual nationals behind bars in Tehran. The Iranian government has become a hostage-taking government, said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. They have been using people as pawns, and thats part of their leverage against the West. Qatar is hoping this rare co-operation will help to catalyse progress on other long-standing disputes. This includes the 2015 nuclear deal, which many regard as dead due to the decision by then-US president, Donald Trump, to withdraw five years ago. He said that Iran would continue to maintain strategic enmity with the United States for as long Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remains in power. President Biden has long been urged to bring the Americans home. Earlier this year, Siamak Namazi wrote to him from an Iranian prison. Mr Namazi, who the US said was unjustly detained, described himself as having the unenviable title of the longest held Iranian-American hostage in history. Morad Tahbaz and his family were also left feeling angry and abandoned after receiving assurances from the British government that he would return to Britain last year along with two other British-Iranians who were detained arbitrarily, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori.

        "content": "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has vowed to go to court over the new Anti-Terrorism Bill. SJB member Ashok Abeysinghe stressed that no matter how the relevant Bill is amended, the main opposition would still oppose it. He further added that although a gazette notification has been issued pertaining to the Bill, it is yet to be presented before the parliament following its most recent amendments. Once it is presented before parliament, there is a period of 14 days for us to go before the Supreme Court to challenge the Bill, he said, emphasising that, Even if the Bill is amended, we will continue to oppose it. We plan to go to courts. Further stressing his point, the SJB MP recalled that when the Anti-Terrorism Bill was initially presented to the parliament, several parties went to court to challenge the legislation, deeming it unsuitable, while many other international organisations, too, raised concerns about it. In September last year, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill prepared by the legal draftsman to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). However, the Justice Ministry later revised the original draft bill published in the government gazette and re-drafted it, after taking into account all the opinions and suggestions it received from various interested parties both locally and internationally. In September 2023, the Cabinet approval was received to publish the Bill which was revised in accordance with the suggestions and opinions received by different parties in the government gazette, and to table the bill in parliament for passing.",

        "title": "India expels Canadian diplomat in tit-for-tat move as row over assassinated Sikh activist deepens",
        "date": "September 19, 2023 01:05 pm",
        "content": "Canadas accusation that India may have been involved in the assassination of a Sikh activist on its soil has triggered a growing row with Ottawa and New Delhi both expelling senior diplomats, sending relations between the two countries plunging. The tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was investigating credible allegations linking India to the June killing of Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Over the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Trudeau said in parliament on Monday, adding his government would take all steps necessary to hold perpetrators of this murder to account. Canada said it had kicked out an Indian diplomat, who foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly described as the head of the Indian intelligence agency in the country. Today were acting by expelling a key diplomat, but we will get to the bottom of this, she told reporters in Ottawa, adding Trudeau has raised this issue with both US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Indias foreign ministry on Tuesday responded in kind, saying it had expelled a senior Canadian diplomat based in India. The concerned diplomat has been asked to leave India within the next five days, it said in a statement. The decision reflects Government of Indias growing concern at the interference of Canadian diplomats in our internal matters and their involvement in anti-India activities. Nijjar was a prominent Sikh leader in western Canada, and according to local police, he was gunned down in his truck in June by two masked gunmen outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. His death both shocked and outraged the Sikh community in Canada, one of the largest outside of India and home to more than 770,000 members of the religious minority. Nijjar was an outspoken supporter of the creation of a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, according to a statement from the World Sikh Organization, and often led peaceful protests against what the advocacy group called the violation of human rights actively taking place in India and in support of Khalistan. The Khalistan movement is outlawed in India and considered a national security threat by the government  a number of groups associated with the movement are listed as terrorist organizations under Indias Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Nijjars name appeared on the Home Ministrys list of UAPA terrorists. In 2020, the Indian National Investigation Agency accused him of trying to radicalize Sikh community across the world in favor of creation of Khalistan, adding that he had been trying to incite Sikhs to vote for secession, agitate against the Government of India and carry out violent activities. India on Tuesday said it rejected Trudeaus allegations, calling them absurd and motivated. We are a democratic polity with a strong commitment to rule of law, a statement released by the countrys foreign ministry said. Such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists, who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten Indias sovereignty and territorial integrity. The inaction of the Canadian Government on this matter has been a long-standing and continuing concern. The White House said it is deeply concerned about the allegations referenced by Prime Minister Trudeau, according to Reuters. We remain in regular contact with our Canadian partners. It is critical that Canadas investigation proceed and the perpetrators be brought to justice, it said. Canadian police have not arrested anyone in connection with Nijjars murder. But in an August update, police released a statement saying they were investigating three suspects and issued a description of a possible getaway vehicle, asking for the publics help. A spokesperson for Australian foreign minister Penny Wong said the country is also deeply concerned by the allegations. We are closely engaged with partners on developments. We have conveyed our concerns at senior levels to India, a statement shared with CNN said. We understand these reports will be particularly concerning to some Australian communities. The Indian diaspora are valued and important contributors to our vibrant and resilient multicultural society, where all Australians can peacefully and safely express their views. Souring relations Canadas allegations against the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are likely to further sour relations between the two countries. An ongoing trade deal between them has been paused, Indias commerce and trade minister said, according to local reports, adding there are certain issues which are of serious concern. The issue of activism within Canadas large Sikh diaspora has long been one of the sources of tension. When Modi hosted the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in New Delhi earlier this month, he did not hold a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau, instead meeting on the sidelines of the summit, where the Indian leader conveyed our strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada, according to a statement from the Indian government. Relations between the two leaders have been frosty for several years. When Trudeau visited India in 2018, his calendar, which was relatively light on diplomatic meetings, was seen by many as a snub from New Delhi. Analysts at the time pointed to Trudeaus perceived sympathy for Sikh activists as a particular area of contention. In 2017, the Canadian leader had been seen at a Sikh event in Toronto where separatist flags and posters depicting an extremist Sikh leader killed in a 1984 Indian Army operation were displayed. In its statement about Trudeaus allegations on Tuesday, the Indian government said: That Canadian political figures have openly expressed sympathy for such elements remains a matter of deep concern. The space given in Canada to a range of illegal activities including murders, human trafficking and organised crime is not new, the statement said. We urge the Government of Canada to take prompt and effective legal action against all anti-India elements operating from their soil. Support for Khalistan overseas The Sikh religion was founded in Punjab in the 15th Century by Guru Nanak and has about 25 million followers worldwide. They are a minority in India, comprising less than 2 of the countrys 1.4 billion people, but form a majority in the northern state of Punjab, which was once home to a large and powerful Sikh empire. The origins of the modern Khalistan movement trace back to around the time of Indias independence from Britain in 1947, when some Sikhs demanded that a nation be carved in the state of Punjab for followers of the faith. When the Partition hastily divided the former colony along religious lines  sending Muslims to the newly formed nation of Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to newly independent India  Punjab, which was sliced in half, saw some of the worst violence. Around this time, Sikhs began a greater struggle for political and cultural autonomy, scholars have said, and the Khalistan movement gained prominence. Over the years, violent clashes have erupted between followers of the movement and the Indian government, claiming many lives. It came to a head in 1984 when then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered Indian troops to storm Amritsars Golden Temple  Sikhisms holiest shrine  to kill Sikh separatists. That operation caused huge anger within the Sikh community and Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in the aftermath. Deadly violence erupted in the days following her death, killing more than 3,000 people  mostly Sikh. A year later the violence spilled over to Canada, when Sikh separatists bombed an Air India plane that had taken off from Toronto airport, killing all 329 people aboard, including numerous Canadians of Indian descent. While Khalistan supporters within India remain on the margins, the movement continues to evoke a level of sympathy from some Sikhs within the global diaspora, particularly in Canada, Britain and Australia. A small but influential number of those Sikhs support the idea of Khalistan, with referendums periodically held to reach a consensus to establish a separate homeland. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 03:24 pm",
        "content": "The names of several senior members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are widely tipped for the position of partys General Secretary which currently remains vacant, political sources revealed. However, MP Duminda Dissanayake is in the lead among the party members who are eyeing the post, according to sources. It is also said that former Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, who is a Senior Deputy Secretary of the SLFP, is also keen on this position. Although Sarath Ekanayake was appointed as the Acting General Secretary of the party, following the expulsion of MP Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Colombo District Court issued an injunction on September 08, preventing the former chief minister from serving in his new position. Accordingly, the SLFPs central committee later decided to appoint MP Sarathi Dushmantha as a stand-in for the general secretary of the party. However, the political sources mentioned that this competition has been created since the vacant post is due to be filled permanently. The chairman of the SLFP, former President Maithripala Sirisena previously announced that the party was ready to accept ousted party member Jayasekara for any other title he may wish to hold in the party, but not as the SLFPs General Secretary. Against such a backdrop, the senior members of the SLFP have opined that especially, if an alliance is to be formed between the SLFP and President Ranil Wickremesinghe aimed at the upcoming elections, MP Duminda Dissanayake is the most suitable party member to be appointed as the General Secretary of the party. Meanwhile, speaking at a press briefing held in Kandy today (19), former Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake stated that the SLFP would not, in fact, work together with the government for any reason.",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 04:07 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire said a payment system was the only way to counter bots. Were moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the system, the Tesla and SpaceX boss said. The BBC approached X for further details but has not yet received a statement from the company. It is unclear whether this was just an off-the-cuff comment, or a signal of firmer plans that have yet to be announced. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for verification. Since taking over Twitter last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. This has been done by giving paid subscribers more features, like longer posts and increased visibility on the platform. However, users can currently still use X for free. Although there is a clear financial interest for the company to charge users, Mr Musk insisted that getting people to pay for the service is aimed at tackling bots. A bot costs a fraction of a penny to make he said. But if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something, some minor amount, the effective cost to bots is very high. X Premium currently costs 8 (6.50) a month in the US. The price differs depending on which country a subscriber is in. The worlds richest person said that he was now looking at cheaper options for users. Were actually going to come up with a lower tier pricing. So we just want it to be just a small amount of money, he said. This is a longer discussion, but in my view, this is actually the only defence against vast armies of bots, Mr Musk added. However, a risk is that by putting X behind a paywall it may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the companys income. Mr Musks conversation with the Israeli prime minister also touched on antisemitism on X. The platform has been accused by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) campaign group of not doing enough to stop antisemitic content. In a statement, the organisation said that Mr Musk was engaging with and elevating antisemites. Earlier this month, he said that the company would sue the ADL to clear our platforms name. In the conversation with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Musk reiterated that he was against antisemitism. Mr Netanyahu accepted the balance between free speech and content moderation was a challenge but urged Mr Musk to get the balance right. I hope you find within the confines of the First Amendment, the ability to stop not only antisemitism... but any collective hatred of people that antisemitism represents, he said. I know youre committed to that, Mr Netanyahu added. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "I am not pro-Indian or pro-Chinese; I am pro-Sri Lankan  President Ranil",
        "date": "September 19, 2023 04:41 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has asserted that Sri Lankas government does not align itself with either India or China and firmly stands for Sri Lankas interests above all else. Some time back a person asked me whether I am pro-Indian or pro-Chinese, so I said definitely I am not pro-Indian, and added by saying I am also not pro-Chinese. So he asked me, then are you neutral? I said no Im not neutral, Im pro-Sri Lankan, the Head of State asserted, adding that many countries do not understand the fact that Sri Lankas priorities are not the same as those of the big powers and the others within the region. Participating in the Ocean Nations: The 3rd Annual Indo-Pacific Islands Dialogue, which was moderated by Dan Baer, Senior Vice President for Policy Research at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and hosted by the Carnegie Endowment and Sasakawa Foundation, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the reluctance of island nations in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific to become embroiled in the rivalry between major world powers. The President emphasised that these nations are focused on their own priorities, including social, economic, and ecological development and seek to maintain their sovereignty and independence. Island nations in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific have distinct priorities, unrelated to the Quad (comprising the US, India, Japan, and Australia) or Chinas objectives, he said, adding that Sri Lanka is open to collaboration with any partners willing to respect its autonomy. We are prepared to work with any actor, state or non-state actors, who will help us to achieve our objectives. We are working with the West on one side, and we are working with China on the other, he said in this regard. He assured, however, that Sri Lanka is not hedging back and forth in a bid to extract the most possible benefits from anyone, emphasising Throughout our island we have to deal with all powers that come in. We may have played one against the other, but that is for our survival. It is the inability to understand the nature of the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific regions which is creating this, None of the countries involved seem to understand what our Sri Lankas geopolitics are, and what we do , he further said. In terms of regional frameworks, President Wickremesinghe noted that Chinas rise occurred within existing regional frameworks such as APEC and ASEAN, which many nations prefer to maintain. The recent expansion of great power rivalry beyond these frameworks has raised concerns among member nations. He noted that the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean hold immense strategic value. The South Pacific is a vital hub for the US Navy and the Indian Ocean played a crucial role in World War II. President Wickremesinghe noted, The South Pacific which includes Hawaii  it is here that the US dominance of the Pacific established in WW2 and Battle of the Coral Sea and Midway as well as the shooting down of Admiral Yamamotos plane took place. The importance of the Indian Ocean was best described by Winston Churchill who said the most dangerous moment of war was the capture of Ceylon and consequently the loss of Indian Ocean. The Indo-Pacific concept has gained recognition, primarily due to mounting challenges from China, the President said, adding that it has prompted a re-evaluation of regional dynamics and cooperation, such as the Jakarta Concord within the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The G7s attempt to involve European powers and NATO in the Indo-Pacific was met with opposition, with only France expressing interest. This move was seen as violating IORAs rules-based order, the President pointed out. The President also noted that the Quad has shifted from a focus on security and dialogue to applying coordinated pressure in the region. While surface warfare threats are minimal in the Indian Ocean, the issue of submarine warfare needs to be addressed within IORA. In terms of Security Dialogues, the President pointed out that the island nations find security dialogues acceptable but emphasize non-interference in their internal affairs. Many island nations, including Sri Lanka, have not engaged in high-level discussions regarding the Indo-Pacific. Recent developments such as the US opening an embassy in the Maldives were also noted. The power balance in the Indian Ocean is evolving, influenced by ASEAN, the Russian-Ukraine war, and the emergence of BRICS. This changing landscape favours the independence of island nations and calls for strengthened cooperation between IORA, ASEAN, and BRICS. In response to a question posed on the Hambantota port, President Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka expressed concerns over the labelling of the Hambantota commercial port as a Chinese military base. The country is developing the Trincomalee harbour in cooperation with India and intends to raise the matter at international forums. He also emphasized the need for IORA to accommodate the Indo-Pacific concept, recognizing the interconnectedness of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and enabling cooperation among small island states in both regions. The island nations of the Indian Ocean and South Pacific are resolute in their pursuit of independence, non-interference and the protection of their unique priorities amidst the evolving dynamics of great power rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe raised concerns that the looming issue of global debt, which albeit being unconnected to Sri Lanka, may adversely impact the nations progress made thus far. Speaking at the Dialogue, the Head of State urged that the matter of global debt and other issues concerning low-income countries be resolved over the next few years, claiming that if not, it could have an adverse impact even on Sri Lanka. Ensuring that Sri Lanka is working towards development, President Ranil revealed that comprehensive economic and technological partnerships are currently being negotiated with India, while they have also applied to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), in a bid to further grow Sri Lankas market. We have no military ambitions, President Wickremesinghe asserted, adding that just because Sri Lanka is acting strategically, this does not mean that the nation has any military ambitions with China or any other state. When questioned as to the extent to which he believes international finance institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) could help to stabilise the Sri Lankan economy and enable the nation to invest the way they would like to, President Ranil stated that while the IMF has offered supported Sri Lanka, only a 3.5 growth rate is offered. But we want to go ahead and ensure that it goes to about 5.5 - 6, thats our own effort, he said in this regard, adding With the IMF and others, we are doing a far-reach economic restructuring, to attract people, he said in this regard. He further stated that with regard to Sri Lankas economy, the economic reforms and shedding the nations bankruptcy status remains his top priorities, while, within that, the lowest-hanging fruit is tourism, next is food security and modernizing agriculture. From there onwards, well work it out, President Ranil said.",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 04:41 pm",
        "content": "YouTube said on Tuesday it had blocked Russell Brand from making money from his online channel after the British actor and comedian was accused of a string of sexual assaults. Brand, once one of Britains most high-profile comedians and broadcasters, said on Saturday he had never had non-consensual sex. That came as the Sunday Times newspaper and Channel 4 TVs documentary show Dispatches reported that four women had accused the 48-year-old of sexual assaults, including a rape, between 2006 and 2013. London police said on Monday that since then they had received an allegation of sexual assault dating from 2003. Brand, the former husband of U.S. singer Katy Perry, has repositioned himself in recent years to build a more than 6 million-strong following to his YouTube channel. Recent videos included an interview with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and discussions on everything from COVID to UFOs, censorship and wellbeing. YouTube, owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc, said it had suspended monetisation on Brands channel after he violated its creator responsibility policy. If a creators off-platform behaviour harms our users, employees or ecosystem, we take action to protect the community, a YouTube spokesperson said. Brand issued a video message on social media on Saturday to deny the very serious criminal allegations hours before they were published. These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies. And as Ive written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous, Brand said. Now, during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual, added the comedian, known for his flamboyant style and appearance. Live shows planned by Brand have also been cancelled after the allegations emerged in the media. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 19, 2023 08:57 pm",
        "content": "A Sydney woman, who accused Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka of sexual assault was questioned in court by the latters legal counsel on Tuesday (Sept. 19). The alleged victim claims she was sexually assaulted on November 02, 2022 at her eastern suburbs home after matching with Gunathilaka on Tinder and meeting him at the Sydney Opera Bar for a date. Gunathilaka allegedly told the woman he did not need to wear a condom, saying that she should trust him and that she would not fall pregnant. The 32-year-old batsman has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent. Gunathilaka was in Australia at the time to participate in the T20 World Cup. The duo had chatted on several times through the dating app, Instagram and video calls on WhatsApp from October 31, before their meeting three days later. As the cricketers rape trial at Sydneys Downing Centre district court continued on Tuesday, defence barrister Murugan Thangaraj SC asked how the alleged stealthing could have taken place given the womans claims the sex had continued for 10 to 15 minutes. You dont describe the sexual intercourse ever pausing, do you? Thangaraj asked. I dont, no, the woman replied. The way you describe what happened, there was no opportunity for Danny to remove the condom, the barrister pressed. No, I disagree with that, the woman said. She told the court the cricketer could have removed the condom and thrown it on the floor while he was either choking her or slapping her from behind. At no point did Mr Gunathilaka have unprotected sex with you, Mr Thangaraj said. That is not correct, the woman replied. The alleged victim, who cannot be legally identified, was also asked about what she said occurred after the pair left the Opera Bar to have pizza in the Sydney CBD and then return by ferry to her home. She alleged Gunathilaka forcefully kissed her on the ferrys front outdoor deck and slapped her from behind in a manner she did not like. CCTV footage shows her chatting and embracing the cricketer on a side outdoor deck and seems to show her waving in front of his phone as he films Sydney Harbour. After they go back inside the cabin to sit down, the footage shows her holding his hands for a long time before getting up to leave. She said the forceful kiss and the slap happened in another area of the ferry where there was no CCTV. The alleged victim says he did slap her but she does not know at what point it was while they were on the ferry. She said she invited him into her house where she offered him some wine and played the guitar. She told police she had stopped playing because Gunathilaka kept filming her without her permission. Thangaraj suggested events that allegedly happened after this, including that Gunathilaka pushed her back onto the lounge and pushed his head forcefully into hers, actually did not happen. He questioned the womans claims she led the cricketer into the bedroom and lit candles to set the mood despite the prior alleged aggressive conduct. The trial heard before Judge Sarah Huggett without a jury continues. -with inputs from Australian Associated Press (AAP)",

The meeting will take place from October 9-15 in Marrakech, just 45 miles (72 km) from the site of the 6.8-magnitude earthquake on Sept. 8, with some changes to adapt content to the circumstances, World Bank President Ajay Banga, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Moroccos Economy Minister Nadia Fettah Alaoui said in a joint statement. Senior IMF and World Bank officials made the decision, first reported by Reuters, at the direct request of the Moroccan authorities who had pressed the global institutions to proceed with the gathering which is expected to bring some 10,000-15,000 to the Moroccan tourist hub. As we look ahead to the meetings, it is of utmost importance that we conduct them in a way that does not hamper the relief efforts under way and that is respectful to the victims and the Moroccan people, the three officials said. At this very difficult time, we believe that the Annual Meetings also provide an opportunity for the international community to stand by Morocco and its people, who have once again shown resilience in the face of tragedy. We also remain committed to ensuring the safety of all participants. Georgieva told Reuters on Friday that Moroccos prime minister told her it would be quite devastating for Moroccos hospitality sector if the meetings were moved to a different location.

According to GeoNet, the quake hit at 9.14am (local time) and was centred 45km north of the town of Geraldine in the Canterbury region. The epicentre is about 120km west of Christchurch and the event marks the strongest earthquake to hit New Zealand this year. The quake was just 11km deep, GeoNet says, and was felt across both the South and North Islands. Despite its size, the National Emergency Management Agency has confirmed there is no tsunami risk. The organisation received over 14,000 reports. New Zealanders described the quake as long and rumbling, and an aftershock registering a magnitude 3.4 was recorded about 10 minutes after the initial shock. The magnitude is similar to that of which rocked Christchurch in 2011, killing 185 people  though the 2011 quake was much shallower at just five kilometres. Its unclear at this stage what damage, if any, has been dealt to the area, though residents have already begun sharing their experiences online. Dairy farmer Craig Hickman posted to X, That was not light shaking. Another said their whole house shook and cupboard doors swung open. Dan Hall, a farmer from Mount Somers near the epicentre, said he was driving and thought his car was falling apart when the quake hit. I actually thought my tyre was coming off.

        "date": "September 20, 2023 12:38 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday made a forceful call for the world to stand up to Russias invasion of Ukraine, calling for leaders to stand firm in their support of President Volodymyr Zelensky and his nation as the war heads toward its second autumn. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin and his armed forces are betting that the world will grow weary of supporting Ukraine and it is incumbent upon the countries in the United Nations to stand firm against Putins aggression. If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? I respectfully suggest the answer is no. We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow, Biden said. Thats why the United States, together with our allies and partners around the world, will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their freedom, he added. The annual UN talks are unfolding for the second year under the shadow of the war in Ukraine, and the conflict will remain a focus for leaders. While the UN has led on organizing humanitarian aid during the conflict, it hasnt acted as a mediator in the war. Biden is set to meet with Zelensky  who was in the audience for Bidens speech on Tuesday  in Washington later this week. For the second year in a row, this gathering  dedicated to peaceful resolution of conflicts  is darkened by the shadow of war. An illegal war of conquest brought without provocation against its neighbor Ukraine, Biden said. He added, Russia alone bears responsibility for this war. Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately. And its Russia alone that stands in the way of peace. Later Tuesday, in remarks to the United Nations Leaders Reception at the New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art, he told other world leaders: Our world stands at an inflection point, and the decisions we make now are going to determine our future for decades to come. The president made reference to Russia, observing that the world stands poised at a moment where basic principles like sovereignty, territorial integrity, universal human rights are being tested, and a member the United Nations Security Council has launched a brazen and brutal attack against the people of Ukraine  attacks that go against the very character of the United Nations. During his speech to the General Assembly, Biden also returned to an issue that he frequently turns to in his public remarks  the future of democracy in the world. The president has often cast the fundamental motivating issue of his presidency as democracy vs. autocracy. And one day after the president railed against his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, in a sharpened speech at a fundraiser warning that Trump was determined to destroy democracy, Biden pressed the importance of democratic institutions. We will defend democracy: our best tool to meet the challenges that we face around the world. Were working to show how democracy can deliver in ways that matter to peoples lives, he said, pointing to global infrastructure partnerships and investments in low and middle income countries. The president frequently uses China as an example of that contrast. But at the UN, he sought to emphasize a more diplomatic tone regarding the American relationship with China, saying he wants competition and not conflict. I want to be clear and consistent: We seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so it does not tip into conflict. Ive said we are for de-risking, not decoupling on China, he said, warning that the US will push back on aggression. Biden says US future is tied to other nations This year, the nations of the global south are also demanding attention from leaders. Many have watched with skepticism as the West rallies attention and funding for Ukraine while their crises go unnoticed. Biden will meet Wednesday with Brazils President Lula da Silva to discuss labor issues and Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom Biden has clashed on the countrys controversial judicial reform plan. Biden and Netanyahu, the senior official said, will discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues focused on the shared democratic values between our two countries and a vision for a more stable and prosperous and integrated region, as well as compare notes on effectively countering and deterring Iran. But with high-level absences from Russia, China, France, and the UK  all permanent members of the UN Security Council  the Biden administration will be relegated to lower-level engagements with key allies and adversaries, all while hoping to elevate the United States views of global infrastructure, food security, democratic values, and territorial sovereignty. Reiterating his belief that the world is at an inflection point in history, Biden told the assembly, As president of the United States, I understand the duty my country has to lead this critical moment. Biden heralded his administrations efforts toward fighting the climate crisis, including investment toward clean energy, climate financing in developing countries, and steps toward the climate finance pledge outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, though he called for additional public and private sector investment. As the US seeks to counter the authoritarian pull of Russia and China, Biden is joining the presidents of five Central Asian nations  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan  for the first-ever so-called C51 presidential summit on Tuesday, the first senior official said, for a discussion on regional security, trade and connectivity, climate, and reforms to improve governance and the rule of law. The United States seeks a more secure, more prosperous, more equitable world for all people, because we know our future is bound to yours.  And no nation can meet the challenges of today alone, Biden said Tuesday. Questions over UNs effectiveness A major challenge for the Biden administrations ability to generate attention and headlines for its foreign policy goals: Forum fatigue, with the G20 meeting of world leaders, BRICs summit of developing countries, APEC gathering focused on Indo-Pacific policy, and the climate-focused COP28 conversation all happening in an unusually condensed calendar, taking some of the urgency away from the conversation happening in New York. Theres always been a sense that when you cant get what you want from the UN, you go somewhere else, said Marti Flacks, director of the Human Rights Initiative at the Council on Strategic and International Studies. Theres more of them being led by US competitors, particularly China. And so theres a sense that they are growing in strength. Still, Biden stressed the importance of the body in facing new challenges. We also recognize that to meet new challenges of our decades-old institutions and approaches, they must be updated to keep pace with the world. We have to bring in more leadership and capability that exists everywhere, especially from regions that have not always been fully included.  We have to make sure were delivering for people everywhere.  That starts with the United Nations  starts right here, he said. There are areas where the administration acknowledges progress will remain elusive. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said hes not optimistic UN leadership and partner countries can make progress reinstating the Black Sea grain initiative, despite UN Secretary General António Guterres holding meetings on it with Zelensky and other partners New York this week. We know the Turks are working hard at this; Guterres is working hard at this, Sullivan told reporters. But the Russians are not giving us a huge amount of cause for optimism at this moment. The issue raises the broader question of UN efficacy, with Russia remaining a member of the United Nations Security Council, despite multiple demands from the council to end the war in Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield said the US is working closely with Ukrainians to document war crimes and atrocities for future prosecution  but it remains unclear when any such tribunal would take place. In addition to strengthening institutions, Biden called on the UN to forge new partnerships, and confront new challenges on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, which, he said, offers both enormous potential and enormous peril. We need to be able to break the gridlock that too often stymies progress and blocks consensus on the council. We need more voices, more perspectives at the table. The United Nations must continue to preserve peace, prevent conflict, and alleviate human suffering. And we embrace nations stepping up to lead new ways to seek new breakthroughs on hard issues, he added. Source: CNN -Agencies",

Speaking on the matter, GMOA Deputy Secretary Dr. Palitha Rajapaksha attributed the high number of deaths caused by heart attacks to the absence of an angiogram machine. He revealed that in the past year alone, 2,179 patients had been admitted to the cardiac unit, of which only 750 were able to do the angiogram, adding that nearly 40 of the hospitals deaths were caused due to heart attacks. There are no angiogram machines in the Badulla District, Uva province and the Ratnapura Teaching Hospital. Because of this, the entire population of 1.5 million people within the Uva province is forced to go to either the Colombo National Hospital, Kandy Hospital, Nagoda Hospital in Kalutara, Karapitiya Hospital, Anuradhapura Hospital or the Polonnaruwa Hospital to get an angiogram done, Dr. Rajapaksha stated in this regard, emphasising the inconvenience caused to patients and the difficulties they face. Meanwhile, the cardiac specialist at the Colombo National Hospital Dr. Gotabhaya Ranasinghe, also raised concerns about the rapid increase in the number of heart patients reported daily, stressing that nearly 170 heart patients are diagnosed every day.",

        "date": "September 20, 2023 03:26 pm",
        "content": "Extremely limited resources have been allocated to the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change albeit the adoption in 2015, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told SDG Summit 2023 in New York. The two-day high-level political forum on sustainable development came to an end on Tuesday (Sept. 19). The world leaders adopted a Political Declaration which left them with a to-do list to turn words into action to attain SDGs. Addressing the event, the Sri Lankan leader underscored the need to accelerate the mobilization of finance and investments and the means to developing and vulnerable countries in order to achieve SDG targets. Recalling that the G20 countries at its 2023 Summit in New Delhi had agreed that developing countries require financing up to USD 5.9 trillion by 2023 to fulfil their nationally determined contributions to climate goals, he said an additional USD 4 trillion is needed every year until the end of the decade if developing countries are to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Drawing attention to this, President Wickremesinghe raised concerns about extremely limited resources being allotted to achieve the SDGs. The Sri Lankan leader pointed out the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled or reversed the economic growth in many countries including Sri Lanka, leading to bankruptcies. In 2019, it was estimated that 9 of Sri Lankas gross domestic product (GDP) has to be invested to realize SDGs, but following the pandemic and the economic crisis, this is not realistic now, President Wickremesinghe emphasized, adding that due to countrys sovereign debt crisis, its debt servicing cost was equivalent to 150 of government revenue in 2022. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, closing the Summit, appealed to the participants to make the most of the Summits momentum to spur progress in the months ahead. Calling for the formation of a leaders group to deliver clear steps that enable the USD 500 billion per year needed for sustainable development to start flowing before the end of 2024, he also urged developed countries to finally meet their official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 of gross national income.",

Depositing the legal document on Sri Lankas accession to the TPNW took place on the sidelines of the ongoing 78th session of the UN General Assembly. Sri Lanka participated in the negotiations of the TPNW at the United Nations in New York, which was adopted on July 07, 2017, and was among 122 states that voted in favour of its adoption. Sri Lanka also contributed through active participation in the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) process of 2016 in Geneva which led to the treaty negotiation process. The island nation has promoted universal adherence to the treaty by consistently voting in favour of an annual UN General Assembly resolution that calls upon all states to join the treaty at the earliest possible date.

        "content": "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musks brain-chip startup Neuralink said on Tuesday it has received approval from an independent review board to begin recruitment for the first human trial of its brain implant for paralysis patients. Those with paralysis due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may qualify for the study, it said, but did not reveal how many participants would be enrolled in the trial, which will take about six years to complete. The study will use a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface (BCI) implant in a region of the brain that controls the intention to move, Neuralink said, adding that its initial goal is to enable people to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone. The company, which had earlier hoped to receive approval to implant its device in 10 patients, was negotiating a lower number of patients with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the agency raised safety concerns, according to current and former employees. It is not known how many patients the FDA ultimately approved. Musk has grand ambitions for Neuralink, saying it would facilitate speedy surgical insertions of its chip devices to treat conditions like obesity, autism, depression and schizophrenia. In May, the company said it had received clearance from the FDA for its first-in-human clinical trial, when it was already under federal scrutiny for its handling of animal testing. Even if the BCI device proves to be safe for human use, it would still potentially take more than a decade for the startup to secure commercial use clearance for it, according to experts.

        "content": "American singer-songwriter Katy Perry has sold her music catalogue to Litmus Music, a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group, for a record 225 million. The deal includes her stake in her master recordings and publishing rights for all five of her studio albums released through Capitol Records, from 2008s One of the Boys to 2020s Smile. That includes multi-platinum hits like Firework, Teenage Dream, Hot n Cold, California Gurls, and I Kissed a Girl. This is the biggest catalogue deal for a single artist in 2023. In recent years, Justin Bieber, Bruce Springsteen, and Bob Dylan have all sold their music catalogues for hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the BBC, Justin Bieber was the previous title holder after offloading his stake in his back catalogue to the UK-based Hipgnosis Songs Capital in January for 200 million. Litmus now owns Perrys stake in the master recordings and publishing for the records, meaning it will collect any future royalties the music earns. Two of her songs, Dark Horse and Roar, have more than one billion streams on Spotify. Roar is also one of the most-watched videos of all time on YouTube, with 3.8 billion plays. A major star in the 2010s, Perry has slowed her work rate down in recent years, concentrating on her Las Vegas residency and raising a family with her partner, the actor Orlando Bloom, the new portal reported. In a new release, Dan McCarroll, who previously held the position of president at Capitol Records and is also one of the co-founders of Litmus, stated that Katy Perry is a creative visionary who has made a major impact across music, TV, film, and philanthropy.

        "date": "September 20, 2023 09:47 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry recently praised the Global Development Initiative (GDI), claiming that when the member states of the UN are contemplating as to what new strategies must be adopted to win the game in the second half, the GDI lends fresh impetus to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Participating in the GDI Cooperation Outcomes high-level meeting held on 19 September 2023 in New York, Minsiter Sabry commended the tangible results and benefits delivered, over the last 2 years, through this Chinese initiative, that complements efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by revitalizing global development partnerships, and promoting stronger, greener and healthier global development. The meeting, themed DGI for SDGs: Action and Progress, was chaired by the Vice President of China Han Zheng, and was held on the sidelines of the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Foreign Minister Sabry further stated that the GDI has laid the foundation for certain core principles: staying committed to development as a priority; to a people-centered approach; to benefits for all and to leave no country and no one behind; to innovation-driven development; to harmony between humans and nature; and to results-oriented actions. He also appreciated the continuous assistance extended to Sri Lanka in renewable energy and food security under the GDI. The GDI had been proposed by President Xi Jinping during the UN General Assembly in 2021. It aims to build a global community of development, giving priority to development and people, and seeks to expedite the implementation of the UNs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Over the past 2 years, more than 100 countries and international organizations, including the United Nations, have supported the GDI, and more than 60 countries, including Sri Lanka have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative.",

        "content": "Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has stated that no police personnel have been charged in connection with the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 thus far. Speaking in Parliament today (20 Sep.), he stated that as per the reports submitted by the relevant Presidential Commission of Inquiry, no police personnel have been charged in this regard, and have only been under observation thus far. The Minister asserted this in response to a question raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Hector Appuhamy, pertaining to the officials allegedly accused in connection with the attack, adding that the relevant names of the personnel were handed over to the Attorney General for further proceedings. Therefore, it would be wrong of me to name certain personnel, as if they are already charged, until they are rightfully prosecuted, he said in this regard. Commenting on concerns raised pertaining to providing some sort of relief to the victims of the 2019 bombings, Minister Alles requested for a period of two days to provide an answer for the matter. Meanwhile, the Archdiocese of Colombo has claimed that using those accused in connection with the Easter Sunday attacks in order to brief MPs on the investigations into the said attacks, is an insult to the Parliament. Former President Maithripala Sirisena, too, has emphasised the need for an international investigation into the attacks, claiming that this is the only way the truth behind the Easter bombings would be uncovered.",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 06:35 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaking at the Climate Ambition Summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly yesterday (20), affirmed Sri Lankas commitment to the Secretary Generals accelerated climate agenda. He highlighted the importance of tangible climate actions and commended the delegates for their valuable suggestions, the PMD reported. President Wickremesinghe drew attention to the significant economic consequences of climate-related issues, with experts predicting a 1.5 GDP loss for Sri Lanka by 2050. In response, Sri Lanka has adopted a dual approach to climate ambition. At COP 27, the President launched the Climate Prosperity Plan, a strategy for green growth cantered on renewable energy generation, leveraging the nations natural advantages in wind and solar power. This initiative aligns with Sri Lankas economic restructuring following the 2022 financial crisis, as the country aims to transition towards a green economy. The second facet of Sri Lankas climate ambition involves supporting the establishment of a climate justice forum. This forum aims to foster international collaboration to address various climate challenges, including loss and damage adaptation and mitigation. In addition to these efforts, Sri Lanka is proposing two critical measures on the global stage. First, the President suggested the creation of an international climate change university, designed as a global platform for research and development focused on climate mitigation actions. Second, recognizing the need for responsible resource management, Sri Lanka is concentrating on areas where maximum impact can be achieved. The President introduced the Tropical Belt Climate Ambition Project, targeting the highly bio diverse tropical belt region. Vulnerable communities in this area are disproportionately affected by climate change. The tropical belt is the most tropically diverse region on earth. Typically, biodiversity increases as the latitude decreases. The biodiversity increases as we get closer to the equator. Vulnerable communities in the tropical belt are the worst impacted by climate change, he added. Investments in renewable energy, nature-based solutions and pollution control within the tropical belt have the potential to yield transformative results, benefiting not only the region but also temperate areas worldwide. Furthermore, the project aligns with the goals of climate change mitigation and adaptation, offering an opportunity for debt relief to low-income countries within the belt. Not only in the tropical belt, but will also impact on the temperate areas outside. The nature-based solutions could contribute substantially to climate change mitigation and adaptation. There are also a number of low-income countries within the belt who will be able to benefit from the debt relief that is being proposed. These initiatives, the Tropical Belt Climate Ambition Plan and the proposed debt relief for low-income economies within the belt, are poised to make a substantial contribution to advancing the Secretary Generals accelerated climate agenda. President Ranil Wickremesinghes statement underscores Sri Lankas dedication to addressing the pressing challenges of climate change on both the national and global fronts, the PMD said.",

        "content": "The Commissioner General of the Department of Examinations will announce the revised dates for conducting the 2023 G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination next week, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha says. The minister made this remark while delivering a special statement in the parliament this morning (21). Speaking further, Premajayantha emphasized that a large number of students, as well as the MPs of both the ruling party and the opposition in their capacity as public representatives, have requested to postpone the AL examination citing several issues. Repercussions of postponing the 2023 Advanced Level exam to 2024 need to be taken into account when considering the request, the minister said, mentioning that holding the school examinations and releasing the results have continuously been put off due to certain adversities including the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, trade union actions and the economic crisis. Schoolchildren and parents were the ones who were affected by all these issues. Furthermore, the Education Minister expressed that admission of students to the universities, admission to the courses conducted by higher educational institutes, and admission to foreign universities have been delayed over the past few years, which cost the students the opportunity to apply for the courses at the minimum prescribed age. He said the ministry hoped to prevent the exam from being delayed year after year and to provide the students the opportunity to face the exams at the minimum prescribed age in order to pursue higher education. Meanwhile, the minister pointed out that if the 2023 AL examination is pushed to January 2024, the 2023 G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, which is currently planned to be conducted in the months of March and April 2024, will have to be postponed to May or June. He also explained that as a result, the authorities will be compelled to postpone exams time and time again. When the school examination calendar becomes irregular, the school term calendar will also be delayed. This will also cause delays in admission of students to Grade 01, he stressed. The minister further warned that this will lead to the loss of opportunities for students to apply for foreign universities and scholarships. In addition, recruitments to several government vacancies will face delays, as the delays in releasing examination results will cause the postponement of various corporate examinations, he added. Premajayantha asserted that however, the attention of the Examinations Department has been drawn to revise the dates for conducting the 2023 AL examination, in a manner that does not affect the school term calendar. The minister highlighted that the decision was arrived at in consideration of the injustice to a considerable number of students who have applied for the examination, following the release of 2022 AL results. Compared to previous years, 18,473 more applications were received for the examination after the results were released, he added.",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 11:29 am",
        "content": "The hearing of the case against Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka over alleged sexual assault before the New South Wales District Court has been concluded and Judge Sarah Huggett will deliver her verdict on 28 September, Australian media confirmed. Cricket star Danushka Gunathilaka has stood trial at the Downing Centre District Court for the past four days after pleading not guilty to one charge of sexual assault without consent. The charge relates to an incident on 02 November 2022, when it is alleged the 32-year-old removed a condom during sexual intercourse  known as stealthing  with a woman at her home in Sydneys east. The pair first met at the Opera Bar near the Sydney Opera House, where CCTV footage shows them embracing, before having drinks together in the city and heading back to the womans home via ferry. The night reportedly turned out very differently to what the woman expected or wanted, while Gunathilakas lawyers have told a court the complainants evidence is demonstrably unreliable. Crown prosecutor Gabrielle Steedman urged Judge Sarah Huggett to find the cricketer guilty, telling the court the complainants evidence must be accepted beyond a reasonable doubt. Ms Steedman said the accused did not respect any of the womans requests or boundaries, arguing it was entirely consistent with someone who would remove his condom despite her clear wishes to the contrary. The prosecutor referred to their pre-date interactions online, including his offer to pay for a flight for her to Brisbane to visit him there, which she declined. It is clear there is a mutual flirtation throughout  but the accused was pursuing her quite relentlessly prior to meeting up, Ms Steedman said. The prosecutor said in the womans bedroom, Mr Gunathilaka engaged in a negotiation about protection after a discussion about his preference to not use condoms. The court has previously heard the woman did not see the cricketer remove the condom but saw it on the floor after he stopped sexual intercourse. When the complainant testified, she alleged she was choked three times during sex  and that Mr Gunathilaka had previously kissed her forcefully and become aggressive on the way home and on the couch. Today, Ms Steedman said he agreed to initially wear the condom to appease her and had plenty of opportunity to remove it. The fact that she did not see him do it stands to reason, and she says she zoned out during this period because it was so unpleasant, the Crown said. In his recorded police interview, the cricketer denied all wrongdoing and told investigators there were two condoms because the first one did not work. Ms Steedman said the claim of the second condom was a deliberate mistruth. MORPHED EVIDENCE Mr Gunathilakas defence barrister, Murugan Thangaraj SC, told the court that the alleged victim had provided a narrative that had morphed and shaped to fit the allegation. He claimed the woman gave false and self-serving evidence throughout her evidence as well as in her two statements to police. Mr Thangaraj said the narrative is unsustainable in the light of the evidence. He questioned whether the woman deliberately left out certain elements of her evidence or rather subconsciously edited them out without realising. Mr Thangaraj said the woman did not remember matters inconsistent with her narrative. During their online interactions, Mr Gunathilaka at one point said he was too tired after a game to meet the woman on a different night out, which Mr Thangaraj said was not entirely consistent with the Crowns submission he was relentlessly pursuing. He highlighted that his client was an international cricketer, questioning why he would risk conduct such as choking which would leave visible injuries. Mr Thangaraj said the woman created an aggressive narrative of what happened in the lead-up to their trip to her house, including claims she was ambushed on her couch. But he said it would be completely inconsistent with that for her to then invite him into the bedroom and light candles. The judge-alone trial has ended. Judge Huggett will deliver her judgment on September 28. Source - ABC  The Australian - Agencies",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 02:32 pm",
        "content": "Azerbaijans president has declared that his countrys sovereignty has been restored over Nagorno-Karabakh after a 24-hour military offensive against ethnic-Armenian forces. Ilham Aliyev praised the heroism of Azerbaijans army hours after Karabakh forces agreed to surrender. Some 120,000 ethnic Armenians live in the South Caucasus enclave, recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan now intends to bring the breakaway region under full control. Its military launched an anti-terror operation on Tuesday, demanding that Karabakhs forces raise a white flag and dissolve their illegal regime. With no means of support from neighbouring Armenia, and after an effective nine-month blockade, the ethnic Armenians soon gave in. Armenian officials reported that at least 32 people were killed, including seven civilians, and another 200 wounded. However according to a separatist Armenian human rights official, at least 200 people were killed and more than 400 wounded. The BBC has not been able to verify any of the figures. On Wednesday evening, Armenian officials accused Azerbaijan of opening fire on troops near the town of Sotk on the border between the two countries after the ceasefire had been agreed, but Azerbaijan immediately denied the claims. Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for his handling of the crisis. Azerbaijans army said it had captured more than 90 positions from the ethnic Armenians before both sides announced that a complete cessation of hostilities had been agreed through Russian peacekeepers, starting at 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Under the terms of the truce, outlined by Azerbaijan and Russia, which has peacekeepers on the ground, local Karabakh forces must commit to being completely disbanded as well as disarmed. There is also a commitment to Armenian forces pulling out, even though its government denies having any military presence there. Azerbaijans presidency said officials from Baku and Karabakhs Armenian representatives arrived in the town of Yevlakh for talks on issues of re-integration on Thursday morning. President Aliyev said Azerbaijanis had nothing against the population, only their criminal junta. Yevlakh is some 100km (60 miles) north of Karabakhs regional capital, Khankendi, known as Stepanakert by Armenians. Civilians flee to airport Marut Vanyan, a journalist in Karabakh, said many families had spent Tuesday night in basements: I didnt sleep and I didnt eat. Its calm now but its a strange feeling. Right now, what we need to do is stop this bloodshed and understand what to do next. Russia said its peacekeepers had evacuated 5,000 people from dangerous areas since the offensive had begun, the countrys Interfax news agency reported. As the ceasefire was announced, Karabakh officials appealed to residents to remain in shelters and not to leave for the local airport, adjacent to a Russian peacekeeping base. However, a crowd of civilians had soon gathered close to the airport and as darkness fell hours later it was unclear what support they would have. Caucasus specialist Thomas de Waal of Carnegie Europe said the terms of the ceasefire and the coming talks were very much on Azerbaijans terms and left ethnic Armenians looking unprotected. This looks like the end of a 35-year-old project, some would say a century-old project, of the Armenians of Karabakh to secede from Azerbaijan, he told the BBC. Were probably, unfortunately, seeing a project whereby the Azerbaijanis offer so little to the Karabakh Armenians that most if not all of them will leave. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan made clear his government was not involved in the ceasefire text and demanded that Russian peacekeepers take full responsibility for the safety of the local population. On Tuesday he accused Azerbaijan of ethnic cleansing in Karabakh. Azerbaijans presidential envoy Elchin Amirbekov told the BBC that Russian peacekeepers had helped facilitate the ceasefire: I think they have to be counted on for the implementation part. An ongoing crisis Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and its neighbour have fought two wars over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous, landlocked region in the south-west of Azerbaijan. The six-week war in 2020 led to several thousand deaths but enabled Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, to recapture territory surrounding and inside the enclave, leaving the ethnic Armenians isolated. For the past nine months, Azerbaijan has conducted an effective blockade of the only road into Karabakh from Armenia, known as the Lachin Corridor. Ethnic Armenians in the enclave complained of shortages of food, medicines and toiletries and Armenia was unable to help. Although some aid was allowed through in recent days, the Karabakh Armenians were very much weakened by the shortages by the time of the Azerbaijani offensive, with little hope of external support. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers were supposed to monitor the 2020 ceasefire but Moscows interest in Armenia has waned during its war in Ukraine, even though Armenia is part of Russias CSTO military alliance. Last May, the Armenian prime minister was quoted as saying his country would be ready to recognise Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan in return for the security of the ethnic Armenian population. The 86,600 sq km of Azerbaijans territory includes Nagorno-Karabakh, Mr Pashinyan was quoted as saying, referring to Azerbaijan as a whole. Russia has also been annoyed by Mr Pashinyans apparent pivot to the West. Earlier this month his wife Anna Hakobyan shook hands with Ukraines president at a conference in Kyiv, and this week, dozens of Armenian and US soldiers took part in military exercises together. The Kremlin has denied Armenian allegations that it did not do enough to help its ally. President Vladimir Putin said only last week that Russia had no problems with Armenias prime minister, but added: If Armenia itself recognised that Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, what should we do? Hundreds of protesters in Yerevan called for the prime minister to resign on Tuesday because of his handling of the crisis and he warned of unidentified forces calling for a coup.

        "date": "September 21, 2023 02:41 pm",
        "content": "India has suspended visa services for Canadian citizens amid an escalating row over the killing of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. Visa service provider BLS posted a message from Indias mission blaming operational reasons for the decision. Tensions flared this week after Canada said it was investigating credible allegations linking India with the murder of the separatist leader. India angrily rejected the allegation calling it absurd. Analysts say relations between the countries, which have been strained for months, are now at an all-time low. The message about the suspension of visas was first posted on the BLS website on Thursday. Important notice from Indian Mission: Due to operational reasons, with effect from 21 September 2023, Indian visa services have been suspended till further notice, it read. Indias foreign ministry refused to comment on the matter and asked the BBC to refer to the BLS website. The move comes a day after India issued an advisory urging its citizens travelling to or living in Canada to exercise utmost caution in view of the growing anti-India activities and politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence in Canada. Delhi said that some recent threats were directed at its diplomats and some Indians who oppose the anti-India agenda. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday that intelligence agencies were investigating whether agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen - India had designated him a terrorist in 2020. Nijjar was shot dead in his vehicle by two masked gunmen outside a Sikh temple on 18 June in British Columbia. Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty, Mr Trudeau told the Canadian parliament on Monday. India reacted strongly, saying that Canada was trying to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists who had been given shelter there. The Indian government has often reacted sharply to demands by Sikh separatists in Western countries for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. The Khalistan movement peaked in India in the 1980s with a violent insurgency centred in Sikh-majority Punjab state. It was quelled by force and has little resonance in India now, but is still popular among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK. Canada has the highest number of Sikhs outside Punjab and has seen several pro-Khalistan protests and demonstrations. In June, reports said India had raised a formal complaint with Canada about the safety of its diplomats there. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 03:21 pm",
        "content": "Traveling through one of the worlds best airports is set to get even smoother next year. Starting in 2024, officials say Singapores Changi Airport will introduce automated immigration clearance, which will allow passengers to depart the city-state without passports, using only biometric data. Singapore will be one of the first few countries in the world to introduce automated, passport-free immigration clearance, Communications Minister Josephine Teo announced during a parliament session on Monday, during which several changes to the countrys Immigration Act were passed. Biometric technology, along with facial recognition software, is already in use to some extent in Changi Airport at automated lanes at immigration checkpoints. But the upcoming changes will reduce the need for passengers to repeatedly present their travel documents at touch points and allow for more seamless and convenient processing, Teo said. Biometrics will be used to create a single token of authentication that will be employed at various automated touch points  from bag drops to immigration clearance and boarding  eliminating the need for physical travel documents like boarding passes and passports. But passports will still be required for many countries outside of Singapore that do not offer passport-free clearance, Teo stressed. Often ranked the worlds best airport and also one of the busiest, Singapores Changi Airport serves more than 100 airlines that fly to 400 cities in around 100 countries and territories worldwide. It handled 5.12 million passenger movements in June, crossing the 5 million mark for the first time since January 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. The airport is a destination in itself and currently has four terminals. It is set to expand, adding a fifth to cater to the growing number of travelers. Changi Airport is projecting a return to pre-pandemic levels of passenger and air traffic and expressed hopes that the upcoming biometric system will help make passenger flows smoother. Our immigration systems must be able to manage this high and growing volume of travelers efficiently and provide a positive clearance experience, while ensuring our security, Teo said. The future of travel? Seamless travel has been catching on around the world and biometric identification could soon be the future of travel, observers say. In 2018, Dubai International Airport introduced biometric Smart Gates tunnels, which use facial recognition to verify travelers identities in as little as five seconds. Passengers are also allowed to use their fingerprints or face scans for authentication, rather than rely on physical passports. Elsewhere in the world, facial recognition technology is already in use to some extent at Hong Kong International Airport, Tokyo Narita, Tokyo Haneda, Indira Gandhi International in Delhi, London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle, among other airports. Digital IDs, compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards in Aruba, allow travelers to travel using secure digital versions of their passports on mobile phones. In the US, major airlines like American Airlines, United and Delta have been experimenting with biometric check-in, bag drops and boarding gates at select airports for the last couple of years.

        "content": "The family of a North Carolina man who died after driving his car off a collapsed bridge while following Google Maps directions is suing the technology giant for negligence, claiming it had been informed of the collapse but failed to update its navigation system. Philip Paxson, a medical device salesman and father of two, drowned Sept. 30, 2022, after his Jeep Gladiator plunged into Snow Creek in Hickory, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Wake County Superior Court. Paxson was driving home from his daughters ninth birthday party through an unfamiliar neighborhood when Google Maps allegedly directed him to cross a bridge that had collapsed nine years prior and was never repaired. Our girls ask how and why their daddy died, and Im at a loss for words they can understand because, as an adult, I still cant understand how those responsible for the GPS directions and the bridge could have acted with so little regard for human life, his wife, Alicia Paxson, said. State troopers who found Paxtons body in his overturned and partially submerged truck had said there were no barriers or warning signs along the washed-out roadway. He had driven off an unguarded edge and crashed about 20 feet below, according to the lawsuit. The North Carolina State Patrol had said the bridge was not maintained by local or state officials, and the original developers company had dissolved. The lawsuit names several private property management companies that it claims are responsible for the bridge and the adjoining land. Multiple people had notified Google Maps about the collapse in the years leading up to Paxsons death and had urged the company to update its route information, according to the lawsuit. The Tuesday court filing includes email records from another Hickory resident who had used the maps suggest an edit feature in September 2020 to alert the company that it was directing drivers over the collapsed bridge. A November 2020 email confirmation from Google confirms the company received her report and was reviewing the suggested change, but the lawsuit claims Google took no further actions. We have the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family, Google spokesperson José Castañeda told The Associated Press. Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps and we are reviewing this lawsuit. Source  The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 05:10 pm",
        "content": "Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry, participating in the 18th Ministerial Meeting of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), has underscored that the forum is an important mechanism to restore the cooperation that once existed among the Asian nations. Addressing the meeting which was held on the sidelines of the 78th UN General Assembly session in New York, Sabry said the ACDs role and principles as a pan-Asian platform can contribute to regional development and the future of an Asian community. We must be proud of the rich, multifaceted heritage that Asia possesses. Indeed, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue is a crucial mechanism for restoring the cooperation that once existed between Asian nations. ACDs objectives, duties, and principles of the Dialogue as a pan-Asian platform where high-level policymakers can exchange ideas and experiences that will contribute to regional development and the future of an Asian community are extremely pertinent. Minister Sabry attended the meeting at the invitation of Dr. Abdullatif Bin Rashid Al Zayani, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain, and the current Chair of the ACD. The Sri Lankan foreign minister, commending Bahrain for its ACD leadership over the past two years, extended the fullest support to Iran, the incoming Chair, in promoting the ACD objectives. The meeting was convened under the theme Post-Pandemic Sustainable Recovery and was an opportunity for foreign ministers to review the progress made over the past year in deepening intra-Asian cooperation through the ACD. The foreign ministers adopted the Bahrain Declaration which focuses on recovering efforts of the ACD as a regional organization following the Covid-19 pandemic, through collaboration. In this regard, Minister Sabry said, Sri Lanka is cognizant of the contribution science, technology, and innovation could make to the ACD 2030 Agenda and the need for collaboration to mitigate the effects of global issues such as the Covid pandemic. When the Covid pandemic swept the globe, the value of novel approaches to problem-solving became evident. The Dialogue, an intergovernmental organization inaugurated in 2002, aims to consolidate Asian strengths and fortify Asias competitiveness by maximizing the diversity and rich resources in Asia. Senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN in New York participated in the meeting.",

        "content": "A trade group for U.S. authors has sued OpenAI in Manhattan federal court on behalf of prominent writers including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen, George Saunders, Jodi Picoult and Game of Thrones novelist George R.R. Martin, accusing the company of unlawfully training its popular artificial-intelligence based chatbot ChatGPT on their work. The proposed class-action lawsuit filed late on Tuesday by the Authors Guild joins several others from writers, source-code owners and visual artists against generative AI providers. In addition to Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI, similar lawsuits are pending against Meta Platforms and Stability AI over the data used to train their AI systems. Other authors involved in the latest lawsuit include The Lincoln Lawyer writer Michael Connelly and lawyer-novelists David Baldacci and Scott Turow. OpenAI and other AI defendants have said their use of training data scraped from the internet qualifies as fair use under U.S. copyright law. An OpenAI spokesperson said on Wednesday that the company respects authors rights and is having productive conversations with many creators around the world, including the Authors Guild. Authors Guild CEO Mary Rasenberger said in a statement on Wednesday that authors must have the ability to control if and how their works are used by generative AI in order to preserve our literature. The Authors Guilds lawsuit claims that the datasets used to train OpenAIs large language model to respond to human prompts included text from the authors books that may have been taken from illegal online pirate book repositories. The complaint said ChatGPT generated accurate summaries of the authors books when prompted, indicating that their text is included in its database. It also cited growing concerns that authors could be replaced by systems like ChatGPT that generate low-quality ebooks, impersonating authors and displacing human-authored books.
