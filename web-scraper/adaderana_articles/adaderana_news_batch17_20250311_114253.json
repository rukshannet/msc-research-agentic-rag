        "date": "January 9, 2025 03:59 pm",
        "content": "A home reportedly belonging to Hollywood actors Leighton Meester and Adam Brody and another owned by actor Billy Crystal were among more than 1,000 buildings destroyed by wildfires raging across Los Angeles, including a blaze that started on Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills. Jamie Lee Curtis, Mandy Moore, Maria Shriver and other celebrities were among more than 100,000 people forced to evacuate their homes to escape the out-of-control fires burning in some of Los Angeles most desirable areas. The largest blaze consumed nearly 12,000 acres (4,856 hectares) in Pacific Palisades, a picturesque neighborhood between the beach towns of Santa Monica and Malibu that is home to many film, television and music stars. Brody, best known for his roles in TV series The O.C. and Nobody Wants This, and Meester, who starred in Gossip Girl, bought their Pacific Palisades home in 2019 for 6.5 million, according real estate and entertainment websites. Crystal and his wife, Janice, said in a statement that they had lived in their Pacific Palisades house since 1979. We are heartbroken, of course, but with the love of children and friends we will get through this, they said. Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California when she was married to former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said the destruction in the upscale enclave was devastating. Everything is gone. Our neighborhood, our restaurants, she wrote on X on Wednesday. The firefighters have and are doing their best, but this fire is massive and out of control. The day after actor James Woods evacuated his house in Pacific Palisades, he said every house around us was on fire. We were literally in the exact epicenter of the fire as it started, Woods, known for roles in Ghosts of Mississippi and Any Given Sunday, said on CNN on Wednesday. There was so much chaos. It was like an inferno. Hollywood Hills Burn On Wednesday evening a fire erupted in the Hollywood Hills and quickly doubled in size, forcing further evacuations in an area synonymous with the entertainment industry Though relatively small compared to the others, the Sunset Fire burned just above Hollywood Boulevard and its Walk of Fame. It would need to cross the 101 Freeway to endanger the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory further up in the hills. Within that area is the Dolby Theater, where the Oscars are held. Next weeks Oscar nominations announcement was already postponed by two days because of the fire, organizers said. This weekends Critics Choice Awards was also delayed by two weeks, organizers said. With a median home price of 4.5 million, Pacific Palisades is home to celebrities as well as the Getty Villa, one of the most popular museums in Los Angeles. Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis said my community and possibly my home is on fire. It is a terrifying situation, Curtis wrote on Instagram. Pray if you believe in it and even if you dont, pray for those who do. Mandy Moore, known for television series This is Us, said she and her family had evacuated because of the proximity of the flames. So gutted for the destruction and loss, she wrote on Instagram. Dont know if our place made it. Media personality Paris Hiltons beachfront mansion in Malibu, reportedly bought for 8.4 million, was among the homes burned down. She said she was heartbroken beyond words. Sitting with my family, watching the news, and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience, Hilton wrote on X. Several other fires were burning around the city. Film permits were revoked in Pasadena and other areas east of Los Angeles at the request of fire officials, according to permitting organization FilmLA. Production of TV shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live and Greys Anatomy was halted on Wednesday. Several film premieres were also called off. Actor Mark Hamill, known for playing Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films, said the blaze was the most horrific since 1993. He said on Instagram that he evacuated his Malibu home on Tuesday evening with his wife and dog. There (were) small fires on both sides of the road as we approached (the Pacific Coast Highway), he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 9, 2025 04:15 pm",
        "content": "Apple clarified on Wednesday that it has never sold the data collected by its Siri voice assistant or used it to create marketing profiles, just days after settling a case in which it faced such accusations. The iPhone maker last week paid 95 million to settle a class action lawsuit in which plaintiffs alleged it routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri unintentionally, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Voice assistants typically react when people use hot words such as Hey, Siri. The company denied those claims and did not admit to them in its settlement last week, in which tens of millions of Apple customers may receive up to 20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones and Apple Watches. Apple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose, Apple said on Wednesday. Apple issued the statement after social media users and commentators interpreted the settlement as confirmation that the allegations were true. In its statement, the Cupertino, California-based company said that certain features require real-time input from Apple servers and it is only in such cases that Siri uses as little data as possible to deliver an accurate result. Apple does not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose, Apple said, adding that it will continue developing technologies to make Siri even more private. A similar lawsuit on behalf of users of Googles Voice Assistant is pending in the San Jose, California federal court. The plaintiffs are represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case.

        "content": "Dr. Deepal Perera, a paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, has raised concerns about the countrys declining birth rate, which he says has seen a considerable decline over the past decade. He emphasized that this trend could have far-reaching consequences for the future of the country. One thing we have seen in observing the past 10 years is the gradual decline in the number of births in the country. In 2013, there were 350,000 births. In 2024, that number has dropped to 228,000. Additionally, a number of these children are being hospitalized due to various diseases, which is a situation we did not witness 20 years ago, Dr. Perera stated. The paediatrician also pointed out worrying trends in childhood health conditions, noting a rise in cases of childhood diabetes, cancer, and mental disorders. The number of reports of childhood diabetes has increased. The number of reports of childhood cancer has increased. We are also seeing an increase in mental disorders. If children are getting sick at this rate, the future will not be promising, he added. if we are not careful about this, we could all face a difficult situation.",

The charges were presented when the case was taken up before Colombo High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne, where the defendant Diana Gamage pleaded not guilty to the charges. During the proceedings, Presidents Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe, representing the defendant, raised preliminary objections. He argued that the document central to the case was prepared in 2003, and with the case being filed in 2024, over two decades later, there was no legal basis to pursue action on such an outdated document. After considering the facts presented, High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne, stated that the objections would be taken into consideration during the trial. Accordingly, the case is scheduled to be taken up for hearing on March 5, 2025.",

        "content": "In a commendable act, the Khyber Police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan successfully reunited a Sri Lankan mother with her 25-year-old daughter and handed over custody to the mother, respecting the daughters choice.

        "date": "January 9, 2025 10:11 pm",
        "content": "All five living US presidents attended Jimmy Carters funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, a rare occurrence that marks the first time the leaders have gathered publicly since 2018. President Biden, President-elect Donald Trump and former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were attending the funeral service while Mr. Biden delivered a eulogy for the 39th president, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. Mr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden were seated next to Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff in the first row Thursday for the funeral service. Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton were seated behind them, next to Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, Obama, Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. Obama and Trump could be seen talking and at times smiling before the service began. Former first lady Michelle Obama was not in attendance. Seated behind the row of presidents and first ladies were also former Vice Presidents Al Gore and Mike Pence, who shook hands with Trump upon their arrival at the service. It marks the first time Ms Harris has been pictured alongside Mr Trump since his storming election victory in November. The UKs Prince Edward and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were also in attendance. Steven Ford, the son of President Gerald Ford, read a tribute from his father during the ceremony, as the late president quipped that two presidents in a room is one too many while the five in attendance smiled and laughed. The five presidents of different parties, some of whom have been political opponents last gathered for the funeral of George H.W. Bush in December 2018. Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter were also in attendance. Eleven presidents have been honored with a state funeral, according to the Congressional Research Service. Like Carters, state funerals often include military honors, lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda, and a memorial service often at the National Cathedral. The former presidents also usually gather for the inauguration. But Trump opted not to attend after Mr. Bidens victory in 2020. Carter, who was 96 at the time, also wasnt in attendance, which marked the first time since he was in office that he skipped an inauguration. After the funeral, the Boeing 747 that is Air Force One when a sitting president is aboard will carry Mr Carter and his family back to Georgia. An invitation-only funeral will be held at Maranatha Baptist Church in tiny Plains, Georgia, where he taught Sunday School for decades after leaving office. Mr Carter will be buried next to his wife in a plot near the home they built before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and where they lived out their lives with the exception of four years in the Georgia Governors Mansion and four years in the White House. --Agencies",

        "date": "January 10, 2025 08:45 am",
        "content": "Ada Derana has uncovered a concerning case of fraud in Sri Lankas rice import trade, where certain individuals exploit government-granted import permits to deceive consumers. An investigation by Ada Derana revealed that a type of rice, closely resembling Basmati rice, is being imported at low cost and sold in the market under the guise of genuine Basmati rice, profiting at the expense of consumers. Sri Lanka permits the import of Basmati rice year-round, subject to a tax exceeding Rs. 300 per kilogram. However, traders are importing a similar variety of rice, which can be purchased at Rs. 220250 per kilogram, paying a significantly reduced tax of Rs. 65 per kilogram. These imports are then marketed at higher prices as Basmati rice, misleading buyers. When contacted for comments, Additional Director General of Sri Lanka Customs and Customs Media Spokesperson Seevali Arukgoda confirmed that the fraud can only be detected through laboratory testing of imported rice samples. He emphasized that Sri Lanka Customs lacks legal authority to address such cases, as the responsibility lies with the Consumer Affairs Authority.",

The delays have caused drivers to remain at the port for nearly a week, leading to severe congestion and operational challenges, said Mr. Manjula. The impact of these delays extends beyond logistics. The Wharf Workers Association has raised concerns over the potential 20 increase in the cost of imported goods as a direct result of prolonged container clearance times.

        "date": "January 10, 2025 11:39 am",
        "content": "The Los Angeles wildfires are on track to be among the costliest in US history, with losses already expected to exceed 135bn (109.7bn). In a preliminary estimate, private forecaster Accuweather said it expected losses of between 135bn-150bn as the blazes rip through an area that is home to some of the most expensive property in the US. The insurance industry is also bracing for a major hit, with analysts from firms such as Morningstar and JP Morgan forecasting insured losses of more than 8bn. Fire authorities say more than 5,300 structures have been destroyed by the Palisades blaze, while more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed by the Eaton Fire. With authorities still working to contain the fires, the scope of the losses is still unfolding. These fast-moving, wind-driven infernos have created one of the costliest wildfire disasters in modern US history, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. The 2018 fire that broke out in northern California near the town of Paradise currently ranks as the disaster with highest insured costs, at roughly 12.5bn, according to insurance giant Aon. That blaze, known as the Camp fire, killed 85 people and displaced more than 50,000. Aon said the high property values in this case mean it is likely to end up as one of the top five costliest wildfires on its list. Including properties that are not insured, the overall losses will be even bigger. Even after the situation is under control, Mr Porter said the events could have long-term effects on health and tourism. It also spells trouble for the insurance industry, which was already in crisis. Homeowners in the US with mortgages are typically required by banks to have property insurance. But companies have been hiking prices - or cancelling coverage altogether - in the face of increasing risks of natural disaster such as fires, floods and hurricanes. As companies stop offering coverage, people are turning in surging numbers to home insurance plans offered by state governments, which are typically more expensive while offering less protection. In California, the number of policies offered through the states Fair plan has more than doubled since 2020, from about 200,000 to more than 450,000 in September of last year. Areas hit by the fires rank as some of the places with highest take-up, according to data from the programme, which was already warning of risks to its financial stability. Denise Rappmund, a senior analyst at Moodys Ratings, said the fires would have widespread, negative impacts for the states broader insurance market. Increased recovery costs will likely drive up premiums and may reduce property insurance availability, she said, adding that the state was also facing potential long-term damage to property values and strain to public finances.

        "title": "SLBFE clarification on physical fitness test for Israeli agricultural jobs",
        "date": "January 10, 2025 06:31 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), Kosala Wickramasinghe, says that many problems have arisen due to the fact that politicians who were in power during the previous government have sent unqualified people to Israeli agricultural jobs. Issuing a statement, the SLBFE Chairman said that Sri Lanka has lost the 10,000 Israeli agricultural job quota due to those workers leaving for the agricultural jobs are now engaging in other jobs. The full statement is below, For the past two years, approximately 5,000 individuals have been awaiting employment opportunities in the country, promised by politicians who also collected money from them. In the past, workers were sent abroad without proper regulation, with politicians prioritizing their associates, who were transported in vehicles and buses. In such circumstances, how can we, as a country, safeguard our job market? We will take appropriate measures to address this situation. If someone claims our actions are unnecessary, they are mistaken. Previously, a quota of about 10,000 agricultural workers was allocated to Israel. However, only around 2,000 workers were sent. Many of these workers, who were not properly vetted, abandoned their assigned jobs and sought alternative employment. As a result, the Israeli government suspended the agricultural employment quota to Sri Lanka. We held extensive discussions to find ways to restore these job opportunities. The Israeli authorities have indicated that they may reconsider if qualified and physically fit workers are sent. To address this, we collaborated with the Sri Lankan Army and the health sector to establish a program focusing on health regulations and a 1.5-month training period to educate job seekers. Many people, under the previous administration, had invested heavily to secure these opportunitiesspending money on medical tests and training, often by mortgaging jewellery and valuables. It is our responsibility to resolve this situation and create a structured plan to secure these jobs. To this end, we identified job seekers, conducted several rounds of discussions, and implemented the new program based on the required criteria. Without such a program, these opportunities would be lost. When it was proposed to suspend agricultural worker dispatches entirely, we emphasized the necessity of conducting tests to ensure only qualified individuals are sent. This approach was accepted, and we are committed to providing these jobs to the deserving candidates. The tests were conducted with the candidates consent, and they were asked to provide their medical reports beforehand. Some candidates, however, failed to bring ECG reports. In such cases, we facilitated the required tests on-site using ECG machines. Out of about 600 candidates, approximately 500 were selected. A minor incident during the process led to some media reports alleging that participants were subjected to harsh, military-style tests. In reality, the physical fitness test required individuals to run 2 kilometers within 1012 minutesan achievable target for those with normal physical fitness. Around 80 of the participants successfully completed the test. Two individuals experienced health issues during the test: one had been sleep-deprived for three days, and another had an underlying illness. Both were quickly hospitalized and discharged without serious complications. The test was conducted under strict health and safety protocols, with ambulances and health officials on standby. We are confident that these physically qualified workers will excel in their jobs, paving the way for more agricultural employment opportunities in Israel. We urge young people to participate in this physical fitness program. By doing so, we can secure these vital opportunities and fulfill our responsibility to provide employment for our citizens.",

Heavy rains in the region over the past few days caused the Diwulwewa tank to overflow, culminating in a landslide near the tanks sluice early this morning (10). Local residents reported a water leak emerging from the embankment, which has since expanded into a major outflow. In response to the escalating situation, authorities have temporarily closed Divulwewa Maha Vidyalaya and suspended traffic along the main road connecting Galenbindunu Wewa to Dutuwewa and Yakalla. Efforts to contain the water flow have been underway since morning, with police, army personnel, and local residents working together to reinforce the embankment using sandbags.

        "title": "Trump spared jail, fine or probation at hush money sentencing days before inauguration",
        "date": "January 10, 2025 09:55 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not go to jail, pay a fine or be put on probation for his criminal conviction stemming from hush money paid to a porn star but the sentence imposed by a judge on Friday places a judgment of guilt on his record. Justice Juan Merchans sentencing of Trump, 78, to unconditional discharge, just days before his Jan. 20 inauguration, closes a case that had loomed over his bid to retake the White House. By granting an unconditional discharge, Merchan places a judgment of guilt on Trumps permanent record without any other legal penalty. Trump will be the first president to take office with a criminal conviction. Merchan said he was imposing the sentence because the U.S. Constitution shields presidents from U.S. prosecution. But he said the protections afforded to the office do not reduce the seriousness of a crime or justify its commission in any way. Despite the extraordinary breadth of those protections, one power they do not provide is the power to erase jury verdicts, Merchan said. Trump pleaded not guilty and has vowed to appeal the guilty verdict. He appeared with his lawyer on TV screens beamed to the courtroom with two American flags in the background. Its been a political witch hunt, Trump said before sentencing, wearing a red tie with white stripes. It was done to damage my reputation so I would lose the election and obviously that didnt work. Im totally innocent, I did nothing wrong, said Trump, who did not testify during the six-week trial last year. Now that he has been sentenced, he is free to pursue the appeal, a process which could take years and play out while he is serving a four-year term as president. Trump fought tooth and nail to avoid the spectacle of being compelled to appear before a state-level judge so close to when he is due to be sworn into office. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a last-minute bid by Trump to halt it. The six-week trial last year played out against the extraordinary backdrop of Trumps successful campaign to retake the White House. The sentencing marks the culmination of the first-ever criminal case brought against a U.S. president, past or present. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, charged Trump, a Republican, in March 2023 with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohens 130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump, who denied it. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in that election. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of all 34 counts on May 30. Prosecutors argued that despite the tawdry nature of the allegations, the case was an attempt to corrupt the 2016 election. Critics of the businessman-turned politician cited the charges and other legal entanglements he faced to bolster their contention that he was unfit for public office. Trump flipped the script. He argued the case - along with three other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits accusing him of fraud, defamation and sexual abuse - was an effort by opponents to weaponize the justice system against him and harm his reelection campaign. He frequently lashed out at prosecutors and witnesses, and Merchan ultimately fined Trump 10,000 for violating a gag order. As recently as Jan. 3, Trump called the judge a radical partisan in a post on his Truth Social platform. In a decision that day, Merchan said that setting aside the verdict would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways and wrote that Trumps behavior during the trial showed disrespect for the judiciary. Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole, Merchan said. A POLITICAL MIXED BAG The hush money case was widely viewed as less serious than the three other criminal cases Trump faced, in which he was accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss and retaining classified documents after leaving the White House. Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases. But Braggs case was the only one to reach trial in the face of an onslaught of challenges from Trumps lawyers. After Trumps Nov. 5 election victory, federal prosecutors backed off their two cases due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. The remaining state case, brought in Georgia over efforts to reverse the 2020 election results in that state, is in limbo after a court in December disqualified the lead prosecutor on the case. The hush money case was a mixed bag politically. Contributions to Trumps campaign surged after he was indicted in March 2023, likely helping him vanquish his rivals for the Republican nomination. During the trial, polling showed a majority of voters took the charges seriously, and his standing among Republicans slipped after the guilty verdict. But the case quickly faded from the headlines, particularly after President Joe Bidens disastrous debate performance led him to drop out with Vice President Kamala Harris replacing him on the Democratic ticket, and after a gunmans bullet came inches from killing Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Merchan initially scheduled the sentencing for July 11, but pushed it back multiple times at Trumps request. In agreeing in September to defer the sentencing until after the election, the judge wrote that he was wary of being perceived as placing his thumb on the scales. Falsification of business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. While Trump would have been unlikely to get jail time due to his advanced age and lack of a criminal history, legal experts said it was not impossible, especially given his gag order violations. Trumps victory and looming inauguration made a sentence of jail or probation even less practical. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Venezuelas Maduro sworn in as US raises reward for his capture",
        "date": "January 11, 2025 07:50 am",
        "content": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose nearly 12 years in office have been marked by deep economic and social crisis, was sworn in for a third term on Friday, despite a six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand aside, and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture. Maduro, president since 2013, was declared the winner of Julys election by both Venezuelas electoral authority and top court, though detailed tallies confirming his victory have never been published. Venezuelas opposition says ballot box-level tallies show a landslide win for its former candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, who is recognized as president-elect by several countries, including the United States. International election observers said the vote was not democratic. The months since the election have seen Gonzalezs flight to Spain in September, his ally Maria Corina Machado going into hiding in Venezuela, and the detentions of high-profile opposition figures and protesters. Gonzalez has been on a whistle-stop tour of the Americas this week and had promised to return to Venezuela. But Machado, appearing in a video posted on social media on Friday, said the moment was not right for his return. Edmundo will come to Venezuela to be sworn in as constitutional president of Venezuela at the right time, Machado said. Today, it isnt viable for Edmundo to enter Venezuela. Ive asked him not to do so because his integrity is fundamental for the final defeat of the regime and the transition to democracy, which is very close. Maduro consolidated the coup and the violation of our constitution, Machado added, calling for street protests. Its time to do whatever is necessary to restore it. The government, which has accused the opposition of fomenting fascist plots against it, has said Gonzalez will be arrested if he returns and offered a 100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Soon, very soon, whatever they do, we will manage to enter Venezuela and put an end to this tragedy, Gonzalez said in his own remarks from the Dominican Republic, asking the military to ignore illegal orders from Maduro and cease any repression. In the latest in a series of punitive steps, the outgoing Biden administration increased its reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro on drug trafficking charges to 25 million, from a previous 15 million. It also issued a 25 million reward for Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and a 15 million reward for Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, as well as new sanctions against eight other officials including the head of state oil company PDVSA Hector Obregon. The U.S. indicted Maduro and others on narcotics and corruption charges, among others, in 2020. Maduro has rejected the accusations. The U.S. move coincided with sanctions by Britain and the European Union, each targeting 15 officials including members of the National Electoral Council and the security forces, and Canadian sanctions targeting 14 current and former officials. The Maduro government has always rejected all sanctions, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an economic war designed to cripple Venezuela. The outgoing government of the United States doesnt know how to take revenge on us, Maduro said during his inauguration speech, without directly mentioning sanctions. The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sanctions, while U.S. officials declined to comment on possible further sanctions, including on the oil industry. Maduro and his allies have cheered what they say is the countrys resilience despite the measures, though they have historically blamed some economic hardships and shortages on sanctions. Maduros inauguration was illegitimate, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, and the U.S. will not recognize him as president. The Venezuelan people and world know the truth  Maduro clearly lost the 2024 presidential election and has no right to claim the presidency, Blinken said. Later on Friday, Padrino led members of the armed forces in a separate ceremony, where they swore complete loyalty to Maduro. DETENTION DETAILS Both Gonzalez and Machado are being investigated by the attorney generals office for alleged conspiracy, but only Gonzalez has a public warrant out for his arrest. Machados first public appearance since August at an anti-government march in Caracas on Thursday was marred by a brief detention. Machado said in her Friday video that she was stopped by the police after leaving the march on Thursday, pulled off the motorcycle where she was a passenger and put on another. She said she was later told to film several videos and that she would then be released. One of the motorcyclists who had been accompanying her was shot and arrested, she said. One video shared on social media and by government officials showed her sitting on a curb and recounting losing her wallet. The government scoffed at the incident and denied any involvement, saying it was an opposition attempt to stoke sympathy for Machado. Some 42 people have been detained for political reasons since Tuesday, judicial NGO Foro Penal said. Maduro was sworn in at the national assembly in Caracas and said he was taking his oath in the name of sixteenth-century Indigenous leader Guaicaipuro and late President Hugo Chavez, his mentor, among others. May this new presidential term be a period of peace, of prosperity, of equality and the new democracy, Maduro said, adding he would convene a commission dedicated to constitutional reform. This act is possible because Venezuela is peaceful, in full exercise of its national sovereignty, of its popular sovereignty, of its national independence, Maduro said. Some 2,000 invitees from 125 countries attended the inauguration, according to the government. Cubas President Miguel Diaz-Canel and Nicaraguas President Daniel Ortega, staunch allies of Maduro, attended, as did Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russias lower house of parliament. Bolivian President Luis Arce congratulated Maduro on social media. ECONOMIC TROUBLES Venezuela closed its borders and airspace to Colombia for 72 hours starting at 0500 local time (1000 GMT), the foreign ministry in Bogota said in a statement, adding the border on the Colombian side would remain open. The opposition, non-governmental organizations and international bodies such as the United Nations have for years decried increasing repression of opposition political parties, activists and independent media in Venezuela. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said the country is being run by a dictator. The Venezuelan government has repeatedly accused the opposition of plotting with foreign governments and agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency to commit acts of sabotage and terrorism. The government said this week it had detained seven mercenaries, including a high-ranking FBI official and a U.S. military official. In recent years, Venezuelas economy has experienced a prolonged crisis marked by triple-digit inflation and the exodus of more than 7 million migrants seeking better opportunities abroad. Many of Machados supporters, among them retired Venezuelans who would like to see their children and grandchildren return to the country, say jobs, inflation and unreliable public services are among their top concerns. The government, meanwhile, has employed orthodox methods to try to tamp down inflation, with some success. Maduro said this month that the economy grew 9 last year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

According to the Irrigation Department, the danger of a breach of the bund remains critical. The issue was first detected last morning (10) when a leak emerged in the earthen bund near the south sluice of the reservoir. The sluice, situated approximately 27 feet deep, is subject to high water pressure, which has compounded the risk of further damage. Efforts to mitigate the situation were undertaken yesterday, with personnel from the Irrigation Department, Army, Police, and local villagers working collaboratively to plug the leak using sandbags. By afternoon, they had temporarily stemmed the water flow. However, reports indicate that the leak has since resumed at the previously damaged section of the bund. The Irrigation Department has issued warnings that if the breach of the bund occurs, several villages could be severely impacted. As a precautionary measure, a total of 30 families from the area have already been evacuated to safer locations.",

        "title": "Pluto may have captured its largest moon with a kiss, scientists say",
        "date": "January 11, 2025 02:38 pm",
        "content": "For decades, astronomers have tried to determine how Pluto acquired its unusually large moon Charon, which is about half the size of the dwarf planet. Now, new research suggests that Pluto and Charon briefly came together billions of years ago in a newly discovered kiss and capture collision. Scientists have long theorized that Charon formed much like Earths moon, which was created after a Mars-size object slammed into our planet. The impact sent molten debris from Earth flying into space, which eventually came together in orbit around our world and cooled to form the moon. But these theories didnt account for the fact that Pluto and Charon may have more structural integrity as icy, rocky bodies on the frigid edge of the solar system. Pluto and Charon are different  theyre smaller, colder and made primarily of rock and ice, said Adeene Denton, lead study author of the research published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Instead, Pluto and Charon likely remained much the same after they collided, spinning together to form an object shaped like a cosmic snowman before separating into the binary system they have today, the study authors said. Binary systems form when two celestial bodies orbit around a common center of mass, like figure skaters who spin while holding hands, according to the authors. Most planetary collision scenarios are classified as hit and run or graze and merge, said Denton, a NASA postdoctoral program fellow at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. What weve discovered is something entirely different  a kiss and capture scenario where the bodies collide, stick together briefly and then separate while remaining gravitationally bound. (Denton conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.) This new type of celestial collision uncovered by Denton and her colleagues could shed light on how planets form and evolve as well as how other bodies in the outer reaches of our solar system gained their own moons. And the new research may offer evidence for a subsurface ocean beneath Plutos icy crust. How planets gain moons Charon and Earths moon are both a large fraction of the size of the main body they orbit, which is unlike other smaller moons orbiting planets throughout our solar system. (Pluto has four smaller moons besides Charon.) For example, Mars is orbited by two tiny potato-shaped moons called Phobos and Deimos, which are likely two asteroids that were captured by the red planets gravity. But that type of formation is unlikely for objects as large as our moon or Charon, Denton said. Other examples of collisions are the hit and run, when an impactor hits a planet and keeps going, or the graze and merge, when an object strikes a planet and they come together, Denton said. Simpler models from the early 2000s simulating how Pluto and Charon came to be in their current orientation supported the idea that some object collided with Pluto to create Charon. In that scenario, the colliding material was regarded as a strengthless fluid, meaning Pluto and Charon would have resembled two swirling, bending blobs, like in a lava lamp, Denton said. Within the last five years, there have been advancements in simulations for impact formation models, which allowed researchers to include material strength properties of celestial bodies  such as Pluto as a rocky core covered in ice. Pluto contains more rock than ice, while Charon is 50 rock and 50 ice, Denton said. When Denton and her colleagues simulated a collision including the structural properties of Pluto and Charon, they were better able to determine the impact momentum exchanged between both bodies as well as the end result. While Pluto and Charon likely exchanged some material during the impact, both remained largely intact because of their composition, sticking together to form a snowman-like figure and rotating as one body until Pluto essentially pushed Charon into a more distant orbit over time. We were definitely surprised by the kiss part of kiss-and-capture, Denton said in an email. There hasnt really been a kind of impact before where the two bodies only temporarily merge before re-separating. The findings suggest that Charon could be as ancient as Pluto. Researchers arent entirely sure when the impact occurred, but it likely happened about 4 billion years ago, early on in the history of the solar system, which is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old. We know that it happened fairly early on, because thats when giant collisions happened  and by early, I mean in the tens of millions of years after solar system formation, around the same time as the (formation of Earths moon), Denton said. The study is a great example of advances in numerical geophysics, said Dr. Katarina Miljkovic, professor and deputy head of the School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Curtin University in Australia. She was not involved in the new research. They provide an elegant solution to the origin of the Pluto-Charon system, where by treating the physical properties of the planetary bodies with higher fidelity resulted in a more feasible impact and capture scenario for the origin of this system, Miljkovic wrote in an email. A subsurface ocean Pluto belongs to a group of objects that distantly orbit the sun called the Kuiper Belt, where thousands of icy remnants left over from the formation of the solar system linger. Eight of the 10 largest Kuiper Belt Objects have large moons like Charon, Denton said, which means that kiss and capture collisions may have occurred across the Kuiper Belt as the solar system formed. Adding more physical realism to the impact models  which we sometimes have to wait on while technology catches up with the complexity of the natural world  changed the answer and opened up a new suite of possible histories for Pluto, Charon, and a host of other Kuiper Belt Objects, said Alyssa Rhoden, a staff scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, in an email. Rhoden and Denton both began working through the NASA Astrobiology Postdoctoral Program in September, but Rhoden was not part of the Pluto study. Some scientists suspect an ocean could lie beneath Plutos thick crust of ice, but questions have been raised about how such an ocean could form in this frigid world. The new collision scenario supports the formation of an ocean because such impacts heat up celestial bodies, Denton said. For example, Charons collision with Pluto would have raised the temperature of the the dwarf planets ice shell, which may have caused it to melt and form a subsurface ocean. Rhoden said she is curious whether such changes also occurred on other Kuiper Belt Objects with large moons. Is there something special about the Charon-forming impact  or the characteristics of Pluto and the impactor  that led Pluto to become a rare (Kuiper Belt Object) ocean world? Rhoden said. Its also possible that after Charon separated from Pluto, moving from a close orbit to a more distant one, both bodies would have experienced tidal heating. This process occurs when the interiors of planets or moons are heated due to the gravitational forces between two bodies in orbit. This is important because were not sure what thermal conditions Pluto may have possessed prior to impact, Denton said. If Pluto formed as a colder body without an ocean, then the giant impact may provide the key tipping point to then push Pluto towards forming and sustaining a subsurface ocean.

        "content": "At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Sri Lankas President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will pay a state visit to China from January 14 to 17, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Friday. The upcoming visit will be President Dissanayakes first visit to China after taking office, and is of great importance to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations. During the visit, President Xi Jinping will hold talks with Dissanayake, and Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress will meet with him respectively, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a press conference on Friday. China and Sri Lanka have long been each others friend and close neighbor. Since our two countries established diplomatic ties in 1957, the bilateral relationship has stood the test of the changing international landscape, always maintained sound and steady growth, and set up a fine example of friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries different in size, Guo said. China stands ready to work with Sri Lanka through the upcoming visit to carry forward our time-honored friendship, deepen political mutual trust, and expand high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and practical cooperation in various fields for continuous new progress in advancing the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership featuring sincerity, mutual support and ever-lasting friendship as well as more benefit for the two peoples, the spokesperson said. Dissanayake was sworn in as the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, Sri Lanka on September 23, 2024, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Dissanayakes first visit to China since taking office presents a valuable opportunity to deepen bilateral cooperation, particularly under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Sri Lanka, strategically located in the Indian Ocean, has become a key partner in the BRI, which has already brought tangible benefits to the country. The Sri Lankan government aims to engage with Chinese leaders to explore ways to better align with the initiative in supporting Sri Lankas economic recovery, Hu Zhiyong, a professor from Zhejiang International Studies University and also research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. Indian media have paid close attention to Dissanayakes visit to China. For example, Indian Express reported about Dissanayakes visit to China on Tuesday and noted that Dissanayakes visit to China follows his visit to India in December. The report also mentioned Dissanayakes reaffirmation of the commitment to advancing high-quality development under BRI. Indian medias focus on the Sri Lankan presidents visit to China underscores their growing anxiety. They have long considered South Asian countries to be within Indias sphere of influence, but struggle to provide concrete support to help these countries address their challenges. At the same time, Indian media are unwilling to accept China or any other countrys growing presence in the region, which fuels their emphasis on the debt trap rhetoric and the so-called China threat narrative, said Hu. Many countries in the region, including Sri Lanka, are now adopting independent foreign policies and resisting external pressure. They seek to cooperate with other nations in ways that best support their own development, said the expert. Source: Global Times --Agencies",

        "content": "The two black boxes on the Boeing jet involved in the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, the transport ministry said on Saturday. South Korean investigators previously said the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were key to finding out the cause of last months crash that killed 179 people. It happened about four minutes after the pilot of the airliner operated by Jeju Air reported a bird strike. Authorities investigating the crash plan to analyse what caused the black boxes to stop recording, the ministry said in a statement. The voice recorder was initially analysed in South Korea, and, when data was found to be missing, sent to a U.S. National Transportation Safety Board laboratory, the ministry said. Black box recorders collect data on communications involving pilots in the cockpit as well as how the aircraft systems perform in-flight. Jeju Air 7C2216, which departed the Thai capital Bangkok for Muan in southwestern South Korea, belly-landed and overshot the regional airports runway on Dec. 29, exploding into flames after hitting an embankment. Only two people survived - crew members who were sitting in the tail section. Two minutes before the pilots declared a Mayday emergency call, air traffic control gave caution for bird activity. Sim Jai-dong, a former transport ministry accident investigator, said the discovery of the missing data from the budget airlines Boeing 737-800 jets crucial final minutes was surprising and suggests all power, including backup, may have been cut, which is rare. The transport ministry said other data available would be used in the investigation and that it would ensure the probe is transparent and that information is shared with the victims families. Some members of the victims families have said the transport ministry should not be taking the lead in the investigation and that it should involve independent experts, including those recommended by the families. The investigation has also focused on the embankment the plane crashed into, which was designed to prop up a localiser system used to assist aircraft landing, including why it was built with such rigid material and so close to the end of the runway.

Her request spread quickly through a network of powerful women. Actors including Sharon Stone and Halle Berry responded, providing sweaters, shoes, clothing, handbags, belts, pajamas and more pulled from their own collections. Im packing up my entire closet, Berry wrote on Instagram. If you live in the Southern California area, I urge you to do the same. This is something we can do right now. Cooper, who also runs a home goods store called COOP, cleared half the space to create a pop-up shopping experience for displaced people to take what they need. Many Angelenos lost entire homes in the fires, which were still burning on Friday. Stone circulated information about the donations on social media, which helped attract publicity. She and her sister, Kelly Stone, contributed clothing, bedding and more, and Kelly volunteered to assist shoppers. The first thing they need when they come in the store is a hug, Kelly Stone said. She then said to shoppers, Show me pictures of yourself, how do you dress? so she could direct them to sweaters or trench coats that reflected their style. At the store on Friday, a therapy dog named Jackie Robinson greeted people at the door. Inside, they looked through racks of dresses and coats, stacks of denim, shelves of shoes and baskets of handbags. Offerings ranged from packages of fresh underwear from Target to new or lightly used Zara dresses and some Gucci and Ferragamo shoes in the mix. Cooper said she received donations and volunteer support from power players across Los Angeles, including actors, executives, lawyers, restaurant owners and moms. Her network of real estate agents in New York was sending gift cards, she said. One Hollywood stylist came with two large bags of items from her closet and was enlisted to help organize the store for shoppers over the weekend. I know people who have lost everything, and even people I dont know Im devastated for, said Lisa Cera, who has worked for celebrities including the Kardashians and Lenny Kravitz. I decided Im just going to bring whatever I can. Ellen Bennett was choosing items for her 72-year-old mother, who lost her home in the Eaton fire on the east side of Los Angeles. Bennett said she selected the basics, including socks, sweaters, pants, a jacket and a pair of running shoes. She left her house with her dog and a bag and just a few things. She thought she would come back, Bennett said of her mother, adding, Its so special and beautiful that in this time of tragedy, people are rising up and helping each other. Store owner Cooper said she helped a man find a pair of sneakers so he could run on the beach, something he had not done since the fires erupted. She said she was overwhelmed by the response to her idea to help. This is a city of love, and everybody wants to support each other, Cooper said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Government of Sri Lanka has announced new excise duty rates for vehicle imports, effective immediately, in a special gazette notification issued today (11). This marks a significant step as the country resumes vehicle imports in February after a five-year suspension. The gazette notification was signed by the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Economic Development. Under the new policy, excise duties range from 200 to 300 for vehicles that are not more than 10 years old from their date of manufacture. The rates are determined based on the engine cylinder capacity and motor power, as detailed in the gazette. Meanwhile, certain modified vehicles of specific headings and categories are subjected to these steep rates. The excise duties are categorized based on vehicle age, engine capacity, fuel type, and configuration. Key highlights include: Passenger Vehicles: Duties range from 200 to 300 for vehicles not exceeding 10 years from their date of manufacture. Modified Vehicles: Vehicles under specific headings, such as those carrying fewer than 13 passengers, face duties of 300 if modified and less than two years old. Engine Capacity-Based Rates: Passenger vehicles with engine capacities between 1,000cc and 1,500cc are taxed at Rs. 3,850 to Rs. 4,450 per cubic centimeter (cc), while larger engines exceeding 3,000cc attract duties of up to Rs. 13,300 per cc depending on their age. Additional rates apply to hybrid and electric vehicles, with duties influenced by motor types and battery capacities. Vehicles with only electric motors face duties of 200 for those older than 3.5 years and up to 300 for newer units. Excise Duty by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

Speaking at a press conference today (11), Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, President of the alliance, criticized the tender decision, which he claims was made despite the companys controversial status. A serious tender transaction has occurred within the SPC in the past few weeks. In June last year, the SPC called for tenders to purchase a total of 270,000 bottles of disinfectant used to clean patients mouths. A decision was reached on December 12, awarding the tender to the lowest bidder. However, this company was previously blacklisted by the SPC and had been barred from further financial dealings. This is a Bangladeshi company and also owes a surcharge of Rs. 127 million to the Sri Lankan government. Dr. Sanjeewa stated. When approached for a response, a spokesperson for the SPC stated that an investigation would be necessary before issuing any official comments on the matter.",

        "date": "January 12, 2025 08:41 am",
        "content": "Firefighters are making an all-out assault to prevent the largest of the deadly wildfires that is threatening Los Angeles from spreading into one of the citys most exclusive neighbourhoods. Aerial crews have been bombarding the flaming hills with water and fire retardant to hold back the Palisades fire, which has expanded an additional 1,000 acres and is now menacing Brentwood. Officials have been on the defensive amid mounting anger at how hydrants ran dry as firefighters struggled to contain the fast-moving blazes. Winds are expected to pick up again overnight, further fanning the flames that have already left at least 11 people dead. LA County had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak, said Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath on Saturday. Firefighters have made modest progress against the worst of the infernos, the Palisades fire, which has scorched nearly 23,000 acres and is 11 contained. But the conflagration has spread into the Mandeville Canyon neighbourhood, sparking evacuation orders for swathes of Brentwood, a ritzy enclave where Arnold Schwarzenegger, Disney chief executive Bob Iger and NBA star LeBron James have homes. Also in the evacuation zone is the Getty Center, a hilltop museum that holds more than 125,000 artworks, including masterpieces by Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Rubens, Monet and Degas. The building is undamaged so far. The second-biggest blaze, the Eaton fire, has razed more than 14,000 acres and was 15 contained. Firefighters have mostly contained two smaller blazes, the Kenneth and Hurst fires. But the National Weather Service warned that the gusty Santa Ana winds that whipped up the fires at the outset would increase again on Saturday and into Sunday. Seven neighbouring states, the federal government and Canada and Mexico have rushed resources to California. No cause has yet been established for the fires. The two biggest ones combined have razed an area more than twice the size of Manhattan. Some 153,000 residents are under mandatory evacuation orders and another 166,000 have been warned they may have to flee, too. The political repercussions have begun. On Friday, Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat with rumoured White House aspirations, ordered an investigation into why a key reservoir was out of service and some fire hydrants ran dry. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley complained about the shortage. When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect theres going to be water, she said. Chief Crowley has also attacked city leadership for cutting her departments budget and eliminating mechanic positions, which she said had resulted in more than 100 fire apparatuses being out of service. On Saturday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass - who has been criticised for being in Ghana attending the inauguration of the African countrys president when the fires erupted in LA on Tuesday, hinted at her tensions with Chief Crowley. Let me be clear about something, Bass told a news conference, the fire chief and I are focused on fighting these fires and saving lives, and any differences that we might have will be worked out in private. More than 70,000 people have signed a change.org petition demanding the mayors immediate resignation. As fears of looting grow, a sunset-to-sunrise curfew is being strictly enforced in evacuated areas, official said. Newsom announced on Saturday that he would double the number of National Guard on the ground to keep communities safe, deploying 1,680 troops. About two dozen arrests have been made, including for burglary, looting and curfew violations. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said cadaver dogs are helping 40 search and rescue team scour razed neighbourhoods. The death toll is expected to rise once house-to-house searches are conducted. The fires were so intense that wheel alloys on cars were melted to puddles of liquid metal. Rick McGeagh, an estate agent, told Reuters news agency that in his Pacific Palisades neighbourhood only six out of 60 homes survived. All that remained standing at his house was a statue of the Virgin Mary. Everything else is ash and rubble, said the 61-year-old father-of-three. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "January 12, 2025 01:50 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Vehicle Importers Association has raised concerns about the potential hike in vehicle import taxes, which are currently at approximately 300. According to the association, taxes could climb to 400, 500, or even 600 for certain vehicles. The president of the association, Prasad Manage explained that the sharp increase in taxes is due to multiple layers of taxation. There is a special import tax based on the vehicles value. Additionally, theres a luxury tax, and all three are added to the CIF value. On top of that, an 18 VAT is applied. This results in four types of taxes determining the final cost of a vehicle, he said. The association predicts that taxes on some vehicles will increase significantly. For instance: Taxes on a Wagon R could rise from Rs. 1.6 million to over Rs. 1.8 million. Taxes on a Vitz could jump from Rs. 2 million to approximately Rs. 2.4 million. Taxes on vehicles like the Toyota Aqua, Corolla, and Axio, previously Rs. 5.7 million to Rs. 6.6 million, could now exceed Rs. 6.6 million. While the cost of importing vehicles will rise sharply, the association noted that the prices of vehicles already in the local market are likely to see only a slight increase. Despite the rising taxes, the association urged the public not to panic. Mr. Manage encouraged potential buyers to wait until new vehicles arrive in Sri Lanka, as the supply situation may stabilize. Sri Lanka imposed strict restrictions on vehicle imports in 2020 during the severe economic downturn. However, with the implementation of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program and the recovery of foreign reserves, optimism about vehicle imports returned. In September 2024, the Cabinet approved the phased import of motor vehicles and wheeled items under 304 Harmonized System (HS) Codes, effective from February 2025. However, a recent gazette notification issued by the President introduced new excise duty amendments on vehicle imports. These adjustments increase excise duties on both fuel-powered and electric vehicles, depending on cylinder capacity and vehicle age.",

They found that 24 were at risk of extinction  classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered  due to compounding threats from pollution, dams, water extraction, agriculture, invasive species, climate change and other disruptions. Most species dont have just one threat putting them at risk of extinction, but many threats acting together, said Sayer, a study-co-author. The tally, published in the journal Nature, is the first that time researchers have analyzed the global risk to freshwater species. Previous studies have focused on land animals including including mammals, birds and reptiles. Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study, called it a long-awaited and hugely important paper. Almost every big river in North America and Europe is massively modified through damming, putting freshwater species at risk, he said. In South America, the vast Amazon River ecosystem also faces threats from deforestation, wildfires and illegal gold mining, said Charvet. Illegal fires to clear forest result in waves of ash polluting the river, and unlicensed gold miners dump mercury into the water, she said. Rivers and wetlands concentrate everything that happens around them, she said. If something goes really wrong, like an acid or oil spill, you can threaten an entire species. Theres nowhere else for these animals to go. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "What ignited the deadly California wildfires?",
        "date": "January 12, 2025 04:47 pm",
        "content": "Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 11 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area. In hilly, upscale Pacific Palisades, home to Hollywood stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal who lost houses in the fire, officials have placed the origin of the wind-whipped blaze behind a home on Piedra Morada Drive, which sits above a densely wooded arroyo. While lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton Fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes. The next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines. John Lentini, owner of Scientific Fire Analysis in Florida, who has investigated large fires in California including the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, said the size and scope of the blaze doesnt change the approach to finding out what caused it. This was once a small fire, Lentini said. People will focus on where the fire started, determine the origin and look around the origin and determine the cause. So far there has been no official indication of arson in either blaze, and utility lines have not yet been identified as a cause either. Utilities are required to report to the California Public Utilities Commission when they know of electric incidents potentially associated with a wildfire, Terrie Prosper, the commissions communications director, said via email. CPUC staff then investigate to see if there were violations of state law. The 2017 Thomas Fire, one of the largest fires in state history, was sparked by Southern California Edison power lines that came into contact during high wind, investigators determined. The blaze killed two people and charred more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers). On Friday, Southern California Edison filed a report with the CPUC related to the Eaton Fire in the hills near Pasadena, an area the utility serves. Edison said it has not received any suggestions that its equipment was involved in the ignition of that fire, but that it filed the report with state utilities regulators out of an abundance of caution after receiving evidence preservation notices from insurance company lawyers. Preliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire, the utility reported. While lightning, arson and utility lines are the most common causes, debris burning and fireworks are also common causes. But fires are incited by myriad sources, including accidents. In 2021, a couples gender reveal stunt started a large fire that torched close to 36 square miles (about 90 square kilometers) of terrain, destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton. The Eaton and Palisades fires were still burning with little containment on Friday. Winds softened, but there was no rain in the forecast as the flames moved through miles of dry landscape. Its going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops, Lentini said. Theyre not going to put that thing out until its ready to go out. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "January 12, 2025 07:10 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, during a meeting held today (12) at the Presidential Secretariat with representatives from Sri Lanka Customs and port-related service providers, has reached several important agreements aimed at resolving the ongoing delays in the clearance of imported containers. The President instructed officials to take immediate action to eliminate the delays within the next four days, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. He also engaged in detailed discussions about the issues faced by state institutions, including Sri Lanka Customs, as well as the challenges encountered by port service providers. While emphasizing the necessity of implementing short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans for port sector development, the President underscored the urgent need for a joint effort by all parties to address the current crisis. As a result, both public and private sector stakeholders agreed to work together towards an immediate resolution, the PMD mentioned. To expedite the clearance process, Sri Lanka Customs officers agreed to operate continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, a 5-acre plot of land in the Bloemendhal area was allocated for storing containers pending investigation, with plans to release 2 acres by January 31 and the remaining portion by February 28. Addressing the issue of congestion caused by idle container vehicles at port terminals, the government agreed to provide land in the Peliyagoda area for parking these vehicles, thereby easing the traffic at the terminals, the PMD added. Further, delays caused by regulatory agencies such as the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), the Department of Food Commissioner, and the Plant Quarantine Division were highlighted during the discussion. It was revealed that staff shortages in these institutions were a significant factor contributing to the delays. In response, the President directed the relevant authorities to fill these vacancies promptly and to enhance welfare allowances for the officers of these institutions to ensure a more efficient clearance process. Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation, Bimal Ratnayake, stated that if there are any financial requirements related to this process, they can be provided by the Ministry of Ports. Additionally, private associations requested the President to take disciplinary action against clerical staff who fail to report for duty on time during the container clearance process. The Minister further emphasized that it is the responsibility of the respective private companies to ensure that their employees report to work promptly. Importers agreed that food-related products must be accompanied by mandatory certificates issued by foreign laboratories following proper testing, and in the event of any violations, appropriate legal action will be taken in accordance with government regulations. A decision was made to reduce the period during which containers can be stored within the port premises without charge to two days. Furthermore, it is anticipated that this period will be further reduced to one day starting from June, the statement highlighted. Minister Ratnayake also noted that this expedited clearance process would continue until June 30 and stressed the need for all stakeholders, including the port, customs, and private service providers, to work together as one unified team. The meeting was attended by the Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Professor Anil Jayanta Fernando; Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; Senior Additional Secretaries to the President, Russell Aponsu and Kapila Perera; officials from Sri Lanka Customs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, and Sri Lanka Standards Institution; officers from the Department of Food Commissioner; representatives from the Association of Sri Lankan Shipping Agents, the Association of Container Operators, and the Association of Container Transporters; as well as officers involved in import and export clearance operations, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "January 12, 2025 09:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan civil society groups and activists are mobilizing to save more than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off the Indian Ocean island nation last month following a government announcement that they will be deported. A group of about 100 Rohingya refugees, which reportedly included over two dozen children, was rescued off the coast of the northeastern Mullaitivu district on Dec. 19. Several protests were recently organized in Mullaitivu and the capital Colombo after Sri Lankas Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala announced on Jan. 3 that the government was in talks with Myanmar authorities over the deportation of the Rohingya refugees. These are stateless people, they dont have a home to go to, social activist Thasneema Dahlan, who took part in a protest in Colombo on Friday, told Arab News. The Rohingya are massacred and chased and terrorized in their own home, and that is why they fled their own country looking for greener pastures elsewhere. The mostly Muslim Rohingya  the worlds most persecuted minority, according to the UN  have faced decades of oppression in Myanmar. In 2017, more than 730,000 Rohingya from Rakhine State were forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh to escape a brutal military crackdown that UN experts have referred to as a genocidal campaign, amid evidence of ethnic cleansing, mass rape, and killings. As Rakhine became a focal point in Myanmars intensifying nationwide civil war, hundreds of Rohingya have been fleeing the country in recent weeks through dangerous sea crossings, often on rickety boats. Last year, more than 7,800 people made such attempts, according to the UN refugee agency  an 80 percent increase compared with 2023. Their objective wasnt to get to Sri Lanka. Their objective was to get somewhere, anywhere where they could survive, Dahlan said. We are urging the government to  please not send them back, not repatriate them, not deport them, because that is just sending them back to death. Sri Lanka, which is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and its 1967 protocol, is a transit point for refugees until the UNHCR helps them resettle in another country. In 2022, its navy also rescued about 100 Rohingya refugees, who have been under the care of local NGOs as they await resettlement. Sri Lankan activists have also filed petitions with the government, urging authorities to relocate the new group of refugees from the Keppapulavu Air Force base in Mullaitivu, where they have stayed since Dec. 23. According to protesters, aid agencies, including the UN, have been stopped from meeting the Rohingya. Sheltering the refugees under a militarized environment is incompatible with international humanitarian norms and basic human values, the North-East Coordinating Committee, which organized the Mullaitivu protest on Thursday, said in a letter. Ruki Fernando, a human rights activist based in Colombo, said the Rohingya refugees should be kept in a place under civil administration, not military. Many Sri Lankans have been refugees. We need to help others. Its our legal obligation  under customary international law, non-refoulement is prohibited. It means no one fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution should be sent back, Fernando told Arab News, referring to the hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils who fled the countrys civil war between 1983 and 2009. We also have moral, ethical obligations to welcome, care and support those in distress. Our religious and spiritual values teach us this. Source: Arab News --Agencies",

        "content": "The construction of the marina in Port City Colombo will promote Sri Lanka to become a new hotspot for regional tourism and investment, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath has said. At a groundbreaking ceremony held on Friday, Herath said the port city is an important platform for Sri Lanka to attract foreign investment and enhance its international image. The development of the marina will fill the gap in high-end maritime services in South Asia, and attract more high-net-worth tourists. The construction of the port city will promote cultural and economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and China, and help Sri Lanka achieve its tourism revenue goals, Herath said. Harsha Amarasekera, chairman of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission, said the port city will continue to inject new impetus into Sri Lankas economy. The commencement of the new project will not only help the port city create more employment opportunities, but will also more effectively attract international high-end brands to settle in, boosting Sri Lankas economic recovery, said Amarasekera. According to reports, the marina commercial project covers an area of about 20,400 square meters and has a construction area of about 49,000 square meters. Source: Xinhua --Agencies",

        "date": "January 13, 2025 07:45 am",
        "content": "Firefighters scrambled Sunday to make further progress against wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed 16 people in the Los Angeles area as forecasters again warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson. Youre going to have really strong gusty Santa Ana winds, a very dry atmosphere and still very dry brush, so we still have some very critical fire weather conditions out there, Thompson said at a community meeting Saturday night. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said 70 additional water trucks arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. We are prepared for the upcoming wind event, Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft Sunday will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said. Fierce Santa Anas have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. Twelve people were missing within the Eaton Fire zone and four were missing from the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Luna added that dozens more reports might have come in Sunday morning and investigators were reconciling whether some of the missing might be among the dead. There are no children among those reported missing, he said. Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 16 over the weekend. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroners office said in a statement Saturday evening. Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. Officials also were building an online database to allow evacuated residents to see if their homes were damaged or destroyed. In the meantime, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods. There are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public, Crowley said at a Sunday morning briefing. Theres no power, theres no water, theres broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures. Officials warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, with more than 700 residents taking refuge in nine shelters, Luna said. Officials said most of the orders in the Palisades area were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings expire Wednesday evening. Please rest assured that first thing Thursday we will begin talking about repopulation, Marrone said. By Sunday morning, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades Fire was 11 contained and containment on the Eaton Fire reached 27. Those two blazes accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Minimal growth was expected Sunday for the Eaton Fire with continued smoldering and creeping of flames, an LA County Fire Department incident report said. Most evacuation orders for the area have been lifted. After a fierce battle Saturday, firefighters managed to fight back flames in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities near Pacific Palisades not far from the coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. The fire ran through chaparral-covered hillsides and also briefly threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. Looting continues to be a concern, with authorities reporting more arrests as the devastation grows. Michael Lorenz, a captain with the Los Angeles Police Department, said seven people have been arrested in recent days, with two suspects posing as firefighters coming and in and out of houses. Asked exactly how many looters have been arrested, Lorenz said he couldnt give a precise number but that officers were detaining about 10 people a day. California National Guard troops arrived Friday to help guard properties. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X Saturday that California will NOT allow for looting. The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures. No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nations costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between 135 billion and 150 billion. In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the fires could end up being the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. I think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope, he said. Along with crews from other states and Mexico, hundreds of inmates from Californias prison system were also helping firefighting efforts. Nearly 950 incarcerated firefighters were dispatched to cut fire lines and remove fuel to slow fire spread, according to an update from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Though the state has long relied on prison labor to fight fires, the practice is controversial as the inmates are paid little for dangerous and difficult work. Inmates are paid up to roughly 10.24 each day, with additional money for 24-hour shifts, according to the corrections department. Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. Everything is gone, he said, speaking in Spanish. All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing. Newsom issued an executive order Sunday aimed at fast-tracking the rebuilding of destroyed property by suspending some environmental regulations and ensuring that property tax assessments are not increased. Weve got to let people know that we have their back, he said. Dont walk away because we want you to come back, rebuild, and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards. We want to make sure that the associated costs with that are not disproportionate, especially in a middle-class community like this. The White House said as of Sunday more than 24,000 people have registered for federal assistance made available by President Joe Bidens major disaster declaration last Wednesday. LA Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that she has spoken with members of the incoming presidential administration and said she expects Donald Trump will come visit the devastated region. Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the citys greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun. Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Crowley, the LA fire chief, said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect theres going to be water, Crowley said. Source: AP --Agencies",

A thematic resort nestled in the middle of a mango plantation with 457 TJC mango trees bordering the tranquil banks of Kandalama Reservoir. Inspired by the novel Amba Yaluwo (Mango Friends) and the golden era of Sri Lankan cinema, this unique property is Sri Lankas first hotel fully managed and staffed by women. Built under the auspices of Thema Collection, the hotel was inaugurated with a lively ceremony attended by embassy officials, government representatives, and prominent figures in the tourism industry. Highlighting the cultural significance of the event, two female Buddhist monks conducted a Pirith sermon to bless the hotel and its all-women staff. The visionary behind this initiative, Chandra Wickramasinghe, Chairman of Thema Collection, emphasized that the hotel showcases how women can excel in every facet of the hospitality industry. The hotel manager, Madhuwanthi Adhikari, shared her enthusiasm for leading this one-of-a-kind project.

        "date": "January 13, 2025 01:38 pm",
        "content": "Thailands cabinet has approved a draft law that would legalise gambling and casinos, a move aimed at boosting tourism, jobs and investment, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Monday. Under the governments plan, the law, which will be sent to parliament for deliberation, would see gambling take place in large-scale entertainment complexes. Casinos and most forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand but soccer betting and underground gaming activities and lotteries are rife, with vast sums of money changing hands. Only some gambling is permitted, such as state-controlled horse races and on an official lottery. Neighbours, Cambodia, Singapore, the Philippines, Laos and Myanmar have benefited from large casino complexes and Thailands government has argued the absence of legal casinos means it is turning its back on revenue and not reaching its tourism potential. Tourism is a key driver of Southeast Asias second-largest economy and Thailand is forecasting record visitor numbers in the next few years. Legalisation will protect the public and would also generate more state revenue, Paetongtarn told reporters. Successive Thai governments have sought to legalise and regulate gambling to boost the economy but each attempt has faced pushback from conservatives in the Buddhist majority country. The latest move could see foreign visitor numbers grow 5 to 10 and tourism revenue increase by about 120 billion baht to 220 billion baht (3.45 billion to 6.32 billion), said Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat. About 9,000 to 15,000 new jobs would be created, he added. A key advocate of legalising gambling has been billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarns father, an influential figure in the ruling party. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 14, 2025 09:41 am",
        "content": "The top aide of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol pleaded with law enforcement on Tuesday to abandon their efforts to detain him over last months martial law imposition, as authorities prepared a second attempt to take him into custody. In his statement, presidential chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said Yoon could instead be questioned at a third site or at his residence and claimed that the anti-corruption agency and police were trying to drag him out like he was a member of a South American drug cartel. However, Yoon Kab-keun, one of the presidents lawyers, said Chung issued the message without consulting them and that the legal team has no immediate plans to make the president available for questioning by investigators. Yoon Suk Yeol has not left his official residence in Seoul for weeks, and the presidential security service prevented dozens of investigators from detaining Yoon after a nearly six-hour standoff on Jan. 3. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police pledged more forceful measures to detain Yoon while they jointly investigate whether Yoons brief martial law declaration on Dec. 3 amounted to an attempted rebellion. The National Police Agency has convened multiple meetings of field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan the detainment efforts and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed in a possible multiday operation. The agency and police have openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested on site. The anti-corruption agency and police havent confirmed when they would return to the presidential residence, which has been fortified with barbed wire and rows of vehicles blocking paths. But Chung said he understood D-day to be Wednesday, without specifying the information he had. Anti-corruption agency and police officials met with representatives of the presidential security service Tuesday morning for unspecified discussions regarding efforts to execute the detention warrant for Yoon, the agency said. It wasnt immediately clear whether they any kind of compromise was reached. The countrys acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, had raised concerns on Monday about potential clashes between authorities and the presidential security service, which, despite a court warrant for Yoons detention, has insisted its obligated to protect the president. The anti-corruption agency and police have completed preparations for a siege, Chung said. They are ready to tear down the walls at any moment and handcuff President Yoon Suk Yeol, who remains isolated in his residence in Hannam-dong and forcibly remove him, he added, accusing investigators of trying to humiliate the president. Thousands of citizens are staying up through the night in front of the presidential residence, vowing to protect the president. If a conflict were to break out between the police and citizens, an unimaginable tragedy could occur. Over the past two weeks, thousands of anti-Yoon and pro-Yoon supporters have gathered daily at competing rallies near Yoons office in Seoul, anticipating another detention attempt. Yoons lawyers have claimed that images of him being dragged out in handcuffs could trigger a huge backlash from his supporters and spark a civil war in a country deeply divided over ideological and generational lines. Yoon made a short-lived declaration of martial law and deployed troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure. His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 and accused him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok says report of possible sale to Musk pure fiction",
        "date": "January 14, 2025 10:28 am",
        "content": "TikTok has called a report that China is considering allowing a sale of the social media companys US operations to Elon Musk pure fiction. The firms comments came in response to a report by Bloomberg that Chinese officials are weighing an option that could see its business in America being sold to the worlds richest person if the US Supreme Court upholds a ban on the app. Supreme Court justices are due to rule on a law that set a 19 January deadline for TikTok to either sell its US operations or face a ban in the country. TikTok has repeatedly said that it will not sell its US operation. We cant be expected to comment on pure fiction, a TikTok spokesperson told BBC News. Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that one possible scenario being considered by Chinese officials would see Musks X social media platform take control of TikToks US operations. X did not immediately reply to a BBC request for comment. Musk is a close ally of US president-elect Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House on 20 January. Last month, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay its decision until he takes office to enable him to seek a political resolution. His lawyer filed a legal brief with the court that says Trump opposes banning TikTok and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office. That came a week after Trump met TikToks chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. On Monday, two Democratic lawmakers, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ro Khanna, also called on Congress and the President Joe Biden to extend the 19 January deadline. During a Supreme Court hearing last week, justices appeared inclined to uphold the legislation and stick to the deadline. During nearly three hours of arguments, the nine justices returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law. The Biden administration has argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. The company has repeatedly denied any influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law to ban it in the US violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.

        "title": "Govt urged to implement systemic excise policy to protect people",
        "date": "January 14, 2025 11:43 am",
        "content": "The Alcohol  Drug Information Center (ADIC) claims that due to the 20 increase in alcohol taxes in 2023, alcohol consumption has decreased by 8.3 million liters, and the governments alcohol excise revenue has increased by Rs. 11.6 billion. The ADIC also alleged that the governments excise revenue from cigarettes has increased by Rs. 7.7 billion in 2023, while cigarette sales have decreased by Rs. 521.5 million. The ADIC made this claim issuing a statement regarding the use of alcohol and cigarettes and the increase in taxes. Excerpts of the statement are below: -Excerpt - Alcohol and cigarettes are not ordinary consumer goods, and their prices should always be maintained at a level that discourages their purchase. Alcohol use causes nearly 15,000 premature deaths in Sri Lanka each year, while smoking kills nearly 20,000 people annually. In addition to making many more people sick, alcohol and tobacco have become major factors limiting peoples happiness and freedom. Every year, tobacco and alcohol companies use various strategies to lure our countrys children to alcohol and cigarettes to replace their losing customers. The number of deaths from non-communicable diseases in our country has now increased to 80. Two of the four main factors affecting non-communicable diseases are smoking and alcohol use. The Surgeon General of the United States federal government issued a special report earlier this year stating that alcohol is a carcinogen and that even small amounts of alcohol consumption increase a persons risk of cancer. Accordingly, it has been confirmed that alcohol is a carcinogen. Therefore, he has recommended to the US government that alcohol bottles should state that alcohol is a carcinogen. Increasing excise taxes is among the effective policies proposed by the World Health Organization to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and tobacco use. Accordingly, the increase in excise taxes that occurred in January 2025 is also beneficial for the country. The idea that excise taxes can be used for the development of a country is outdated. Statistics show that the health and economic costs of alcohol and the amount of tax collected from alcohol have not been able to cover the economic and health costs of alcohol. According to a study conducted by the UNDP in 2022, the economic and health costs of alcohol are 237 billion rupees, while the alcohol tax revenue that year was 165.2 billion rupees. Furthermore, the World Health Organizations recommendations for alcohol control state that a quantitative increase in alcohol taxes is a very effective alcohol control measure that the government can implement at a low cost. This has also been demonstrated by the recent increase in excise duties in our country. The 20 increase in alcohol taxes in 2023 has reduced alcohol consumption (pure alcohol) by 8.3 million liters and increased the governments alcohol excise revenue by 11.6 billion rupees. Additionally, the governments excise revenue from cigarettes has increased by 7.7 billion rupees, while cigarette sales have decreased by 521.5 million. This increases state excise revenue and reduces consumption. This has a positive impact on several health, economic, and social problems. Therefore, increasing excise taxes is a win-win situation for the country. Furthermore, whenever the price of alcohol increases, alcohol companies try to create a perception that illegal alcohol will increase. This effort is a tactic used to prevent future tax increases and reduce existing excise taxes, as increasing taxes on legal alcohol will reduce sales of their products. The harm caused by legal or illegal alcohol is not different, and all types of alcohol have a serious impact on health. Therefore, the government should formulate a formal program to control illegal alcohol, effectively enforce the law to control illegal alcohol, and reduce the use of legal alcohol by increasing excise taxes, reducing the ease of obtaining alcohol, and preventing methods that lead children and youth to use alcohol. Furthermore, when increasing excise taxes, it should be done through a scientific tax system. Until 2009, the government had the full or most of the advantage in levying excise duty on cigarettes. Before 2009, the maximum tax increase was made by considering the market, demand, inflation, and price elasticity when determining excise duty. Therefore, the opportunity for tobacco companies to set a price on the tax has been minimized. This has enabled the government to obtain the maximum amount of tax that can be collected and has not enriched multinational companies. Thus, the increase in the profits of tobacco companies, as they receive a large additional profit for their advertising and various interventions, increases the opportunities for children and youth to become victims of tobacco companies. Although there have been calls for reducing this situation for many years, the tobacco companies have benefited the most from the tax increase this time. The excise duty on the cigarette category with the highest sales in the market has increased by Rs. 4.51. However, its price has increased by Rs. 10. The cigarette industry will benefit from the increase in cigarette taxes this time as a proper tax collection system has not yet been established. The additional profit that the cigarette industry will receive from this tax increase is approximately Rs. 7,000 million. However, based on the current situation, it can be said that whoever comes to power, the tobacco and alcohol companies always win. Therefore, what people-friendly governments should do is not to increase the income of tobacco and alcohol companies, but to make healthy, economic decisions that keep the public happy and healthy. For that, it is the responsibility of a people-friendly government to protect the people by implementing a systematic excise policy. -End of Excerpt -",

        "date": "January 14, 2025 12:02 pm",
        "content": "The schoolgirl recently abducted in the Daulagala area of Gampola has been handed over to the Daulagala Police by Ampara Police officers last night (13), along with the primary suspect. The suspect and the victim are expected to be produced before the Gampola Magistrates Court today (14) for further legal proceedings. Speaking to the media at the police station, the father of the abducted girl denied claims of any romantic relationship between his daughter and the suspect. He clarified that while the suspect is his nephew, the other two individuals allegedly involved in the incident are not known to him. The girls father further alleged that the abduction was carried out solely as part of a scheme to extort money, dismissing any other motives behind the crime. Police on Monday (13) successfully apprehended Mohammed Nassar, a 31-year-old resident of Kahatapitiya in Gampola, who abducted an 18-year-old schoolgirl at Daulagala, Kandy, on January 11. The duo was located near the Ampara Bus Stand on a luxury bus scheduled to depart for Kandy this morning (13). Police had traced the suspects location through analysis of his mobile phone data, which revealed his presence in the Ampara Police Division. Acting on this information, five police teams were deployed, leading to the suspect and the schoolgirl being taken into custody at around 9.30 a.m. on January 13. The investigations have revealed that the suspect and the girl had traveled from Polonnaruwa to Valaichchenai and then to Ampara in a three-wheeler, where they spent the night at a private accommodation. According to initial statements, the suspect claimed that the abduction stemmed from a family dispute. He has alleged that he had previously worked overseas in Japan for two years and provided money to the girls fatherhis maternal unclebut was not repaid. This disagreement, coupled with issues over their proposed marriage, reportedly led to the incident. Accordingly, the youth had also allegedly demanded a ransom of Rs. 5 million from the girls father after the abduction.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas new President urged to uphold press freedom, repeal PTA and Online Safety Act",
        "date": "January 14, 2025 01:05 pm",
        "content": "As many as 25 civil society organizations including the Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) have urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to ensure that Sri Lanka upholds press freedom and the right to freedom of expression, which are protected by the countrys constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sri Lanka is a state party. The 25 civil society organizations have mentioned that they appreciated the expressed commitment of the National Peoples Power to uphold media freedom and pursue accountability for past crimes against journalists, as outlined in the coalitions election manifesto. To that end, they call upon the newly elected government to reopen or initiate prompt, impartial, and transparent investigations to ensure accountability in cases of violence against the press and other violations of human rights and freedom of expression, including, but not limited, to dozens of murders, abductions, and physical attacks on journalists and media offices during and in the aftermath of the countrys 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. The investigations should meet international standards, including those outlined under the United Nations Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death, they mentioned. We welcome the recent order of a reinvestigation into the 2005 murder of journalist Dharmeratnam Sivaram. We further urge authorities to bring the prolonged prosecution for the 2010 enforced disappearance and suspected murder of journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda to a timely and effective end while ensuring accountability for all perpetrators and providing access to justice and effective remedies for Ekneligodas family they said. Furthermore, the organisations have called on the government to ensure that law enforcement agencies end the harassment and intimidation of journalists, especially ethnic Tamils, who have long faced intensive surveillance and other undue restrictions on their reporting. Law enforcement agencies should facilitate the withdrawal of criminal cases brought against journalists in retaliation for their work. Further, authorities should not take legal action against journalists for intimidating public servants, they highlighted. Meanwhile, they have also called on the President to repeal the Online Safety Act, which grants sweeping powers to a commission appointed by the president to censor online content, thereby creating a chilling effect on human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. The law should be replaced with new cybersecurity legislation aimed at addressing genuine online harms, such as harassment and fraud, rather than enabling disproportionate and unjustified restrictions on peaceful online speech and jeopardizing the right to privacy, they highlighted. The organisations also call for the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has long been used to harass and imprison journalists for their work. The relevant offenses should instead be addressed within the framework of the countrys existing criminal laws they said. Their requests also include to amend the Parliamentary (Powers and Privileges) Act, amend the Personal Data Protection Act to remove provisions allowing the law to override the Right to Information Act, establish an independent, self-regulatory media commission that will uphold press freedom and adjudicate matters of journalistic ethics without criminalizing reporters or placing undue restrictions on their work. Your election as president of Sri Lanka, a country haunted by impunity for brutal attacks on the media, offers a historic opportunity to demonstrate a genuine commitment to human rights and the rule of law. We urge you to seize this critical moment and stand ready to support your efforts to protect media freedom, as well as the rights to freedom of expression and access to information. The Sri Lankan people deserve no less, they added.
