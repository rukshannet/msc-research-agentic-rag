The price reduction, made as per the pricing formula, will be effective from midnight today (May 03), according to Litro chairman and CEO Muditha Peiris. Revised prices are as follows:  12.5kg cylinder  Rs. 3,638 (reduced by Rs. 100)  5kg cylinder  Rs. 1,462 (reduced by Rs. 40)  2.3kg cylinder  Rs. 681 (reduced by Rs. 19) Meanwhile, LAUGFS Gas PLC, the other leading LP gas supplier in the country, says the prices of its products remain unchanged despite the price hike in the global market. In a statement, the company said the prices of LP gas went up in the global market due to several factors including the rising demand for energy, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. These factors have resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of production and logistics of LP gas, which has impacted the prices of LP gas across the world, LAUGFS Gas PLC said further. Despite these challenges, LAUGFS Gas remains committed to providing our customers with safe, reliable, and high-quality LP Gas at a reasonable price. We have made significant investments in our infrastructure and supply chain to ensure that we can continue to meet the growing demand for LP Gas in Sri Lanka.

        "content": "A teenage boy opened fire at a school in Serbias capital Wednesday, killing eight children and a school guard, police said. Six more children and a teacher were injured and hospitalized. Police identified the shooter by his initials, K.K., and said he had opened fire with his fathers gun. He was arrested in the school yard, police said. A statement identified him as a student at the school in central Belgrade who was born in 2009. Police said they received a call about the shooting at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school around 8:40 a.m. Primary schools in Serbia have eight grades, starting with first grade. I was able to hear the shooting. It was non-stop, a student who was in a sports class downstairs when the gunfire erupted. I didnt know what was happening. We were receiving some messages on the phone. Unlike in the United States, mass shootings in Serbia and in the wider Balkan region are extremely rare; none were reported at schools in recent years. In the last mass shooting, a Balkan war veteran in 2013 killed 13 people in a central Serbian village. Experts, however, have repeatedly warned of the number of weapons left over in the country after the wars of the 1990s. They also note that decades-long instability stemming from the conflicts as well as the ongoing economic hardship could trigger such outbursts. Local media footage from the scene showed commotion outside the school as police removed the suspect, whose head was covered as officers led him to a car parked in the street. The student who heard the shooting, who was identified only by her initials, E.M., because of her age, described the suspect as a quiet guy who looked nice. He was having good grades, but we didnt know much about him, the student added. He was not so open with everybody. Surely I wasnt expecting this to happen.  Milan Milosevic, who said his daughter was in a history class when the shooting took place, told N1 television that he rushed out when he heard what had happened. I asked where is my child but no one could tell me anything at first, he said. Then she called and we found out she was out. He (the shooter) fired first at the teacher and then the children who ducked under the desks, Milosevic quoted his daughter as saying. She said he was a quiet boy and a good student. Police sealed off the blocks around the school, in the center of Belgrade. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) says that the flu spreading across the country these days could be a new variant of the Covid-19 virus. Chairman of the association Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne emphasized that different varieties of the Covid-19 virus can emerge depending on the nature of the disease. We dont really have a good understanding of those variants. It takes time to analyze them and to obtain the reports. Covid-19 patients are still being reported in many other countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore. But we dont need to worry. Dr. Ariyaratne also pointed out that, however, it is essential to follow proper hygiene practices that we were following during the Covid-19 pandemic since the Influenza virus is also being spread. Especially it is important to wear a face mask properly, he added. The SLMA further mentions that several viral diseases are spreading due to the prevailing rainy condition, adding that it is difficult to identify those diseases separately from each other since the symptoms of these viral diseases are similar. However, it is essential for people to continue following health guidelines, the SLMA said. Meanwhile, the doctors have urged the general public to be cautious of Leptospirosis disease, since its spread is also on the rise. If you have the symptoms like fever, red eyes, muscle pain, dark-coloured urine If these symptoms are recognized early, then the complications of the Leptospirosis disease can be prevented by proper treatment, the doctor added.",

Accordingly, the members of the public have been instructed to submit their standpoints and proposals in writing to the following fax number or the e-mail address: 0112 470822  justicemedia07gmail.com Last week, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said public opinions and suggestions pertaining to the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill would be accepted until May 30, 2023. After taking into account the public perspective, several rounds of discussions are expected to take place to decide on the amendments to the Bill. The Anti-Terrorism Bill was published in a bid to replace the much-disputed Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Despite some improvements, the Bill came under fire for containing certain provisions that would facilitate abuse. It is also deemed a piece of legislation that would give the President, the police and the military broad powers to detain people without evidence and to make vaguely defined forms of speech a criminal offence. Human rights organizations have raised deep concerns about the Bill, alleging that it would empower the authorities to systematically violate fundamental human rights. They pointed out that the new Bill, instead of addressing the prevailing issues, would expand the definition of terrorism to include crimes such as property damage, theft or robbery and restrict the rights of freedom of assembly and speech. The rights advocates have urged the Sri Lankan government to make sure that any counterterrorism legislation introduced upholds international human rights standards.",

        "content": "Russia accused Ukraine on Wednesday of attacking the Kremlin with drones overnight in a failed bid to kill President Vladimir Putin. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities on the statement from Moscow, the most dramatic accusation it has levelled against Kyiv since invading its neighbour more than 14 months ago. The Kremlin said two drones had been used in the alleged attack on Putins residence in the walled Kremlin citadel, but had been disabled by electronic defences. It said Russia reserved the right to retaliate - a comment that suggested that Moscow might use the alleged incident to justify a further escalation in its war with Ukraine. Two unmanned aerial vehicles were aimed at the Kremlin. As a result of timely actions taken by the military and special services with the use of radar warfare systems, the devices were put out of action, the Kremlin said in a statement. We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the presidents life, carried out on the eve of Victory Day, the May 9 Parade, at which the presence of foreign guests is also planned ... The Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit. Baza, a Telegram channel with links to Russias law enforcement agencies, posted a video showing a flying object approaching the dome of the Kremlin Senate building overlooking Red Square and exploding in an intense burst of light just before reaching it. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos authenticity. The statement from the presidential administration said fragments of the drones had been scattered on the territory of the Kremlin complex but there were no casualties or material damage. RIA news agency said Putin had not been in the Kremlin at the time, and was working on Wednesday at his Novo Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

Under the Fund Act, financial assistance is provided for surgery and medical treatment for various ailments. In line with the Presidents instructions and the guidance of the Presidents Secretary, necessary measures were taken to complete the medical aid requests received by the Presidents Fund by December 31, 2022. The applications were sorted and processed, and eligible beneficiaries received benefits, with more than Rs.1,717 million spent. To streamline the application process, the Presidents Fund Secretary, Sarath Kumara, simplified the system to make it efficient, enabling applicants to receive benefits within a week. Since the approved hospitals for providing medical benefits are concentrated in the vicinity of major cities, by starting the registration of hospitals located in rural areas, facilities have been provided to grant medical assistance to patients in remote areas to get treatmentsurgeries from approved hospitals in rural areas. Also, in addition to the diseases that have received financial support from the Presidents Fund, the requests of patients have also been considered and new diseases have been registered with the recommendation of the Ministry of Health, which has benefited a large number of patients. Taking into account the current economic situation and the cost of surgerytreatment, the maximum limits of medical aid paid for all diseases have also been increased. Under this, the Presidents Fund has also worked to assist low-income earners in various parts of the island to improve their livelihoods. --PMD--",

        "title": "Sri Lanka apparel exports to drop by 1 billion in 2023, trade body says",
        "date": "May 3, 2023 08:38 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas apparel export earnings could slump by 1 billion this year, a top industry expert said on Wednesday, as slowing global demand hits the crisis-hit South Asian country. Apparel is Sri Lankas largest industrial export and earned 5.95 billion in 2022, helping the country as it weathered its worst financial crisis since independence in 1948, triggered by a record reduction in foreign exchange reserves. But the industrys first-quarter performance in 2023 has struggled with textiles and garment exports dropping 13.8 to 1.3 billion, data from Sri Lankas central bank showed. Exports in March marked the lowest in three years, said Yohan Lawrence, Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), which is the industrys apex body. Given the slowdown in demand we are seeing now, a 1 billion reduction in exports this year is not unreasonable, he told Reuters. Our projection is it could be five to six more months before we see a recovery in global demand. Shipments to the Unites States, the countrys biggest buyer, dropped by 22 to 470 million in the first quarter. Exports to the European Union fell 13 to 344 million while first-quarter exports to the United Kingdom were down 10 to 167.7 million, according to the latest JAAF data. A steep 66 power tariff hike in February has also hit Sri Lankas competitiveness, Lawrence added. However, the industry is not expecting significant job losses from the downturn but small and medium companies could see difficulties as the sector adapts to deal with a slowdown in orders. The islands apparel sector has about 300,000 employees, most of whom are women. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Ukraine denies Russian claim Kyiv sent drones to hit Kremlin",
        "date": "May 3, 2023 10:09 pm",
        "content": "Russia claimed it foiled an attack by Ukrainian drones on the Kremlin early Wednesday, calling it an unsuccessful assassination attempt against President Vladimir Putin and promising retaliation for what it termed a terrorist act. The Ukrainian president denied it, saying: We dont attack Putin or Moscow. Putin wasnt in the Kremlin at the time and was at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russias state news agency RIA Novosti. There was no independent verification of the reported attack on the Kremlin, which Russia authorities said occurred overnight but presented no evidence to support it. Questions also arose as to why it took the Kremlin hours to report the incident and why videos of it also surfaced that late in the day. A video posted overnight on a local Moscow news Telegram channel, shot from across the river from the Kremlin, appeared to show smoke rising over the buildings. It wasnt possible to ascertain its veracity. According to text accompanying the footage, residents of a nearby apartment building reported hearing bangs and seeing smoke around 2:30 a.m. The Kremlin said Russian military and security forces stopped the drones before they could strike. Nobody was hurt, it added. The Kremlins website said debris from the drones fell on the grounds of the Moscow landmark without damage. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on an unannounced visit to Helsinki for talks with the leaders of five Nordic countries, denied any role in the attack. We dont attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. Were defending our villages and cities, he said at a news conference. Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the claims would provide a pretext for Russia to justify massive strikes on Ukrainian cities, on the civilian population, on infrastructure facilities in coming days. The Pentagon is looking into the alleged attacks, according to a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. American intelligence officials also were looking into the Russian claims but had not yet made a determination, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing assessment. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Washington at a World Press Freedom Day event, said he had seen the reports but I cant in any way validate them. We simply dont know. He added: I would take anything coming out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt. So lets see. Well see what the facts are and its really hard to comment or speculate on this without really knowing what the facts are. The purported drone attack would be a significant escalation in the 14-month conflict, with Ukraine taking the war to the heart of Russian power. Phillips OBrien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, said, It certainly wasnt an attempt to assassinate Putin, because he doesnt sleep in the roof and he probably never sleeps in the Kremlin. He added it was too soon to prove or disprove whether it was a Russian attempt either to make Ukraine look reckless or to buck up Russian public opinion or if it was a Ukrainian operation to embarrass Russia. The alleged attack immediately prompted calls in Russia from pro-Kremlin figures in Russia to carry out assassinations on senior leadership in Ukraine. The Kremlin claimed the attack was planned to disrupt Victory Day, which Russia celebrates in Red Square on May 9 to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Peskov said the parade would take place as scheduled. Shortly before the news about the alleged attack broke, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin issued a ban on using drones in the Russian capital, with an exception for drones launched by authorities. Sobyanin didnt offer any reason for the ban, saying only that it would prevent the illegal use of drones that can hinder the work of law enforcement. Zelenskyy was in Finland to secure greater firepower for his armed forces as they figure out how to dislodge Russian troops from occupied areas of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia reportedly have experienced ammunition shortages after a winter of long-range shelling and missile strikes. Ukraines government has been pressing its allies to give it more as officials consider when and how they might start trying to drive Russian forces out of the Ukrainian territory they have occupied. Zelenskyy told a Helsinki news conference before Russias drone attack claims that Ukraines counteroffensive is coming very soon. This year will be decisive  for victory, he said. In the meantime, 16 civilians were killed Wednesday in a massive attack by Russian forces on Ukraines partially occupied southern Kherson province, the Ukrainian Prosecutor Generals Office said. Russian fire hit the train station and the only open supermarket in the regional capital, also called Kherson, killing 12 people and wounding 22, local officials said. Three energy workers died when they came under fire while making repairs north of the city. The Nordic countries  Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland  have been among Kyivs strongest backers since Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Before the meeting with Zelenskyy in Finlands capital, Nordic officials appeared ready to provide more aid as the war stretches into its 15th month. There is still an urgent need for military support to ensure that the Ukrainians stand as strong as possible in the fight against Russia, Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen said in a statement. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, another of the summit attendees, said: Here in the north, we have a more unpredictable and aggressive Russian neighbor, and it is important that we discuss together how to face this new situation. The talks came a day after U.S. officials said Washington plans to send Ukraine about 300 million in additional military aid, including an enormous number of artillery rounds, howitzers, air-to-ground rockets and ammunition. The weapons will all be pulled from Pentagon stocks, so they can go quickly to the front lines, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid has not yet been formally announced. Elsewhere, Russia used Iranian-made drones during its third attack on Ukraines capital city in six days. Explosions were heard in Kyiv and elsewhere during the night as Ukrainian air defenses shot down 21 of the Russian drones, Ukraines Air Force Command said. No damage or casualties were reported Meanwhile, a massive blaze broke out at an Russian oil depot, local officials said Wednesday. The depot erupted in flames in Russias southern Krasnodar region, located east of the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula, according to Krasnodar Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev. He didnt say what caused the fire, which was described as extremely difficult to put out. But some Russian media outlets said it was likely caused by a Ukrainian drone attack overnight. There was no official comment on that possibility. Local residents heard an explosion shortly before the fire erupted, Russian news site Baza said. Military analysts think Ukraine is targeting supply lines in the Russian rear while gearing up for a possible counteroffensive amid improving weather conditions and as it receives large amounts of weapons and ammunition from its Western allies. Explosions also derailed a Russian freight train and hit a Russian airfield in recent days. Last weekend, a massive fire erupted at an oil depot in Crimea after it was hit by two of Ukraines drones, a Russia-appointed official said. In anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russian forces are focused on destroying logistical routes and centers of Ukraines armed forces with long-range strikes, Kyiv military officials say. At the same time, Russia plans to continue talks with the United Nations and other parties to an wartime agreement on facilitating Black Sea agricultural shipments, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said ahead of talks on Friday. Earlier Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed a new round of consultations between Russia and the U.N. on access of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to the world market would be held in Moscow. Signed in July and renewed twice, most recently in March, the deal unblocked Ukrainian grain shipments that were held up in the countrys blockaded ports last year. The deal will expire May 18 unless Russia agrees to its renewal. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka looks to adventure travel to attract quality tourists and help rebuild economy",
        "date": "May 3, 2023 10:21 pm",
        "content": "Adventure tourism is playing a key role in helping Sri Lanka rebuild its economy after a turbulent few years for the South Asian nation. The countrys tourism sector was particularly affected in recent years due to a foreign currency crisis resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic which led to months of food and fuel shortages, along with runaway inflation and prolonged blackouts. A year on, leading Sri Lankan figures, speaking at a Dubai conference, were optimistic about tourism helping the countrys recovery. One of the main strategies is to diversify their offerings and target those seeking adventure holidays. We are not going to try and make Sri Lanka expensive but we want to make it the destination of choice when it comes to affordable luxury, said Harin Fernando, Sri Lankan Minister of Tourism and Lands. We have just launched the Pekoe Trail, a 23-day hike through the mountains  thats just one of the adventures we are offering, Harin Fernando, Sri Lankan Minister of Tourism and Lands, told a conference on the second day of the Arabian Travel Market at Dubai World Trade Centre. Were also investing in marine diving, mountain climbing and hiking. Another activity we are looking to bring to Sri Lanka is ski diving. Visitors from the GCC will play a key role in ensuring Sri Lanka continues to rebound from its troubles in recent years, the minister added. The Middle Eastern market is going to be crucial for Sri Lanka, he said. Initially, what we wanted were numbers, which meant quantity over quality, but now I want to see us move to quality over quantity. We were desperate to get tourists back to Sri Lanka but that was the short-term goal. Now we need to move to a long-term strategy. It means attracting tourists who were likely to spend more on their holidays. The average spending of tourists in Sri Lanka is 200-250, which is not enough, said Mr Fernando. The target is to move that number to 400-500 by next year. We are not going to try and make Sri Lanka expensive but we want to make it the destination of choice when it comes to affordable luxury. Bounced back Sri Lanka experienced power cuts and a shortage of essential goods last year, with inflation rates reaching as high as 50 per cent. Protests took place in the capital city of Colombo and spread to other parts of the country. The fuel crisis led to schools closing with people urged to work remotely to reduce costs. Eventually, the country missed a payment on its foreign debt for the first time in its history. There was also a change of leadership as the crisis deepened. In March, the International Monetary Fund approved a 3 billion bailout loan to help Sri Lanka in restructuring its debt and addressing its crisis-hit economy. The Sri Lankan rupee has strengthened from its record low in May to emerge as the worlds best-performing currency this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The feeling among those at the event in Dubai is that those days are in the past. It has been a bumpy ride for Sri Lanka in the last 11 to 12 months but I am delighted to say we have bounced back from where we were a year ago, said Mr Fernando. Sri Lankas ambassador to the UAE said being a year-round destination makes it attractive to a visitor from the Middle East, where temperatures tend to soar during the summer months. After months of turbulent times, Sri Lankan tourism is back, stronger and better than ever, said Udaya Indrarathna at the event. We have a lot of unique experiences to offer the Middle Eastern traveller. Sri Lanka is a year-round destination with pristine beaches and amazing weather. The country is a biodiversity hotspot with large forest coverage and a rich wildlife. It also boasts a unique cultural heritage. Its the best of Asia in one compact island. Hoteliers at the event believe that Sri Lanka is resurgent because of the diversification it offers tourists. The complexion of tourism in Sri Lanka is changing, said Suresh Rajendra, president of leisure for the John Keels Group, the parent company of Cinnamon Hotels. The typical tourism in Sri Lanka has been beach stays and tours based on the culture and the hill country. Thats changing and we are seeing Colombo starting to attract the conference market which is bringing in more visitors from India and China. CinnamonHotels unveiled plans for a new Colombo-based resort in Dubai on Tuesday. Diversification in India Hoteliers at the conference said India is also working on diversifying its tourist offering. Within the adventure space you have dunes, mountains, the sea and beautiful lakes, said Amir Golbarg, senior vice president of operations in the Middle East and Africa with Minor Hotels. He was referring to the Jaipur region, where a new Anantara luxury resort owned by the Minor group is due to open at the end of this year. Just half an hour away you have beautiful unexplored dunes and in other areas you have incredible wildlife, he said. Were looking at how we can add an adventure trek with going on a journey with the tigers and experiencing them in the wild. The potential for tourism to grow in India was huge, but more needed to be done to improve its infrastructure, the conference heard. India is now the worlds most populous country, overtaking China, but it should have more inbound tourists, said Dimitris Manikis, president for the EMEA region at Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. The potential is enormous but there are issues with infrastructure that need to be overcome. These include the network of roads and railways, visas, airports  everything that makes a destination more accessible. Source - The National -Agencies",

        "date": "May 4, 2023 08:01 am",
        "content": "The World Banks 25-member executive board on Wednesday elected former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga to a five-year term as president, effective June 2, the bank said, ushering in an Indian-born finance and development expert charged with revamping the lender to tackle climate change and other global crises. Banga, 63, was nominated for the post by U.S. President Joe Biden in late February and was the sole contender to replace departing World Bank chief David Malpass, an economist and former U.S. Treasury official who served in the Trump administration. The election came after World Bank board members interviewed Banga for four hours on Monday. Malpasss last day at the bank will be June 1. The decision came in a vote by 24 of the boards members, with Russia abstaining, instead of the usual consensus-based process, a source familiar with the process said. Sources familiar with the process had expected Banga to win the boards approval handily after several meetings with board members in recent weeks and Mondays formal interview. One of the sources called Banga a true change maker who will help accelerate reforms at the global development bank. It already loans out hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries but is working to increase its lending to help them address global challenges such as climate change. The Board looks forward to working with Mr. Banga on the World Bank Group Evolution process, as discussed at the April 2023 Spring Meetings, and on all the World Bank Groups ambitions and efforts aimed at tackling the toughest development challenges facing developing countries, the bank said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters last month that attracting more private capital for development goals would be a key area of focus for Banga if he is approved. Biden announced Bangas candidacy during Yellens participation in a meeting of Group of 20 finance officials in Bengalaru, India, a source familiar with the process said. Once it became public, she and her top traveling aides immediately began selling their counterparts on Bangas candidacy, the source said. The World Bank has been led by an American since its founding at the end of World War Two, while the International Monetary Fund has been led by a European. Banga, who was born in India and spent his early career there, has been a U.S. citizen since 2007. Banga has met with officials from 96 governments since his nomination, the source said. He visited eight countries during a three-week world tour to meet with government officials, business leaders and civil society groups, flying a total of 39,546 miles (63,643 km).

The 32-year-old is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent while in Sydney for the T20 World Cup. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. A police fact sheet filed with the court said the woman was fearing for her life and could not get away from the accused during the November 2022 incident. The prosecution successfully applied for the adjournment, which will take the hearing beyond the statutory six-month requirement for charge certification, at Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. Gunathilakas lawyer Alen Sahinovic opposed the delay, arguing his client was being subjected to undue hardship as a foreign citizen with strict bail conditions and limited familial and social support. Mr Sahinovic will apply for the Director of Public Prosecutions to pay legal costs at the next hearing. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lankas T20 World Cup team last year but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested in the early hours of November 6 at Sydneys Hyatt Regency Hotel, shortly before he was scheduled to board a flight home with the rest of the team after they bowed out of the tournament. Gunathilaka remains on bail ahead of a committal hearing at Downing Centre in Sydney on May 18. Source: Australian Associated Press -Agencies",

The research findings include that the overall dengue seroprevalence rate in children was 24.8, with the highest rates reported from Trincomalee (54.3) and the lowest rates from Badulla (14.2), which is a high-altitude estate area. While the seroprevalence rates were significantly higher in urban areas (35.8) compared to rural (23.2) and estate areas (9.4), there was no association between seropositivity rates with population density in each district, it added. In the meantime, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed to mobilize the dengue task force to control the spread of dengue in the Western Province since the region has seen a surge in dengue cases. President Wickremesinghe has directed the Governor of the Western Province, the Chief Secretary and the District Secretary accordingly, to mobilize the dengue task force with the support of relevant institutions and the public, in order to control the dengue spread.",

        "title": "More details on Serbia school shooting reveal teen made kill list",
        "date": "May 4, 2023 01:04 pm",
        "content": "A teenager who killed eight fellow students and a security guard in a Serbian school planned the attack for weeks and had a kill list, according to police. The 13-year-old was arrested following Wednesday mornings attack at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade. Another six pupils and a teacher were also injured in the shooting. The motive for the attack is still being investigated, police said. Officers in helmets and bulletproof vests cordoned off the area around the school, located in the central Vracar neighbourhood, shortly after 08:40 (06:40 GMT). The suspect is alleged to have used his fathers guns, both of which had legal permits. He is also said to have gone to a shooting range more than once with his father before the killings. The boys mother and father have since been arrested. In a televised address to the country, President Aleksandar Vucic described the attack as the most difficult day in the modern history of our country. He said the suspect would be sent to a psychiatric clinic. Under current Serbian law, he cannot be held criminally responsible as he is under 14. Mr Vucic has suggested that the age of criminal liability may be lowered to 12 in the wake of the killings. He has also proposed several other reforms, including an audit on firearms licences and a tightening of the rules around who can access shooting ranges. Police say the suspect planned the attack a month in advance and that he had carried a priority list of children to target and which classrooms he would go into first. Most of the victims were born in 2009 - meaning they were either 13 or 14 at the time of the incident. A national three-day mourning period starting on Friday has been announced. Seven girls and one boy have been confirmed among the dead, with four further boys and two girls injured. A boy who was shot in the neck and chest in said to have suffered the worst injuries, while a girl is in critical condition with a head injury. Three other boys suffered injuries to their legs, while a second girl was shot in the abdomen and is currently stable. Theres been an operation and all that can be done has been but theyre still fighting for her life, the health minister said. A teacher injured in the attack was also reported to be undergoing surgery and the minister said her life was at risk. The sounds of crying parents could be heard on the streets around the school hours after the shooting. Milan Milosevic, the father of one of the pupils at the school, said his daughter was in the class where the gun was fired and managed to escape. The boy first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly, Mr Milosevic told broadcaster N1. I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts. They say he the shooter was quiet and a good pupil. He recently joined their class. I saw kids running out from the school, screaming. Parents came, they were in panic. Later I heard three shots, one student told the Serbian state broadcaster RTS. Mr Vucic said the suspect had become friendly with the guard, who was described by one parent as a great guy and a man who loved kids. Mass shootings are comparatively rare in Serbia, which has very strict gun laws, but gun ownership in the country is among the highest in Europe. The western Balkans are awash with hundreds of thousands of illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s. In 2019, it was estimated that there are 39.1 firearms per 100 people in Serbia - the third highest in the world, behind the US and Montenegro. In the deadliest shooting since then, Ljubisa Bogdanovic killed 14 people in the central village of Velika Ivanca in 2013, and Nikola Radosavljevic killed nine and wounded five in the eastern village of Jabukovac in July 2007.

        "date": "May 4, 2023 01:13 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has urged all concerned parties to agree on a meaningful debt relief package for countries under debt stress. Delivering the Sri Lankan intervention at the 56th Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Incheon, South Korea, Sabry appreciated the ADBs commitment to help its developing member countries to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic by allocating USD 20.5 billion from its own resources in 2022. I am happy to announce that today, we are looking forward with a glimmer of hope as we have just navigated our way out of the abyss of extreme complications. Suffering of the Sri Lankans has been eased to a certain degree, the Minister said. He said this after expressing gratitude to the assistance offered by several multilateral and bilateral partners, including the ADB last year, when the island nation was suffering from an unprecedented economic crisis, and also from the aftershocks of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine. Attributing what is considered to be one of the islands worst economic crises since gaining independence to longstanding underlying fiscal vulnerabilities, Sabry explained the measures taken thus far in this regard, saying During the last 10  12 months we have adopted strenuous and difficult action to control inflation and we have seen our currency marginally appreciating. He noted, however, that Sri Lanka cannot be satisfied with the progress made thus far, emphasising that sustaining these developments is the daunting task ahead of us. Learning from the past, we are undertaking painful reforms. We have laid the basic foundation for transforming the economy and have launched a comprehensive economic reform programme, the Foreign Affairs Minister said. Sabry also spoke of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Sri Lanka is due to receive from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) following successful negotiations, assuring that Sri Lanka remains committed to debt resolution consistent with the IMF programme.",

        "content": "The committee appointed to probe the recent kidney transplant racket uncovered by Ada Deranas Ukussa at a private hospital in Borella has recommended that the approval granted for the hospital to perform kidney transplants be temporarily halted. Accordingly, the Attorney General had informed the Court of Appeal today (04 May) that the committee had recommended that all kidney transplants be suspended at the private hospital in question, until the relevant investigations have concluded. The matter was raised when a writ petition filed by the hospital, seeking to invalidate a letter issued by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) recommending that all kidney transplants be suspended at the hospital in question, was taken up in court this morning (04 May). Appearing on behalf of the respondents, Additional Solicitor General Vikum De Abrew emphasised that the relevant letter was issued by the DGHS based on a probe conducted by the nine-member committee appointed by him, adding that the approval issued for the hospital to conduct kidney transplants expired on 31 December 2022. Appearing for the petitioning party, however, Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha argued that as a result of the letter issued by the DGHS, the hospital is facing severe difficulties with their daily operations, highlighting that they are also currently unable to pay the salaries of hospital staff. He further noted, however, that his client has no objections to conduct the relevant transplant procedures under the supervision of the DGHS in the event they are granted approval to do so. Upon consideration of the facts presented by both parties, it was decided by the court that the petition would be heard on 11 May.",

Prof. Banneheka said the FUTA has called off its trade union action, however, vowed to continue their fight. The evaluation of answer scripts was delayed by at least two months due to the trade union action launched by the FUTA, in protest of the new tax policy. They urged the government to scrap the recently-imposed excessive taxes. Last week, FUTA called for an urgent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the issues that prompted them to resort and prolong their trade union action. Against this backdrop, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the parents of the students appealed to university lecturers to put off its trade union action until the answer script evaluation of the 2022 Advanced Level examination is completed.",

        "content": "Google is going to start displaying a blue checkmark next to select senders names on Gmail to verify their identity, the company announced on Wednesday. The new blue checkmarks will automatically appear next to companies that have adopted Gmails existing Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) feature. The BIMI feature, which rolled out in 2021, requires senders to use strong authentication and verify their brand logo in order to display a brand logo as an avatar in emails. Users will now see a checkmark icon for senders that have adopted the BIMI feature. Google says this update will help users identify messages from legitimate senders versus impersonators. Once you hover over the blue checkmark next to a senders name, you will see a blurb that says the sender of this email has verified that they own the domain and logo in the profile image. Strong email authentication helps users and email security systems identify and stop spam, and also enables senders to leverage their brand trust, the company wrote in a blog post. This increases confidence in email sources and gives readers an immersive experience, creating a better email ecosystem for everyone. Blue checkmarks have made headlines for the past several months, largely because of the mess on Twitter that began when the Elon Musk-owned social network began selling verification. Last week, Twitter officially got rid of legacy blue checkmarks, while earlier this week a glitch brought them back momentarily if you updated your bio. Of course, verification checkmarks arent just a Twitter-only concept, as YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok and many other digital platforms have some form of verification. In March, Meta took a page from Musks book and launched paid verification checkmarks, and even LinkedIn recently introduced verification badges. Gmail is rolling out the blue verified checkmarks starting today across both Workspace accounts and personal Google accounts, so youll probably start seeing them soon. Source - TechCrunch -Agencies",

        "date": "May 4, 2023 05:17 pm",
        "content": "A jury will now decide whether British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran ripped off Marvin Gayes Lets Get It On after hearing closing arguments on Wednesday in a week-long copyright trial. Sheerans lawyer, Ilene Farkas, told the jurors in Manhattan federal court that similarities in the chord progressions and rhythms of Gayes classic and Sheerans hit Thinking Out Loud were the letters of the alphabet of music. These are basic musical building blocks that songwriters now and forever must be free to use, or all of us who love music will be poorer for it, she said. Keisha Rice, who represents heirs of Gayes co-writer Ed Townsend suing Sheeran and his record label, said her clients were not claiming to own basic musical elements but rather the way in which these common elements were uniquely combined. Mr. Sheeran is counting on you to be very, very overwhelmed by his commercial success, she said, urging jurors to use their common sense to decide whether the songs are similar. The jurors were sent home shortly after closing arguments and will return on Thursday morning to deliberate. Townsends heirs in 2017 sued Sheeran, his label Warner Music Group and his music publisher Sony Music Publishing, claiming infringement of their copyright interest in the Gaye song. Sheeran and his co-writer, Amy Wadge, both testified during the trial that they did not copy Lets Get It On. Sheeran said he had only passing familiarity with the song and that Thinking Out Loud was inspired by Irish musician Van Morrison. Gaye, who died in 1984, collaborated with Townsend, who died in 2003, to write Lets Get It On, which topped the Billboard charts in 1973. Thinking Out Loud peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2015. Sheeran is also facing claims over Thinking Out Loud in the same court from a company owned by investment banker David Pullman that holds copyright interests in the Gaye song. Sheeran won a trial in London last year in a separate copyright case over his hit Shape of You. Gayes heirs in 2015 won a 5.3 million judgment from a lawsuit claiming the Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams song Blurred Lines copied Gayes Got to Give It Up. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "At this juncture of Sri Lankas unprecedented economic crisis, the timeless philosophy of the Buddha is a source of solace, President Ranil Wickremesinghe says in his message for the Vesak festival. Hence, it is imperative to rise above all differences and join hands in unity and service as espoused by the Buddha in order to overcome the dangers in pursuing a life of normality during these troubled times, he said further. Wickremesinghe noted that this path should be guided by the four Noble States of loving-kindness (Metta), compassion (Karuna), sympathetic joy (Mudita) and equanimity (Upekkha), as upheld in the Buddhist philosophy. Read the full text of President Wickremesinghes message for Vesak below: This thrice blessed day of Vesak being the most important in the Buddhist calendar, dawns with sacred significance. While commemorating the Buddhas birth, enlightenment and passing away, it is a revered occasion, to venerate his Teachings based on the concept of compassion, by participating in activities of piety and giving of alms, through devotion to service of humanity. At this juncture of the countrys unprecedented economic crisis, the timeless philosophy of the Buddha becomes a source of solace. Therefore, during these troubled times, it is imperative to rise above all differences and join together in unity and service as espoused by the Buddha, to overcome the dangers in pursuing a life of normality. This path should be guided by the four Noble States of loving-kindness (Metta), compassion (Karuna), sympathetic joy (Mudita) and equanimity (Upekkha), as upheld in the Buddhist philosophy. On this hallowed day, let us seize this instance of religious sanctity, and pay tribute to the Buddhas sagacity, by uniting in solidarity to rebuild an affluent Sri Lanka.

        "date": "May 5, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Serbian police arrested on Friday a gunman suspected of killing eight people and wounding 14 others in a village near Belgrade in the second mass shooting in the country this week. The suspect U.B., born in 2002, has been apprehended in the vicinity of the city of Kragujevac, he is suspected of killing eight people and wounding 14 overnight, the Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement. It said the investigation was ongoing. Serbias President Aleksandar Vucic is expected to address the nation around 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT). The shooting in the village of Dubona, near the town of Mladenovac, 42 km (26 miles) south of Belgrade was the second in the Balkan country in just two days. On Wednesday, a 13-year old boy shot dead nine and injured seven at a school in Belgrade before turning himself in. According to local media, the suspect in the second shooting was involved in a altercation in a school yard late on Thursday and left but returned with an assault rifle and a handgun. He opened fire and continued to shoot at people at random from a moving car. State broadcaster RTS reported an off-duty policeman and his sister were among those killed. Around 600 Serbian police, including elite Special Anti-terrorist Unit (SAJ) and Gendarmerie were involved in a manhunt, dubbed Operation Whirlwind, RTS reported. Inside the village of Dubona, a Reuters witness saw heavily armed police establishing a checkpoint and searching incoming traffic. Armoured police SUVs and black vans circled the area. This is sad, the young policeman is my daughters age, born in 1998, said Danijela, a middle-aged woman in Dubona. My daughter is taking sedatives, we could not sleep all night, they grew up together. The wounded had been transported to several local hospitals, the RTS reported. It also said the Health Ministry called people to donate blood for the wounded. Police used a helicopter, drones and multiple police patrols to hunt down the suspect. This is terrible for our state, this is a huge defeat. In two days so many ... killed, said Ivan, a Dubona resident. NATION IN MOURNING The Balkan nation begins three days of official mourning on Friday following its first mass school shooting on Wednesday. The suspected shooter took two of his fathers handguns to kill eight pupils and a security guard in a hallway and history class at their school in the capital Belgrade. Hundreds of school children with candles and flowers gathered for a vigil on Thursday evening in streets around the school, while churches planned memorial prayers. Dozens of high school teachers rallied in front of the Education Ministry in downtown Belgrade on Thursday, demanding improvements to school security and the education system. Serbia has an entrenched gun culture, especially in rural areas, but also strict gun control laws. Automatic weapons are illegal and over the years authorities have offered several amnesties to those who surrender them. After the school shooting in Belgrade, the Serbian government introduced a two-year ban on the issuing of new gun permits, a revision of existing permits and checks on how gun owners store their arms. Still, the country, and the rest of Western Balkans, are awash with military-grade weapons and ordnance that remained in private hands after the wars of the 1990s. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "WHO declares end to COVID global health emergency",
        "date": "May 5, 2023 10:28 pm",
        "content": "The World Health Organization ended the global emergency status for COVID-19 on Friday more than three years after its original declaration, and said countries should now manage the virus that killed more than 6.9 million people along with other infectious diseases. The global health agencys Emergency Committee met on Thursday and recommended the UN organization declare an end to the coronavirus crisis as a public health emergency of international concern - its highest level of alert - which has been in place since Jan. 30, 2020. It is therefore with great hope that I declare COVID-19 over as a global health emergency, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that the end of the emergency did not mean COVID was over as a global health threat. During a lengthy conference call to brief the press on the decision, some WHO members became emotional as they urged countries to reflect on lessons learned during the pandemic. We cant forget those fire pyres. We cant forget the graves that were dug. None of us up here will forget them, said WHOs technical lead on COVID-19 Maria Van Kerkhove. The COVID death rate has slowed from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 in the week to April 24, 2023, according to WHO data, reflecting widespread vaccination, availability of better treatments and a level of population immunity from prior infections. Ending the emergency could mean that international collaboration or funding efforts are also brought to an end or shift in focus, although many have already adapted as the pandemic receded in different regions. The battle is not over. We still have weaknesses and those weaknesses that we still have in our system will be exposed by this virus or another virus. And it needs to be fixed, said the WHOs emergencies director Michael Ryan. The WHO does not declare the beginning or end of pandemics, although it did start using the term for COVID in March 2020. In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins, Ryan said. Last year, U.S. President Joe Biden said the pandemic was over. Like a number of other countries, the worlds biggest economy has begun dismantling its domestic state of emergency for COVID, which officially ends May 11, meaning it will stop paying for vaccines and testing for many people and shift responsibility to the commercial market. The European Union also said in April last year that the emergency phase of the pandemic was over, and other regions have taken similar steps. SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM The WHOs declaration comes just four months after China ended its prolonged severe COVID restrictions and was ravaged by a big surge in infections. The decision also suggests that WHO advisers believe a new more dangerous coronavirus variant is unlikely to emerge in the coming months, although the virus remains unpredictable. I will not hesitate to convene another emergency committee should COVID-19 once again put our world in peril, WHO chief Tedros said. In many parts of the world, testing has dwindled dramatically, and people have largely stopped wearing masks. In some countries, mask-wearing mandates have resumed during COVID outbreaks. The WHO published a plan this week advising countries on how to live with COVID long-term. COVID will continue to challenge health systems worldwide long term, including long COVID, infectious disease experts say. No one should take (this) to mean COVID-19 is no longer a problem, said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. It is still a significant public health problem and looks likely to remain one for the foreseeable future. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka can be on path to prosperity if debt sustainability achieved - IMF",
        "date": "May 5, 2023 11:57 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka can be put on the path to prosperity if the debt can be made sustainable by implementing the IMF-supported program properly, the Director of Asia  Pacific Department of the IMF Krishna Srinivasan says. Addressing a press briefing on the Regional Economic Outlook on Asia and Pacific, Srinivasan said: Sri Lanka is a country with a quintessential problem where you had twin deficit, you had a large increase in the fiscal deficits, putting pressure on the external accounts, reserves falling, exchange rate falling. Sri Lanka approached the IMF for a relief program, green-lighted by the global lenders Executive Board not too long ago, which places emphasis on macroeconomic stabilization, bringing inflation down. On March 20, 2023, the Executive Board of the IMF green-lighted a 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. The EFF program opens doors for Sri Lanka to access financing up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organizations. Srinivasan said Sri Lankas fiscal consolidation is based on revenue-based consolidation, partly because the island nation has among the lowest - in terms of revenue mobilization - tax collection, which goes back to the policy mistake it made pre-pandemic. Hence, the IMF-supported program is a revenue-based consolidation which provides stability to the countrys economy, Srinivasan explained, adding that it also wants to rein in inflation, which went through the roof. Further, the EFF program addresses governance and corruption issues in Sri Lanka, which is the first country in Asia that has had a deep diagnostic on the issue of governance and corruption, the IMF official continued. Its also a program where we have a floor on how the country should support the poor and the vulnerable. And to make sure that the fiscal support they provide is temporary and targeted to the people who need it most. So, its a very comprehensive program and the fiscal consolidation by itself will not be enough. Sri Lanka needs to make good faith efforts to reach a debt agreement with its private, official and other creditors, Srinivasan noted. Speaking on Sri Lankas inflation, Srinivasan said the inflation has come down, albeit from high levels. Inflation has to come down durably because lets not forget, inflation is the worst kind of tax on the poor, and the poor and the vulnerable are hurting the most. In terms of restructuring, he said when Sri Lankas domestic debt is restructured, it is important to make sure that financial stability is safeguarded. The debt in Sri Lanka was assessed to be unsustainable. And thats why, before the program could be approved, there had to be a path towards restoring sustainability. And that includes restructuring debt to all creditors -- private creditors, official creditors, and to some extent, domestic debt, for the simple reason that debt sustainability is quite a big challenge in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "May 6, 2023 09:49 am",
        "content": "The first coronation in 70 years is to take place on Saturday (May 06), with King Charles III and the Queen Consort preparing for their historic carriage ride to Westminster Abbey in London. Despite forecasts of rain, crowds have already begun to gather on the procession route. There will be a huge security operation in central London, with 100 heads of state set to attend. Protests have been promised by those opposed to the monarchy. The Coronation service, which will last almost two hours, will be seen first-hand by 2,300 guests, including Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who arrived from the United States on Friday on a commercial flight. It will be the first time since the release of Prince Harrys memoir that he will have been seen in public with his brother, Prince William, the Prince of Wales. It is thought Prince Harry may fly back to the US a matter of hours after the ceremony to rejoin his wife Meghan. Charles became king of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms in September, when his mother Elizabeth died after 70 years on the throne. Months of intense planning have gone into the coronation celebrations - the 40th to take place at Westminster Abbey since 1066. On the eve of the Coronation, the King looked relaxed as he went on a walkabout on the Mall, flanked by the Prince and Princess of Wales and a heavy security detail. Barbara Crowther, 69, and her friend Pauline, joined the crowds holding a Coronation Street banner. We werent going to camp, but there are so many people here, we thought that if we dont camp out, we wont get anywhere near the front, said Ms Crowther. Katie Gordon, from Wiltshire, was painting faces with her two daughters on Friday. She thinks the new King and Queen are going to be great. Were camping out tonight ready for the Coronation, and theyre painting everyones faces as they walk by, Ms Gordon said. Were doing it for free, its just something were doing. We bought the facepaints for ourselves and thought, why not do it for other people too? As the sun set on Friday, hundreds of tents had appeared along the Coronation route, with those gathered hoping to witness the historic event. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will preside over the service, with guests ranging from US First Lady Jill Biden to President Macron of France and entertainers Ant and Dec. Olena Zelenska, wife of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, met Catherine, Princess of Wales at a pre-Coronation reception at Buckingham Palace on Friday. Charles was photographed sharing warm words with the First Lady of Ukraine, and greeting Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, with a handshake and a kiss on the cheek. There has been controversy over whether people at home were being asked to pledge their allegiance to the King. The Church of England has made clear this is entirely optional and people might instead have a private moment of reflection. The keynote message of the Coronation from King Charles is in his first prayer when he reaches the Abbey reads: I come not to be served, but to serve. The high point of the ceremony will come when the St Edwards Crown is placed on the Kings head, a moment that will be marked by the Abbey bells being rung and a gun salute in nearby Horse Guards Parade. Camilla will be crowned alongside Charles - and after the couples long and often complicated relationship, she will now be officially described as Queen Camilla. The ceremony will emphasise diversity and inclusion, with more multi-faith elements than any previous coronation, with contributions from Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Sikh representatives. A Bible lesson will be read by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is Hindu, and music will be sung in Welsh and Scottish and Irish Gaelic. There will be women bishops taking part in the service for the first time in a coronation service that goes back almost a thousand years. After the service, at around 13:00 BST, King Charles and Queen Camilla will travel in the Gold State Coach back to Buckingham Palace, in a spectacular mile-long (1.6km) procession, with 4,000 soldiers and 19 military bands. Meticulous rehearsals for the procession were carried out by marching around a replica route with landmarks such as the Cenotaph marked out with traffic cones. When they reach the Palace, it remains uncertain who will be seen with the King and Queen for the traditional balcony appearance. There are plans for a flypast when the senior royals are on the Palace balcony, but there will be concerns about the weather, with a forecast for cloud and showers. The run-up to the Coronation has also seen a number of vocal protests from anti-monarchy groups - and the Republic campaign group has announced its intention to hold a protest on the route of the procession. There will be a massive security operation, with the Metropolitan Police putting 11,500 officers on duty in what it says will be its biggest ever single-day deployment. Anti-monarchy groups have defended their right to protest, but the police have warned that tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low. The guest list has also been disputed, with criticism of the presence of Chinese vice-president Han Zheng, accused of presiding over a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong. But this will be a ceremony played out before a huge global audience, with TV crews from all over the world arriving in London. They will see pageantry, religious symbolism and ancient traditions, with King Charles III crowned in a 700-year-old Coronation chair, in a ceremony that most people will never have seen before in their lives.

        "content": "New British monarch King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla were officially crowned in a magnificent coronation ceremony on Saturday (May 06), an opulent display of pomp and pageantry which dates back 1,000 years. His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen Consort travelled in a procession to Westminster Abbey for the coronation service on Saturday. This is the United Kingdoms first coronation in 70 years. Charles, who became the King of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms following the demise of his mother Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, is the oldest British monarch to have been crowned at the age of 74. Massive crowds gathered along the procession route to get a glimpse of the new monarchs. Meanwhile, thousands of military personnel were seen in London as a large security operation was in place for the historic event. The service was witnessed first-hand by some 2,200 people, with Heads of State, celebrities, and faith leaders in attendance. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who led the coronation service, acknowledged the multiple faiths observed in the UK by saying the Church of England will seek to foster an environment in which people of all faiths may live freely. Archbishop Welby then administered the coronation oath, which is a legal requirement. He asked King Charles to confirm that he would uphold the law and the Church of England during his reign, after which the sovereign placed his hand on the Holy Gospel and pledged to perform and keep the promises. The King also took a second oath - the Accession Declaration Oath - stating that he is a faithful Protestant. The high point of the ceremony came when the St. Edwards Crown was placed on the new Kings head, marked by the Abbey bells and a gun salute. Meanwhile, Camilla Parker Bowles, 75, was anointed and crowned in a simpler ceremony soon after the crowning of King Charles. She will now be officially addressed as Queen Camilla. The efforts to make the coronation ceremony more diverse and inclusive with more multi-faith elements, and contributions from Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Sikh representatives, are noteworthy. A Bible lesson was read out by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is of Hindu faith, and music was sung in Welsh, Scottish and Irish Gaelic. Meanwhile, female clergy were involved in the service for the first time after the Church of England allowed women to become bishops in 2014. Following the ceremony, the King and the Queen Consort will return to Buckingham Palace. Despite the celebratory mood in Britain for the coronation, there were some protests staged by anti-monarchy groups during which half a dozen people were arrested. -with inputs from agencies",

The High Commissioner stressed the vital role that economic integration between the two countries could play in Sri Lankas economic recovery, an official readout stated.

The matters discussed included further economic integration between Sri Lanka and India, enhancing Indian investments and tourism in Sri Lanka, ways and means to further promote bilateral trade, cooperation in power and energy sector as well as aspects relating to Rupee trade, the official readout stated further. Several banks in Sri Lanka have opened special rupee trading accounts, called Vostro accounts.

After receiving this information, the police personnel rushed to the islet and spotted the refugees waiting on the Indian shores. They were brought to the Mandapam station at around 7 a.m. for an interrogation. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the 10 people from Mullaitivu had decided to leave their country following the economic crisis, and the prices of essential goods touching new highs. The refugees claimed that they were not getting jobs regularly. A fisher said that for the last two months or so, he had not got work daily. In a week, for at least four days I remain idle... With no money in hand and the prices of rice and sugar rising due to scarcity, providing a proper meal for the family became very tough, he noted. Even borrowing money from friends or other sources had become difficult as the interest rates were high.  I thus decided to sell off some of my movables and with the proceeds, hired a boat to reach Indian shores, he summed up. A young woman, who was carrying her little child, said that they were coming to India for the first time and it was a bitter experience in Sri Lanka. Even with the new government in place, things have not improved from the common mans point of view. Getting jobs and essential goods from local grocery or ration shops remains very tough, she said. Having come to know that the Tamil Nadu government provided shelter and food, we felt at least for a temporary period, we could live peacefully.

        "date": "May 7, 2023 08:47 am",
        "content": "A gunman killed eight people and wounded seven others  three critically  in a shooting at a Dallas-area mall before being fatally shot by a police officer who happened to be nearby, authorities said Saturday. Officials did not immediately provide details about the victims, but witnesses reported seeing children among them. Some said they also saw what appeared to be a police officer and a mall security guard unconscious on the ground at Allen Premium Outlets. The gunman reportedly stepped out of a silver sedan and began shooting people outside the outlet mall in the suburb of Allen, forcing hundreds to lock down in stores or flee in panic in the latest gun violence to strike the country. Allen police said in a Facebook post that nine victims had been taken to hospitals. Medical City Healthcare, a Dallas-area hospital system, said in a written statement it was treating eight victims between the ages of 5 and 61. Their conditions were not disclosed. Dashcam video that circulated online showed a man step out of a vehicle outside the mall and immediately start shooting at people on the sidewalk. More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle recording the video drove off. An officer with the Allen Police Department was in the area on an unrelated call when he heard shots at 3:36 p.m., department wrote on Facebook. The officer engaged the suspect and neutralized the threat. He then called for emergency personnel. Nine victims were transported to local hospitals by Allen Fire Department, the agency wrote in the Facebook post, adding: There is no longer an active threat. Mass killings are happening with staggering frequency in the United States this year, averaging about one a week, according to an analysis of APUSA Today data. The White House said President Biden had been briefed on the shooting and that the administration had offered support to local officials. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who has signed laws easing firearms restrictions after previous mass shootings, called the attack an unspeakable tragedy. Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas), whose congressional district encompasses the mall, said he had confirmed with law enforcement that the shooter was dead, and that he had apparently acted alone. On Saturday evening, hundreds of shoppers stood outside across the street from the mall as officers circulated among them asking whether anyone had seen what happened. Fontayne Payton, 35, was at HM and wearing headphones when he heard the sound of gunshots. It was so loud, it sounded like it was right outside, Payton said. People in the store scattered before employees ushered them into the fitting rooms and then into a lockable backroom, he said. When they were given the all-clear to leave, Payton saw the store had broken windows and a trail of blood to the door. Discarded sandals and bloodied clothes lay nearby. Once outside, Payton saw bodies. I pray it wasnt kids, but it looked like kids, he said. The bodies were slumped over bags on the ground and covered in white towels, he said. It broke me when I walked out, to see that, he said. Further away, he saw the body of a heavyset man wearing all black. Payton said he assumed it was the shooter, because unlike the other bodies it had not been covered up. Stan and Mary Ann Greene said they were browsing in the Columbia Sportswear store when the shooting started. We had just gotten in, just a couple minutes earlier, and we just heard a lot of loud popping, Mary Ann Greene told AP. I said, Was that gunfire? Employees immediately rolled down the security gate and brought everyone to the rear of the store until police arrived and escorted them out, the Greenes said. Eber Romero was at the Under Armour store when a cashier said that there was a shooting. As he left the store, Romero said, the mall appeared empty, and all of the shops had their security gates down. Then he started seeing broken glass and people who had been shot on the floor. Video shared on social media showed people running through a parking lot amid the sound of gunfire. More than 30 police cruisers with lights flashing blocked an entrance to the mall after the emergency calls, and there were multiple ambulances, some from neighboring cities, on the scene. A live aerial broadcast from the news station showed armored trucks and other law enforcement vehicles stationed outside the sprawling outdoor mall. The Dallas office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also responded to the scene. Allen, a suburb about 25 miles north of downtown Dallas, has roughly 105,000 residents.

        "date": "May 7, 2023 11:43 am",
        "content": "Police arrested the leader of anti-monarchy group Republic and 51 others at King Charless coronation on Saturday, saying their duty to prevent disruption outweighed the right to protest. Hundreds of yellow-clad demonstrators gathered among the 10-deep crowds lining the procession route in central London to stand out from those clad in red, white and blue, and to hold up signs saying Not My King. Republic said its leader Graham Smith had been detained before the procession began and photos circulated on social media showing police officers seizing demonstrators placards. We absolutely understand public concern following the arrests we made this morning, Commander Karen Findlay of the London Metropolitan police said in a statement. Over the past 24 hours there has been a significant police operation after we received information protesters were determined to disrupt the Coronation procession. Republic had vowed to mount the biggest protest against a British monarch in modern history and protesters booed as King Charles and Queen Camilla made their way to Westminster Abbey, and as the service was relayed publicly on large speakers. It is disgusting and massively over the top, said Kevin John, 57, a salesman from Devon who was among the protesters. It is also hugely counterproductive by the police because all it has done is create a massive amount of publicity for us. It is completely crazy. Police did not confirm Smiths arrest. They said they had acted because they believed protesters would seek to deface public monuments with paint and disrupt official movements. All of these people remain in custody, Findlay said. Police said in a separate statement on Saturday that they had arrested three people earlier in the day based on intelligence that protesters were planning to throw rape alarms at the procession which could have scared the horses involved and thereby caused a risk to public safety. Amongst the items seized during the arrests in Londons Soho district were a number of rape alarms, the police added. Protests also took place in Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales, with participants holding up signs saying: Abolish the monarchy, feed the people. On social media, many contrasted Britains cost of living crisis with the pomp and pageantry. Although protesters were in a minority compared with the tens of thousands gathered to support the king, polls suggest support for the monarchy is declining and is weakest among young people. With the crown passing from Queen Elizabeth to her less popular son, republican activists hope Charles will be the last British monarch to be crowned. It has a hereditary billionaire individual born into wealth and privilege who basically symbolises the inequality of wealth and power in our society, said Clive Lewis, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker. STAGGERINGLY EXPENSIVE In London, protesters demanded an elected head of state, saying that the royal family has no place in a modern constitutional democracy and is staggeringly expensive. Dont you think this is all a bit silly, said one placard. Most of the anti-monarchy protesters had congregated in Trafalgar Square next to the bronze statue of King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649, leading to a short-lived republic. Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events. He was heckled at a Commonwealth Day event at Westminster Abbey in March and targeted with eggs in York in November. The death of the queen has also reignited debate in Australia, Jamaica and other parts of the Commonwealth over the need to retain Charles as their head of state. The state government of New South Wales said it had decided not to light up the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark the coronation in order to save money. Events in other countries where Charles is head of state were also low key. While many other European monarchies have come and gone, or are far diminished in scale and importance, the British royal family has remained remarkably resilient. In Britain, polls show the majority still want the royal family, but there is a long-term trend of declining support. A poll by YouGov last month found 64 of people in Britain said they had little or no interest in the coronation. Among those aged 18 to 24, the number rose to 75. Source  Reuters -Agencies",
