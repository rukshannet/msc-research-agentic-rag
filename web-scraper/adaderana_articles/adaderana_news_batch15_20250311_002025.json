        "date": "April 8, 2023 05:45 pm",
        "content": "China has proposed setting up of a radar base in Sri Lanka, aiming to counter Indias naval presence and strategic oversight in the Indian Ocean region, a report has claimed. The proposed radar base will focus on monitoring the activities of the Indian Navy while also evaluating New Delhis strategic assets in the region, Economic Times reported. The paper reported that Aerospace Information Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the likely agency which is steering this project in the forests of Dondra Bay, Sri Lanka, about 155 km southeast of Colombo. The proposed radar will have the capability to track US military movements at its military base in Diego Garcia, an island of the British Indian Ocean Territory, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, located over 1700 km southwest of Dondra Bay. The report, while citing people familiar with the developments related to Chinese proposal, said that the radar set-up, if successfully established by Beijing, would be detrimental to Indian military installations as they will be in the range of the proposed radar. The proposed Chinese oversight installation in Sri Lanka is likely to have the range as far as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to its east. Sri Lanka remains vulnerable to Chinese designs in the region because of the Chinese debt owed to the country. Dondra Bay is located at the southernmost tip of Sri Lanka. It forms a significant part of Sri Lankas history. India has been concerned about Chinese activities in Sri Lanka. Last year, Chinese surveillance vessel Yuan Wang 5 docked at the Hambantota Port after the Sri Lankan government conceded to the Chinese request despite Indian warnings. Sri Lanka allowed the vessel to dock at Hambantota and remain for six days for refuelling and logistics supplies. Source  WION  Agencies - Agencies",

        "date": "April 8, 2023 09:25 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas national carrier has been struggling against even more headwinds than many of its rivals. Airlines around the world have been buffeted by the impact of countries closing their borders during the pandemic and soaring fuel prices due to the Ukraine war. State-owned SriLankan Airlines is also facing the worst economic crisis for decades in its home country. Its British-born boss told the BBC how he plans to turn the firm around. I think the first lesson for me is dont ever go and be a CEO during Covid, Richard Nuttall, the chief executive of SriLankan Airlines, jokes when asked what his biggest takeaway is from the last two years. Mr Nuttall has spent decades in the airline industry, working with names including Cathay Pacific and Philippines Airlines. He became the chief executive of SriLankan Airlines in April last year, after joining the company in November 2021 as its chief commercial officer. He joined the loss-making carrier after Sri Lanka eased its coronavirus border restrictions and hopes were high that the firm was set to see a recovery in passenger numbers. However, the economic problems that had been dragging on the country since before the pandemic deepened in the summer of 2021. A series of missteps by the government resulted in the worst economic crisis since the countrys independence, depleting Sri Lankas foreign reserves needed to import everything from food to fuel. Soaring prices saw protesters taking to the streets, which hammered the countrys tourism industry, which was vital to its economy. Countries that advised their citizens to not travel to Sri Lanka smacked of double standards, Mr Nuttall said. In the west, protest is a sign of democracy and nobody issues travel advisories. But when you have a protest in somewhere like Sri Lanka, everybody slaps on travel advisories. In February, Sri Lanka secured a 3bn (2.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund. As part of the plan to rebuild its shattered economy, the government aims to raise funds by privatising SriLankan Airlines. In February this year, unable to meet interest payments due end of the year, the company defaulted on a 175m (140m) bond. Mr Nuttall highlighted that, while he was not against selling off the business, there was still a lot of work to be done to restructure its debt before that can happen. If we can structure that debt, then a large part of what were paying as interest comes back and can be used to run the airline, he said. And it means that an outside investor can come in and not pay for the sins of the past. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "(Reuters) - At least 23 African migrants were missing and four died on Saturday after their two boats sank off Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy, a judicial official said, amidst a sharp rise in migrant boats from the North African country. The coast guard rescued 53 others off the southern city of Sfax, two of whom are in critical condition, Sfax court Judge Faouzi Masmoudi said. He added that four bodies were recovered. In recent weeks, dozens have gone missing and died in repeated drowning accidents off the Tunisian coast. Tunisia has taken over from Libya as a main departure point for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East in the hope of a better life in Europe. Crackdowns on human trafficking in Libya have made Tunisia a more accessible option. The National Guard said on Friday that more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, were intercepted or rescued in the first three months of the year while trying to cross into Europe, five times more than figures recorded in the same period last year. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday that Europe risks seeing a huge wave of migrants arriving on its shores from North Africa if financial stability in Tunisia is not safeguarded. Meloni called on the IMF and other countries to help Tunisia quickly to avoid its collapse. Tunisian Foreign Minister Nabil Ammar said last week the country needed funding and equipment to better protect its borders. Tunisia had received equipment from Italy in the past years, but Ammar said it was outdated and not sufficient. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "To tackle the enormous economic challenge that Sri Lanka is facing, everyone must come together to support the recovery and promote stable and inclusive growth, says the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer. Speaking in a video on the IMF YouTube channel on supporting recovery and promoting stable and inclusive growth in Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer states that after years of increasing economic problems and policy mistakes, Sri Lanka has committed to report and rebuild. The IMF is here to help. The fund has approved about USD 3 billion over the next four years to support Sri Lanka in this time of need, he said, in the video. Peter Breuer, the IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka expresses that since 2019, significant tax cuts and delays in anticipated reforms have left the country entering the pandemic with thin currency reserves, high debt levels and no fiscal space to buffer against shocks. With no reserves left, power cuts, shortages of food and medicines, and long lines for petrol emerged. Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history. There are no easy solutions, but thats where everyone must come together to tackle this enormous problem, Mr. Breuer mentioned. Furthermore, Mr. Breuer points out that Sri Lankans must make efforts to continue their way out of the crisis while supporting the less fortunate, highlighting that the global community must support Sri Lanka in this effort so that it can once again be on a path of strong and inclusive growth. Working with the Fund, the Sri Lankan authorities have put together an ambitious economic recovery program, including reforms to raise the government revenue, stabilize prices, build up foreign reserves and safeguard financial stability, he explained, adding that the Sri Lankan authorities are also asking their creditors to support their efforts by granting debt relief. When a crisis strikes, the poor are hit hardest. The program aims to raise spending for the poor and vulnerable, strengthen social safety nets and introduce progressive tax reforms to ensure greater contributions come from high-income earners, he said. In addition, Mr. Breuer has also highlighted that with breathing room from external debt relief, the IMF expects Sri Lankas economy to gradually start to recover and expand. Its critical to ensure the hard-won gains from the reforms benefit the Sri Lankan people, and the crisis will not repeat itself, he claimed. The IMF representative who emphasized that the authorities have committed to improving public financial management and strengthening the anti-corruption legal framework, also expressed that in addition, the IMF will assess governance and corruption vulnerabilities and provide recommendations. We, at the IMF look forward to working closely with the people of Sri Lanka for a brighter future for all.",

With Easter commemorating the resurrection of Jesus, it is an occasion for us to reflect on the values of love, peace, and forgiveness as espoused by Him, which are at the core of Sri Lankan culture, and we must come together with family, friends and communities, to solemnize the blessings life has to offer. We are presently seeking to overcome an era of unprecedented hardship, uncertainty and disappointment and are looking forward to a better tomorrow. The Government is dedicated to realizing the aspirations of all Sri Lankans regardless of race, religion, party or color. I strongly believe that we can overcome these challenges in the near future. However, it is crucial that we all unite on a common agenda that elevates us beyond narrow political objectives and regressive trends, and instead paving the way for the country toward progress.

The move is aimed at preventing resistance against the hijab law, said the statement, carried by the judiciarys Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes Irans spiritual image and spreads insecurity. A growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman while in custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the protests following her death. But although risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media. Meanwhile, dozens of female students at schools in a central town and the northwestern city of Ardabil were taken ill on Saturday in a new wave of suspected poisonings which affected hundreds of schoolgirls across Iran earlier this year. This morning, students smelled an unpleasant odour, had a burning sensation in the throat and felt weak so they were immediately transferred to medical centres by emergency personnel, a security official in Ardabil told reporters, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. A fact-finding committee investigating the suspected poisonings is expected to report to parliament in about two weeks, its head was quoted as saying by the semi-official news agency ILNA. Authorities have accused the Islamic Republics enemies of using the attacks to undermine the clerical establishment. But suspicions have fallen on hardline groups operating as self-declared guardians of their interpretation of Islam. Saturdays police statement on the hijab law called on owners of businesses to seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections. Under Irans Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest. Describing the veil as one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation and one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic, an Interior Ministry statement on March 30 said there would be no retreat on the issue. It urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives in past decades have emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

The companys artificial intelligence powered Ernie bot, launched last month, has been touted as Chinas closest answer to the U.S.-developed chatbot ChatGPT. Baidu said it had lodged lawsuits in Beijing Haidian Peoples Court against the developers behind the counterfeit applications of its Ernie bot and the Apple company. At present, Ernie does not have any official app, Baidu said in a statement late on Friday posted on its official Baidu AI WeChat account. It also posted a photograph of its court filing. Until our companys official announcement, any Ernie app you see from App Store or other stores are fake, it said. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Reuters search on Saturday found there were still at least four apps bearing the Chinese-language name of the Ernie bot, all fake, in Apples App Store. The Ernie bot is only available to users who apply for and receive access codes. In its statement, Baidu also warned against people selling access codes. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Speaking at a party conference in Kolonnawa, he stated that the people will take to the streets voicing their requirement to go to a national economy built on nationalism and localism. When the work done by all leaders who emerged in Sri Lanka after independence was put on one side of a scale, and the work done by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa was put on the other side, his side is too heavy. So, this party of yours is not a party that can be brought down by torching houses, by attacking or by threatening, he said. MP Kariyawasam also mentioned that the SLPPs tenure was the time period where no debt was taken, but the prevailing debts were paid. We, the SLPP needed to build the country by not obtaining a loan, which your child will have to pay back in the future. No matter how many economic difficulties there were, our tenure was the period in which no debt was taken, but when the debt was paid. We can see how the leaders who led the Aragalaya protest movement are partying today. Did the people of this country rally for such a future? I think, as a party, the people of this country will need us again in the very near future, Kariyawasam claimed.",

        "date": "April 9, 2023 08:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said on Sunday that the government would follow the Supreme Courts observations on the proposed new Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), amid objection from the Opposition and the civil society groups. He said the decision to delay the tabling of the bill in parliament was based on requests made by various organizations for more consultation. So that they would have more time to go to the Supreme Court if they wished to do so, Rajapakshe said. The new Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) will replace the much-maligned Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) of 1979, which was enforced to counter the then Tamil separatist militancy. On April 1, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told reporters that the new counter-terrorism law will be introduced later this month. However, the justice minister later said the bill would be delayed to either late April or early May. Rajapakshe said that under the new bill the defence ministers powers of PTA, which allowed indefinite and arbitrary detention, had been diluted. It will be the police who will be ordering detention and anyone arrested must be produced before court in 24 hours, he told reporters. Rajapakshe said if the new counter terrorism act was going against the fundamental and human rights of individuals, the Supreme Court would rule as such. Under the Sri Lankan parliamentary practice, any new bill could be challenged in the highest court to judge on its constitutionality within 14 days of its presentation in parliament. The Supreme Court would rule if it required a simple or absolute majority in the 225-member assembly and if it would need a national referendum for its adoption to become law. On March 17, the new Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 97 pages was published in the government gazette. The opposition and civil society groups objected to the new ATA, saying it targets the civil society protests which took place mid-last year over the then governments failure in handling the ongoing economic crisis. Since 2016, the European Union has been urging the government to repeal the PTA and bring in new counter-terrorism legislation in line with international standards. The EU has linked its GSP export tariff concessions to Sri Lanka modifying its counter-terrorism Act. The main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa had slammed the bill as undemocratic and authoritarian. The opposition and rights groups fear that anyone expressing democratic opposition to the government could be targeted using the ATA. Sri Lanka, which currently is reeling under its worst economic crisis, has witnessed several activities that have threatened its national security. The nation saw the end of the Tamil insurgency in 2009 after the killing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. A fresh security threat dented the countrys security after the Easter suicide attacks in 2019 that killed 290 people. Source - PTI -Agencies",

        "content": "Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for an attack on a village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo that authorities said killed around 20 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its Telegram channel. The attack, which took place on Friday in Musandaba, a village on the outskirts of Beni, is part of a wave of violence against civilians that the army and local authorities blame on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan group based in eastern Congo that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State. We counted about 20 dead on Friday in the village of Musandaba, said the military administrator of Beni territory, Colonel Charles Omeonga. He accused the ADF. Local activist Janvier Kasereka Kasayirio said 22 bodies had arrived at a nearby hospital. An army spokesman in the North Kivu region where the attack took place, Anthony Mwalushay, said the assailants used machetes to avoid confrontation with the army. The attack took place in one of two conflict-hit provinces where Congo replaced civilian authorities with military administrations more than a year ago in an attempt to halt the violence. This week, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo condemned another massacre committed by the ADF in neighbouring Ituri province, which it says killed 30 people.

        "date": "April 10, 2023 10:14 am",
        "content": "Recent cases of Chinese nationals who have been trafficked overseas with the promise of high salaries but ended up trapped in illegal activities including telecom scams and online gambling are a warning for Chinese nationals to keep a wary eye on recruitment traps overseas, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka said in a notice over the weekend. The Chinese Embassy had rescued 13 Chinese nationals who were trafficked to Sri Lanka, cut off from contacts with their families and the outside world, and forced to engage in illegal activities such as telecom scams and internet gambling, the embassy said in its media release. The victims were subject to threats against their lives and suffered physical abuses from corporal punishment and torture when they failed to accomplish their tasks or when they attempted to escape, the embassy said. According to the Criminal Law of the Peoples Republic of China, victims involved in overseas telecom scams will most probably face punishment even if they were coerced into committing the crime, Zhao Guohua, lawyer and co-founder of Beijing Mingji Law Firm, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that the criminals use job opportunities as bait to lure some young Chinese people who are under great employment pressure. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka quickly coordinated with local police to carry out rescue operations upon learning of the situation, captured key members of the telecom fraud gang and the suspects involved in illegally harming and detaining the victims, and successfully rescued the 13 Chinese nationals who were trapped by the scheme after they believed the so-called high salary, low threshold, short working hours, and enjoyable traveling welfare and other overseas job recruitment information. A similar rescue operation was conducted by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar on Thursday with a Chinese national smuggled into Myanmar and forced to engage in telecom fraud rescued. In recent years, online gambling and telecom fraud have caused social problems in Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka, with some Chinese nationals falling victims to murder, kidnapping and human trafficking. Some people are lured to overseas by the promise of high salaries. A major human trafficking case was disclosed on Friday by the general border inspection station for entry and exit of South Chinas Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region under the National Immigration Administration. Police announced the dismantling of a large-scale trafficking gang that organized Chinese nationals to leave the country illegally by sea to engage in transnational criminal activities. A total of 108 suspects from the gang were apprehended including 69 punished with prison sentences ranging from nine months to eight years and fines between 5,000 Yuan and 200,000 Yuan (29,093). The criminal gang posted the so-called recruitment advertisements on Chinese social media offering highly paid overseas jobs and promising to reimburse all travel expenses to lure potential job-hunters into traps. One gang member said that it would promise a monthly salary of between 8,000 Yuan and 16,000 Yuan, even up to 20,000 Yuan. Border police have reminded the public to stay vigilant and make sure to go overseas for work through a regular and legal labor agency. They should not believe recruitment ads that promise high salaries and benefits, which can not only endanger personal safety but also lead to crimes. Source - Global Times -Agencies",

        "content": "Police have opened fire at a car that failed to comply with the police orders to stop near the Godawela Railway Crossing in Polgahawela today (April 10). A group of police officers on duty, who were on the lookout for a car that was transporting narcotics, based on a tip-off received by the Polgahawela Police, had reportedly ordered the car travelling from the Kurunegala direction to stop. However, the police officers had shot at the vehicle, as it continued to travel without stopping despite the police orders. The gunshot had reportedly hit a tire of the car. Ada Derana reporter mentioned that the police officers had managed to stop the car after travelling around one kilometer following the shooting, and apprehended three individuals who were travelling inside the car. The occupants of the car included two men and a woman, according to Ada Derana reporter. Police have also seized several packets of drugs from inside the vehicle at the time, and had later found some other packets, suspected to also contain drugs, which were thrown away, based on the details revealed during the interrogations of the arrested suspects.",

        "content": "Indias health ministry is conducting mock drills to check preparedness of hospitals to deal with rising Covid-19 cases. The drills are being held on Monday and Tuesday across the country. Indias active case count is relatively low but experts are urging caution to stop further spread of the disease. The country saw a deadly second wave in 2021 and the government came under criticism as many hospitals ran out of oxygen and critical care beds. India recorded close to 6,000 new cases on Sunday, government data shows. The active case count was 35,000. The surge is largely driven by XBB.1.16, which is an omicron subvariant. The WHO has said it was watching the subvariant and the spread in India. Experts say its not known to be lethal. Its been in circulation for a few months. We havent seen a change in severity in individuals or in populations, but thats why we have these systems in place, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOs COVID-19 technical lead, recently said. Many cities in India have seen a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks, but the surge has not led to an increase in hospital admissions. Both public and private hospitals are participating in the mock drills, which are being supervised by Indias health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, and other state health ministers. In an online meeting held on 7 April, Mr Mandaviya had also asked health officials to identify emergency hotspots by tracking cases related to respiratory illnesses and he also advised them to increase testing and vaccination for Covid-19. He also stressed the need for increasing awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks in public places. Meanwhile, some states have made it mandatory to wear masks in public and are urging citizens to follow Covid-19 safety protocols. India was on alert in December as well due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in neighbouring China, and had stepped up surveillance. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Provincial snap elections are not in the national interest of Pakistan given its economic turmoil and security situation, the countrys Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said on Monday. His comments defy an order from Pakistans Supreme Court last week that mandated the elections and they raise the risk of a constitutional crisis to add to the countrys political and economic upheaval. The court had set Monday as the deadline for the government to issue funds - 21 billion Pakistani rupees (73.4 million) - to Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and told the ECP to report back to it on Tuesday. Dar on Monday put forward a new financial bill to seek a vote on whether to approve funding for the election. The countrys economic, security and internal conditions demand that snap polls arent in the national interest, he said in a televised speech to parliament. Former prime minister Imran Khan dissolved his local governments in two provinces early this year to try to force the government to hold snap general elections across the country that are not due until October.

        "date": "April 10, 2023 05:30 pm",
        "content": "Through funding from the European Union (EU), a shipment of 3,820 tonnes of urea fertilizer procured by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture today, for distribution among smallholder paddy farmers and paddy seed farmers in Sri Lanka. This new shipment of urea fertilizer will be dispatched to over 72,200 smallholder paddy farmers who were severely impacted by the recent economic crisis in Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Ampara, Matale, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota districts and is integral to a 4 million Euro (approximately 1.5 billion rupees) programme launched by FAO and the EU to address the agriculture and food security crisis in Sri Lanka while supporting the introduction of integrated plant nutrient management strategy amongst identified paddy growers. Speaking on the support the EU has extended to revitalize Sri Lankas paddy cultivation sector, European Union Ambassador, Denis Chaibi said: The distribution of urea fertilizers for vulnerable farmers is one of many actions we undertook to respond to the socio-economic crisis affecting millions of people in Sri Lanka. We hope that with this new support we can prevent immediate food shortages but also contribute towards a transition to a more sustainable and resilient agriculture sector in the future. Through this programme, every eligible farmer cultivating up to 0.5 Ha of land in the targeted districts will receive 50kg of urea fertilizer for the upcoming cultivating season. Additionally, the programme will also provide high-quality paddy seeds and the necessary technologycapacity building to boost the efficient use of fertilizer. Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera said, This initiative by EU and FAO goes beyond providing material inputs and addresses the countrys long-term need to ensure sustainability of the local agriculture sector. I am appreciative of this support extended to our farmers as this will go a long way in helping Sri Lanka become a food secure nation. This consignment of essential urea fertilizer will be the first component of the multi-faceted support FAO will provide through valuable funding from the EU, to boost Sri Lankas paddy production and revitalize the local agriculture sector. We will work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Irrigation to ensure its success while helping the countrys agriculture sector improve its sustainability through capacity building and training of extension officials and farmers, FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan said. Crop failures during recent harvesting seasons due to shortages of fertilizer and vital inputs, have posed many challenges for smallholder paddy farmers to sustain their livelihoods. This programme seeks to encourage smallholder farmers through material and technical inputs to adopt scientific farming practices to enhance fertilizer use efficiency and strengthen the seed paddy production system in Sri Lanka to meet the current demand. The programme also aims to strengthen government seed farms by providing them with modern, state-of-the-art seed processing and drying machines.",

        "content": "Two bodies were found Monday in the rubble following an explosion that collapsed a building in the southern French city of Marseille, bringing the confirmed death toll to four as rescuers continue searching for four more people who are unaccounted-for. Two other bodies had previously been found overnight. The judicial authority will proceed to identify the victims, firefighters said in a statement. Minister for Cities and Housing Olivier Klein told reporters that at least four people have died, after he met with rescuers on site. The hope to find survivors is still there, Minister for Cities and Housing Olivier Klein told reporters. It is very meticulous work done by firefighters, he added, noting the risk for adjacent buildings to collapse. More than 100 firefighters were mobilized for the searches. Marseille mayor Benoit Payan tweeted Monday that the pain and sorrow are great. He expressed his thoughts for the families of the victims and those who are suffering. Rescue and search operations are continuing, without respite, he said. An investigation has been opened for involuntary injury, at least initially sidestepping possible criminal intentions. A gas explosion was among the avenues of investigation, prosecutor Dominique Laurens said Sunday evening. The collapse occurred shortly before 1 a.m. on Sunday, in an old quarter in the center of Marseille, Frances second-largest city, less than a kilometer (a half-mile) from its iconic old port. About 200 people have been evacuated from their homes in the area. In 2018, two buildings in the center of Marseille collapsed, killing eight people. Those buildings were poorly maintained  not the case with the building that collapsed Sunday, the interior minister said. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed officials to develop a formal plan aimed at maximizing the contribution of the Nuwara Eliya District, a major tourist city, to the Sri Lankan Governments program to establish a stable economy within a four-year timeframe. During a discussion held at the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat this morning (10), the President instructed officials to work on a formal plan to maximize the contribution of the Nuwara Eliya District, the Presidents Media Division reported. The discussion also included the unveiling of the Nuwara Eliya New Town Development Plan and the Nuwara Eliya Tourism Plan, which were attended by political authority and government officials from the Nuwara Eliya District. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who spoke at the occasion, highlighted that despite the belief of many that the countrys economy could not be rebuilt, the agreement reached by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Government, provides an opportunity for fresh hope on the countrys economy. The President emphasized the importance of developing the Nuwara Eliya District as a striking city that can attract tourists throughout the year, targeting both local and foreign tourists. The President stressed the importance of preparing the development plans while considering the needs of tourists. He explained that the plans should prioritize creating a pleasant environment for tourists to relax, rather than focusing on constructing large buildings. He also pointed out that the absence of a formal system for rainwater drainage in Nuwara Eliya City is a longstanding issue, and he urged officials to implement an urgent program to address this problem. Additionally, he directed special attention to solving the problem of drinking water in the area. Mr. Wickremesinghe further explained that buildings in the Nuwara Eliya City should be done according to a proper plan, rather than constructing buildings haphazardly. He emphasized that the city has suffered due to the construction of large buildings and that officials should consider whether to turn it into a bustling metropolis like New York or maintain its identity as Nuwara Eliya. The President highlighted the likelihood of an increase in tourist arrivals to Nuwara Eliya with the completion of the Central Expressway and stressed the importance of developing facilities in accordance with a proper plan. He also emphasized that no party or investor should be allowed to damage the resources of the Nuwara Eliya District, and that all development should be environmentally friendly and well-planned. Furthermore, Mr. Wickremesinghe called for government officials and political authorities to work in a well-coordinated manner in these matters. He encouraged everyone to think beyond the traditional framework and align themselves with the new program needed by the country. Following the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his intention to meet with all the secretaries of ministries, chairpersons of authorities and commissions, as well as heads of departments in order to obtain their contribution to realize the targeted 2025 development plan. During the discussion, there was a widespread focus on developing the Nuwara Eliya District through sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. There was a detailed conversation regarding the development activities to be carried out in the city under the Nuwara Eliya City Development Plan, as well as the development of Nanu Oya as a sub-city. Plans were also made to develop Nuwara Eliya as a green city by preserving forest conservation areas, and five suburbs were earmarked for development with Nuwara Eliya as the central hub. Additionally, the establishment of a university in Nuwara Eliya and the construction of a Ramayana Center were also discussed during the meeting. The President issued instructions to modernize the Nanu-Oya Railway Station and establish a high-quality economic centre nearby. The aim is to enable farmers to pack their vegetables and transport them safely and conveniently to Colombo. The development of the racecourse and the lake, improvement of parking facilities, and speedy implementation of a formal water management program in Nuwara Eliya were given special attention during the discussions. In addition, a program to increase the income of local residents and improve their lives was discussed at length. The event was attended by Minister Jeevan Thondaman, Nuwara Eliya District Members of Parliament S.B. Dissanayake, C.B. Ratnayake, V.S. Radhakrishnan and M. Rameswaran, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Nuwara Eliya District Secretary Nandana Galabada, and other government officials. --PMD",

        "date": "April 10, 2023 09:47 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  A shooting Monday at a bank in downtown Louisville, Kentucky killed at least four people and wounded at least eight others, police said. The suspected lone shooter was also dead. The shooting, the 15th mass killing in the United States this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, about 160 mile (260 kilometers) to the south. Police arrived as gunshots were still being fired inside the Old National Bank and exchanged fire with the shooter, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said at a news conference. It wasnt clear whether the shooter was killed himself or was shot by officers. We believe this is a lone gunman involved in this that did have a connection to the bank. Were trying to establish what that connection was to the business, but it appears he was a previous employee, Humphrey said. Humphrey said that at least eight people were being treated at hospitals for wounds, including two police officers, one of whom was in critical condition. An emotional Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he lost friends in the shooting in a building on East Main Street not far from the Louisville Slugger Field and Waterfront Park. This is awful, he said. I have a very close friend who didnt make it today. And I have another close friend who didnt, either. And one whos at the hospital that I hope is going to make it through. It was the second time that Beshear was personally touched by a mass tragedy since becoming governor. In late 2021, one of the towns devastated by tornadoes that tore through Kentucky was Dawson Springs, the hometown of Beshears father, former two-term Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Andy Beshear frequently visited Dawson Springs as a boy and has talked emotionally about his fathers hometown. Humphrey, the deputy chief, said the actions of responding police officers in Louisville on Monday morning had undoubtedly saved lives. This is a tragic event, he said. But it was it was the heroic response of officers that made sure that no more people were more seriously injured than what happened. This years 15 mass shootings is the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009, when 16 incidents had occurred by April 10, according to a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. Going back to 2006, the first year for which data has been compiled, the years with the most mass killings were 2019 and 2022, with 45 and 42 mass killings recorded during the entire calendar year. The pace in 2009 slowed later in the year, with 32 mass killings recorded that year. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2023 08:51 am",
        "content": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will push this week for urgent resolution of requests by Zambia and Ghana for restructuring of their sovereign debts, and moves to conclude a debt treatment for Sri Lanka, U.S. Treasury said on Monday. Yellen, who is slated to meet counterparts from around the world during this weeks meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), is also pushing for concrete steps to speed up the overall debt relief process and make it more predictable, Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh said. During the week, Secretary Yellen will ... maintain urgency for the speedy resolution of Common Framework cases like Zambia and Ghana to remove debt overhangs and foster growth in developing countries, Treasury said in a statement. Sri Lanka, Zambia and Ghana have already defaulted on their overseas debt and are working towards debt reworks with creditors. Some 60 of low-income countries are in or near debt distress, but the Group of 20 (G20) common framework set up to help low-income countries has failed to deliver quick debt relief. At a broad level, were really just pushing to improve the speed and predictability of this framework, Shambaugh said at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank. This is going to require constructive and timely participation of all creditors in international debt restructuring discussions. Shambaugh said Treasurys immediate priority was resolving outstanding requests from Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia under the G20 framework, and from Sri Lanka, which is working on a separate debt plan since it is a middle-income country. He said Washington was pressing for concerted action on Zambias debt treatment and the formation of a creditor committee for Ghana in the next month, adding that the two largest economies in the world - the United States and China - needed to collaborate on these challenges. At these meetings, were going to be working very hard to speed up this process, make it more transparent and make it function better, he said, adding that progress had been slower than we would like. A senior Treasury official said it was up to China whether Zambias case could be resolved this week. Yellen and other G7 officials have long criticized Chinas slow movement on specific debt treatment cases under the G20 framework, although they have welcomed Chinas agreement to provide financing assurances for Sri Lanka, which paved the way for an IMF lending package. DEBT ROUNDTABLE Yellen will discuss the debt issue in separate meetings on Wednesday with officials from the G20 and the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, which includes debtor countries, Treasury said. The official expressed hope that the debt roundtable meeting would yield actual accomplishments, the official said. What were looking for is concrete steps that will make the process operate faster, and in a more transparent way. Sources familiar with the matter said the co-chairs of the roundtable - the IMF, the World Bank and India as current president of the G20 - planned to issue a statement after Wednesdays meeting. A record number of developing nations are at risk of a debt crisis, with ballooning inflation, escalating borrowing costs and a strong dollar jacking up the cost for borrowing countries to repay loans and raise fresh money. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last week also took aim at China, saying she had told the countrys new top economic leader that Beijing needed to speed up its work on debt restructuring requests. World Bank chief David Malpass said on Monday he hoped meetings this week with Chinese officials could help break the ice on badly needed debt relief for poor countries. Yellen has no formal meetings with Chinese counterparts on her schedule, but the U.S. official said officials from the Biden administration and China will continue dialogue where were able to.

        "title": "G20 finance heads face reform calls from Global South",
        "date": "April 11, 2023 11:41 am",
        "content": "The guardians of the global economy are meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week to discuss a daunting set of challenges  slowing global growth, banking sector vulnerability and growing calls for multilateral reform. Alongside the IMFs annual spring meetings with the World Bank in Washington, DC, finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBG) of the Group of Twenty, or G20, will meet on April 12-13th. While problems facing the global economy will be at the top of the agenda, tensions related to the war in Ukraine may make it difficult to produce an agreed plan of action. To shore up confidence in the global financial system, G20 officials are likely to discuss providing temporary backstops for bank deposits, Edward Glossop, the assistant director of macroeconomics at Ernst  Young, told Al Jazeera. It seems inevitable that the Fed United States Federal Reserve will seek to extend daily swap lines currency exchanges between major central banks, usually transacted on a weekly basis until the end of April, to keep an ample supply of money flowing through global markets, Glossop added. In January, the World Bank lowered its 2023 growth forecast for the global economy to just 1.7 percent, down from 3 percent. Last week, meanwhile, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva predicted the world will face years of anaemic growth. Washington-based lenders have warned that interest rate rises aimed at taming inflation are causing financial turbulence across the worlds banking system. Over the past 13 months, the US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark rate by 4.5 percentage points, with other major central banks following suit. Higher interest rates, which lower the value of fixed-rate assets and raise the probability of default for variable-rate instruments, have been blamed in part for the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Market jitters quickly spread to Europe, resulting in multinational investment bank UBSs shot-gun takeover of long-struggling Credit Suisse in March. The cheap money period came to an end when central banks started raising interest rates to try and lower consumer prices. Global risk appetite has since fallen, Glossop said. Elsewhere, the Federal Reserves recent tightening cycle has prompted international investors to move funds into US financial assets and away from riskier developing-country investments, rattling their economies. In particular, it has led to greater refinancing costs and widespread currency depreciations against the greenback. On top of higher import bills, falling currency values make existing foreign debt repayments more expensive. This has spurred calls for the G20, whose member states represent 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the worlds population, to work towards debt relief for developing countries. In an effort to contain inflation at home, the Fed and its counterparts will continue to do harm to developing countries if they persist with interest rate rises, Martin Guzman, Argentinas former minister of finance, told Al Jazeera. Last December, the World Bank estimated that low-income countries would face 62bn in external debt servicing this year, a 35 percent annual rise. Part of this increase was due to currency dynamics but the extent obviously varied between creditors, Guzman said. Approximately 66 percent of low-income-countries official debt is owed to China, the worlds largest sovereign creditor. At the last FMCBG meeting, the Reuters news agency reported that India tabled a proposal imploring bilateral lenders  including China  to take losses on outstanding loans. China, meanwhile, has challenged multilateral lenders such as the IMF and World Bank for not accepting haircuts on their loans. Beijing has maintained that debt relief efforts among all creditors should be joint and comprehensive, Guzman said. So this weeks FMCBG will a good opportunity to discuss the common framework. The G20s common framework is an attempt at coordinating sovereign debt relief among its members and request the same restructuring terms from private lenders. So far, only four countries have signed on. None has yet completed their debt negotiations. Guzman went on to note that improved guidelines, such as suspending debt repayments during negotiations and extending the common framework to middle-income countries as opposed to just low-income nations would help to validate the initiative. Apart from multi-lateral debt relief, observers are also calling for internal reform at international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). For Avinash Persaud, the climate envoy for Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley, the present moment offers an ideal opportunity to restore trust in multilateralism, especially in IFIs and MDBs. For starters, fund quota limits are too small for emergency lending, Persaud told Al Jazeera, alluding to IMF programmes such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, where country funding is capped at 150 percent of their capital commitments into the fund. This curbs the amount of lending for fiscal and climate emergencies. Instead, the fund should be seeking to play a similar role as the Fed of recent weeks, namely, a stopgap creditor with few lending conditions. Persaud also dismissed the World Banks cautious approach to risk tolerance. The Bank can raise billions of more dollars for developing countries by adjusting its loan-to-equity ratio by just 1 percent, he said. His remarks were echoed in a G20 July report which found that, by changing their lending ratios slightly, MDBs could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in new lending capacity. Still, Persaud sees this years leadership change at the World Bank as positive. In February, Ajay Banga was nominated to head the organisation after his predecessor, David Malpass, quit the role amid accusations of being a climate-change denier, which Malpass denied. Stakeholders are beginning to change their minds on questions about developing-country debt and the environment, Persaud said. Bangas appointment shows that. He will have a brief moment to shake things up at the start of his tenure. Lets hope the G20 support him. Source  Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "title": "Local Govt election postponed for second time",
        "date": "April 11, 2023 01:32 pm",
        "content": "The Election Commission says, for the second time, it is compelled to postpone the 2023 Local Government polls, scheduled to be held on April 25. In a special media release published today (April 11), Commissioner-General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake said the decision was reached due to reasons beyond the control of the election body and the inadequacy of funds to go ahead with the preparations for the Local Government polls. Thereby, the Returning Officers, after seeking the consultation of the election body, are expected to decide on a date for the polls, based either on the availability of funds or the court order pertaining to the matter. Ratnayake, in the press release, assured that the Election Commission would continue to take all necessary measures, as it has done thus far, to hold the Local Government polls at the earliest possible. Following the 2018 Local Government polls, which saw the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) securing a majority of the seats, the next election was originally scheduled to be held last year. However, the local elections were deferred indefinitely due to the exacerbated economic situation and the political instability in the country, while the term of office of local government bodies was extended for a period of one year. Eventually, the election was planned to be held on March 09, and the Printing Department and the Election Commission made repeated requests from the Treasury, seeking funds to prepare for the Local Govt polls. However, printing of ballot papers stalled without sufficient funds. Accordingly, the election was put off to April 25 only to be deferred once again. Against this backdrop, the Supreme Court, on March 03, issued an interim order, preventing the Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana from withholding budgetary allocations made for the Local Govt election. Later, several government MPs including Premnath C. Dolawatte alleged that the Supreme Courts interim order on the Local Government elections is a breach of parliamentary privileges. However, the move attracted widespread criticism, with many deeming it an attempt to postpone the election on the part of the government. Meanwhile, the term of office of 340 out of the 341 local government bodies, which was extended by one year, expired at midnight on March 19. After the tenure of the local government bodies expires, the authority of 29 municipal councils will be transferred to the municipal commissioners, while the authority of the 36 municipal councils and the 275 local councils is transferred to the secretaries of relevant institutions.",

Speaking during TV Deranas 360 programme last night (April 10), he emphasized that all members of the government are of the common opinion that the bill needs to be amended. There are some things in general that I cannot agree with. I mentioned them in the Cabinet. The first thing is that I dont agree with allowing a DIG to issue detention orders. It cannot be allowed. Either it should be vested with the Minister or at least that power should stay with the Defense Secretary, he said. When the definition is consideredgiving a broad definition to this is very dangerous. It can be misused. Minister Sabry pointed out that they are all of the opinion that this should be implemented as a law which can be used as a line of demarcation and only on instances of terrorism, but not to be used as a generally accepted law. In response to a question whether Sri Lanka has granted permission for China to establish a radar base in the Southern Province, as reported by certain sections of foreign media, the Minister claimed that no such request has been made from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so far, and that therefore, any such approval has not been granted to China by the ministry. Meanwhile, responding to another question as to under which provisions the IMF programme is going to be tabled in the parliament for a vote, he mentioned that parliament is the representation of the public in a representative democracy, due to which their consent will be sought. Then in the parliament, the peoples representatives can present their consent whether they like the programme or not, and if they are against it they need to present any alternatives. Commenting further, he also spoke on whether he will join President Wickremesinghe for his future political career. Im not usually the one to leave the camp. But I dont see anyone else for the leadership at the moment except President Wickremesinghe. I have not worked with him. I have continuously worked against him. Now I am working with him for the first time. While working with him, I see that we had a wrong understanding about him.",

        "date": "April 11, 2023 03:45 pm",
        "content": "Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has raised two concerns pertaining to the proposed Anti-Corruption Bill which is due to be tabled in Parliament soon. Issuing a statement in this regard, TISL noted that although the proposed legislature addresses several key points that various anti-corruption activists, including TISL, have been advocating for, it also seeks to override all other written law, and appears to send a negative signal to citizens willing to come forward as informants and whistleblowers to report corruption. It seeks to override all other written law, which includes the Right to Information Act. The proposed law contains sections that require officials of the CIABOC to sign oaths of secrecy and therefore, the disclosure of information by CIABOC under the new law will only be possible with special permission from the Commission. As such, the proposed law promotes a culture of secrecy by making access to information from the CIABOC more difficult and thereby negates the objective to enhance transparency in governance, as stated in the Bill. TISL also notes that Section 119 of the Bill, which refers to false allegations, appears to send a negative signal to citizens willing to come forward as informants and whistleblowers to report corruption. While the similar provision in the current law has not been misused targeting corruption fighters, this particular provision could become seriously counterproductive and dangerous in a context of a politically influenced public service, or in an adverse environment of stifled civic space, democratic deficits, weak governance or kleptocracy, the statement read. As an organization that advocates for citizens freedom of expression, TISL said it believes that the proposed Bill should be more robust and progressive enough to encourage whistleblowers and citizens to come forward and report corruption without fear of repercussions, while discouraging the corrupt. The organization further highlighted that the law itself, on paper, cannot solve the plague of systemic corruption in Sri Lanka since the effectiveness of the law will entirely depend on its enforcement. For instance, the Bill provides for joint investigations and international co-operation, which will have no impact unless this is practically implemented. Under this Bill, the CIABOC is granted immense police powers, which provides adequate space for CIABOC to carry out its functions. TISL reiterates that the successful implementation of those functions depends on the level of independence the Commission is given, starting with the appointment of the Commission and the Director-General, the creation of an enabling environment where the commission and law enforcement officials are able to act without undue influence and intimidation, availability of resources including human resources, financial independence, and knowledge capacity. The mere passage of this Bill, despite its progressive portions, will not be able to address the issue of corruption in Sri Lanka until there is the political will to lead the country by example, a system change that includes a cultural shift where the people resist corruption even at the petty level, and a context that is conducive to the whistleblowers, the statement read in this regard. Therefore, TISL has called upon the government, to rectify these concerns with the technical assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and to continue to engage with citizens, experts, and civil society, in order to adopt a holistic approach to achieve the envisaged goal of eradicating corruption in Sri Lanka.",

Accordingly, officials of the Immigration and Emigration Departments branch at the BIA have reportedly taken the required measures to deport the 31-year-old Nigerian on the same flight in which he had arrived, after he attempted to enter the island nation with a Bahamian passport. He had first travelled to Liberia from Nigeria, after which he had gone to Morocco and subsequently flown to Qatar, from where he arrived in Sri Lanka aboard a Qatar Airways flight. Upon his arrival, the Nigerian national was sent to the Border Surveillance Unit at the BIA based on suspicions of his passport. It was subsequently confirmed that the passport had, in fact, been forged. During the interrogation that followed, the Nigerian admitted to the passport being falsified, explaining that he opted to travel with it after several of his applications for a Sri Lankan visa had been rejected since 2022. This issue comes in the backdrop of several Nigerian nationals being accused of various financial crimes involving ATMs, online databases and social media, which has reportedly made it harder for them to enter Sri Lanka, while also being subjected to strict background searches.",

        "date": "April 11, 2023 11:58 pm",
        "content": "The Australian law firm, which is assisting Sri Lankas Attorney Generals Department with the civil suit to claim compensation for the environmental damage caused by the shipwreck of MV X-Press Pearl, has advised that carrying out the litigation process in Singapore is favourable to the island nation, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) says. This was disclosed during a meeting held at the Justice Ministry with the participation of the Attorney General and the senior officials of the department, the top management of the MEPA, and a group of lawyers with expertise in maritime law. The meeting was chaired by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The Singapore-flagged container ship MV X-Press Pearl, only three months after being commissioned, was gutted in a fire that erupted off the western coast of Sri Lanka on 19 May 2021. Following the disaster, the MEPA appointed a committee of experts comprising professors and other relevant top public officials to assess the damage. The panel handed over its second Environment Damage Assessment Report to the Attorney Generals Department on 13 January 2023. The MEPA says it has provided all necessary documents to the Attorney Generals Department to prosecute the ship owner or the operator or the ships agents in Sri Lanka under the Criminal Law, in terms of Section 26 of the Prevention of Maritime Corruption Act. As the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is given to continue the litigation process in Singapore, the Attorney Generals Department is proceeding with the legal matter accordingly. However, the committee of expert lawyers appointed to look into the matter has suggested that the prosecution be done in Sri Lanka. The decision to continue the legal proceedings in Singapore recently attracted criticism as it was deemed a very costly move. According to the Australian law firms advice, with Singapore being a renowned international maritime hub and its up-to-date maritime laws, filing the lawsuit in the Southeast Asian country is advantageous for Sri Lanka, the Attorney General told the attendees of the meeting. In addition, the owner of the X-Press Pearl and all other major parties linked to the shipwreck are based in Singapore, and implementing a court order in Singapore or in the United Kingdom, where the main office of the vessels insurance company is located, will be plain sailing for Sri Lanka, the Attorney General has explained further.",

        "date": "April 12, 2023 07:44 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lankas sovereign lenders have yet to inform the government how they will engage with the country to restructure its 7.1 billion of debt and whether they will form an official committee or engage in bilateral talks, the central bank governor told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. The island nation aims to formally engage in debt negotiations with overseas creditors that include China, India and the Paris Club group of nations in May, after concluding a debt rework with holders of its domestic debt. Its up to the creditors to decide. We are happy if there is one platform, as it would be easier to discuss and share information, central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told Reuters. Whether they are coming together or on a separate bilateral basis, we will have comparable debt treatment, Weerasinghe said on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings in Washington. As a middle-income country, Sri Lanka is not able to apply for relief under the Group of 20 common framework for debt treatments, so how the government can engage with creditors is not formally outlined. But is unclear whether a formal committee could secure a swift overhaul, as the platform has failed to speed up debt restructuring talks for common framework countries such as Zambia. DEBT REWORK INSTRUMENTS Sri Lanka, caught in the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 triggered by a severe shortage of dollars, has seen steep inflation, a currency plunge and its economy slide into recession. It recently secured a 2.9 billion loan from the IMF, and also aims to get debt relief from over 12 billion owed to holders of sovereign bonds. When asked if the country would consider debt-for-nature swaps for all its overseas creditors, Weerasinghe said that those are useful and relevant financial instruments, though the countrys main goal is to complete the debt rework process as soon as possible. If creditors say that they would like to have those instruments, that it can be done within the timeline and do it fast, we are open, the central bank chief said. Sri Lankas foreign private creditors are considering swapping the countrys defaulted bonds for new securities where cash flow is linked to future economic growth. Everyone can come and offer those kinds of solutions, and as we engage with them, we can see whether to include them or not. The central bank governor said that additional financing through the IMFs Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to address climate changes impact on the economy could be available, but only after the country recovers its debt sustainability under the Washington-based lender programme.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Navy has initiated expanding the Kankesanthurai harbour, with a view to accommodate more traffic and provide better infrastructure in support of the passenger ferry service between Sri Lanka and India. The government of Sri Lanka launched the ferry service project between the port of Kankesanthurai, Sri Lanka and Pondicherry, India to provide a more affordable and convenient mode of transportation. Sri Lanka Navy, on the directives of the navy commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, actively supported the expansion of the Kankesanthurai harbour facility by providing its manpower and expertise, in response to a request made by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping  Aviation. Accordingly, the project got underway on 01 February, with skilled manpower and industrial expertise enabled by the navy. Thus, the Sri Lanka Navy has undertaken the construction of a passenger terminal for immigration and customs clearance of people who intend to use this passenger ferry service. Required materials for the construction work are provided by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). At present, a group of 60 naval personnel are engaged in the construction of a 1,000 square meter passenger terminal, under the supervision of naval civil engineering officers. The construction work of the passenger terminal will be completed soon and thereupon the facility will be handed over to the SLPA for its operational purposes. The passenger ferry service project is part of a larger effort to strengthen longstanding ties between India and Sri Lanka, with a focus on improving tourism. The contribution of the navy towards the prompt implementation of the project will not only help save the public money but also allows the public to enjoy the expected benefits of this project in due course. Last month, the Ports, Shipping  Aviation expressed hopes of commencing the operations of the ferry service on 29 April. Ferry owners are planning to charge USD 50 per passenger for a one-way trip while allowing a passenger to carry baggage weighing 100kg. Only daytime operations will be in effect during the first stage. A ferry is expected to carry 150 passengers at a time and will take around 4 hours to travel from Karaikal Port in Pondicherry to Kankesanthurai. Sri Lanka Ports Authority has provided a financial facility of Rs. 144 million for the total constructions that are carried out by the Sri Lanka Navy.",

        "date": "April 12, 2023 10:10 am",
        "content": "The Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) has temporarily called off its strike action, which had been commenced in protest of the governments tax policy. Accordingly, the university lecturers will rejoin academic activities from April 17. The Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA), issuing a statement, said it has decided in a special Board of Representatives meeting to temporarily suspend the continuous strike from April 17, 2023, and resume work. The decision was made after the Minister of Education promised to address FUTAs concerns. FUTA also emphasises that the governments progress will be continuously monitored and the strike will resume if the promises are not fulfilled within a reasonable time frame. At the meeting, the Board of Representatives had discussed recent correspondence with the chairman of the University Grants Commission and the Minister of Education and decided that according to these documents, sufficient action has not been taken to address FUTAs primary concerns, it said. It was determined that until a satisfactory conclusion is reached, the decision on the participation of university academics in the GCE Advanced Level evaluation will be deferred. FUTA said it recognizes the Minister of Educations initial dedication but believes that the support of other government officials is needed to successfully implement the proposed changes. Without a concrete plan outlining when the government intends to fulfill its promises, FUTA is hesitant to place its faith in the words of the government. The failure of the government to meet the demands of FUTA has had far-reaching effects on the quality of education, and FUTA holds the government solely responsible. The association said that the governments response to the demands of FUTA and PTUA, as well as the governments treatment of unions, are both undemocratic. To find a better solution, FUTA wants the government to speak to both FUTA and PTUA. Workers should be allowed to organise into unions and bargain collectively, and the government should honour these rights. The government should address the concerns of FUTA and PTUA and find a solution that benefits society as a whole. As FUTA, we have informed the government that we will no longer tolerate the governments failure to address the legitimate demands of the universitys academics, which has led to concerns including life threats for the FUTA leaders. We, at FUTA, strongly disapprove of such conduct and pledge to take any and all measures necessary to stop it in the future. We condemn the threatening behaviour. We advocate for a space where all people can feel comfortable sharing their ideas without fear of retaliation. We call on every Sri Lankan to stand with us in defending these ideals and fostering an atmosphere of mutual regard and tolerance. FUTA had joined a countrywide one-day strike action led by the trade union collective of professionals on March 15 against the recent tax revision, electricity tariff hike and several other unpopular decisions made by the incumbent government. Although services returned to normalcy after the token strike was called off the following day, the FUTA decided to continue its trade union action as satisfactory solutions were not provided for their demands. As a result, the evaluation of 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination papers was delayed by at least 50 days, with parents of the students expressing concerns about the future of their children. Against this backdrop, FUTA convened a special meeting last night to decide on the AL exam paper marking process. Meanwhile, the Department of Examinations on Monday (10 April) announced that the 2022 GCE Ordinary Level examination, originally scheduled to commence on 15 May, has been postponed by two weeks, to 29 May.",

Further, the Sri Lankan delegation has reiterated the countrys dedication at this historic time to build a prosperous country with the support and trust of its international partners by building on the lessons learnt from the crisis, Semasinghe said in a Twitter thread. Semasinghe also represented Sri Lanka at the G-24 meeting on Securing Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Amidst Emerging Challenges, convened at a time the world is gradually recovering from multiple crises while global growth remains low with downside risks. He said the meeting provided a platform to discuss key areas where the international community and multilateral institutions can effectively support the policy efforts of the emerging market and developing economies towards securing sustained and inclusive growth. Meanwhile, the World Bank, too, reiterated its support for Sri Lanka to stabilize its economy, step up social protection and revive growth. This was conveyed by the Managing Director of Operations of the World Bank, Anna Bjerde during her meeting with the Sri Lankan delegation.

The Spring Meetings are taking place three weeks after the Executive Board of the IMF, on March 20, green-lighted a 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. The EFF program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organizations.",

        "title": "Japan, India and France to announce Sri Lankas debt restructuring negotiation process",
        "date": "April 12, 2023 03:18 pm",
        "content": "Japan, India and France are scheduled to hold a press briefing on Thursday (13 April) to announce the launch of the debt restructuring negotiation process on Sri Lanka. International Monetary Fund (IMF) communicated this quoting the Japanese Finance Ministry. Accordingly, the finance ministers of the three creditor countries  Shunichi Suzuki, Bruno Le Maire and Nirmala Sitharaman  will join the said press briefing planned to be held on the margins of the Spring Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group in Washington DC. The three creditor countries have been working closely for a coordinated debt restructuring process for the island nation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe are expected to join the live streaming of the press briefing. In addition, the IMF, World Bank and other international organizations as well as the private sector will participate in the debt restructuring discussions. The IMF had made Sri Lankas debt restructuring a prerequisite for granting the USD 2.9 billion bailout. Its Executive Board approved a 48-month extended arrangement under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion) to Sri Lanka following financing assurances from the creditors. Sri Lanka, which drew its first tranche of the USD 3 billion bailout programme, has already met an instalment to pay back an Indian line of credit which the island nation obtained early last year just before announcing the debt default. The IMF bailout, the 17th in Sri Lankas history, was approved following prolonged discussions over Colombos unsustainable debt. Sri Lanka was hit by an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves, sparking a major political and humanitarian crisis in the island nation. -with inputs from agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2023 04:00 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka expects China to support its effort to restructure debts and help it begin repaying its obligations, according to the nations central bank governor. The country also aims to quickly complete negotiations with official and commercial creditors, Nandalal Weerasinghe said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Washington, where hes attending the International Monetary Fund and World Banks Spring Meetings. Its in the best interest for China and Sri Lanka both to complete this process soon and we can get back to repaying our distressed obligation, Weerasinghe told Bloombergs Kathleen Hays. Debt-restructuring talks have begun and we have to make sure that we do it as soon as possible. The IMF on March 20 approved a 3 billion loan for the island nation to help bail it out of the worst economic crisis in decades. The multilateral lenders endorsement is also expected to provide a reform framework, unlock fresh funding and investments, and let the South Asian country begin restructuring its debt after an unprecedented default in May 2022. Weerasinghe said in March that the nation will also seek comparable support from its bilateral creditors such as the Paris Club members, as well as China and India. Sri Lanka is expected to unveil its restructuring blueprint by end-April. Emerging-market debt distress, and cooperation among creditors, is a key theme this week during the IMF-led meetings. Creditor and debtor nations are meeting Wednesday to seek a way forward on the Group of 20s so-called Common Framework, which is aimed at restructuring poorer countries debt owed to all creditors, including China and private debt holders. Japan, France and India plan to announce the launch of the debt restructuring process for Sri Lanka on Thursday in Washington, on the sidelines of the IMF meetings. Sri Lanka last month took a key step toward winning the cooperation of its external bondholders for restructuring 84 billion in debt by agreeing to include local-currency bonds in the program. The exercise, which will include the shorter-term treasury bills held by the nations central bank and also some longer-term treasury bonds on a voluntary basis, is intended to reduce the burden on foreign commercial creditors. Since Sri Lanka reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF in September, local authorities have increased taxes, cut energy subsidies and returned to a more flexible exchange-rate regime. The cabinet has approved divestment of stakes in government-run companies including Sri Lanka Telecom Plc, Sri Lanka Insurance Corp and SriLankan Airlines. It also green-lit a bill for a new monetary law giving more independence to the central bank. The central bank on April 4 held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high of 16.5 in order to keep Asias fastest inflation in check while supporting economic recovery. As a result of very tight monetary policy, already disinflation process has started, and by the end of this year we are confident we will reach single-digit inflation, Weerasinghe said in the interview, reiterating the central banks expectations.

        "date": "April 12, 2023 04:01 pm",
        "content": "Until a satisfactory conclusion is reached, the decision on the participation of university academics in the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination paper evaluation will be deferred, the Federation of the University Teachers Association (FUTA) says. In a statement, the association said the decision was taken at a special meeting of its Board of Representatives on Tuesday. The FUTA temporarily called off its continuous trade union action, launched against the governments tax policy, and rejoin academic activities starting from April 17. The association said the decision was made after the Education Minister promised to address its concerns. FUTA also emphasized that the governments progress would be continuously monitored and threatened to resume the strike if the promises are not fulfilled within a reasonable time frame. At the meeting, the Board of Representatives had discussed recent correspondence with the chairman of the University Grants Commission and the Education Minister. It was decided that according to these documents, sufficient action has not been taken to address FUTAs primary concerns, it said. FUTA said it recognizes the Education Ministers initial dedication but believes that the support of other government officials is needed to successfully implement the proposed changes. Without a concrete plan outlining when the government intends to fulfill its promises, FUTA is hesitant to place its faith in the words of the government. The failure of the government to meet the demands of FUTA has had far-reaching effects on the quality of education, and FUTA holds the government solely responsible. The association said that the governments response to the demands of FUTA and PTUA (Professionals Trade Union Alliance), as well as the governments treatment of unions, are both undemocratic. To find a better solution, FUTA wants the government to speak to both FUTA and PTUA. Workers should be allowed to organise into unions and bargain collectively, and the government should honour these rights. The government should address the concerns of FUTA and PTUA and find a solution that benefits society as a whole. As FUTA, we have informed the government that we will no longer tolerate the governments failure to address the legitimate demands of the universitys academics, which has led to concerns including life threats for the FUTA leaders. We, at FUTA, strongly disapprove of such conduct and pledge to take any and all measures necessary to stop it in the future. We condemn the threatening behaviour. We advocate for a space where all people can feel comfortable sharing their ideas without fear of retaliation. We call on every Sri Lankan to stand with us in defending these ideals and fostering an atmosphere of mutual regard and tolerance. FUTA had joined a countrywide one-day strike action led by the trade union collective of professionals on March 15 against the recent tax revision, electricity tariff hike and several other unpopular decisions made by the incumbent government. Although services returned to normalcy after the token strike was called off the following day, the FUTA decided to continue its trade union action as satisfactory solutions were not provided for their demands.",

        "date": "April 12, 2023 05:26 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank is considering more concessionary funding for Sri Lanka and support for green bond issues as part of its assistance to help the South Asian nation recover from its worst economic crisis in decades. The Manila-based lenders immediate priority in 2023 is to continue work on overall economic stability and support the banking and energy sectors, ADB Sri Lanka country director Chen Chen said in an interview in Colombo. We are also actively working on mobilizing more concessional resources and grant resources to the country, Chen said. This will hopefully be part of our assistance in the coming years. ADB is trying to mobilize funds below the already concessional Ordinary Capital Resources facilities that Sri Lanka currently has access to, Chen said. Last month, Sri Lanka clinched a 3 billion loan program from the International Monetary Fund that is expected to unlock fresh funding and help the island nation begin restructuring its debt after an unprecedented default in 2022. Last year, the World Bank made Sri Lanka eligible for more concessional funds, as the nation sought to ease its debt obligations. Through 2022, the ADB disbursed around 334 million by re-purposing existing project loans. The lender already has about 3.7 billion of previously approved loans in transport, energy, education, health, social protection, agriculture, and small and medium enterprises, among others, which will be disbursed as projects progress, Chen said. Sri Lanka is now conducting an asset quality review of banks with ADBs support, and is discussing reforms to improve governance and financial sustainability for the power sector, Chen said. Disruptions to economic activity due to electricity outages last year as the government ran out of dollars to pay for essential imports including fuel, food and medicine, showed that the power sector has a key role to play in Sri Lankas stability and future recovery, Chen said. The ADB is also working with local authorities to prepare the groundwork to sell green or blue bonds, after economic stability is restored, Chen said. The lender expects Sri Lankas economy will contract 3 this year and expand 1.3 in 2024, after shrinking by 7.8 last year. We hope in the long term, the private sector can contribute more to the economy, Chen said. We would like to continue discussions with the private sector if there is emerging needs.

He also mentioned that the Sri Lankan government has introduced a new scheme for public servants which enable them to work abroad.
