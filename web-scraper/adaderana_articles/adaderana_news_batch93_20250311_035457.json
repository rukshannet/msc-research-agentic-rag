        "title": "Dont dry your iPhone in a bag of rice, says Apple",
        "date": "February 22, 2024 01:38 pm",
        "content": "If your iPhone gets wet dont dry it in a bag of rice, Apple has advised. Despite the techniques popularity, experts have long warned against it, with tests suggesting it doesnt work. And now the tech giant itself has published guidance telling users it could result in small particles of the grain damaging their devices. The firm said people should instead gently tap out any liquid, with the phone connector facing down, then leave it to dry out. Despite the increasing sophistication of smartphones, popular approaches for fixing them if they have been dropped in water remain rather unsophisticated. Apple has taken the opportunity to steer users away from several of them. As well as avoiding bags of rice, it also advises against drying a wet phone using an external heat source or compressed air, meaning radiators and hairdryers should be avoided. Nor, it suggests, should users try inserting a foreign object, such as a cotton swab or a paper towel into their phone. Instead, it guides people to leave their phone in a dry area with some airflow before reconnecting it to a charger. As the website MacWorld - which first spotted the new support document - notes, the changing design of smartphones may mean all such advice will be unnecessary in the future. That is because devices are increasingly able to withstand getting wet. All Apple devices from the iPhone 12 onwards are able to withstand immersion up to a depth of six metres, for up to half an hour. But with cost-of-living pressures driving growth in the global second-hand mobile market, it is likely that many people will need advice on what to do - and what not to - with a soggy smartphone for some time yet.

        "title": "Archaeological sites in Afghanistan bulldozed for systematic looting",
        "date": "February 22, 2024 01:55 pm",
        "content": "More than 37 archaeological sites in Afghanistan have been destroyed and targeted with systematic looting under the Taliban-run government, according to researchers at the University of Chicago. Researchers at the universitys Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation identified 162 ancient settlements that faced devastation at an alarming rate between 2018 and 2021, continuing at 37 sites since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The analysis of satellite images of sites identified around northern Afghanistans Balkh region has provided the first evidence of patterns of looting that were initially identified under the Talibans first stint in power and have continued since, according to a BBC report. The sites that have been plundered date back to the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, with some even predating 1000 BC, researchers say. Most of these sites are located in the Balkh region, formerly the central territory of Bactria, which boasts a storied past dating to the 6th Century BC during the Achaemenid Empire era. Subsequently, it was captured by Alexander the Great, evolving into a hub for Zoroastrianism and Buddhist faith. It later became a centre for Islamic culture. The researchers have identified 29,000 archaeological sites across Afghanistan. The Taliban returned to power after overthrowing the Ashraf Ghani government and promised to respect the countrys ancient heritage among its other assurances of maintaining a more moderate rule. During their first stint in power in 2001, Taliban left the historians stunned after destroying a statue of the Bamiyan Buddhas, which had stood as the worlds largest Buddha statue for over 1,500 years. The Unesco world heritage site of Afghan Buddhism was a holy site for Buddhists on the Silk Road route. Professor Gil Stein, the director of the Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation at Chicago university, told the British broadcaster that they have identified a new pattern of destruction in the region since 2018. Satellite imagery showed marks on the pictures that his team says could have been left behind by the bulldozers that left track marks which disappeared over time. More images showed newly bulldozed sites punctuated with pits dug out by looters, Mr Stein said, adding that they were clearing out vast areas to make it easier to loot the site systematically. These looted artefacts could have been smuggled out of Afghanistan through Iran, Pakistan and other countries, he said, adding could end up being displayed in museums or auction houses in Europe, North America, and east Asia. He said some 162 sites were devastated at an astonishing rate of one a week in the span of four years from 2018 to 2021 and continued after the Taliban overthrew his government in 2021. The Taliban government officials have rejected the claims of destruction and plundering of historical sites in the country. Atiqullah Azizi, the Talibans acting deputy minister for information and culture, told BBC that 800 units have been assigned to safeguard the sites of historical importance. We sent various teams to check the sites and I can reassure you that there hasnt been a single incident in any of those sites, he said. However, the Professor Stein said: We can show there was continuity even across two very different political regimes. Source: The Independent -Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 02:42 pm",
        "content": "Forty countries from the Asia and Pacific region today agreed that transforming agrifood systems was imperative to providing food security for their childrens generation and beyond, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported today. The summation was delivered at todays close of the 37th Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC37) in Colombo. The conference was hosted by the Government of Sri Lanka. Forty countries of Asia and the Pacific attended the APRC, with the vast majority attending in-person, including some 20 government Ministers. It was the first time since 2018 that a large in-person gathering of the regions food and agriculture Ministers and other policymakers was convened by FAO, and is seen as emblematic of the attention needed to recover from the pandemic and disruptions caused to food production and distribution that has plagued many countries in the region ever since. A wake-up call to learn from the past  and each other. The global pandemic, coupled or followed closely with a shortage of food, feed fuel, fertilizer and access to finance, caused food price to jump significantly. Lessons were learned and many called it a wake-up call to ensure that food affordability and availability and agricultural production must be a global priority. Food and agriculture are now at the centre of the global development agenda and this is an opportunity for all of us, including civil society and private sector organizations to decisively reimagine and reshape agrifood systems for global economic, social and environmental benefits, said Jong-Jin Kim, FAOs Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific. This transformation will be important for you to maintain a sustainable environment and increase biodiversity, while providing opportunities for decent jobs for people. That is the added value of modern farming, Kim said to the delegates at the end of the four-day conference. Kim called on the FAO Member Nations gathered to address these issues holistically. We must do this together with all relevant key partners, not only with the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, but also with Ministers for Welfare, Women, Children, Environment, Science, Education, Trade Investment and Finance. These are their duties too. So, we must work together as a team. Science and Technology are constantly evolving. In the agrifood sector, we should lead, said Kim. Agriculture, food and nutrition are at the core of humanitys needs  and the world casts its eyes towards Asia and the Pacific region for leadership. As the Director-General said  we are the Agents of Change, Kim added, referring to the opening statement to the conference by the FAO Director-General, Dr QU Dongyu. Conclusions and recommendations going forward  Better Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment and a Better Life  leaving no one behind. In the final report to the APRC  FAOs regional governing body  it acknowledged several important points for further action by FAO and other actors. It noted the main challenges facing the region relate to its ability to sustainably increase productivity and innovation, particularly in the face of resource limitations, climate change risks and the regions growing population as the medium- and long-term outlook highlights and emphasized the importance of transparent, predictable, open and fair markets, underpinned by an effective multilateral trading system, for food security. The report went on to recognize the importance of digital innovations and blended finance, engaging the private sector in mobilizing resources for resilient, inclusive and sustainable agrifood systems transformation. It also highlighted the need to focus on specific issues including local food systems, low carbon, resilient and sustainable practices, and water issues; strengthen efficient, inclusive and resilient value chains and markets; boost initiatives under the Paris Agreement; and develop global standards for biosecurity and food safety, important for agrifood systems, early warning systems and anticipatory action. Transforming capture fisheries and aquaculture towards sustainability in Asia and the Pacific region The report highlighted the Asia-Pacific regions leadership in capture fisheries and aquaculture, contributing with over 70 percent of global production; the aquaculture sector is projected to grow by over 20 percent by 2030. It also acknowledged that when managed and developed sustainably, aquatic food systems, in both marine and freshwaters, including aquaculture and fisheries of the region, contributed significantly to improving food and nutrition security and livelihoods, specifically enhancing womens participation along the value chain. The Conference welcomed FAOs Blue Transformation vision in the context of Asia and the Pacific region to increase the contribution of fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic foods value chains to provide a more significant proportion of nutritious food and resilient livelihoods in the region, while recognizing that Blue Transformation promotes sustainable aquaculture intensification, effective management of all fisheries and upgraded value chains to ensure the social, economic and environmental viability of aquatic food systems.",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 04:41 pm",
        "content": "For chef Sameera Madushanka Dahanayaka, winning a gold medal is a breeze  he has already snagged 30 in various competitions. However, his recent triumph at the 26th IKA Culinary Olympics in Germany is the most remarkable one. Representing the UAE national team, the Sri Lankan wowed the judges in both pastry and culinary art categories at the event. He earned two gold medals in salt carving and two in sugar carving, showcasing his exceptional skills. The UAE national team secured 27 silver medals, highlighting their culinary prowess. The chef from Mister Baker named his salt carving The Lost City of Dragon Riders and Together One Dream. The sugar carving was of a ruler sitting on his majestic throne named The Emperor. To participate in the competition and carve his pieces, Sameera worked overtime. It took me more than six months to make these art pieces. I worked on these pieces for the competition before and after my office hours, said Sameera. For the sugar artistic piece, I had to powder sugar, add other ingredients, and harden it based on the required shape. Post the construction of the entire structure, it was then shaped and smoothened with sandpaper, said Sameera. However, the intricate salt structure required much more time than the sugar artistic piece. In the salt artistic piece, the salt granules are powdered, mixed with corn flour starch, water, and other ingredients, and then given the desired shape, and I had to look at it every day, said Sameera, adding that these pieces can be preserved for over four years. The competition featured 1,500 chefs from 70 countries, with a panel of over 60 international experts, including renowned chefs like Jerard Mendis and Uwe Micheel. This is the top competition I participated in, and grabbing gold is a big achievement. I am so happy to have won for the UAE, said Sameera. Six years ago the Sri Lankan moved to UAE and worked in several places. He currently works at Mister Baker as a cake decorator. I started my journey in culinary art in 2015. I visited UAE 6 years ago; since then, it has become my second home. Being a resident here, I have been getting enough opportunities to participate in top-level competitions. Tushar Fotedar, director at Mister Baker, said, Chef Sameeras achievement reflects his dedication and skill and brings immense pride to Mister Baker, the UAE, and the culinary community. We congratulate chef Sameera on this exceptional accomplishment and look forward to continued success on his culinary journey. Fuelled by his dedication to culinary mastery, Sameera is now gearing up for the upcoming Culinary World Cup set to take place in 2026. After his achievements and gold medal wins, he is pumped up to represent UAE again. Source: Khaleej Times -Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 06:16 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A Chinese research ship arrived in the Maldives on Thursday, global ship-tracking data showed, just three months after a similar vessel visited the Indian Ocean and sparked New Delhis security concerns. The visit follows January comments by a U.S. think tank, that Chinas navy could leverage the insights gained from these missions for deployment of naval forces, a claim Beijing calls part of a concocted image-smearing China threat narrative. Xiang Yang Hong 03, owned by a research institute that reports to Chinas natural resources ministry, made a port call in the Maldives capital of Male, data from MarineTraffic showed, more than a month after leaving its home port of Xiamen in southeastern China. Prior to its arrival, the civilian ship had spent more than three weeks surveying waters just outside the exclusive economic zones of India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, the ship-tracking data showed. Chinas foreign ministry has said research by the vessel was exclusively for peaceful purposes to benefit scientific understanding. In recent years, India has voiced concern about the presence of Chinas research vessels in the Indian Ocean, even if they do not belong to the military. An Indian security official has previously said the vessels were dual-use, meaning the data they gather can be used for both civilian and military purposes. Xiang Yang Hong 03 has visited the Indian Ocean multiple times. It sailed through the Sunda Strait in Indonesia in 2021, alarming Indonesian authorities, who said it had switched off its tracking system three times. Chinese research vessels have also stopped in nearby Sri Lanka. In 2022, Yuan Wang 5, a military vessel capable of tracking rocket and missile launches, arrived in Colombo, alarming India. The last time a Chinese research vessel docked in Sri Lanka was in October 2023, reviving Indias concerns. But in January, the island nation imposed a year-long moratorium on foreign research ships, effectively denying China a port of call. Xiang Yang Hong 03s arrival follows a January visit to China by Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu that upgraded ties, with Beijing offering 920 million yuan (128 million) in free aid. The Maldives has said the vessel would do no research in its waters, stopping only for personnel rotation and replenishment of supplies. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 08:54 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Tourism, Diana Gamage says nightlife plays a critical role in driving economic growth, citing it as a cornerstone of the night economy. She underscored that the night economy accounts for a substantial 70 of a countrys revenue, illustrating its significant contribution to national finances. Highlighting the importance of nightlife, the State Minister pointed out that night time is when people typically engage in activities such as dining and entertainment, resulting in increased revenue generation through taxes, particularly from excise duties. She stated that this revenue is essential for sustaining the countrys operations and development. Speaking at a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (Feb.22), Gamage endorsed the undeniable significance of nightlife to the economy, emphasizing its integral role in generating revenue and supporting essential services. The statement comes within ongoing debate about regulating nightlife and balancing the needs of various stakeholders, including residents, tourists, and businesses. As debates continue regarding the regulation of nightlife, stakeholders are urged to consider the broader economic implications and the vital role that nightlife plays in driving economic activity and sustaining national finances. The State Minister for Tourism further emphasized the importance of providing entertainment options to tourists, particularly in beach areas, which are major attractions for visitors. Addressing concerns about nightlife regulations, the Minister highlighted the significance of entertainment in enhancing the tourist experience. According to her, nightlife plays a crucial role in catering to the needs of tourists, not only in beach areas but also in urban centres like Colombo. The lawmaker noted that current regulations often restrict entertainment options, citing examples such as early last orders in hotels and restaurants, which may not align with the preferences of international tourists. Drawing attention to the diverse origins of tourists, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, the State Minister emphasized the need for flexibility in entertainment hours to accommodate varying cultural norms and preferences. Gamage urged stakeholders to recognize the importance of extending entertainment hours to enhance the overall tourism experience and attract more visitors to the country. As discussions on tourism regulations continue, stakeholders are encouraged to consider the perspectives of tourists and the potential economic benefits of promoting a vibrant nightlife scene. The Ministers remarks underscore the importance of striking a balance between regulation and the provision of entertainment options to ensure a memorable and enjoyable experience for visitors to Sri Lanka. --PMD",

The uproar followed a decision by the speaker to ignore precedent and allow a vote which helped the opposition Labour Party avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on the Israel-Hamas war. Lawmakers from the governing Conservatives and the opposition Scottish National Party (SNP) left the debating chamber in protest and some tried to take the rare step of holding proceedings in private. The speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, eventually apologised and said he had made his decision to allow lawmakers to vote on a range of views because he was concerned about their security after some had faced threats of violence over their stance on the war. It is regrettable and I apologise for the decision, he told parliament. I did not want it to end like this. Labour, tipped to win a national election expected later this year, has been engulfed by an internal battle over its policy towards the Middle East conflict since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that led to Israels invasion of Gaza. The debate in parliament was initiated by the SNP, which put forward a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. Labour and the Conservatives, which have both backed Israel while expressing concern over its actions in Gaza, then proposed amendments, with different conditions they said were necessary before there should be a pause in fighting. In an usual move, Hoyle selected both those amendments to be voted on, breaking with the precedent whereby one opposition party cannot alter anothers motion. Usually, only the government amendment would be selected. Some lawmakers jeered the speaker when he announced his decision. One member of parliament accused Hoyle, a former Labour lawmaker, of causing a constitutional crisis. The governments Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt said Hoyle had undermined parliament and the government was pulling out of proceedings. BRITISH POLITICS AT ITS WORST Hoyles decision meant Labour lawmakers could vote for their partys own plan and avoid having to defy their leadership by supporting the SNP motion. During the chaos, the Labour amendment was eventually approved verbally, without a formal vote where individual lawmakers views are recorded. Some lawmakers called for the vote to be held again as their views had not been reflected. While the outcome is not binding on the British government or likely to be closely watched in Israel or by Hamas, it had the potential to cause problems for Starmer, who is keen to present his party as united, disciplined and ready for power. Its disgraceful, its very disgraceful. Today we have seen British politics at its worst. Politicians are trying to save themselves, rather than saving an entire nation, the Palestinian Ambassador to Britain, Hasam Zumlot, told LBC radio. Hundreds of protesters outside parliament demanded lawmakers back a ceasefire while the debate took place. Labours leadership had said they were reluctant to back the SNP motion because it condemned the collective punishment of the Palestinian people and it did not specify that a ceasefire must be observed by Israel and Hamas. A similar motion tabled by the SNP in November saw Starmer suffer the biggest revolt of his leadership. The Labour leader initially gave full backing to Israel as it embarked on its military retaliation. But Labour lawmakers and party members have been increasing pressure on the leadership to back an immediate ceasefire. Both Israel and Hamas have deflected rising international pressure to halt a war, now in its fifth month, that has demolished much of the Gaza Strip and caused a humanitarian catastrophe, rejecting each others terms for a ceasefire.

        "title": "COPF questions Fin. Min.s reluctance to adopt VAT amendment recommendations",
        "date": "February 22, 2024 11:52 pm",
        "content": "The Finance Ministry officials have told the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) that the revenue loss incurred from the initial sugar scam should be classified as tax foregone, instead of a tax loss. This was mentioned when the Finance Ministry officials were summoned before the COPF on Tuesday (22). When asked about the progress of recovering the lost revenue resulting from the initial sugar scam, as highlighted in the report by the Auditor General, the ministerial officials contended that it should not be classified as a tax loss, but rather as tax foregone due to the reduction of the special commodity levy from Rs. 50 to 25 cents. Despite this explanation, the COPF members pressed the officials for data on certain companies that had disproportionately profited from this tax adjustment, amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion from six companies, with an additional six companies yet to be investigated. Further, the COPF, which previously considered the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill that removed all VAT exemptions back in November 2023, also inquired as to why the Finance Ministry has failed to adopt the recommendations made by the committee regarding the VAT Amendment Bill. Accordingly, the COPF recommended to the Finance Ministry to reconsider VAT exemptions for medical equipment, ambulances, high-protein agro foods for children, and agricultural items, which had not been considered by the Ministry. The VAT (Amendment) Bill also increased the tax from 15 to 18 and decreased the threshold for VAT registration from Rs. 80 million to Rs. 60 million per annum, effective from January 01, 2024, aiming to adjust tax rates and registration requirements in line with the governments goal to increase revenue to 14 of GDP in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the COPF questioned the officials as to why they keep delaying the implementation of VAT on foreign digital and software providers, creating an unequal playing field for domestic digital and software providers. COPF chair MP Dr. Harsha de Silva pointed out that local travel booking agents are subjected to VAT while websites such as Booking.com are exempted. Since it is merely a change in the interpretation of the law, the Committee pressed officials on why theyre delaying this, but officials stated that they require a new law, which is set to come into effect in April 2025. The Committee further pushed the officials to find a mechanism to collect due taxes and create an equal playing field until they draft a new VAT bill. Additionally, the COPF deliberated on the Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Bill. This amendment to the Act, which lowers the turnover threshold of registration for the Social Security Contribution Levy from one hundred and twenty million rupees to sixty million rupees per annum, effective from January 01, 2024, was approved by the Committee.",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 07:03 am",
        "content": "Bobi the dog has been posthumously stripped of his title as worlds oldest dog over a dispute about his real age. Guinness World Records (GWR) said it had no evidence that the elderly canine, who died last year, was as old as claimed. The organisation said the microchip claimed to prove Bobis age was not sufficient proof to grant him the title, awarded in February last year. GWR said it had not yet determined which dog is the new record holder. Bobi was a Rafeiro do Alentejo from Conqueiros, Portugal. The breed typically lives for around 12-14 years. But when Bobi was awarded the award, it was claimed that he was 30 years old. Bobi died in October 2023, at the reported age of 31 years and 165 days. But GWR launched an investigation into the evidence used to prove the title last month, following doubts being raised over its reliability in proving Bobis age. GWR said: Were left with no conclusive evidence which can definitively prove Bobis date of birth. Without any conclusive evidence available to us right now, we simply cant retain Bobi as the record holder. Bobis owner, Leonel Costa, has not commented on the records removal, but had previously said suspicions over the veracity of the dogs age were unfounded. Last month, Danny Chambers of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons told the Guardian that not a single one of his vet colleagues believed that the dog actually lived to 31. The previous oldest dog ever was Australias Bluey, who died in 1939 at the age of 29 years and five months. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 07:25 am",
        "content": "A spacecraft built and flown by Texas-based company Intuitive Machines landed near the south pole of the moon on Thursday, the first U.S. touchdown on the lunar surface in more than half a century and the first ever achieved by the private sector. The uncrewed six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, touched down at about 6:23 p.m. EST (2323 GMT), the company and NASA commentators said in a joint webcast of the landing from Intuitive Machines mission operations center in Houston. The landing capped a nail-biting final approach and descent in which a problem surfaced with the spacecrafts autonomous navigation system that required engineers on the ground to employ an untested work-around at the 11th hour. It also took some time after an anticipated radio blackout to re-establish communications with the spacecraft and determine its fate some 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth. When contact was finally renewed, the signal was faint, confirming that the lander had touched down but leaving mission control immediately uncertain as to the precise condition and position of the vehicle, according to the webcast. Our equipment is on the surface of the moon, and we are transmitting, so congratulations IM team, Intuitive Machines mission director Tim Crain was heard telling the operations center. Well see what more we can get from that. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson immediately hailed the feat as a triumph, saying, Odysseus has taken the moon. As planned, the spacecraft was believed to have come to rest at a crater named Malapert A near the moons south pole, according to the webcast. The spacecraft was not designed to provide live video of the landing, which came one day after the spacecraft reached lunar orbit and a week after its launch from Florida. Thursdays landing represented the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when NASAs last crewed moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. To date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the moon - the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just last month, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface. Odysseus is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site. The NASA payload will focus on collecting data on space weather interactions with the moons surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landers and NASAs planned return of astronauts later in the decade. The IM-1 mission was sent on its way to the moon on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket launched by Elon Musks company SpaceX from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. DAWN OF ARTEMIS The arrival of Odysseus also marks the first soft landing on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle and the first under NASAs Artemis lunar program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to Earths natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there. NASA aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone toward eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the moons south pole in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and production of rocket fuel. A host of small landers like Odysseus are expected to pave the way under NASAs Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the moon at lower costs than the U.S. space agencys traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself. Leaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks. Just last month the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket making its debut flight. The malfunction of Astrobotics Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan. Although Odysseus is the latest star of NASAs CLPS program, the IM-1 flight is considered an Intuitive Machines mission. The company was co-founded in 2013 by Stephen Altemus, former deputy director of NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston and now the companys president and CEO. The proliferation of commercial space ventures has itself been driven by leaps in technology in recent decades. The Apollo program and robot lunar Surveyor missions that preceded it flew at the very dawn of the computer age, before the advent of modern microchips, electronic sensors and software, or the development of super light-weight metal alloys and myriad other advances that have spurred a revolution in spaceflight.

        "date": "February 23, 2024 12:33 pm",
        "content": "Tharaka Balasuriya, Sri Lankas Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, spoke to WIONs diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal on the sidelines of Raisina Dialogue 2024 in New Delhi. Balasuriya weighed in on several issues ranging from the India-Lanka relationship, Colombos ties with China, tourism, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and more. While speaking on China, Balasuriya said that both countries are friends, but in Indias case its a civilisational link as he pointed out the historical connection of cultures. He said that China is an important trading partner, but so are other countries. Read the excerpts of the full interview below: WION: How do you see the India-Sri Lanka relationship, especially in the light of financial connectivity? We saw recently the launch of UPI in your country. Tharaka Balasuriya: I think India and Sri Lankas relationship is at an all-time high. The UPI is beneficial for both countries. If you look at the events of Sri Lanka and what took place one and a half years ago, it mainly started out as a foreign exchange crisis mainly a lack of dollars. So we have to ensure that our dollar dependency is reduced. And we now for example, our biggest tourist market is from media and if we can collect the tourists remittance from India and we import about 5.5 billion worth of goods from India and use those, the Indian rupees, to pay in Indian rupees for the Indian imports, then we will reduce our dollar dependency. and it also becomes very flexible and it becomes very easy for the Indians to travel to Sri Lanka and then they pay in Indian rupees. WION: Sir, essentially we recently saw the Indian External Affairs Minister saying that one should go to Sri Lanka. How do you see that comment and how do you see Sri Lanka as a tourist destination for many Indians? Tharaka Balasuriya: Have you visited Sri Lanka? WION: I have visited Sri Lanka but not on a very fortunate note. Its after the Easter bombings but maybe Ill visit on a happier note. Tharaka Balasuriya: Your External Affairs Minister is absolutely correct because Sri Lanka is a country with an area of over 65,000 square kilometres, but it has something for everybody. Its no wonder Markopolos said its the best island of its size in the world. We have some of the best beaches in the world. We have the hill country which is very cool in temperature and we have wildlife and wildlife parks for example, the Yala National Park has the highest concentration of leopards in the world. We have the historical the cultural triangle, which is to pass and then we also are trying to develop the Ramayana trail. We have five Shiva Lingam temples in Sri Lanka. And also Sri Lanka is in close proximity to India. So the maps when you look at the ticket prices for somebody in the North of India to travel to the southern city and for that person to travel to, Sri Lanka, I dont think therell be much of a cost difference. So I would encourage all Indians to visit Sri Lanka and it will be absolutely a brilliant experience. WION: There is the China factor as well when it comes to the India-Sri Lanka relationship and the Sri Lanka-China relationship. Is it an act of balancing or is India your natural ally? Tharaka Balasuriya: When you say its our natural ally I think that has an implication saying in other countries our enemy or something. No, its not like that. You know, both countries are friends, but in Indias case, its a civilisational link. You know, If you read the books, the people of Sri Lanka came from India. Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country, and Buddhism came from India. So it is a much stronger big brother-small brother relationship with India and Sri Lanka. China is an important trading partner. But so are other countries. So if you look at most of our exports, they go to Europe and they go to the United States. And they are also very important trading partners. And I think the look at the quantum of the volume of trade, which India does with China, you know, ours is minuscule. So, Sri Lanka is a small country. We dont have political huge international political ambitions but we want to do is trade with all countries and ensure that you know, the people of Sri Lanka will benefit. Source: WION",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 01:59 pm",
        "content": "Scientists have discovered a previously undocumented species of giant anaconda in the Amazon which they say can grow up to 7.5m and weighing close to 500kg, making it the largest and heaviest snake yet known in the world. Until now, four species of anacondas were known, with the largest one  the green anaconda  inhabiting tropical parts of South America such as the basins of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Esequibo rivers, as well as some smaller watersheds. These anacondas, found in the rivers and wetlands of South America, are well known for their lightning speed and ability to squeeze the life out of prey by coiling around, asphyxiating them, and swallowing them whole. A newly published decades-long study has now found that the green anaconda is genetically two different species. Researchers working with the indigenous Waorani people captured and studied several specimens of the newly named northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayima) in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The species was found during filming for National Geographics Disney series Pole to Pole with Will Smith. Scientists documented several anacondas belonging to the new species lurking in the shallows, lying in wait for prey as they paddled canoes down the Amazonian river system. The size of these magnificent creatures was incredible  one female anaconda we encountered measured an astounding 6.3 metres long, study co-author Bryan Fry from the University of Queensland said in a statement.There are anecdotal reports from the Waorani people of other anacondas in the area measuring more than 7.5 metres long and weighing around 500 kilograms, Dr Fry said. The new species, described in the journal Diversity, diverged from the previously known southern green anaconda about 10 million years ago, differing genetically from it by 5.5 per cent. To put this in perspective, humans differ from chimpanzees by only about 2 per cent. The finding, according to researchers, is pivotal for the conservation of anacondas, which are apex predators and vital to maintaining balance in their ecosystems. A healthy anaconda population means their ecosystems are vibrant with ample food resources and clean water, while declining numbers of the snake may indicate environmental distress, scientists say. So knowing which anaconda species exist, and monitoring their numbers, is crucial, researchers write in The Conversation. The anacondas and their habitats are under increasing threat from land fragmentation caused by industrialised agriculture, forest fire, drought, climate change, as well as heavy metal pollution linked to spills from oil extraction activities. Of particular urgency is research into how petrochemicals from oil spills are affecting the fertility and reproductive biology of these rare snakes, Dr Fry said. Source: The Independent --Agencies",

        "title": "Four killed, many others missing as blaze engulfs apartment blocks in Spain",
        "date": "February 23, 2024 03:07 pm",
        "content": "At least four people have died and up to 15 are missing after a massive fire ripped through two joined apartment blocks in the Spanish city of Valencia, emergency services say. The blaze engulfed a 14-storey block in the Campanar neighbourhood and spread to an adjoining building. Firefighters were seen rescuing people from balconies. Experts say that highly flammable cladding on the building enabled the fire to spread rapidly. The building contains 138 flats and was home to 450 residents, newspaper El Pais reported, citing the buildings manager. Fifteen people, including six firefighters and a young child, have been injured although their lives are not in danger. Valencia Mayor María José Catalá said authorities were still trying to locate between nine and 15 people, while the governments regional representative said 14 people remained unaccounted for. More than 20 fire crews tackled the blaze, which was made worse by high winds. By early Friday the block was a giant fire-blackened shell. People were urged to stay away from the area. Local reports said firefighters had rescued several residents using cranes, including a couple living on the seventh floor. One woman told TVE she had seen firefighters attempting to rescue a teenage boy trapped on the buildings first floor. Luis Ibanez, who lives nearby, told TVE he had looked out of a window and saw the flames engulfing the block within a matter of minutes, saying it was as if it was made of cork. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. The whole side of the building directly opposite was on fire. One man who lives on the second floor of the building told TV channel La Sexta that the flames grew rapidly after the fire started, reportedly on the fourth floor. The fire spread in a matter of 10 minutes, he said, adding that material on the facade of the building may have caused the fire to spread. Questions have been asked in Spain about the materials used in construction of the building, which was built in 2008-09. Esther Puchades, vice president of the College of Industrial Technical Engineers of Valencia, told Spanish news agency Efe she had previously inspected the building. She said its exterior featured a polyurethane material, which is no longer in wide use because of fears over flammability. It also has an aluminium covering. The reason the building burned so fast is because of this type of cladding, she told Spanish media. The cladding has been described by experts as effective for heat insulation but the ventilation, or gap, between it and the covering means it can be highly flammable. Luis Sendra, of Valencias architects association, said this can cause a chimney effect, allowing fires to spread more quickly. The issue of cladding recalls the 2017 tragedy at Londons Grenfell Tower. The cladding was blamed for helping flames to spread when that fire broke, resulting in 72 deaths. Firefighters were called at around 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). A field hospital has been set up in the area, RTVE reported. People displaced from their homes would be housed in hotels, authorities said. Writing on X (formerly known as Twitter) Spains Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: Dismayed by the terrible fire in a building in Valencia... I want to convey my solidarity to all the people affected and recognition to all the emergency personnel already deployed at the scene. The Valencia authorities have announced a day of official mourning for the victims of the fire. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 06:14 pm",
        "content": "The human trafficking racket in Myanmar goes on unabated as more Sri Lankans continue to be brought in for cyber slavery, according to a harrowing statement given by a youth who had fallen victim to the Burmese terror group. The young man revealed that another Sri Lankan national was recently moved to the cyber slavery camp where he is being forcibly held, and as many as 15 other Sri Lankans including two females were also slated to be brought there. He said the Sri Lankan embassy in Myanmar, the foreign ministry, the immigration authorities, the president and all respective authorities have been informed about their situation, urging them to take necessary action without delay. In December 2023, media reports shed light on the plight of a group of about 50-60 Sri Lankans, who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative IT sector job offers and are being held captive in Myanmar by a notorious ethnic armed group. They too had been duped into applying to job vacancies in Dubai by a certain agent in the UAE only to be trafficked into Myanmar to work in terror camps in Myaweddi area where they are forced to commit internet scams. Earlier, the Sri Lankans who fell victim to this human trafficking scam said that they were initially unaware of the cybercrime camp. Despite initially being told that they were supposed to do jobs such as data entry, these Sri Lankans had been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, in order to steal their money. In the event they refuse to do as told, the captives are subjected to acts of torture, which they said include electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving. It was also revealed that these workers had travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Reportedly, Sri Lankan youths have been experiencing this plight since 2022.",

        "title": "Scientists announce discovery of 240-million-year-old Chinese dragon fossil",
        "date": "February 23, 2024 06:27 pm",
        "content": "Scientists in Scotland have revealed a remarkable discovery of a very strange 240-million-year-old Chinese dragon fossil. The international team from National Museums Scotland revealed their discovery -- found in Guizhou Province in southern China -- of the Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a 5-meter-long aquatic reptile from the Triassic period dating back an estimated 240 million years. With 32 separate neck vertebrae Dinocephalosaurus orientalis had an extraordinarily long neck that draws comparison with that of Tanystropheus hydroides, another strange marine reptile from the Middle Triassic of both Europe and China, scientists said announcing the discovery. Both reptiles were of similar size and have several features of the skull in common, including a fish-trap type of dentition, officials continued. However, Dinocephalosaurus is unique in possessing many more vertebrae both in the neck and in the torso, giving the animal a much more snake-like appearance. Scientists say the reptile was clearly very well adapted to an oceanic lifestyle, as indicated by the flippered limbs and exquisitely preserved fishes in its stomach region. Despite superficial similarities, Dinocephalosaurus was not closely related to the famous long-necked plesiosaurs that only evolved around 40 million years later and which inspired the myth of the Loch Ness Monster. The reptile was originally identified in 2003, but this most recent discovery of additional, more complete specimens has allowed scientists to depict the bizarre long-necked creature in full for the very first time. It is yet one more example of the weird and wonderful world of the Triassic that continues to baffle palaeontologists, said Dr. Nick Fraser, Keeper of Natural Sciences at National Museums Scotland in the statement announcing the discovery. We are certain that it will capture imaginations across the globe due to its striking appearance, reminiscent of the long and snake-like, mythical Chinese Dragon. Researchers from Scotland, Germany, the United States and China studied the fossil over the course of ten years at the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology in Beijing but made their announcement public on Friday. This has been an international effort. Working together with colleagues from the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Europe, we used newly discovered specimens housed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to build on our existing knowledge of this animal, Professor Li Chun from the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology said. Among all of the extraordinary finds we have made in the Triassic of Guizhou Province, Dinocephalosaurus probably stands out as the most remarkable. The paper describing the animal has been published in full in the academic journal Earth and Environmental Science: Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. As an early-career researcher, it has been an incredible experience to contribute to these significant findings, said Dr. Stephan Spiekman, a postdoctoral researcher based at the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History. We hope that our future research will help us understand more about the evolution of this group of animals, and particularly how the elongate neck functioned. Source: ABC News -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 07:16 pm",
        "content": "Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake has directed the respective officials to initiate legal actions against the unauthorized conferment and utilization of national awards and honorary titles. The Presidential Secretariat said it is actively overseeing instances where individuals and non-governmental entities are bestowing awards, certificates, and titles falsely representing the prestigious national honours granted by the President to distinguished Sri Lankans. These recognitions are traditionally bestowed through a formal process meticulously evaluated by designated authorities. Emphasizing the imperative to promptly cease the misappropriation of national award titles by unauthorized entities, the Presidential Secretary underscored the potential for such unauthorized actions to inflict considerable injustice and disrespect upon the genuinely esteemed Sri Lankan recipients of these honours. The establishment of the National Awards in 1986, as outlined in Extraordinary Gazette No. 3873 dated 02.03.1986, was followed by subsequent amendments detailed in Government Gazette No. 6278 dated 12-09-1990, Government Gazette No. 8634 dated 20-03-1995, and Government Gazette No. 153512 dated 08-02-2008. Furthermore, the introduction of two new awards, namely Vishishta Kaushalyabhimani and Vishishta Republica Abhimani, was ratified through Ministerial Note No. PSNCACD952023 presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on 18-02-2023. The process for nominations for National Awards is facilitated by Provincial Governors and Cabinet Ministers. Recommendations for the selection of awardees, both Sri Lankan and non-Sri Lankan individuals who have demonstrated exceptional service to Sri Lanka, are evaluated by a Selection Committee appointed by the President and chaired by the Prime Ministers Secretary. Presidential Secretariat says plans are underway to devise a new application system to engage eligible Sri Lankans in the nomination process. Subsequently, following the Presidents endorsement, a panel of academic experts appointed by the Presidential Secretary convenes to assess and select the awardees. The names of the chosen recipients will be officially published in a gazette, and the awards will be presented by the President on designated occasions, which may include Independence Day, National Heros Day, and ceremonies honouring non-Sri Lankan recipients. --PMD",

        "content": "The United States remains committed to the economic growth and prosperity of Sri Lanka, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma told government, civil society and economic leaders during his visit to Sri Lanka. Verma met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Ali Sabry to discuss progress on Sri Lankas IMF program, including inclusive economic and governance reforms aimed at keeping Sri Lanka on the path to sustainable economic growth, the US Embassy in Colombo said. Deputy Secretary Verma stressed the vital need to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, the statement said. They also explored opportunities to deepen defense and maritime cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka, including strengthening the Sri Lanka Navys capabilities to safeguard national security and promote a more stable Indo-Pacific region. On February 23, aboard the SLNS Vijayabahu, one of three former U.S. Coast Guard cutters transferred by the United States to Sri Lanka, Deputy Secretary Verma said, I am pleased to announce that the Department of State has notified Congress of our intent to transfer a fourth medium endurance cutter to Sri Lanka. The Department obligated 9 million in Foreign Military Financing to support this effort. We look forward to offering the cutter, pending the completion of Congress notification period. If completed, this transfer would further strengthen defense cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka. The ship would increase Sri Lankas ability to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone, monitor its search and rescue area, and provide additional security for ships from all nations that transit the busy sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Participating in the announcement at Colombo Port were Sri Lanka State Minister of Defense Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, and U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, who remarked, The United States has previously transferred three cutters to the Sri Lankan Navy, which deploys these ships for maritime operations and law enforcement missions, countering human trafficking and drug trafficking, while supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster response efforts. The eventual transfer of a fourth vessel would be just one more point in a long history of cooperation between Sri Lanka and the United States in preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Deputy Secretary Verma also visited the site of the West Container Terminal (WCT), a deepwater shipping container terminal in the Port of Colombo. The WCT, currently being constructed by Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) Private Limited with 553 million in financing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, will provide critical infrastructure for the South Asian region. Operating near capacity since 2021, the Port of Colombos new addition will be the ports deepest terminal and aims to boost Colombos shipping capacity, expanding its role as a premiere logistics hub connecting major routes and markets, boosting prosperity for Sri Lanka without adding to its sovereign debt.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in coordination with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Myanmar continues to make every effort to rescue and repatriate the Sri Lankan nationals who have become victims of human trafficking and are trapped in Myanmar, the ministry said in a statement. These Sri Lankans have been coerced into various online scams in multiple locations within the Myawaddy area of Myanmar, under the pretext of legitimate job offers in the IT field. Foreign Minister M.U.M. Ali Sabry took this issue up with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, requesting urgent intervention to rescue Sri Lankan nationals, the statement said. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Myanmar has also been consistently bringing to the notice of the Myanmar authorities the serious situation of Sri Lankan victims enslaved in cybercriminal activities by traffickers, urging the authorities to take immediate action to rescue the victims from these distressing circumstances. Consequently, the Government of Myanmar has assured that all measures will be taken towards rescuing the victims from the grip of traffickers as early as possible, the ministry said. Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs U.L. Mohammed Jauhar met with the Myanmar Ambassador in Colombo on 22 February 2024 and reiterated the urgent need for assistance for the safe rescue and repatriation of the Sri Lankan nationals in the Myawaddy area. It has been informed that while the Myanmar Government has been making efforts, it encountered difficulties in accessing the concerned area due to the prevailing situation, the statement added. The Ministry said it is in close coordination with the Sri Lankan Missions based in the neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia and international organizations to ensure the wellbeing and safe repatriation of these Sri Lankans at the earliest. The Ministry said it is also exploring the possibility of working with other countries whose nationals have also been affected. Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said it has been informed that certain elements are making attempts to collect money from the families of the affected persons promising assistance in the rescue and repatriation process of the trafficked victims. The Ministry requested the families of those affected to exercise extreme caution in dealing with these individuals. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs further said it has been in constant contact with the relevant authorities, and wishes to assure that all possible avenues are being pursued for the rescue and safe repatriation of the Sri Lankans who have fallen victim to human trafficking in Myanmar, in close collaboration and constant contact with the Myanmar Government authorities.",

        "date": "February 23, 2024 10:32 pm",
        "content": "BERLIN (AP)  German lawmakers on Friday approved a government plan to liberalize rules on cannabis, paving the way for the country to decriminalize limited amounts of marijuana and allow members of cannabis clubs to buy it for recreational purposes. Parliaments lower house, or Bundestag, backed the legislation, a prominent reform project of Chancellor Olaf Scholzs socially liberal governing coalition, by 407 votes to 226. There were four abstentions. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the governments aim is to fight the black market and better protect young people. He said current laws in the European Unions most populous nation have failed, with consumption rising and increasing problems with contaminated or overly concentrated cannabis. Whatever we do, we cant carry on like this, he told lawmakers. You can stick your head in the sand  but we wont solve a single problem that way. Lauterbach, who noted that he himself long opposed legalizing cannabis, argued that addiction researchers say removing the taboo around marijuana and giving information on its risks is the right approach. The bill foresees legalizing possession by adults of up to 25 grams (nearly 1 ounce) of marijuana for recreational purposes and allowing individuals to grow up to three plants on their own. That part of the legislation is supposed to take effect on April 1. German residents who are 18 and older would be allowed to join nonprofit cannabis clubs with a maximum 500 members each, starting July 1. The clubs would be allowed to grow cannabis for members personal consumption. Individuals would be allowed to buy up to 25 grams per day, or a maximum 50 grams per month  a figure limited to 30 grams for under-21s. Membership in multiple clubs would not be allowed. The clubs costs would be covered by membership fees, which would be staggered according to how much marijuana members use. The government plans a ban on advertising or sponsoring cannabis, and the clubs and consumption wont be allowed in the immediate vicinity of schools, playgrounds and sports facilities. An evaluation of the legislations effect on protection of children and youths is to be carried out within 18 months of the legislation taking effect. The main center-right opposition bloc vehemently opposes the change. Youre asserting here in all seriousness as health minister  that we will curb consumption among children and young people with the legalization of further drugs, conservative lawmaker Tino Sorge said to Lauterbach. Thats the biggest nonsense Ive ever heard. Lauterbach told reporters after the vote that dealers have no reason at all to celebrate. He noted that, under the new legislation, dealers who are caught selling to children or youths can expect to face a sentence of at least two years. The plan falls significantly short of the governments original ambitions, which foresaw allowing the sale of cannabis to adults across the country at licensed outlets. The project was scaled back following talks with the European Unions executive commission. Parliaments upper house, which represents Germanys 16 state governments, could in principle delay the legislation, though it doesnt formally require the chambers approval. Bavarias conservative state government has said it would examine whether legal action against the liberalization plan is possible. The legislation is one of several that Scholzs coalition, which has since become highly unpopular as a result of economic weakness and persistent infighting, pledged when it took office in 2021. It has eased rules on gaining citizenship and ended restrictions on holding dual citizenship. Among other policies, it also plans to make it easier for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to change their gender and name in official registers. Source: AP --Agencies",

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT The South Asian island nation finalised a 2.9 billion bailout, from the International Monetary Fund in March 2023, which helped temper skyrocketing inflation, improved state revenue and boosted foreign exchange reserves. The country defaulted on its overseas debt in May 2022 after a severe shortage of foreign exchange reserves triggered the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Sri Lanka has since made progress on about 11 billion of bilateral debt restructuring and hopes to have agreements in place with all key creditors, including bondholders, by May at the latest, Sabry told Reuters earlier this month. KEY QUOTES The State Department official and the Sri Lankan leaders discussed progress on Sri Lankas IMF program, including economic and governance reforms aimed at putting Sri Lanka on the path to sustainable economic growth, the department said in a statement. BY THE NUMBERS Sri Lankas economy is estimated by the World Bank to have contracted by 3.8 last year but is expected to grow by 1.7 in 2024.

        "content": "Seeking to enhance maritime security and interoperability, coast guard personnel from India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have embarked on a four-day trilateral exercise to identify emerging maritime challenges in the Indian Ocean Region. Indian Coast Guard ship Samarth and ICGS Abhinav along with Sri Lanka Naval Ship Samudura reached Malé on Thursday for the exercise DOSTI-16 that would be held between February 22 and 25. Bangladesh is participating as an observer. Coast guard helicopter ICGS Dornier too is part of the trilateral exercise Dosti, which Sri Lanka said aims to enhance cooperation, strengthen friendship, improve mutual operational capability, and develop interoperability among the Coast Guard personnel of India, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) late Thursday evening extended a warm welcome to ADG S Paramesh, Additional Director General of the Indian Coast Guard. Upon his (Paramesh) arrival at the VIA, Colonel Mohamed Saleem, Commandant of MNDF Coast Guard, greeted him, a post on X by MNDF said. Commanding Officers of both ICG ships called on Commandant MNDF CG and discussed mutual avenues of cooperative engagements, the Indian Coast Guard said in a post on X. The ICG ships would participate in a series of activities and take part in a joint sea exercise with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard and Maldives National Defence Force. The Indian Mission in Maldives described the 16th edition of the India-Maldives-Srilanka trilateral exercise Dosti as a regional synergy to enhance maritime security  interoperability! Earlier, a release from the Sri Lankan Navy said before its ship left for the Maldives: Participating in this nature of exercises will allow the Sri Lanka Navy to enhance cooperation and interoperability with other maritime stakeholders in the region. It (also) offers numerous advantages, including acquiring new knowledge about maritime operations, exchanging strategies and experiences, identifying emerging maritime challenges in the Indian Ocean Region, and collaboratively finding solutions for them, it added.

        "title": "Death toll in Spanish building fire rises as questions grow about speed of blaze",
        "date": "February 24, 2024 10:20 am",
        "content": "The death toll in a fire that engulfed an apartment block in the Spanish city of Valencia rose Friday to nine as questions were raised about whether construction materials caused the fire to spread so rapidly. One person remained missing, according to forensic police, who after identification procedures downgraded the death toll from an officials account of 10 provided earlier following a visual count of remains. The fire started Thursday evening and quickly engulfed the two residential buildings. Neighbors described seeing the rapid spread of the blaze, residents stuck on balconies and hearing children screaming. I have no words to describe the suffering of those poor people, said Sara Plaza. Police found 9 bodies in the gutted residential buildings. Valencias national government delegate confirmed that the bodies matched the list of people that authorities had been trying to locate and that one person remained missing. Neighbor Alejandra Alarcón said it took 15 minutes for the fire to engulf an entire building, as questions abounded as to how the fire spread so rapidly. Experts suggested that a type of cladding might have made the blaze spread faster, but Valencia Mayor María José Catalá said the cause of the fire was still not known and it was too early to comment on whether some materials used in construction of the modern complex might have contributed. The vice-president of the Valencia College of Industrial and Technical Engineers, Esther Puchades, who once inspected the building, told the state news agency Efe that the cladding used included polyurethane and when heated it is like plastic and it ignites. She said it was the first fire of its type in Spain, but that other blazes involving the material have been similarly destructive in the United Kingdom and China. Spains polyurethane manufacturers association, IPUR, issued a statement contesting Puchades claim, saying there was no evidence that polyurethane was used in the Valencia buildings façade. The June 2017 fire at Grenfell Tower in London, which had similar cladding, caused 72 deaths. In the Grenfell Tower, the exterior walls of the 25-story public housing complex were covered by a layer of foam insulation topped by what are called aluminum composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels. These are essentially two sheets of aluminum sandwiched around a layer of polyethylene, a combustible plastic polymer that melts and drips on exposure to heat. After a faulty refrigerator started the fire in a fourth floor apartment, the flames quickly spread to the exterior cladding and began climbing up the outside of the building. The fire reached the roof within minutes, then spread to engulf much of the structure, trapping residents in their apartments. A public inquiry into the fire found that the flames spread rapidly owing to the presence of aluminum composite material and polyethylene, a substance similar to polyurethane. The complex in Valencia was finished in 2009. In a promotional video, the now bankrupt construction company Fbex boasted that it used a new aluminum-based material as part of its façade. Fifteen people were treated for injuries and two remained in city hospitals. Both were said to be stable. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene, promising support for those affected and expressing gratitude to firefighters and military personnel who worked to extinguish the blaze. Pope Francis also sent a telegram of condolences. It was not immediately known how many people were in the two buildings when the fire broke out, but dozens are believed to have lost their homes and belongings. The complex had some 140 apartments. The Valencia regional government declared three days of mourning and announced financial aid to cover accommodation, clothing and food. Weekend soccer games involving Valencia and Levante have been postponed after both clubs requested not to play in the immediate aftermath of the fire, the Spanish league said. Residents were housed overnight in hotels or in the homes of relatives and neighbors, authorities said. Neighbors also responded by donating clothes and food in shops for the survivors. Firefighters rushed to the scene on the outskirts of the city as flames burst from windows. They used a crane to lift two residents from one of the balconies. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "US targets Russia with more than 500 new sanctions",
        "date": "February 24, 2024 01:59 pm",
        "content": "The US has announced more than 500 new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. These include measures against Russias main card payment system, financial and military institutions, and officials involved in Navalnys imprisonment. The EU has also announced new sanctions on access to military technology. The measures mark a week since Navalny suddenly died in an Arctic Circle jail. US President Joe Biden, who met Navalnys widow and daughter in San Francisco on Thursday, has said there can be no doubt the Russian president was to blame for his death. The newly-announced US measures also include nearly 100 firms and individuals which will also face export restrictions. Others target the state-owned operator of Mir, Russias main payment system, which has become more prominent since Visa and Mastercard suspended their services there. Companies involved in powering Russias war effort, developing the countrys future energy production and its co-operation with Iran over drones will also be hit. More than two dozen entities outside of Russia - including people in China, the UAE, Vietnam and Liechtenstein - have also been sanctioned, accused of being connected to businesses that send materials to Russias military. The sanctions are unlikely to have an impact on Russias economy. It is already the most sanctioned country in the world, and there are very few key entities or sectors that are not already subject to US and European restrictions. Russian banks and military-industrial enterprises have adapted, and developed workarounds to evade existing sanctions. Ukrainian officials have published details of US and European microchips and other technology they have found in captured Russian drones. Many of these parts are imported to Russia from third countries such as China. In a statement, President Biden said they new sanctions would ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home. This latest package brings the number of entities sanctioned to over 4,000, and comes on the eve of the second anniversary of Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going, Mr Biden said in the statement. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, told reporters on Friday that the administration had plans for further action against Russia, but needed to work with international partners and gain greater legal authority from Congress to implement it. The EU also announced its 13th raft of sanctions on Friday, targeting nearly 200 companies and people accused of helping Russia procure weapons, or of involvement in kidnapping Ukrainian children - something Moscow denies. They included 10 Russian companies and individuals involved in the shipping of North Korean armaments to Russia, including North Koreas defence minister. We remain united in our determination to dent Russias war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defence, said EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell. The EU has now listed more than 2,000 individuals since the war started. In response, Russias foreign ministry said it had significantly expanded a list of EU officials and politicians banned from entering Russia. The European Union is continuing its fruitless attempts to put pressure on Russia through unilateral restrictive measures, it said in a statement. The Russian president himself was sanctioned by the US, EU and UK days after the start of Moscows full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. His assets were frozen and companies were banned from providing them with goods. People close to him, including his daughters, are also under sanctions. The International Criminal Court served Mr Putin with an arrest warrant last year, alleging he was responsible for war crimes and focusing on the deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. Mr Putin regularly praises the performance of the Russian economy in spite of international sanctions.We have growth, the West has decline, he said last month during a visit to the remote Russian region of Chukotka. They depend on us more than we depend on them. Its economy is around 1 larger than it was in February 2022. Moscow can still find plenty of buyers for oil, gas and minerals, especially in Asia. But Western officials say this is a marathon, not a sprint, and sanctions can take years to show results. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The decision to detonate the bomb at sea was taken after considering all options, including a controlled detonation on site, according to a government statement. I think it is fair to say that the last few days will go down in history for Plymouth. This war-time bomb has really brought out war-time spirit, people coming together to really support each other and whilst it has been really tough  we got through it, said Tudor Evans, leader of Plymouth City Council. The bomb was carefully loaded onto a lorry, which drove slowly to the slipway so it could be loaded onto a boat, which then took the bomb out to sea so it could be safely detonated, he said. Evans thanked the bomb experts for their bravery and for putting their lives on the line while they were removing the bomb. The device was discovered on Tuesday in a garden, the Plymouth City Council said in a post on social media. It has been a rollercoaster of emotion the last few days, and I would like to praise the community for helping the emergency team in evacuating and supporting our effort to protect their home, Evans said.

        "content": "Sri Lankas T20I captain Wanindu Hasaranga has been suspended for two international matches after his accumulated demerit points reached five within a 24-month period following his latest breach of the ICC Code of Conduct, for which he received a 50 percent fine and three demerit points. Hasaranga was found guilty of breaching article 2.13 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to Personal abuse of a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire or Match Referee during an International Match. Hasarangas five demerit points convert to two suspension points. As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or T20Is, whatever comes first for the player or player support personnel, Hasaranga stands suspended from Sri Lankas first two T20Is against Bangladesh next month. The incident occurred after the end of the match, when Hasaranga confronted umpire Lyndon Hanibal to criticise him over a decision. Afghanistan player Rahmanullah Gurbaz has also been penalised. He has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct in the same match. Rahmanullah was found to have breached article 2.4 of the Code, which relates to Disobeying an Umpires instruction during an International Match. In addition to this, one demerit point has been added to Rahmanullahs disciplinary record, for whom it was the second offence in a 24-month period, taking his cumulative demerit points to two. The sanction was imposed on Rahmanullah for changing the grip of his bat on the field of play despite being repeatedly warned not to do so. Both players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by Chris Broad of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for formal hearings. On-field umpires Lyndon Hannibal and Raveendra Wimalasiri, third umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge and and fourth umpire Ranmore Martinez levelled the charges. Level 2 breaches carry a penalty of between 50 and 100 per cent of a players match fee and three or four demerit points while Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

As per reports, this suspect had deserted the Army in 2009 while following the basic training program and had later officially left the service. The suspect was taken into custody this afternoon (Feb. 24) in Narawelpiya South, Hakmana. Identified as Sadees Kumara, he is charged with aiding and abetting the shooting which took place on Feb. 21 near a meat shop in Elapitiwala Junction, Mahabage and killed the shop owner. Three unidentified assailants had opened fire using a revolver, around 7:15 a.m. on Feb. 21. The victim had succumbed to injuries while being rushed to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama. The deceased, named Hettiarachchige Don Sujith alias Ukkuwa, was the brother-in-law of the criminal gang leader Welle Saranga and a resident of North Batagama in Ja-Ela. The motive behind the shooting was not immediately clear, but a rival gang led by Dubai Nipuna was under suspicion of orchestrating the murder. Reports also revealed that Sujith had been receiving death threats from Dubai Nipunas gang. The prime suspect or the gunman, who was serving as a Corporal attached to the 4th Battalion of the Gemunu Watch Regiment at the Army camp in Chenkalady of Batticaloa, was meanwhile arrested early this morning while on the run. He had fled the camp yesterday when the Army intelligence officers were approaching but was later taken into custody in the Ampara area following an extensive search operation. The suspect was later handed over to the Police Special Task Force (STF) officers for onward investigations. The third suspect, the motorcyclist, however, is still at large, and investigations are underway to apprehend him as well.",

        "date": "February 25, 2024 08:07 am",
        "content": "At least 15 people were killed and 44 injured in a fire at an apartment building in eastern Chinas Nanjing, local authorities said Saturday. The blaze broke out at a news conference Friday morning, with officials saying a preliminary investigation suggested the fire started on the first floor of the building, where electric bicycles were stored. The building is located in the Yuhua District of Nanjing, a city of more than eight million people, about 260 kilometers (162 miles) northwest of Shanghai. The fire was put out by 6:00 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday) and the search and rescue operation ended around 2:00 p.m., officials said. According to the emergency services, 25 fire engines were mobilized to fight the fire. Footage shared on Chinese social media shows a skyscraper on fire in the middle of the night, with black smoke pouring out of it. Other images show huge flames engulfing several floors of the building, with the flashing lights of emergency vehicles visible in the darkness nearby. Additional footage, apparently taken later, shows white smoke billowing from several points in the building. Forty-four injured people were sent to hospital for treatment, officials said, adding that one person was in critical condition and another was seriously injured. At a press conference, the mayor of the city, Chen Zhichan, expressed condolences and apologies to the families of the victims. Frequent fires Fires and other fatal accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement. And the country has seen a series of deadly fires in recent months, often caused by carelessness  prompting President Xi Jinpings calls last month for deeper consideration and more efforts to prevent safety accidents from occurring. In January, dozens of people died in a fire at a store in the central city of Xinyu, which state news agency Xinhua said was caused by the illegal use of fire by workers in the stores basement. The fire comes just days after an evening fire at a school in central Chinas Henan province killed 13 schoolchildren while sleeping in a dormitory. A school teacher told the state-run Hebei Daily that all the victims were from the third grade of grades 9 and 10. Domestic media say that the fire was caused by an electric heating device. And in November, a fire at the office of a coal company in northern Chinas Shaanxi Province killed 26 people and sent dozens to the hospital. A month ago, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in the countrys northwest killed 31 people and prompted the official pledge of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety. And in April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to climb out of windows to escape. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump wins South Carolina, easily beating Haley in her home state and closing in on GOP nomination",
        "date": "February 25, 2024 02:19 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump won South Carolinas Republican primary on Saturday, easily beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state and further consolidating his path to a third straight GOP nomination. Trump has now swept every contest that counted for Republican delegates, adding to previous wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Haley is facing growing pressure to leave the race but says shes not going anywhere despite losing the state where she was governor from 2011 to 2017. A 2020 rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable. Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trumps momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner as polls closed statewide at 7 p.m. That race call was based on an analysis of AP VoteCast, a comprehensive survey of Republican South Carolina primary voters. The survey confirmed the findings of pre-Election Day polls showing Trump far outpacing Haley statewide. I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now, Trump declared, taking the stage for his victory speech mere moments after polls closed. He added, You can celebrate for about 15 minutes, but then we have to get back to work. South Carolinas first-in-the-South primary has historically been a reliable bellwether for Republicans. In all but one primary since 1980, the Republican winner in South Carolina has gone on to be the partys nominee. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012. Trump was dominant across the state, even leading in Lexington County, which Haley represented in the state Legislature. Many Trump-backing South Carolinians, even some who previously supported Haley during her time as governor, werent willing to give her a home-state bump. Shes done some good things, Davis Paul, 36, said about Haley as he waited for Trump at a recent rally in Conway. But I just dont think shes ready to tackle a candidate like Trump. I dont think many people can. At Haley headquarters on Saturday night, supporters waved her signs in front of a large projection screen showing Trumps speech, blocking it from view. That, of course, didnt make the defeat any less crushing. About an hour later, Haley took the stage and said: What I saw today was South Carolinas frustration with our countrys direction. Ive seen that same frustration nationwide. I dont believe Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden, Haley said, later adding: I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run. Im a woman of my word. She said she plans to head to Michigan for its primary on Tuesday  the last major contest before Super Tuesday. Still, she faces questions about where she might be able to win a contest or be competitive. Trump and Biden are already behaving like they expect to face off in November. Trump and his allies argue Biden has made the U.S. weaker and point to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russias decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly attacked Biden over high inflation earlier in the presidents term and his handling of record-high migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has questioned  often in harshly personal terms  whether the 81-year-old Biden is too old to serve a second term. Bidens team in turn has highlighted the 77-year-old Trumps own flubs on the campaign trail. Biden has stepped up his recent fundraising trips around the country and increasingly attacked Trump directly. Hes called Trump and his Make America Great Again movement dire threats to the nations founding principles, and the presidents reelection campaign has lately focused most of its attention on Trump suggesting hed use the first day of a second presidency as a dictator and that hed tell Russia to attack NATO allies who fail to keep up with defense spending obligations mandated by the alliance. Haley also criticized Trump on his NATO comments and also for questioning why her husband wasnt on the campaign trail with her  even as former first lady Melania Trump hasnt appeared with him. Maj. Michael Haley is deployed in the Horn of Africa on a mission with the South Carolina Army National Guard. But South Carolinas Republican voters line up with Trump on having lukewarm feelings about NATO and continued U.S. support for Ukraine, according to AP VoteCast data from Saturdays primary. About 6 in 10 oppose continuing aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Only about a third described Americas participation in NATO as very good, with more saying its only somewhat good. Haley has raised copious amounts of campaign money and is scheduled to begin a cross-country campaign swing on Sunday in Michigan ahead of Super Tuesday on March 5, when many delegate-rich states hold primaries. But its unclear how she can stop Trump from clinching enough delegates to become the partys presumptive nominee for the third time. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., complimented Haley while speaking to reporters at Trumps election night party in Columbia but suggested it was time for her to drop out. I think the sooner she does, the better for her, the better for the party, Graham said. Later, the senator was greeted with boos after Trump called him to the stage to address those gathered. Trumps political strength has endured despite facing 91 criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, the discovery of classified documents in his Florida residence and allegations that he secretly arranged payoffs to a porn actress. The former presidents first criminal trial is set to begin on March 25 in New York, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in the closing weeks of his 2016 presidential campaign. Biden won South Carolinas Democratic primary earlier this month and faces only one remaining challenger, Dean Phillips. The Minnesota Democratic congressman has continued to campaign in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary there, despite having little chance of actually beating Biden. Though Biden is expected to cruise to his partys renomination, he faces criticism from some Democrats for providing military backing to Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some in his party support a ceasefire as the death toll in Israels war has reached 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The war could hurt the presidents general election chances in swing states like Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population. Source - AP News - Agencies",

TM Dilshan, renowned for his explosive batting style, played a pivotal role in numerous victories for the Sri Lankan cricket team throughout his career. The 47-year-olds acquisition of Australian citizenship marks a new chapter in his life post-retirement from professional cricket. Todays citizenship ceremony was made even more special with the attendance of Tillakaratne Dilshan, a former Sri Lankan cricketer and captain of the Sri Lanka national cricket team. Dilshan is regarded as the best Sri Lankan player in run-chases in ODI history. He also holds the record for being the top run scorer in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup with 500 runs and scored a century against England in the semi-final. Additionally, he was part of the Sri Lankan team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, the MP posted on social media.

It was great to hear that his daughter Resandi is following in her fathers footsteps, he added. Tillakaratne Dilshan amassed over 10,000 runs from 330 ODIs since his one-day international debut in 1999 against Zimbabwe. His Test career spanned 87 matches, during which he accumulated 5492 runs, including a high-score of 193. In 80 T20I matches, Dilshan made 1889 runs, which featured one century and 13 half-centuries.

        "date": "February 25, 2024 06:30 pm",
        "content": "Negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have resumed in Doha between experts from Egypt, Qatar, the United States and Israel, as well as Hamas representatives, state-linked Egyptian media reported Sunday. An Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea was in Paris on Friday discussing possibilities of a deal to ensure a fresh ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israels war cabinet agreed on Saturday to send a delegation to Qatar to continue the talks, according to Israeli media reports. The talks are a continuation of what was discussed in Paris and will be followed by meetings in Cairo, reported Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services. During the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, Palestinian militants took some 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel. As with a previous week-long truce in November that saw more than 100 hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners freed, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been spearheading efforts to secure a new deal. International pressure for a ceasefire has mounted in recent weeks, as the death toll from Israels military offensive on the Palestinian territory nears 30,000, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas -- which rules Gaza -- in response to its unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. In negotiations, Hamas has demanded a ceasefire and Israels withdrawal from Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed as delusional as he vows to press further into the territory. Fears have surged over Israeli plans for a ground invasion of Rafah, Gazas southernmost city where 1.4 million Palestinians have been pushed into sprawling tent cities right against the Egyptian border. US, Arab and other mediators have voiced hope a deal can be reached before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on March 10 or 11, depending on the lunar calendar. Source: AFP --Agencies",

The film about the race to build the first atomic bomb took the top honor - best movie cast - handed out by members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union at a red-carpet ceremony in Los Angeles. Cillian Murphy, who played scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, won best movie actor, and co-star Robert Downey Jr. best supporting actor. Irish actor Murphy said he took up the profession after trying to make a career as a musician and often felt like an interloper. This is extremely special to me because it comes from you guys, Murphy told his fellow actors as he accepted his award. SAG-AFTRAs choices are closely watched because actors form the largest group of voters for the Academy Awards, the film industrys top prizes. At the moment Oppenheimer appears unstoppable.

Honors from Producers Guild of America, another key predictor of Oscars success, will be announced on Sunday. In other SAG accolades, the best actress trophy went to Lily Gladstone, star of Killers of the Flower Moon. Gladstone played a member of the Osage Native American community that suffered a string of murders in 1920s Oklahoma over their oil-rich land. My friends, fellow actors, I feel the good in what you have done, Gladstone said. We bring empathy into a world that so much needs it.

        "date": "February 25, 2024 10:13 pm",
        "content": "U.S. and British forces carried out strikes against more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday, officials said, the latest round of military action against the Iran-linked group that continues to attack shipping in the region. The United States has carried out near daily strikes against the Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen and have said their attacks on shipping are in solidarity with Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza. The strikes have so far failed to halt the Houthis attacks, which have upset global trade and raised shipping rates. A joint statement from countries that either took part in the strikes or provided support, said the military action was against 18 Houthi targets across eight locations in Yemen including underground weapons and missile storage facilities, air defense systems, radars and a helicopter. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes were meant to further disrupt and degrade the capabilities of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that they will bear the consequences if they do not stop their illegal attacks, which harm Middle Eastern economies, cause environmental damage and disrupt the delivery of humanitarian aid to Yemen and other countries, Austin said. The strikes were supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Al Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by the Houthi movement, said on Saturday that U.S. and UK forces carried out a series of strikes in the capital, Sanaa. It quoted an unnamed Houthi military source as saying the renewed raids were a miserable attempt to prevent Yemen from providing support operations to the Palestinian people in Gaza. Earlier this week the Houthis claimed responsibility for an attack on a UK-owned cargo ship and a drone assault on a U.S. destroyer, and they targeted Israels port and resort city of Eilat with ballistic missiles and drones. The groups strikes are disrupting the vital Suez Canal shortcut that accounts for about 12 of global maritime traffic, forcing a longer, more expensive route around Africa. No ships have been sunk nor crew killed during the Houthi campaign. However there are concerns about the fate of the UK-registered Rubymar cargo vessel, which was struck on Feb. 18 and its crew evacuated. The U.S. military has said the Rubymar was carrying more than 41,000 tons of fertilizer when it was hit, which could spill into the Red Sea and cause an environmental disaster. The European Union has launched a naval mission to the Red Sea to restore and safeguard freedom of navigation. The United States has a parallel coalition, Operation Prosperity Guardian, aimed at safeguarding commercial traffic in from attacks by the Houthis. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

So many victims, wounded, destruction, anguish, and tears in a period that is becoming terribly long and whose end is not in sight. It is a war that not only devastates that region but also unleashes global waves of hate and fear, Pope Francis said during his weekly Angelus message. I plead for that little bit of humanity to be found to create the conditions for a diplomatic solution in search of a just and lasting peace, he said. Heads of the Group of Seven major democracies on Saturday pledged to stand by war-weary Ukraine, and Western leaders travelled to Kyiv to show solidarity on the second anniversary of Russias invasion. Francis said he was also concerned about escalating violence in the east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last week, violent clashes escalated between the DRCs army and Rwandan-backed M23 Tutsi-led rebels in eastern Congo, killing scores and displacing hundreds of thousands. I join the bishops in their call to pray for peace, hoping for an end to the clashes and a search for genuine and constructive dialogue, he said.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action in the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Zelenskyy said that the number was far lower than estimates given by Russian President Vladimir Putins government. 31,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in this war. Not 300,000, not 150,000, not whatever Putin and his deceitful circle have been lying about. But nevertheless, each of these losses is a great sacrifice for us, Zelenskyy said at the Ukraine. Year 2024 forum in Kyiv. The Ukrainian leader said that he wouldnt disclose the number of troops that were wounded or missing. He also said that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. We dont know how many of our civilians they killed. We dont, he said. Its the first time that Kyiv has confirmed the number of its losses since the start of Russias full-scale war on Feb. 24, 2022. Russia has provided few official casualty figures. The most recent data from the Defense Ministry, published in January 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 deaths, although reports from U.S. and U.K. officials put that number significantly higher. A U.S. intelligence report declassified in mid-December 2023 estimated that 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. If accurate, the figure would represent 87 of the roughly 360,000 troops Russia had before the war, according to the report. Independent Russian news outlet Mediazona said Saturday that about 75,000 Russian men died in 2022 and 2023 fighting in the war. A joint investigation published by Mediazona and Meduza, another independent Russian news site, indicates that the rate of Russias losses in Ukraine is not slowing and that Moscow is losing about 120 men a day.

The President emphasized the economic potential of Hambantota, envisioning it as a pivotal hub for infrastructure development and connectivity. He highlighted plans to link Hambantota to the Myanmar port, with further extensions anticipated up to Chongqing in eastern China and down to Africa. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of leveraging the extensive investments already made in infrastructure in Hambantota, despite previous challenges, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. We have spent a significant amount on infrastructure here, and despite facing crises, it is imperative to capitalize on these investments, remarked President Wickremesinghe. He disclosed plans for allocating thousands of acres of land for investment zones, with additional acquisitions sought in the Moneragala area. Moreover, the President advocated for strategic expansion into new areas, including Avissawella and Eheliyagoda, to alleviate urban congestion and foster new city centres. Plans for a North Colombo port expansion and potential industrial and IT parks were also discussed, aiming to attract investments and spur economic growth. We must concentrate our efforts and funds on key infrastructure, particularly in Hambantota and Colombo, President Wickremesinghe stated. He expressed confidence in attracting investors for heritage cities like Colombo once land availability is ensured. However, he acknowledged the need for continued investment in Hambantota to propel its development, highlighting it as the next significant hub after Colombo. The development of Trincomalee as a major investment zone, in collaboration with India, emerged as a priority during the discussion. President Wickremesinghe announced plans for a joint working group to implement development initiatives in Trincomalee, emphasizing the importance of bilateral cooperation in driving economic growth and regional stability. President Wickremesinghes remarks underscored a strategic shift towards targeted infrastructure development, emphasizing the pivotal roles of Hambantota and the Eastern Province in economic growth and positioning it as a key player alongside Colombo in Sri Lankas development trajectory.

        "date": "February 26, 2024 10:14 am",
        "content": "A Bangladeshi court on Sunday barred the adoption of elephants from the wild, a move hailed by animal rights activists as a landmark order to help stop cruelty. Rights groups said the high court order suspending licences will stop the torture of captive Asian elephants in the name of training. The high court today suspended all licenses for the captive rearing of elephants, Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country, told AFP. Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants. But poaching and habitat loss saw their number dwindle so much that they are now declared critically endangered in the South Asian country. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country. As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the countrys northern and southeastern hills. The forestry department has previously issued licenses to logging groups who use the elephants to drag tree trunks, or to circus groups -- to adopt the animals. But Gupta said the elephants were being exploited and used for begging and street extortion, breaking the license terms. Animal rights activists said the suspension would end often brutal training -- known as hadani. This is a landmark order, said Rakibul Haque Emil, head of the animal rights group People for Animal Welfare (PAW) Foundation in Bangladeshi. PAW and actor Jaya Ahsan launched a public interest litigation against captive elephant licensing. In this name of training elephants, private licensees including circus parties brutally separate elephant calves from their mother, shackle them for months and then torture them to teach tricks, Emil said. We hope it is the end of hadani in Bangladesh, he added. The plight of the captive elephants was highlighted May last year when a young elephant, used for begging on the streets, was killed by a train. Some daub the elephants in colourful paint and force them to do tricks on the streets, asking for cash for their performance. In May 2019 police also rescued two emaciated elephants from their owners after the animals were used for roadside begging. The elephants were later handed over to Dhaka Zoo. Emil said they would mobilise support for the rehabilitation of captive elephants. Several countries in Asia such as Thailand and Nepal have found some success in rehabilitating captive elephants, he said. We shall do it here. Source: AFP --Agencies",

While an investigation was previously conducted at the institutional level to determine if the fatalities were a result of an infection caused by the germs that entered the bloodstream or the chemicals administered during the dialysis procedure, the Ministry of Health also appointed a 5-member committee of experts to look into the matter at the ministerial level. Meanwhile, measures are also afoot to appoint a two-member committee of expert doctors specializing in blood and blood transfusion procedures, Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Maheepala said. In light of the situation, the authorities of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital have decided to direct kidney patients in need of dialysis to the Kuliyapitiya, Narammala, Dambadeniya Nikaweratiya and Nikawewa Hospitals for treatment. Reports have revealed that the five patients had died due to complications that arose after their platelet levels dropped rapidly during the dialysis treatment. Director of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital Dr. Chandana Kendanagamuwa stated, however, that the exact cause of these deaths is yet to be acertained.

        "content": "A survey conducted by the University of Peradeniya has revealed that 71 of the official telephone lines assigned to state institutions in the country are not functioning properly. The relevant survey was conducted by a group of students from the Universitys Department of Economics and Statistics, under the guidance of Prof. Wasantha Athukorala. Accordingly, Prof. Athukorala revealed that as per the survey, only 29 of the official telephone lines introduced for the public to contact state institutions operate properly, while 49 of these lines do not operate at all and 22, albeit being in operation, are not answered by anyone. The survey pool included the official telephone lines assigned to Grama Niladhari officers, Samurdhi officers and development officers from Divisional Secretariats across the island. Accordingly, as per the data gathered from 98 of the 276 Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) divisions that were surveyed, 14 of the telephone lines were not in operation, 42 were left unanswered and only 44 were answered. Similarly, of the 23 (out of 24) Municipal Council areas that were surveyed, it was revealed that 4 of the official lines were not in operation, while 44 were not answered. Prof. Athukorala further stated, however, that even of those official lines that were answered, the responses given were rather vague, and barely of any use or relevance to the queries made. He highlighted that although these official telephone lines are being introduced for the convenience of the public, it is in fact not the case when actually attempting to use them, while urging that immediate measures be taken by the relevant institutions and authorities to resolve the matter.",

        "date": "February 26, 2024 04:52 pm",
        "content": "The inaugural edition of the Lanka T10 League is scheduled to be held from 12  22 December, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced on Monday (26 Feb.). The tournament, which was initially planned to be held in June 2023, was later shifted to December 2023, and now December 2024, as SLC deemed the December window the most appropriate to conduct the league successfully.

        "title": "Cabinet decides to suspend Parate Executions",
        "date": "February 26, 2024 05:59 pm",
        "content": "All Parate Executions have been suspended until 15 December 2024, as per a Cabinet decision made on Monday (26 Feb.). The relevant proposal was furnished by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, following a request made by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Minister of Industries Ramesh Pathirana. Accordingly, the relevant amendments are due to be presented before the Parliament soon. State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya had informed Parliament last week that steps will be taken to suspend the powers of the Parate execution law for a certain period for the purpose of protecting small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs (SMEs). As per the Cabinets decision, the banks practice of acquiring properties of whose loans are yet to be paid off will be suspended until 15 December 2024 and Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 will be amended to facilitate the necessary legal provisions. The government has observed that large-, medium- and small-scale businesspeople in the country had to face numerous constraints to maintain their businesses during the economic hardships that prevailed over the past 3 years. The economy has revived to some extent now, however, certain issues still exist pertaining to paying off the loans obtained from the banks for the medium- and small-scale businesses. Under such circumstances, adhering to existing legal provisions, banks have been acquiring properties of a considerable number of businessmen due to non-payment of loans and subsequently auctioning them. For this reason, the government says a sufficient grace period should be granted to pay off the loans without being a burden to the banking system. In light of this, the Cabinet of Ministers has granted the approval to the proposal tabled by the President to put a temporary halt to the acquisition of properties of loan defaulters by banks and to amend the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act.",

        "title": "Israel attack on Rafah would be final nail in coffin of Gaza aid: UN chief",
        "date": "February 26, 2024 06:40 pm",
        "content": "A full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would deliver a death blow to aid programs in Gaza, where humanitarian assistance remains completely insufficient, the UN chief warned Monday. Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Antonio Guterres said that Gazas southernmost city, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are crowded together in tent cities, was the core of the humanitarian aid operation in the Palestinian territory. An all-out Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there; it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programs, he said. His comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that his country was intent on a ground invasion in Rafah, in its bid for total victory over Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war. He said that once a ground invasion happens, victory would be just weeks away, and that a potential ceasefire, being discussed in Doha, would only delay the operation. The war that has been raging for more than four months broke out after Hamass unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Hamas militants also took about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead, according to Israel. Israels retaliatory offensive has killed at least 29,692 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest tally issued Sunday by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. End the bloodshed Guterres stressed Monday that nothing can justify Hamass deliberate killing, injuring, torturing and kidnapping of civilians, the use of sexual violence -- or the indiscriminate launching of rockets towards Israel. And nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, he said. Amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, UNRWA, the main UN aid agency for Palestinians, has urged political action to avert famine in Gaza. But Guterres stressed that humanitarian aid is still completely insufficient. I repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, he said. He lamented that despite his urgent calls for the UN Security Council to take all measures to end the bloodshed in Gaza and prevent escalation, it had failed to act. As one of five permanent members of the 15-member council, the United States -- Israels biggest ally -- has a veto that it has wielded three times so far to bar the body from calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Guterres warned of the consequences of the councils lack of action on Gaza, and its failure, due to a Russian veto, to act on the war in Ukraine. This inaction has severely -- perhaps fatally -- undermined its authority, he cautioned. The council needs serious reform to its composition and working methods. Source  AFP - Agencies",

        "title": "No plans to increase water tariffs this year - Minister Jeevan",
        "date": "February 26, 2024 09:41 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman, emphasized that addressing the challenges encountered by the upcountry Tamil community should extend beyond mere daily wages. He underscored the importance of enhancing their quality of life by addressing various facets such as housing, land, education, health, and infrastructure. During a press conference held at the Presidential Media Center today (26), under the theme Collective path to a stable country, Minister Thondaman remarked on the unnecessary nature of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) signed by certain political parties, purportedly aimed at resolving the issues faced by the upcountry Tamil populace. He stressed that genuine solutions to these issues do not necessitate MoUs. Furthermore, Minister Thondaman assured that there are no plans to increase water tariffs this year. He highlighted that the implementation of any proposed water pricing formula would be executed in a manner sensitive to the well-being of the populace, ensuring minimal distress. Expressing his views further, Minister Thondaman said; We anticipate no increase in water tariffs for the current year. While we have completed the groundwork for the water tariff formula slated for introduction last year, we are currently reviewing its specifics. Our aim is to avoid burdening the public unnecessarily with the water tariff formula. Certain political entities have entered into Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) regarding the issues faced by the upcountry Tamil community. However, MoUs are not required to address the genuine concerns of the upcountry Tamil populace. The upcountry Tamil community has long witnessed such symbolic gestures; what is imperative now is tangible action. We are committed to this cause. Contrary to some political leaders assertions that the sole concern of Tamil plantation workers is their daily wage of Rs. 1500.00, I refuse to belittle my people in such a manner. President Ranil Wickremesinghe advocates for a unified approach, transcending political affiliations, to address the challenges faced by minorities. I share this stance wholeheartedly. Our collective focus should be on the holistic development of the community. Despite President Ranil Wickremesinghes repeated calls for unity in this regard, regrettably, many individuals remain entrenched within narrow political confines. In 2015, a plan was set forth to construct a total of 24,000 homes for the upcountry Tamil community, comprising 14,000 units funded through Indian assistance and 10,000 units allocated by the Sri Lankan Government. However, by 2022, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing economic challenges led to the cessation of construction on these homes. By that time, only 1560 houses had been completed by the Sri Lankan Government. The initiation of a new project for 10,000 houses became possible as the prior 4,000-house project, facilitated by the Government of India, reached completion. Beyond housing, the imperative of securing land rights for these communities is recognized. The upcountry Tamils have long grappled with a myriad of unresolved issues, spanning housing, land tenure, education, healthcare, and infrastructure deficiencies. Both President Ranil Wickremesinghe and I align in the belief that sustainable resolutions are imperative. Accordingly, concerted efforts are underway to address these challenges comprehensively.

        "title": "Sweden to join NATO in historic move as Hungary ratifies bid",
        "date": "February 26, 2024 11:02 pm",
        "content": "Swedens NATO accession was approved by Hungarys parliament Monday, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War. Hungarys vote ended months of delays to complete Swedens security policy shift and followed a visit by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Friday during which the two countries signed an arms deal. Swedens NATO membership was supported by 188 lawmakers in Hungarian parliament, with 6 against and no abstentions. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbans government has faced pressure from NATO allies to fall in line and seal Swedens accession to the alliance. Finally it is done, Sweden is the 32nd member of the alliance, and this way NATO has become stronger, Agnes Vadai, a lawmaker of the opposition party Democratic Coalition (DK) told parliament. Stockholm abandoned its non-alignment policy for greater safety within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022. With Sweden following Finland into NATO, President Vladimir Putin has effectively achieved the very thing he sought to avert when he launched his war in Ukraine  an expansion of the alliance, Western leaders have said. While Finland became a NATO member last year, Sweden was kept waiting as Turkey and Hungary, which both maintain better relations with Russia than other members of the U.S.-led alliance, raised objections. Turkey withheld ratification on Swedens membership demanding tougher action against militants from the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) it said had made a home in Sweden. Sweden changed its laws and relaxed rules over arms sales to assuage Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also linked ratification with U.S. approval of sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, with Ankara now expecting the United States to work on securing the U.S. Congress endorsement. Hungarys foot-dragging was less clear in nature with Budapest mostly venting its annoyance over Swedish criticism of the direction of democratic development under nationalist premier Orban rather than any concrete demands. Orban  who has refused to send weapons to neighbouring Ukraine and repeatedly criticised Western sanctions against Russia  on Monday again urged a ceasefire in Ukraine. The accession of Sweden, which has not been at war since 1814, and Finland is the most significant expansion of the alliance since its move into Eastern Europe in the 1990s. While Sweden has ramped up cooperation with the alliance in recent decades, contributing to operations in places such as Afghanistan, its membership is set to simplify defence planning and cooperation on NATOs northern flank. Sweden also brings resources such as cutting-edge submarines tailored to Baltic Sea conditions and a sizable fleet of domestically produced Gripen fighter jets into the alliance. It is hiking military spending and should reach NATOs threshold of 2 of GDP this year. The ratification will now be signed by the speaker of parliament and Hungarys president within a few days, after which the remaining formalities, such as depositing accession documentation in Washington, are likely to be concluded swiftly.
