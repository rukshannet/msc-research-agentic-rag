        "title": "U.N. begins polio vaccination in Gaza, as fighting rages",
        "date": "September 1, 2024 05:36 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations, in collaboration with Palestinian health authorities, began to vaccinate 640,000 children in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with Israel and Hamas agreeing to brief pauses in their 11-month war to allow the campaign to go ahead. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed last month that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. The campaign began on Sunday in areas of central Gaza, and will move to other areas in coming days. Fighting will pause for at least eight hours on three consecutive days. The WHO said the pauses will likely need to extend to a fourth day and the first round of vaccinations will take just under two weeks. Children, escorted by members of their families, crowded a UN-run clinic in the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, where around one million people were sheltering, according to Palestinian officials. Medical staffers marked children who got the drops with a pen on their fingers. I came to the UNRWA clinic today to vaccinate my daughters against polio and God willing we wont see any more diseases other than the diseases we are already experiencing. I hope we will go back to our homes safe and sound, said Gaza mother Afnan Al-Muqayyad. Polio was just one of many of Al-Muqayyads concerns. Skin diseases are widespread, there are no detergents, detergents are very expensive and we cant afford them. Also, the food is very expensive, everything is expensive, and the childrens weight is dropping, they were fine before but now theyre becoming very thin. I hope God will set things straight, she said. COMPLEX CAMPAIGN Juliette Touma, communications director of UNRWA, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency, said the vaccination campaign was massive and one of the most complex in the world. Today is test time for parties to the conflict to respect these area pauses to allow the UNRWA teams and other medical workers to reach children with these very precious two drops. Its a race against time, Touma told Reuters. Israel and Hamas, who have so far failed to conclude a deal that would end the war, said they would cooperate to allow the campaign to succeed. WHO officials say at least 90 of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by the war. Children continue to be exposed, it knows no borders, checkpoints or lines of fighting. Every child must be vaccinated in Gaza and Israel to curb the risks of this vicious disease spreading, said Touma. Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued to battle Hamas-led militants in several areas across the Palestinian enclave. Residents said Israeli army troops blew up several houses in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, while tanks continued to operate in the northern Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun. On Sunday, Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in southern Gaza where they were apparently killed not long before Israeli troops reached them, the military said. The war was triggered after Hamas militants on Oct. 7 stormed into southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages by Israeli tallies. Since then, at least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Gaza, the enclaves health ministry says. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka Ports Authority reports 1.54 million TEU handled amid regional competition",
        "date": "September 1, 2024 07:07 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has addressed recent concerns regarding a perceived decline in transshipment volumes at the Port of Colombo, which some attribute to the expansion of regional ports in India. While these regional ports are often viewed as competitors, the SLPA emphasizes the importance of collaboration within the industry. The authority, along with all terminal operators at the Port of Colombo, acknowledges the benefits of neighboring port expansions, which can help meet the evolving demands of the market collectively. According to the SLPA, the fluctuations in transshipment volumes should be interpreted within the broader context of global supply and demand dynamics that impact ports worldwide. Seasonal changes, coupled with global economic and social factors, have led to a temporary decline in cargo handling, not just at the Port of Colombo but at various international ports as well. The SLPA clarified that this situation is not a result of increased competition but rather a common occurrence within the maritime industry. In a positive turn, the Colombo Port has shown impressive growth in container handling for 2024, indicating a significant improvement in operational performance. The SLPA reported a substantial increase in activity, handling 1.54 million TEU, which marks a 16 percent rise compared to the 1.32 million TEU processed during the same timeframe last year. Similarly, SAGT has also recorded growth, processing 1.28 million TEU in 2024, an increase from 1.16 million TEU in 2023, reflecting a 10.4 percent rise. The Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) noted a more modest growth rate of 5.0 percent, handling 2.20 million TEU this year, up from 2.09 million TEU in 2023. Overall, the Colombo Port experienced a growth of 9.6 percent, reaching a total of 5.02 million TEU in 2024, compared to 4.58 million TEU the previous year. In a recent incident, the SLPA successfully averted a potential disaster when a fire broke out on the container vessel MSC Capetown III, showcasing their commitment to safety and operational integrity. --Agencies",

        "date": "September 2, 2024 12:41 pm",
        "content": "As her 4-year-old son perused the Israeli museums ancient artifacts, Anna Geller looked away for just a moment. Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast. It was just a distraction of a second, said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. And the next thing I know, its a very big boom boom behind me. The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C. What could be considered every parents worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators. Alex Geller said Ariel  the youngest of his three children  is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, please let that not be my child was the first thought that raced through his head. Im embarrassed, said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. He told me he just wanted to see what was inside. The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museums vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbal Rivlin, the director of the museum. She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers  who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week  felt welcome to return. Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israels border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said. There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was in complete shock. He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage. But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasnt vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit, Alex Geller said. Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week. Thats whats actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how theyre restoring it, and all the technology theyre using there, Alex Geller said. Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together. Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology. I like that people touch. Dont break, but to touch things, its important, he said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "September 2, 2024 04:25 pm",
        "content": "Massive protests swept Israel on Sunday following the death of six hostages in Gaza as frustration mounted over the failure of the countrys leadership to secure a ceasefire deal that would free Israeli captives. Crowds estimated by Israeli media to number up to 500,000 strong demonstrated in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities, demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do more to bring home the remaining 101 hostages, about of a third of whom Israeli officials estimate have died. In Jerusalem, protesters blocked streets and demonstrated outside the prime ministers residence. Aerial footage showed Tel Avivs main highway filled with protesters holding flags with pictures of the slain hostages. Israeli television footage showed police directing water canons at demonstrators who had blocked roads. Local media reported 29 arrests. Labour leaders called a one-day general strike on Monday. The Israeli military announced the recovery of the bodies from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, as a polio vaccination campaign began in the war-shattered Palestinian territory and violence flared in the occupied West Bank. The bodies of hostages Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino were returned to Israel, military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters. A forensic examination determined they were murdered by Hamas terrorists in a number of shots at close range 48-72 hours previously, an Israeli health ministry spokesperson said. Netanyahu, who faces growing calls to end nearly 11 months of war with a deal for a ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages, said Israel would not rest until it caught those responsible. Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal, he said. Senior Hamas officials said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a ceasefire agreement, was to blame for the deaths. Netanyahu is responsible for the killing of Israeli prisoners, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. The Israelis should choose between Netanyahu and the deal. Israels assault on Gaza began after Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages in attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israels offensive has levelled much of the enclave of 2.3 million people, and the Gaza health ministry says at least 40,738 Palestinians have been killed. Displaced people are living in dire conditions with inadequate shelter and a hunger crisis. HAMAS WILL PAY, BIDEN SAYS Amid mounting public anger, the head of Israels trades union federation, Arnon Bar-David, on Sunday called for a general strike on Monday to pressure the government into signing a deal, and said Ben Gurion airport, Israels main air transport hub, would be closed from 8 a.m. (0500 GMT). Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who has clashed frequently with Netanyahu, also called for an agreement, and opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid urged people to join the demonstration in Tel Aviv. In a last-ditch bid to stop the demonstrations, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hardline member of Israels security cabinet, asked the attorney general to prohibit the strike. The Hostage Families Forum called on Netanyahu to take responsibility and explain what was holding up an agreement. The six hostages brought home on Sunday were all murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity. The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages, it said. Netanyahus office said he had spoken to the family of Lobanov, whose body was among those recovered, apologising and expressing deep sorrow. But the family of Gat said they refused to speak to the prime minister and instead called on Israelis to join protests. Take to the streets and shut down the country until everyone returns. They can still be saved, Gats cousin, Gil Dickmann, wrote on X. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was devastated and outraged by the death of 23-year-old Israeli American Goldberg-Polin and the other hostages. Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages, he said in a statement. Speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, he said he was still optimistic about a ceasefire deal. Months of stop-start negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have so far failed to secure a deal, despite increased U.S. pressure and repeated trips by top officials to the region. Speaking to Al-Jazeera television, chief Hamas negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya, based in Qatar, on Sunday reaffirmed the group would not sign an agreement unless Israel fully withdrew from Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, issues that have been sticking points in the talks. POLIO VACCINATIONS Israel and Hamas agreed to pause fighting in areas of Gaza for at least eight hours daily from Sunday to Tuesday to begin vaccinating 640,000 children against polio. Children, escorted by family members, crowded a UN clinic in the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, according to Palestinian officials. The territorys health ministry said at least 72,611 children were vaccinated the first day. The campaign comes after the confirmation last month that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. Israeli forces continued to battle Hamas-led militants in several parts of Gaza, with the Israeli military targeting what it said was a Hamas command centre in a former school in Gaza City. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said 11 people had died and medics said many others had been wounded. In Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike killed two Palestinians and wounded 10 others, according to medics, bringing the days total death toll in Gaza to 27. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 2, 2024 07:10 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli court ordered strikers back to work by Monday afternoon, as dozens of protesters continued to take to the streets to call out the failure to return hostages held in Gaza. The Bat Yam Labor Court ordered the general strike to shut down by 2:30 p.m. local time  three and a half hours earlier than the Histadrut Labor Federation planned to end it, the Times of Israel reported. The strike went into effect over the weekend, after the bodies of six hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7 were found in the Gaza Strip. Autopsies revealed that the hostages  including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg Polin  were alive as recently as 72 to 48 hours before they were found. They had all been shot multiple times at close range. Protesters and the families of the hostages insisted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government should have guaranteed the hostages were returned alive as part of a deal with the terror group. Histadrut Labor Federation chair Arnon Bar-David said he respected the courts decision to end the strike, the Times of Israel said. It is important to emphasize that the solidarity strike was a significant measure and I stand behind it. Despite the attempts to paint solidarity as political, hundreds of thousands of citizens voted with their feet, he noted. I thank every one of you  you proved that the fate of the hostages is not right-wing or left-wing, there is only life or death, and we wont allow life to be abandoned. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the loved ones of the Oct. 7 hostages, encouraged the public to continue to protest despite the ruling. This is not about a strike, this is about rescuing the 101 hostages that were abandoned by Netanyahu with the cabinet decision last Thursday, they wrote. Last week, Israels ministers voted to support the IDFs ongoing presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, or the narrow strip of land along the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Netanyahu reportedly told Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday that he was prioritizing maintaining Israeli troops in the corridor over saving the remaining hostages, according to the Times of Israel. The significance of this is that Hamas wont agree to it, so there wont be an agreement and there wont be any hostages released, Gallant responded to a series of IDF maps outlining their positions along the border, according to a transcript that was leaked to Channel 12. After a tense back-and-forth, Gallant told the ministers that their vote on the maps gave Israel two possibilities. Either keeping the IDF deployed on the Philadelphi Corridor or bringing home the hostages  you are deciding to stay on the Philadelphi Corridor. Does this seem logical to you? he demanded. There are living (hostages) there! he added. Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer cautioned Gallant that the prime minister can do whatever he wants. The prime minister can indeed make all the decisions, and he can also decide to have all the hostages killed, Gallant snapped. Source: New York Post --Agencies",

        "date": "September 3, 2024 09:31 am",
        "content": "The US has seized a plane belonging to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, claiming it was bought illegally for 13m (9.8m) and smuggled out of the country. According to the US justice department, the Falcon 900EX aircraft was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the US state of Florida. It is unclear how and when the plane ended up in the Dominican Republic. Tracking data showed it leaving La Isabela airport near the capital Santo Domingo on Monday, arriving at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida soon after. Venezuela has denounced the seizure, saying that it amounted to an act of piracy Foreign Minister Yván Gil said the US had justified itself with the coercive measures that they unilaterally and illegally impose around the world. In a statement, the Venezuelan government said it reserves the right to take any legal action to repair this damage to the nation. US officials said the plane was seized for suspected violations of US export control and sanctions laws. They added that an investigation found that people affiliated with Mr Maduro had allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the planes illegal purchase from a company based in Florida in late 2022 and early 2023. The aircraft was then illegally exported from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean in April 2023. The argument by US officials that the planes sale and export was in violation of US sanctions is unlikely to carry much weight with President Maduro, who has repeatedly accused the US of meddling in his countrys internal affairs. A spokesperson for the White House national security council said the action represented an important step to ensure that Maduro continues to feel the consequences from his misgovernance of Venezuela. Markenzy Lapointe, US attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said the Dominican Republic authorities had given the US government invaluable assistance in organising the seizure. It doesnt matter how fancy the private jet or how powerful the officials  we will work relentlessly with our partners here and across the globe to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside of the United States, said Matthew S Axelrod from the department of commerce - one of the federal agencies involved in the operation to recover the plane.

He took oaths before Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena following the commencement of the parliamentary proceedings at 9.30 a.m. today (03). On August 28 2024, the name of Karunarathna Paranawithana of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) was Gazetted by the Election Commission to fill the parliamentary seat which fell vacant by the resignation of Ratnapura District SJB MP Thalatha Athukorala. Paranawithana had previously served as Deputy Minister of Parliament Reforms and Mass Media and as the Deputy Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training. Prior to that he served as Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media before resigning to contest from the UNP-led alliance the UNFGG in the parliamentary polls in 2015. The Parliament on August 23 informed the Election Commission that a vacancy has been created in the House following the resignation of Thalatha Athukorala as a Member of Parliament. Accordingly, the Secretary General of the Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera had communicated to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing that the Member of Parliament representing the Ratnapura Constituency, Thalatha Athukorala has tendered her letter of resignation as a Member of Parliament with effect from the 21 August 2024 and thus a vacancy has been created following the resignation. This has been informed in terms of the Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. Thalatha Athukorala, who was elected to the Parliament representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in the 2020 general election, informed parliament on August 21 that she will be resigning from her position as a Member of Parliament. Athukorala, the sister of the late United National Party (UNP) politician Gamini Athukorala, first entered Parliament in 2004. She has been re-elected in subsequent general elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020 from the Ratnapura District. In the 2020 general election, she secured her seat in Parliament as a member of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) with 45,105 votes from the Ratnapura District.",

Digitalization should be initiated in the labor sector. We are going to implement it across every sector, he said. The Head of the State also discussed plans to increase opportunities for young Sri Lankans seeking employment abroad: In my view, we should encourage our youth to explore opportunities overseas and increase the number of groups going to foreign countries. I am already in talks with East Asian nations to expand such opportunities, he explained. He further outlined plans for a training initiative aimed at equipping young people with vocational skills for the global market.

        "title": "UK suspends certain arms export licences to Israel over humanitarian law concerns",
        "date": "September 3, 2024 10:56 am",
        "content": "Britain will immediately suspend 30 of its 350 arms export licences with Israel because there was a risk such equipment might be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law, foreign minister David Lammy said on Monday. Lammy said the decision to suspend the licences did not amount to a blanket ban or an arms embargo, but only involved those that could be used in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. We recognise, of course, Israels need to defend itself against security threats, but we are deeply worried by the methods that Israels employed, and by reports of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure particularly, Lammy told parliament. Soon after the Labour Party won an election in July, Lammy said he would update a review on arms sales to Britains ally Israel to ensure these complied with international law. It is with regret that I inform the House (of Commons, lower house of parliament) today the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law, Lammy said. British exports amount to less than 1 of the total arms Israel receives, and the minister said the suspension would not have a material impact on Israels security, and Britain continued to support its right to self-defence. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision was disappointing and sends a very problematic message to Islamist militant group Hamas and its patrons in Iran. Both Israeli and Palestinian leaders are being investigated for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies. The Israeli response in Gaza has killed more than 40,700 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Lammy said Mondays decision was not a judgment on whether Israel had breached international law or not. Israel and Palestinian leaders have dismissed allegations of war crimes. This is a forward looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt, and it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts, he said. According to information provided by government officials to Reuters and data from the Department for Business and Trades Export Control unit, the value of permits granted for the sale of military equipment to its ally fell by more than 95 to a 13-year low after the start of the war in Gaza. Many of the licences approved in the period after the start of the conflict were for items listed for commercial use or non-lethal items such as body armour, military helmets or all-wheel drive vehicles with ballistic protection. Despite winning a landslide victory in July, British Prime Minister Keir Starmers party did suffer significant setbacks in areas with large Muslim populations and he has been under pressure from some of his lawmakers to take a firmer line with Israel over the conflict. MILITARY COMPONENTS Among the items included under the arms export suspension will be components for military aircraft including fighter jets, helicopters and drones. But, parts for F-35 fighters will be exempted, except where going directly to Israel, as the government said it was not possible to suspend these without prejudicing the jets entire global programme. The governments statement today that it is suspending 30 arms export licences to Israel is a belated, but welcome move, finally acting upon the overwhelming evidence of Israeli war crimes in Gaza, said Sam Perlo-Freeman, Research Coordinator for Campaign Against Arms Trade said. But exempting parts for Israels F-35 is utterly outrageous and unjustifiable. Unlike the U.S., Britains government does not give arms directly to Israel but rather issues licences for companies to sell weapons, with input from lawyers on whether they complied with international law. Earlier this month, the United States approved the sale of 20 billion in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 3, 2024 11:13 am",
        "content": "In the years since the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912, we have become familiar with haunting images of the doomed passenger liners bow, lying at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now, new photos taken this summer show that the view has changed dramatically. The latest expedition by RMS Titanic Inc., an American company with salvage rights to the wreck, has revealed that a section of the previously intact railing around the front of the ships upper deck has fallen off. The 15-foot-long section now lies on the sea floor, directly below where it once was. We are saddened by this loss and the inevitable decay of the Ship and the debris, the company said in a statement on its website. Over the course of the next few weeks and months, we will conduct a more thorough review of Titanics condition and her changes over time, it continued. Although Titanics collapse is inevitable, this evidence strengthens our mission to preserve and document what we can before it is too late, it added. The July expedition, the companys ninth since it first visited the wreck 1987, involved ocean imaging experts, oceanographers, scientists and historians working together to capture new images of the wreck to review its condition, identify artefacts and areas at risk, and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts, according to the company. More than two million photos were taken, and the team searched for numerous artefacts. On the final day of the expedition, the team found and photographed a two-foot-tall bronze statue of Diana, the Roman goddess of nature and hunting. The statue, which once sat atop the fireplace mantle as a centrepiece in the Titanics First Class lounge, was ripped away and thrown into the wrecks debris field when the lounge tore open as the ship sank, according to the company. While the figure was photographed in a 1986 expedition, its location remained unknown until this latest expedition due to a tradition of secrecy surrounding the Titanics wreck, the company said. Much of the art that decorated the halls and rooms of the ship was made of organic materials, breaking down into the earth after many decades submerged in the hostile environment of the ocean, the company said Sunday in an Instagram post on the statue. However, Diana is still resting upright among miles of debris. Like the eternal Roman deities, she is timeless-and she is rediscovered thanks to Expedition 2024, it added. As scientists race to preserve its history, the legendary wreck is slowly perishing. In 2019, footage from a series of dives by an exploration team from Triton Submarines revealed the effects of salt corrosion, metal-eating bacteria and deep current action on the decomposition of the ship.

Addressing a public rally held in Homagama Dissanayake also expressed his conviction that the majority of Sri Lankans have already decided to elect him to the office of president at the forthcoming poll. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has splintered into several camps collapsed. Parliamentarians such as Dr. Bandula Gunawardana, Dinesh Gunawardena, Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Rohitha Abegunawardhana are with Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said. On the other hand, G. L. Peiris, Nalaka Godahewa and Dullas Alahapperuma have sided with Sajith Premadasa. There are a number of SLPP members who are supporting Namal Rajapaksa as well. Arjuna Ranatunga often said that people such as Thilanga Sumathipala should be removed from their positions in order to protect Sri Lanka cricket. In return, Thilanga Sumathipala claimed that Ranatunga is a jealous leader who doesnt want Sri Lanka to win a cricket world cup again. However, both of them were seen together at one of Sajith Premadasas election rallies. Not only that Patali Champika Ranawaka and Rishad Bathiudeen were seen together at another rally of Premadasa, Dissanayake added. Speaking further, the NPP presidential candidate said: What type of politics is this? From the beginning of their election campaign, they criticized the National Peoples Power. However, they never imagined that a situation such as this would arise. Theres a conflict between Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa. However, amid the support received by the NPP, some members of their camps are discussing the possibility of uniting in order to defeat the NPP. However, it is too late to do so now. The people of this country have already decided to vote for the NPP. In my opinion, no gambit plaid by Ranil Wickremesing or Sajith Premadasa, is capable of preventing our victory, he added.",

On September 10, Huaweis consumer group chief, Richard Yu, will announce a new product. He hinted on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform, that this product is something special, taking five years to develop. According to insiders, Huawei plans to introduce the worlds first smartphone that can fold twice. The company might also launch a new electric vehicle, although details could change. Apple is launching its new iPhone 16 and accessories on September 9. Huawei scheduling its event right after Apple suggests that it is ready to compete directly. Recently, Huawei made a strong comeback in the Chinese market with its Mate 60 series, pushing Apple out of the top five smartphone makers in the country. This new launch could be Huaweis way of challenging Apple even more. Whats special about Huaweis new phone? The new Huawei phone, possibly called the trifold, is expected to have two hinges, allowing it to fold twice. This would make it possible to have a large, tablet-sized screen in a device that still fits in your pocket. Huawei has been leading in foldable phone technology, and this new design could take it further. What else might Huawei announce? Huawei might also reveal a new version of its Aito M9 electric vehicle, featuring a five-seat layout instead of six. This SUV is a joint project between Huawei and the car company Seres. It will likely include advanced tech like Huaweis HarmonyOS, voice control, and facial recognition to start the vehicle. Huawei could also introduce new smartwatches, the Watch GT 5 and Watch D2, with updated hardware. Huawei has kept most details about its new products under wraps, leading to speculation that some of the products might still be in the prototype stage.

By launching innovative products like the trifold smartphone and the Aito M9, Huawei aims to strengthen its position in both the smartphone and electric vehicle markets.

        "date": "September 3, 2024 03:00 pm",
        "content": "A man found frozen in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977 has finally been identified, closing the book on a nearly 50-year-long mystery. The Berks County Coroners Office identified the remains of the missing man as Nicholas Paul Grubb, 27, from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. Surprisingly, advanced technology played no role in identifying the Pinnacle Man, a moniker inspired by the peak in the Appalachian Mountains near where Grubb was found. Instead, Berks County Coroner John Fielding told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that a Pennsylvania State Police detective discovered the missing link to the cold case the old-fashioned way, by digging through files. Hikers find Pinnacle Man On January 16, 1977, hikers found a mans frozen body in a cave just below the Pinnacle, in Albany Township, the Berks County Coroner said at the news conference. During the autopsy he was unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing or belongings, according to George Holmes, chief deputy coroner of Berks County. The cause of death, according to Holmes, was determined to be a drug-induced overdose. There were no signs of trauma to Grubbs body suggesting foul play, the coroners office said. Dental records and fingerprints were collected from the mans body during his autopsy, according to Holmes, who added that the fingerprints were misplaced. A break in the case More than 42 years passed before authorities revisited the cold case, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ, which reported Grubbs body was exhumed in 2019 after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois. Berks County forensic experts performed an exam in 2019, and DNA samples were taken to update his record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. But they did not match the two missing person cases, the coroners office said. Fast-forward to early August, when there was a major break in the cold case. Ian Keck of the Pennsylvania State Police found the lost fingerprint card from Grubbs 1977 autopsy. Keck submitted the fingerprint card to NamUs on August 12, according to Holmes, and within an hour an FBI fingerprint expert matched the Pinnacle Mans fingerprints to Grubbs. One of Grubbs family members was notified by the Berks County Coroners Office, who confirmed Grubbs identity. The family member asked the office to place his remains in the family plot. This identification brings a long awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible. It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work to provide answers, to bring closure and to give the unidentified a name and a story, Fielding said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

School safety, including overloaded school buses and poorly designed buildings, has long been a problem in China. In 2017, a dozen people, including 11 kindergarten pupils, were killed when a school bus crashed and burst into flames in a tunnel in the eastern Chinese city of Weihai, also in Shandong province. The driver, six Chinese children and five South Korean children were killed. It remains unclear whether the crash was deliberate or the result of unsafe driving. China has cracked down heavily on transportation dangers, adding training and vehicle inspections. China also has suffered numerous cases in recent years of attacks on school children, often using knives or homemade explosives. The suspects were generally found to be bearing grudges and seeking revenge over personal matters or against society more generally. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya-led alliances presidential candidate, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa says that a data-centric scientific approach should be implemented to strengthen Sri Lankas economy. He emphasized that it is essential to calculate the contribution of each district and regional level to the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In a meeting with the business community and experts held in Anuradhapura, Premadasa highlighted the economic disparities across the country. Economically, the country is largely divided. There is a wide gap between the rich and the poor, said the SJBs Presidential candidate. He further stated that some provinces are economically strengthened while others lag significantly behind. When we look at the numbers, we can be happy about the contribution of various provinces to the economic growth apart from the Western Province. If a leader needs to recover the countrys economy, that person should immediately order to measure the economic output of each district that is given to the countrys GDP, said Sajith Premadasa. He also stated that the data should then be refined further at the Divisional Secretariat level and if the calculations are done accurately and properly, the resources, problems and, deficiencies of those areas can be identified where it can be used to implement a scientific plan in a data-centric manner. Lets honestly think in a new way and go on a new journey, said Premadasa.",

You may remember that during the Yahapalana governance, the prices of tea leaves and pepper had fallen. Gotabayas government came and once again gave a strong price for tea leaves and pepper. That is the government of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, he said. He highlighted that Gotabaya Rajapaksas government prioritized local interests, which is a principle that their governments have always followed. Rajapaksa further stated that the objective is not to strengthen the economy of a re-exporter, or any other businessman, or a farmer in another country.

Seneviratne, along with other committee members. Chairman Udaya R. Seneviratne stated that the report was prepared in alignment with the conditions outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It was developed with the agreement of the Treasury and the approval of the Cabinet to ensure the necessary financial allocations. The expert committee on restructuring public sector salaries and allowances was appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on June 12, 2024, with the approval of the Cabinet. The committee comprises 10 members from both the public and private sector. The committee chaired by former Presidential Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne included several key members: Jude Nilukshan- Director General of the Department of National Budget, Hiransa Kalutanthri- Director General of the Department of Management Services, S.

Varnan Perera, Additional Secretary to the President. The final report, which was to be submitted within three months, presents an 18-point policy outlining the reforms to be implemented in the public service and the proposed salary increases. Speaking on the occasion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the committees recommendations would be implemented through the Ministry of Finance. He expressed his intention to increase the income of all as outlined in the reports recommendations. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; Following the last economic collapse, numerous measures were necessary to boost government revenue. During this challenging time, public sector employees faced significant burdens, yet they continued to perform their duties diligently. As a result, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country increased in 2023, leading to an improvement in the overall economic situation. With the funds acquired in 2023, we implemented Aswesuma program to assist low-income individuals. As the economy continued to develop in 2024, our focus shifted to restructuring public sector salaries and allowances. In line with this, the report prepared by Udaya R. Seneviratne and other committee members has been submitted. I intend to act on their recommendations and will forward the report to the Ministry of Finance for further review. This initiative is expected to raise incomes as suggested in the committees report. I extend my gratitude to Udaya R. Seneviratne and all the committee members for their work on this report. Chairman of Presidential Expert Committee, Udaya R. Seneviratne; An expert committee was appointed on June 12, 2024, with the approval of the Cabinet to oversee the restructuring of salaries and allowances in the public sector. This committee comprised 10 members from both the public and private sectors. We were instructed to submit the report within three months, and accordingly, the interim report was presented on August 12. In this report, we outlined an 18-point policy for implementing public service reforms and increasing salaries. Cabinet approval was granted on August 12, allowing us to prepare a comprehensive salary revision for the entire public service, including constitutional boards, corporations, universities, and all governmental departments. Notably, the basic salary increase ranges from 24 to 50-60, starting from a basic salary of Rs.30, 000, with the salary structure revised according to a ratio of 1 to 6. Accordingly, it was recommended to allocate 50 of the cost of living allowance to public servants and pensioners, ensuring the salary increase benefits nearly 1.5 million government employees and pensioners. We submitted the final committee report to the Honourable President a week before the three-month deadline, confirming significant relief for all government employees. These recommendations were made after securing the Treasurys agreement to allocate the necessary financial resources and were aligned with the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, there is no need for any doubts regarding this. With the Treasurys agreement and the approval of the Cabinet, the implementation is set to begin on January 1, 2025. Additionally, we have proposed several other amendments and reforms in the public service. If these reorganizations are properly executed in the coming years, they have the potential to create a highly efficient public service in the country, enabling the state machinery to significantly contribute to the nations economic development.",

Speaking at the Cabinet press conference held today (03), Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Bandula Gunawardena stated that it has been observed that over 900,000 voters who were included in the renewed 2024 voters list are at risk of losing the right to vote and the right for the candidacy as a result of the indefinite postponement of the 2023 LG Election. Furthermore, he highlighted that although all the citizens above 18 years of age should be allowed to exercise their right to vote as per the Article 4 of the Constitution, voters who were included into the voters list in 2024 will lose the opportunity to vote in an election in which the acceptance of nominations were concluded in January 2023. Additionally, the Cabinet Spokesman expressed that provision should be made for 25 youth representation in nominations submitted for local government bodies following the passing of Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No 30 of 2023, and that, however, this provision has also been overlooked as the relevant nominations were called in 2023. Thus, it has been decided to direct the legal draftsman to prepare a Local Authorities Elections (Special Provisions) Bill including necessary provision after consulting the Election Commission, in a manner that empowers the election regulatory body to recall the nominations for the aforesaid election and to hold the election based on the updated 2024 voters list, in order to address the said issues. However, the joint proposal submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers by Prime Minister as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils  Local Government and the Minister of Justice pertaining to the matter has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, subject to adoption at the next meeting.",

He added that he had ordered a full and prompt investigation into the circumstances of the attack. The Russian scum will definitely be held accountable for this strike, Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. He repeated his calls for more Western air defences and urged allies to allow their long-range weapons to be used for strikes deeper into Russian territory in order to protect Ukraine. We keep telling everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defence systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in a warehouse somewhere. Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not some time later. Unfortunately, every day of delay means loss of life. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "At least 12 people have drowned after a small boat carrying around 70 migrants capsized in the English Channel on Tuesday, just off the northern coast of France near Boulogne-sur-Mer, according to French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. Darmanin added a search and rescue mission was underway involving fire brigade and navy helicopters, several military vessels and two fishing boats. Local authorities said that several other people had been rescued but remain in serious condition, and warned that the death toll could yet rise. At least two people are still reported to be missing. Unfortunately, the bottom of the boat ripped open, said Olivier Barbarin, mayor of Le Portel, a suburb of Boulogne-sur- Mer, where a first-aid post was set up to treat victims. Barbarin had earlier put the death toll at 13. The boat had reportedly been attempting to cross from France to the United Kingdom when it was spotted in difficulty by a French vessel, the Minck, which had gone to its aid before it broke up, the Mincks captain Etienne Baggio told the AFP news agency. Sea temperatures in the area were around 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). Its a huge drama, said Mayor Barbarin of what is the most deadly single incident in the English Channel involving migrants this year. Some 25 people have already lost their lives attempting the crossing since January. Barbarin said that the towns out-of-use hoverport had been opened up for use by rescue helicopters. According to the local Voix du Nord newspaper, Interior Minister Darmanin is expected in Boulogne-sur-Mer this afternoon. All government services have been mobilized to find the missing and take care of the victims, Darmanin wrote on social media. I am on my way to meet elected officials and the emergency services.

        "date": "September 3, 2024 10:01 pm",
        "content": "Indias Congress party today said that protests in Kenya over Adani Groups proposed takeover of Nairobi airport is a matter of grave concern as it could turn into anger against India. The proposed takeover of Nairobi airport by the Adani Group has sparked widespread protests in Kenya. The Kenya Aviation Workers Union has called for a strike to protest. This is a matter of grave concern for India, as the non-biological prime ministers friendship with Adani is now world-famous. The ongoing protests there could easily turn into anger against India and the Indian government, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on social network X (formerly Twitter). Ramesh claimed that Adani Groups projects have created similar controversies in neighbouring Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as well in recent times with disastrous effects for Indian interests. In recent years, similar controversies over Adani Group projects in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have undermined our national interests. These controversies have had disastrous consequences for India. For example, the Bangladesh governments contract to buy power from Adanis coal plant in Jharkhand became the immediate flashpoint for protests that forced Prime Minister Sheikha Hasina to resign last month. Adanis renewable energy projects in Sri Lankas Mannar district were also mired in controversy and led to widespread protests against the Sri Lankan government in 2022, warned Ramesh. He further added, Historically, Indias soft power has been one of the greatest strengths of our foreign policy. Today, this strength has been undermined by the Prime Ministers collusion with the Adani Group. This is an unprecedented failure for India on the global stage. This is just one of the many sacrifices the country has made at the altar of the friendship of a non-biological Prime Minister. About 10,000 members of the Kenya Aviation Workers Union had initially planned to walk out August 19 over plans by the Kenyan government to strike an investment deal with Indias Adani Group to expand and operate Nairobis Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). However, the protest has been delayed several times for negotiations. The union has opposed the deal, saying it was an attempt to privatise the airport by stealth. Under the proposal, Adani would invest 1.85 billion to expand the airport in exchange for operating it for 30 years, according to AFP. Adani would add a second runway and upgrade the passenger terminal, according to airport operator Kenya Airport Authority (KAA). Kenyas government has defended the deal as a necessary measure to refurbish JKIA -- one of Africas busiest hubs -- which is often hit by power outages and leaking roofs. KAA said last month that the deal would be subjected to technical, financial and legal reviews alongside requisite due processes. Source: The Economic Times --Agencies",

        "content": "Lebanons controversial former central bank governor was detained Tuesday after being questioned in several corruption cases, according to three judicial officials. Salameh served a 30-year term as central bank governor beginning in 1993. Though he was widely celebrated for his role in Lebanons economic recovery after a 15-year civil war, Salameh left his post last year under a cloud, with several European countries probing his alleged financial crimes. He was blamed by many in Lebanon of being responsible for the countrys financial crisis since late 2019. Salameh has repeatedly denied allegations of corruption, embezzlement and illicit enrichment. He insists that his wealth comes from inherited properties, investments and his previous job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch. Salameh was questioned Tuesday by the top public prosecutor, Judge Jamal Hajjar, for over three hours, according to the three officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with the media. Salameh was interrogated over several financial matters, including a case in which he allegedly hired a company called Optimum to manipulate financial statements and conceal Lebanons haemorrhaging financial losses. The officials said that Lebanons Internal Security Forces transferred Salameh to a more secure prison but did not disclose further details. He is expected to remain in custody while he is interrogated. Hajjar is expected to file charges against Salameh in the next few days, after which his case will be transferred to an investigative judge. Salameh has been among the officials most blamed for policies that led to the countrys economic crisis, which has decimated the value of the Lebanese pound by around 90 against the U.S. dollar and sparked triple-digit inflation. The U.S., the U.K, and Canada have sanctioned Salameh and his close associates, and France issued an international arrest warrant against him, though Lebanon does not extradite citizens. France, Germany, and Luxembourg also are investigating Salameh and close associates over alleged illicit enrichment and the laundering of 330 million. Salameh has criticized the European investigation and said it was part of a media and political campaign make him a scapegoat. Lebanon has not appointed a new central bank governor, but a vice governor, Wassim Mansouri, has been named acting governor. The crisis-hit country has also been without a president for almost two years and is run by a caretaker Cabinet with limited functions. Source: AP --Agencies",

Fernando, who also serves as the State Minister of Urban Development and Housing, communicated this while addressing the House during todays Parliamentary session, a short while ago. Speaking in the Parliament, MP Fernando urged the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe to join together during the upcoming presidential race, if possible, in order to prevent the country from going into a situation which he claimed would be a point of destruction. Furthermore, Fernando added: Due to two rebellions in this country in 1971 and 1989, especially in 1989, over 60,000 young people had perished. This was the same in the north as well. When a group of beloved young people from the north were going to take the country to a place of destruction with the LTTE, there was a great massacre of young people. Now the target is again the youth. This is at a point where they have destroyed the minds of the youth through social media networks. From today onwards we will seeIf we cant win this Honorable Speaker I accept, victory or the defeat is the democracy...But if this country is going back to a destructive state, if they are talking about a huge protest movement or torching the parliamentWe cannot let that happen, he added.

        "date": "September 4, 2024 11:28 am",
        "content": "The National Peoples Power presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake reiterated that the conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are not unfavourable to the country. Joining a business community conference held in Colombo, Dissanayake reassured that an NPP government will uphold the current agreement with the IMF. Now all the international relations of the country including the bilateral and multi-lateral agreements have been placed inside the IMF basket. It means that the entire future program of the country is tied together with the International Monetary Fund, he said. Furthermore, Dissanayake said that at this time, if anyone is thinking of unilaterally withdrawing from the IMF program, it is an abdication of accountability to the citizen or to the country. Commenting further regarding the matter, the NPPs presidential candidate added: Therefore, we guarantee you that we have no hope of unilaterally withdrawing from the International Monetary Fund. But we have a number of parameters set by the International Monetary Fund that we have to fulfill. We should maintain primary account balance of 2.3 next year. By 2032, our debt ratio should be maintained at 98. We are given a number of parameters. They are not harmful to a country. Achieving them is not a bad thing. Its not a bad economic goal, no matter who gives it, he signed off. Last week, speaking to the Associated Press, Dissanayake had expressed that he plans to uphold the agreement with the IMF while his administration negotiates changes to ease the burden on the public. We cant come out from the existing IMF program because we entered into the IMF program only after the country was financially collapsed. We believe there could have been another alternative. But now all the bilateral and multi-lateral agreements have been placed inside the IMF basket, Dissanayake said. More attention should be paid to the hardships faced by the people when moving forward with the IMF program, he had said.",

        "title": "Do Americans have a better sense of smell than Europeans?",
        "date": "September 4, 2024 01:53 pm",
        "content": "The old cliché says its good to stop and smell the roses. If you believe a series of viral videos, you may appreciate them more if you grew up in the US. It started with an offhand comment about the weather from a friend of Harrison Szep, a 23-year-old UK migrant living in Florida. He said something along the lines of it smells like its about to rain, Szep says. It stopped him in his tracks. For me this was a first, hearing this. Friends and family back in Cleethorpes, England had never mentioned this supernatural ability. Szep jumped on TikTok looking for answers, and posted a video calling the idea that Americans can smell the rain ridiculous. The reaction was volcanic. It sparked a debate that stretched across more than 80,000 comments and dozens of videos from other users. This is true, user yvanabee said in a response video viewed over six million times. I noticed that my American friends were smelling more things than I was, like they were more in tune with the scents around them. The American nostril, she claimed, is more keyed into everything from the bouquet of fresh cut grass to the smells associated with different seasons. I call it scent culture. Countless people chimed in to argue these abilities are common all over the world, but ultimately, many agreed: Americans do smell better than Europeans (or, rather, their noses do). There are, of course, glaring problems with this theory. Chief among them is that many Europeans can indeed smell rain, fresh-cut grass and more. In fact, some of the earliest studies of petrichor, the scientific name for the smell of rain, were done by French and British chemists. Thats to say nothing of Europes rich history with perfume. But like so many debates on social media, theres a whiff of truth underpinning the conversation. Because your ability to smell does have a lot to do with who you are and where youre from. Theres a lot of variation in the human sense of smell, including peoples ability to detect certain odours, says Casey Trimmer, a research scientist who studies the olfactory system at DSM-Firmenich, a biotechnology company based in Switzerland that works in the fragrance business. Genetics plays a role, Trimmer says, but things like age, gender, and ancestry can also influence how we perceive certain odours, in addition to cultural and experiential differences. Trimmer and others say its possible, if unlikely, that some combination of these factors give Americans an olfactory boost. Smell (and taste) get less attention from the academic and medical communities than their sensory brethren hearing and sight. There has never been a study testing American sniffers against Europeans, according to Trimmer and several other olfactory researchers. However, there is some research which has shown some surprising differences in smelling abilities among different populations, both within and across cultures. Wake up and smell the gene pool Common knowledge holds that women have a stronger sense of smell than men, a fact supported by research. (However, theres little evidence to support the popular idea that pregnancy heightens your sense of smell, though it may make you more intolerant of certain odours.) But biological sex isnt the only genetic variable that affects smell. For example, some people have a genetic predisposition that makes them more sensitive to the scent of isovaleric acid, which has a distinct sweaty odour. By the same token, genetic differences make some people blind to certain smells, such as lyral, a chemical that smells of white flowers, or guaiacol, which smells smoky  both common perfume ingredients. We have a collection of more than 400 different receptors in our nose, but nobody has the same collection of receptors, says Julien Wen Hsieh, a rhinology and olfactology surgeon at the Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland. This explains in part why there is so much variation in the sense of smell in the population. Our ability to detect odours  and how strong or pleasant we find them  also depends on how those detectors work in our own individual noses. We smell a fragrance like violets when a chemical called beta-ionone binds to a detector known as OR5A1. But for about half of people, that detector simply doesnt work. Youll never be able to smell beta-ionone if youre one of them, no matter how much of it is sitting in a vial in front of you. When rain hits dry soil, it can release a compound called geosmin, which has an earthy odour thats a key component of the petrichor smell. Genetic variation can affect how people perceive earthy smells, Trimmer says, so its theoretically possible that DNA could make Americans better equipped to smell rain. But thats unlikely, as more than half of Americans have European ancestry. Their genetics, especially their olfactory genetics, are very similar, she says. Cultural aromas Genes arent the whole picture, though. Some of your smelling prowess depends on training. Sommeliers are better able to tell different smells apart than untrained amateurs. In fact, a study of sommelier students found that their olfactory bulbs  a ball of nerve cells used for smelling in the nasal cavity  literally grew bigger over the course of their year-and-a-half wine programme. Wine snobbery isnt the only way to expand your sniffing abilities though. It seems some of that training happens naturally depending on the language and culture that surrounds you. In English-speaking countries, people identify most smells by relating them to an object or a phenomenon: it smells like rain, for example. If we compare that to colours, thats like saying tomatoes are the colour of strawberries instead of calling them red. But that isnt true in some other cultures. The Jahai people, an Indigenous group from the Malay peninsula, have a long list of words for individual smells, similar to the rich vocabulary of words for colour in English. As you might expect, the Jahai are much better at identifying smells than English speakers. Some researchers believe that having the words to describe smells affects our ability to perceive them. The same is true for other senses: language changes how we experience the world. Russian, Greek and Turkish all have two different words for dark and light blue, for example. People immersed in these languages can pick out individual shades of blue that might look identical to people who speak languages like English, which has just one word for the colour. In fact, one study found that Greek speakers got worse at identifying different shades of blue after living in the UK. If you dont use it, you lose it, apparently. Language probably doesnt account for any would-be variations between the noses of Europeans and Americans, though, says Rachel Herz a neuroscientist at Brown University in the US who studies the psychological effects of smell. Linguistically, the comparison between Americans and Europeans is meaningless in this case, Herz says. The UK, for example, shares a common language with the US. British and American English use the same words for scent, she says, other than possible slang terms, of which Im unaware. And if anything, Id expect more of this kind of word play from Brits than Americans. Still, there are other reasons that cultures might have different olfactory skills. A 2014 study compared Cook Islanders, Europeans, and the Tsimané, an Indigenous people from the Bolivian rainforest. Cook Islands residents were significantly more sensitive to smells than the Tsimané, and both groups were significantly better at smelling than Europeans. Previously, researchers assumed that living a life thats more in tune with the land would improve your sense of smell. This study challenged that idea. Cook Island residents were the best sniffers, but the Cook Islands are as developed and industrialised as any country in Europe, while the Tsimané live off subsistence farming, hunting and foraging. Pollution may be the culprit, the researchers said. Air pollution can significantly damage your sense of smell. The authors note that the Cook Islands are in the Pacific region, one of the least polluted areas on Earth, while the air quality of the Bolivian rainforest is better than Europes. The relative levels of pollution followed the order of sniffing ability. Scents and sensibility Like most compelling scientific questions, theres no simple answer to why some populations smell better than others. Sensitivity to smells can vary even among populations that live in the exact same place. A 2012 study that looked at 391 New Yorkers, almost all of whom lived in Manhattan, found some surprising olfactory differences. Asians in the study had slightly more sensitive smelling abilities than Caucasians, and both groups had higher olfactory acuity than African Americans. These differences held up even when you accounted for gender, age, smoking habits and body type. What accounts for these differences? It could be genetics, culture or, theoretically, small variations in air quality across individual Manhattan neighbourhoods. Without more research, we can only speculate. Theres one fundamental problem underpinning the entire discussion, however. There is currently no universal test for olfaction, Hsieh says. Current tests are highly biased by cultural and genetic background, exclude many countries and cultures from having an effective test for olfaction and are adapted only for a handful of countries. Countries and cultures demonstrate wide differences in their familiarity with certain smells. Australians are probably more familiar (and therefore more sensitive) to the smell of eucalyptus than Canadians, for example. But according to Hsieh, existing smell tests dont account for that problem. He and other researchers are currently working on a universal olfaction test that utilises white smells. Like white noise, white smells would be equally unfamiliar no matter who is being tested, which would allow for more easily comparable test results. But until a such a test is established and researchers go out and use it, we wont be able to sniff out a truly satisfying answer to the American smell question. In the end, none of the potential influences on smelling are enough for Herz to believe that TikTok has noticed a real olfactory trend. Perhaps it just comes down to what people say out loud. Various individuals may verbally comment on smell more than others, Herz says. Overall, I am unaware and highly doubt that this behaviour is greater among Americans than Europeans.

        "date": "September 4, 2024 03:33 pm",
        "content": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba resigned on Wednesday, the highest-profile casualty so far of a major government reshuffle ordered by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at a crucial juncture in the 30-month war against Russia. After Zelenskiy, 43-year-old Kuleba was the best-known face of Ukraine overseas, meeting leaders around the world and lobbying for military and political support in fluent English. More resignations and appointments are expected over the coming days after five ministers stepped down on Tuesday, in what a senior Zelenskiy ally cast as the start of a government reset ahead of the cold autumn and winter seasons. Kulebas resignation letter was posted on Facebook by the speaker of parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk. Zelenskiy has said changes to the government were necessary to achieve the results required by Ukraine. Autumn will be extremely important for Ukraine. And our state institutions should be configured so that Ukraine achieves all the results that we need - for all of us, he said on Tuesday. Russian forces are advancing in the east of Ukraine while Ukrainian troops have made a bold incursion into Russias Kursk region. Moscow has intensified drone and missile attacks in recent weeks and Kyiv launched a mass drone attack on Russias energy infrastructure over the weekend. On Tuesday, at least 50 people, including soldiers, were killed by two missiles in the central Ukrainian town of Poltava in the deadliest single attack of the war this year. Later this month Zelenskiy travels to the United States, where he hopes to present a victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden, a key ally. The Kremlin said that government changes in Ukraine would not affect a peace negotiation process in any way, although such talks appear a distant prospect with the two warring parties far apart in their objectives. According to lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak, parliamentary committees will consider the resignations and then parliament will vote on them in what is usually a formality. The new appointments are likely to be approved as soon as Thursday. Zelenskiy is expected to nominate his candidate for a new foreign minister on Wednesday, with first deputy foreign minister Andrii Sybiha among the frontrunners. On Tuesday, Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin, Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna and the justice, environment and reintegration ministers stepped down. At least five portfolios have been vacant since ministers were fired or resigned earlier this year, including the important agriculture and infrastructure ministries. Opposition lawmaker Iryna Herashchenko said: Its a government without ministers ... an intellectual and personnel crisis that the authorities are closing their eyes to. She called for a government of national unity that would end the tight grip on the reins of power held by Zelenskiys political team. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed against the presidential pardon granted to former army officer Sunil Ratnayake, who was on the death row over the Mirusuvil massacre, has been fixed for consideration on January 15, 2025, by the Supreme Court. The petitions seek to invalidate the decision taken by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to pardon former army officer Sunil Ratnayake, who was convicted of the murder of 8 civilians at Mirusuvil in Jaffna in December 2000 and was sentenced to death in the year 2015. The relevant petitions were filed by the family members of the victims of the Mirusuvil massacre, the Centre for Policy Alternatives and the former Commissioner General of the Human Rights Council of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Ambika Satkunanathan. However, the court also granted time for the respondents of the petitions to file objections. On June 25, 2015, he was found guilty for the killing of 8 civilians in Mirusuvil and sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court. The murders occurred on 19 December, 2000 when eight internally displaced refugees returning to inspect their property were arrested in the village of Mirusuvil. They were subsequently murdered and buried in a mass grave, about 16 miles east of Jaffna town. The Attorney General had filed charges against 5 army soldiers in connection with the incident. When the case was taken up, the court sentenced Staff Sergeant Sunil Rathnayake to death as sufficient evidence had proven the allegations against him. However, the other 4 soldiers were acquitted as there was insufficient evidence to link them to the murders. In 2020, then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa pardoned and released Ratnayake.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has ruled that the Registrar General violated basic human rights and ordered the government to pay a total compensation of Rs. 3.3 million to the aggrieved petitioners. The Supreme Court has decided that the basic human rights of the assistant registrars working in the Registrar Generals Department were violated by indefinitely postponing their promotion examination. The verdict, announced by Supreme Court Justice Janak De Silva, with the concurrence of Judges Gamini Amarasekara and Shiran Gunaratne, stated that the failure of government authorities to make timely decisions can negatively impact peoples lives and reduce the effectiveness of the public service. The decision was given delivering the verdict over the fundamental rights petition filed by the Secretary of the All Ceylon Assistant Registrars Association of the Registrar Generals Department D. M. S. Dissanayake, along with 132 assistant registrars. The petitioners stated that they were appointed on July 11, 2005, as assistant registrars Grade III in the Registrar Generals Department. A promotion examination for advancement to the second grade of clerical assistant was scheduled to be held on February 2, 2013. However, based on an anonymous letter, the Registrar General postponed the examination indefinitely, which the petitioners argued was a violation of their basic human rights. The Supreme Court bench stated that the decision taken by the Registrar General to postpone the examination indefinitely without conducting a proper investigation into the anonymous letter was arbitrary and against the law. The court declared that the Registrar General has violated the basic human rights of the petitioners, and as a result ordered the government to pay Rs. 25,000 as compensation to each petitioner.",

        "content": "The Attorney General has informed the Supreme Court that the government is prepared to pay the salaries of government surveyors, subject to conditions. The payment of relevant salaries is temporarily suspended due to the trade union action launched by the Government Surveyors Association. Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Deputy Solicitor General Kanishka de Silva informed this to the court when a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by the government surveyors was taken up for hearing. The petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda and Priyantha Fernando on Tuesday (03). The petitioners had pointed out their fundamental rights have been violated through the governments action to suspend their July and August salaries citing the trade union action launched against the assigning of the survey departments projects to private surveyors. However, the Deputy Solicitor General stated that the petitioning surveyors have refused to sign off on the government projects and that the government is ready to pay the suspended salaries if they agree to sign the relevant projects. Appearing for the petitioning party, Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris mentioned that the petitioners are ready to sign the relevant projects, only if the government is ready to suspend the assigning of the survey departments projects to private surveyors. He further requested the court for a date to confirm the facts related to this petition. Accordingly, the Supreme Court judge bench ordered the petition to be recalled on October 13, for further consideration of the facts presented.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement detailing the procedures for the online authentication of birth, marriage and death certificates. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched online authentication process for birth, marriage and death certificates, in partnership with the Registrar Generals Department at a ceremony held on September 2, 2024 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. With the new online process, Sri Lankan citizens can apply for the authentication of their birth, marriage, and death certificates through the Consular Affairs Divisions online platform. The authenticated certificates will be sent to the applicant via email, eliminating the need for in-person application or collection of the authenticated documents, said Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The event was attended by Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, Foreign Affairs State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya, Acting Secretary Foreign Affairs Shanika Dissanayake, Registrar General Samantha Wijayasinghe, Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara, Director General of Consular Affairs Sisira Senavirathne, and other senior officials. In his remarks, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, emphasized the significance of digitizing document authentication services to enhance efficiency and effectiveness for the public. He noted that the Ministrys journey in online document authentication began with the launch of online verification for GCE OL and AL certificates in collaboration with the Department of Examinations, marking a major milestone in the digital transition. The Minister also highlighted that the introduction of online authentication for birth, marriage, and death certificates issued by the Registrar Generals Department, represents another key advancement in the digitalization process. It was also highlighted that educational certificates and birth, marriage, and death certificates together constitute approximately 55 percent of the documents authenticated daily by the Consular Affairs Division. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the Consular Affairs Division has taken further steps to enhance its online document authentication services by integrating its Electronic Document Authentication System (e-DAS) with other key government authorities and entities, which include local universities, Sri Lanka Medical Council, Sri Lanka Police, the Department of Motor Traffic, TVEC, Department of the Registrar of Companies, British Council, and trade chambers, thereby making document authentication services available to the public effectively. The procedures for online authentication of birth, marriage, and death certificates are as follows: Visit the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and submit an online application through the portal provided: https:mfa.gov.lkonline-consular-services Once the details are submitted, applicants will receive a link to make the required payments. The fees for certificate generation and authentication should be paid online through this link. After completing the transaction, the authenticated document (customer copy) will be emailed to the address provided by the applicant. The customer copy needs to be submitted to the relevant foreign missions as required.",

        "title": "Musks Starlink backtracks and says it will comply with judges order to block X in Brazil",
        "date": "September 4, 2024 07:33 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musks satellite-based internet service provider Starlink backtracked Tuesday and said it will comply with a Brazilian Supreme Court justices order to block the billionaires social media platform, X. Starlink said in a statement posted on X that it will heed Justice Alexandre de Moraes order despite him having frozen the companys assets. Previously, it informally told the telecommunications regulator that it would not comply until de Moraes reversed course. Regardless of the illegal treatment of Starlink in freezing our assets, we are complying with the order to block access to X in Brazil, the company statement said. We continue to pursue all legal avenues, as are others who agree that alexandres recent order violate the Brazilian constitution. De Moraes froze Starlinks accounts last week as a means to compel it to cover Xs fines that already exceeded 3 million, reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. Starlink filed an appeal, its law firm Veirano told the Associated Press on Aug. 30, but has declined to comment further in the days since. Days later, the justice ordered the suspension of X for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required in order to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action  particularly, in Xs case, the takedown of accounts. A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld the block on Monday, undermining efforts by Musk and his supporters to cast the justice as an authoritarian renegade intent on censoring political speech in Brazil. Had Starlink continued to disobey de Moraes by providing access, telecommunications regulator Anatel could eventually have seized equipment from Starlinks 23 ground stations that ensure the quality of its internet service, Arthur Coimbra, an Anatel board member, said on a video call from his office in Brasilia. Already some legal experts questioned de Moraes basis for freezing Starlinks accounts, given that its parent company SpaceX has no integration with X. Musk noted on X that the two companies have different shareholder structures. X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users  mostly far-right activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy and allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro  and has alleged that de Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to arrest. And Musk has been relentlessly posting in recent days, lambasting de Moraes as a criminal. This evil tyrant is a disgrace to judges robes, Musk wrote on X along with a photo of de Moraes some 17 hours before Starlink announced its decision to comply with the order. He hasnt posted about the companys operations in Brazil since its announcement. The reversal comes as a relief to those in Brazil who have come to depend on Starlink. The company has said it has more than 250,000 customers in the country, many of whom are in remote areas that wouldnt have fast internet access otherwise. Before Starlink, internet access in many of these areas came from slow, unstable fixed antennae. Its easy-to-install kits and high-quality connections have transformed communication in some communities, surpassing even major Amazonian cities in speed. The Forest People Connection project, founded in 2022 with Musk-donated Starlink terminals, has so far brought them to 1,014 remote communities, including riverine and Indigenous peoples. The Yanomami are among them. Living in a far-flung corner of Brazils rainforest, they had faced a severe health crisis, but now have access to Starlink-powered telemedicine consults and reliable communication for emergency transport of patients. Improved connectivity has also facilitated illegal activities, such as gold mining. While Brazils massive territory with vast rural and forested areas makes it a key growth market for Starlink, its presence isnt yet as large as Musk has led some to believe. On Sunday, he shared someone elses post that showed him meeting Bolsonaro in 2022 and noted that the duo claimed to have struck a partnership to bring Starlink to 19,000 schools. Musk touted the deal on X at the time. It never happened. As of March 2023, SpaceX and the communications ministry hadnt signed any contract, and only three terminals had been installed in Amazon schools for a 12-month trial period. The ministrys press office didnt immediately answer an AP request for updated information about these contracts on Tuesday. Brazils education ministry told the AP that states are responsible for signing contracts with internet service providers. Since January 2022, when Starlink began operations in Brazil, it has captured a 0.5 percent share of the internet market, trailing significantly behind leading providers, according to Anatel. Although Starlink has retreated and says it will now block X, Musks bravado in recent days has boosted his hero status in the eyes of his fans, said Marietje Schaake, the international policy director at Stanford University Cyber Policy Center. The battle of the titans, between de Moraes and Musk, reminds us of how powerful, political and provocative tech leaders have become, said Schaake, who is also author of the forthcoming book The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley. Brazil wont be that last country to seek accountability or to put up guardrails. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Pope Francis, in Muslim-majority Indonesia, warns against religious extremism",
        "date": "September 4, 2024 08:35 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis on Wednesday urged political leaders in Indonesia, the worlds most populous Muslim-majority country, to guard against religious extremism, which he said distorted peoples beliefs through deception and violence. On a packed first full day of his longest ever overseas journey that includes nine days in Southeast Asia, where Christians are a small minority, the pontiff also met local Catholics and asked them not to force their faith on others. In a speech to Indonesias political leaders, Francis said the Catholic Church would increase its efforts toward inter-religious dialogue in hopes of helping tamp down extremism. In this way, prejudices can be eliminated, and a climate of mutual respect and trust can grow, the 87-year-old pope said in an address at Jakartas presidential palace. This is indispensable for meeting common challenges, including that of countering extremism and intolerance, which through the distortion of religion attempt to impose their views by using deception and violence, said Francis. About 87 of Indonesias population of 280 million is Muslim. Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the countrys constitution. Though Indonesia has seen some instances of Islamist violence in recent years, including suicide bombings in 2021 and 2022 linked to an Islamic State-inspired group, religious extremism has been on a decline since a spate of high-profile attacks two decades ago that included the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. Indonesias president of 10 years, Joko Widodo, thanked Francis for his calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Indonesia appreciates the Vaticans attitude which continues to voice (and) call for peace, he said in his welcoming speech. Religion Manipulated Francis was greeted by crowds waving small Vatican and Indonesian flags as his car arrived at the presidential palace. Dorothea Dawai, 10, was among the group welcoming the pope. Wearing a green kebaya, a traditional Indonesian dress, she said she hoped to ask for a blessing. The pontiff, who suffers from knee and back pain, was in a wheelchair as he left his car and met the president outside the building. In his public remarks, Francis did not mention any specific violent incidents, but made several references to extremism, intolerance and manipulation of religion. There are times when faith in God is ... sadly manipulated to foment divisions and increase hatred instead of furthering peace, communion, dialogue, respect, cooperation and fraternity, said the pontiff. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Francis and Widodo had not spoken specifically about the Gaza war in their meeting, but more generally about ongoing conflicts and the importance of peace. Not Forcing Faith Francis later met local Catholics in Jakartas cathedral. An enthusiastic crowd of hundreds, including a small child dressed in a pope outfit, gathered outside to see him. Inside the church, children played the angklung, a traditional bamboo instrument, as they awaited Francis arrival. Sitting at the back of the cathedral under a Teak wood ceiling, the pope listened to brief testimonies from four Indonesian Catholics. One was from a nun who elicited a smile from Francis when she asked him to press Vatican officials to hurry Indonesian translations of Catholic texts. The pope peppered his prepared remarks with off-the-cuff additions and jokes. He praised Indonesias cultural diversity and told the Catholics that following the churchs teachings does not mean imposing our faith or placing it in opposition to that of others. The pope will leave Indonesia on Friday before heading to Papua New Guinea, then East Timor and Singapore and will have clocked nearly 33,000 km (21,000 miles) when he returns to Rome on Sept. 13. Francis has emphasised Catholic-Muslim dialogue and in 2019 was the first pope to visit the Arabian peninsula. On Thursday, he will join an inter-religious meeting at the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asias largest mosque. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The presidential candidate of Sarvajana Balaya alliance, Dilith Jayaweera says that the promises made by certain candidates to increase the salaries of the public service are improbable. Speaking at a press conference held today (04), Jayaweera pointed out that what he is proposing is a necessary program to uplift the public servants standard of living. Furthermore, he stated: The current president himself said two months ago that there is no way to pay the salaries. The same government that said there is no way to pay the salaries has increased the salaries by 25. This requires more than Rs. 2 billion. How can we have confidence in this? This is an insult to the knowledgeable public servants. Salaries should be increased in a logical manner, he added. Mr. Anura Kumara proposes to increase the salaries every six months. How will it be possible? Where will the money come from?, Jayaweera questioned. Meanwhile, he also expressed that this process must be carried out following proper discussions with the public sector employees. It should be a more intellectual discussion; the necessary subsidies, money, incentivesthey must be aimed at raising their standard of living, he said. We have suggested that government employees should be given incentives for efficient public service. Someone who works well should get more incentives. The statements made by these candidates are just complete promises. If you ask a child who has a rough understanding of Sri Lankas economy... who is studying economics for the Advanced Levels, he will say... this is not a promise that can be fulfilled.",

        "date": "September 5, 2024 09:18 am",
        "content": "A 14-year-old boy killed two fellow students and two teachers and wounded nine others in a shooting at a Georgia high school on Wednesday, jolting the United States with the first mass campus shooting since the start of the school year. The suspect, who had been interviewed by law enforcement last year over online threats about committing a school shooting, was taken into custody shortly after the shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, investigators said. He was identified as Colt Gray, 14, and will be charged and tried as an adult, Chris Hosey, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, told a press conference. Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said the gunman, armed with an AR platform style weapon, or semiautomatic rifle, was quickly confronted by deputies assigned to the school and that the suspect immediately got on the ground and surrendered. Once under arrest the suspect was speaking with investigators, who believe he was acting alone, but they declined to say if they knew what motivated him. Officials identified those killed as two 14-year-old students, Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, and two teachers, Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53. All nine of those hospitalized were expected to recover, Smith told reporters. Pure evil did what happened today, Smith said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation later issued a statement revealing that it had investigated online threats to commit a school shooting in 2023 and local law enforcement interviewed a 13-year-old subject and his father in nearby Jackson County. The statement did not identify the teen, but Georgia officials said the statement was in connection to the subject in custody. The father stated he had hunting guns in the house, but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them. The subject denied making the threats online. Jackson County alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the subject, the FBI said, adding that there was no probable cause to make an arrest. The shooting revived both the national debate about gun control and the outpouring of grief that follows in a country where such outbursts occur with some regularity. People in Winder, a city of 18,000 some 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Atlanta, gathered in a park for a prayer vigil later Wednesday night. Some leaned on each other or bowed their heads in prayer, while others lit candles to honor the dead. We are all hurting. Because when something affects one of us it affects us all, said Power Evans, a city councilman who addressed the gathering. I know that here tonight, all of are going to come together. Were going to love on one another. ... Were all family. Were all neighbors. Biden Calls For Gun Safety Legislation The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting and his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as we receive more information. Jill and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed, Biden said in a statement, calling on Republicans to work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party nominee for president, called the shooting a senseless tragedy. Weve gotta stop it. We have to end this epidemic of gun violence, Harris said at the start of a campaign event in New Hampshire. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, wrote on social media that Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA. These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster. Georgias Republican Governor Brian Kemp, asked at a press conference what could be done to prevent shootings, said, Today is not the day for politics or policy. Today is the day for an investigation, to mourn these precious Georgians that we have lost. The shooting was the first planned attack at a school this fall, said David Riedman, who runs the K-12 School Shooting Database. Apalachee students returned to school last month; many other students in the U.S. are returning this week. The U.S. has seen hundreds of shootings inside schools and colleges in the past two decades, with the deadliest resulting in over 30 deaths at Virginia Tech in 2007. The carnage has intensified the pitched debate over gun laws and the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment, which enshrines the right to keep and bear arms. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

If they are shouting on the stages sowing the seeds of hatred the same way as before; if they do not propose any strategy; if they say that the rest of the Vine Bridge Vel Paalama should go as they have been told before in the pastIf Lalkanta, Harini, Vijitha Herath and Sandunnetthi are all talking about doing the same old work in a different way but with more hatred than beforehow can people trust them?, he questioned.",

        "content": "A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed regarding the alleged harassment of the public during the Gota Go Gama protests in the Galle Face Green, where spiked barricades were placed on the roads around the Presidential Palace, has been fixed for hearing by the Supreme Court. The petition, filed by Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera, claims that the fundamental human rights of the public were violated through this act, since these roadblocks posed a danger to the people. The relevant petition was taken up by a three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda, and Priyantha Fernando. After reviewing the case, the court ordered that notice be issued to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Attorney General, who have been named as respondents in the petition, to appear before the court on March 04, 2025. The petitioner argues that the spiked barricades placed by the police during the protests posed significant risks to the public and has requested the Supreme Court to declare that the publics fundamental rights were violated through this act. Additionally, the petition seeks a compensation of Rs. 50 million for the affected individuals.",

        "date": "September 5, 2024 03:15 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas rising star Harshitha Samarawickrama has been joined by two of the most consistent performers from Ireland in being nominated for the ICC Womens Player of the Month award for August. Harshitha Samarawickrama (Sri Lanka) Samarawickrama continued her rise to stardom with some monster scores with the bat in August as the left-hander dominated against Ireland in both the ODI and T20I series. Fresh from an unbeaten 69 against India at the end of July, Samarawickrama improved her output upon arriving in Dublin as the registered scores of 86 and 65 from the two T20I matches to finish the two-match series as the leading run-scorer for both sides. If that wasnt enough, Samarawickrama then produced some even better numbers in the three-match ODI series against the Irish as she poured in scores of 19, 105 and 48 to again finish as the leading run-scorer in that series. Orla Prendergast (Ireland) While not quite able to match the run tally that Samarawickrama managed, Prendergast showcased her all-round talents during August with some impressive efforts in all facets of her game. Prendergast contributed 67 runs and two wickets from a pair of appearances during the T20I series against Sri Lanka, but it was in the opening match of the ODI series that the 22-year-old really shone. The 22-year-old collected figures of 325 with the new-ball and took a pair of catches to help restrict Sri Lanka to 2608 in Belfast, before producing a knock for the ages in reply to score 122 from just 107 deliveries in the three-wicket victory. It was no surprise that Prendergast was awarded the Player of the Match award for her efforts and she once again made valuable contributions with the ball during the remainder of the series to help Ireland register a 2-1 series triumph. Gaby Lewis (Ireland) It was in the shortest format that Lewis shone brightest during August, with the prodigious right-hander scoring the highest individual score for Ireland in T20I cricket. Lewis was in scintillating touch right from the outset of the second T20I of the series against Sri Lanka at Pembroke Cricket Club in Dublin, as she found the boundary from the opening over and went on to record a brilliant 119 from just 75 deliveries in a match-winning performance. The 23-year-old hit 17 boundaries and two massive sixes during her stay as Ireland amassed 1733 with the bat and that proved too much for Sri Lanka as the hosts held on to record the victory and tie the two-match series.",

        "content": "German police shot dead a man in an exchange of fire near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi history museum in Munich on Thursday, state Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. It was a male person and we know that he acted here with a long-barrelled gun, a Munich police spokesperson said. Due to the intervention of the police, the perpetrator was stopped and probably died at the scene, Herrmann told reporters. There were no indications of other suspects or incidents in the Bavarian state capital, Munich police said on X. The incident occurred on the anniversary of the 1972 attack at the Olympic Games in Munich in which Palestinian Black September gunmen murdered 11 Israeli athletes. The Israeli foreign ministry said the consulate was closed on Thursday for a commemoration of the Munich Olympics massacre and no one from the consulate staff was injured in the incident. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described it as a serious incident but declined to speculate on the circumstances and background to it. The protection of Israeli facilities has top priority, she said. The museum and research institute, which focuses on the history of Germanys 1933-45 Nazi regime, is located near the Israeli consulate in Munichs Maxvorstadt neighbourhood. Police had said earlier a large operation was underway in response to an incident and asked the public to avoid the area in a post on social media platform X.

        "content": "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested the former Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Anuradhapura Sanjeewa Mahanama, who allegedly assisted in the orchestrated shooting targeting the vehicle of former parliamentarian Uddika Premaratne. On June 14, Sri Lanka Police said that it was uncovered that the incident where several gunshots had been fired at the vehicle belonging to then-Anuradhapura District MP Uddika Premaratne, had been staged by the actor-turned-politician himself with the help of the Anuradhapura ASP. On September 17, 2023, it was initially reported that a group of unidentified gunmen had opened fire at Premaratnes car soon after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura at around 10:35 p.m. and that the parliamentarian had managed to escape unharmed. It was claimed that the perpetrators, who had arrived in a car, had targeted the parliamentarian who was walking towards the house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratnes car was damaged in the shooting incident for which the gunmen were believed to have used a pistol, it was reported. Anuradhapura police initiated investigations soon after the incident was reported and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were deployed to beef up the security near the MPs house. Later, investigations into the matter were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Later on 27 February 2024, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP resigned as a Member of Parliament, following which S.C. Muthukumarana of SLPP was appointed to fill the vacant MP seat. However, Premaratne was later reported to have travelled to Canada, seeking political asylum, which he refuted, and claimed that he was expecting a work visa in Canada. In 2020, the popular actor was announced as a candidate for the 2020 parliamentary election from the Anuradhapura District as a member of the Sri Lanka Peoples Freedom Alliance, a political alliance led by the SLPP formed in 2019. He obtained 133,550 votes and won a seat in the 16th Parliament of Sri Lanka.",

Speaking at a press conference today (05), Jayaweera suggested that a certain force is working to allow the countrys military to deteriorate without a proper audit on national security. Addressing the media, Jayaweera pointed out that the issue of diminishing military strength is mentioned in every major policy statement presented by the main presidential candidates. He criticized this approach, stating, I saw that there is such a thing in their manifestos. This has become a disease now. It means that the strength of the armed forces will be allowed to decrease naturally...The candidate has mentioned it in the manifesto in his own language  allowing to weaken naturally. I do not understand why theyre going after it. Jayaweera questioned the reasoning behind such policies, emphasizing the critical role of the military in safeguarding the nation. If the cost is too high, just cut the expenditure on politicians. He further accused political factions, including the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), of trying to weaken the armed forces. On what scientific basis are you talking about weakening the military? he questioned, adding that all these political forces and candidates have come under various influences. Today, we observe a silence of our Buddhist monks as well. The reason for that is the backlash from social media. This must be stopped. We must show our true power, he added.",
