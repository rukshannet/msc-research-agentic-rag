        "date": "November 3, 2023 12:00 pm",
        "content": "In a significant development, Sri Lanka is making notable strides towards combating climate change and transitioning into a green economy. Speaking at an international forum, President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, outlined the countrys ambitious plans for environmental sustainability and economic growth. The President made these remarks at the first International Climate Change Forum at Temple Trees yesterday (02). This conference ends today (03). President Wickremesinghe emphasized that Sri Lankas economic model would be built on competitiveness, digital transition, energy transition and the transformation to a green economy. He pointed out that the countrys small size could be advantageous, given its potential for excess green energy, including solar, wind power and hydrogen. However, Sri Lanka currently lacks the expertise to formulate detailed plans for this transition. To address this, the country is reaching out to multilateral development banks and bilateral partners to obtain the necessary knowledge and support. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe disclosed Sri Lankas intention to present a climate prosperity plan at COP 28, with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2040. This ambitious endeavour, while necessary for the planets well-being, comes with a substantial cost of over 100 billion USD over 20 years. To meet these financial challenges, Sri Lanka is committed to raising a significant portion of the required funds through commercial means. The president acknowledged the tough task ahead but expressed determination to become the first country in the region to achieve a green economy. In addition to these efforts, Sri Lanka is taking a proactive stance in addressing climate change on a global scale. President Wickremesinghe revealed plans to establish the International Climate Change University (ICCU), emphasizing that it should be an international stakeholder university rather than a solely Sri Lankan institution. The government has already allocated 600 acres overlooking the Kothmale reservoir for this purpose. Sri Lanka is also investing in building its capacity for climate finance, recognizing that the discussions on this topic primarily involve the northern hemisphere, multilateral organizations, and major players like China and India. The president stressed the need for the global south, including Sri Lanka, to develop expertise in climate finance, debt relief and related economic issues. Lastly, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of the upcoming COP 28, emphasizing the necessity of global cooperation to address climate change effectively. He urged for defining global goals on adaptation and phasing out fossil fuels, while also addressing compensation, funding and loss and damage. Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Senior Presidential Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff, delivered remarks during the event, conveying his appreciation for the invaluable support provided by the representatives of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank. Their assistance played a crucial role in ensuring the success of Sri Lankas inaugural international climate change conference. In addition, Mr. Ratnayake mentioned that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will lead the Sri Lankan delegation at the upcoming COP28 conference scheduled for this year. Mrs. Valerie Hickey, the Global Director for Environment at the World Bank, also spoke during the opening ceremony. Cabinet Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister of State Kanaka Herath, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Prime Ministers Secretary Anura Dissanayake, United Nations Development Program Resident Representative Azusa Kubota, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Head of Asia Region for Agriculture Dr. Purvi Mehta, Environment Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Ms. Aruni Wijewardena and special guests including ambassadors, high commissioners, ministry secretaries and government officials participated in this event.",

        "content": "The United States House of Representatives passed a Republican-led bill on Thursday (02 Nov.) which would provide 14.3 billion in aid to Israel, defying President Joe Bidens request to also include more money for Ukraine and other pressing issues. The bill was also passed despite Democrats insistence it has no future in the Senate while Biden had already promised to veto it. The measure passed 226 to 196, largely along party lines, also diverts funding from the US tax collection agency Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The vote also marks a shift from typical strong bipartisan congressional support for providing aid to Israel as 12 Democrats joined the 214 Republicans to vote in favour of the bill. Two Republicans and 194 Democrats voted against the measure. Why will the bill be rejected? The aid package for Israel is the first major legislative action under new Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was selected after weeks of chaos in the lower chamber of the US Congress. The bill also came as US lawmakers rushed to respond to the attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, which according to Israeli authorities has claimed the lives of 1,400 people. However, while Israel typically has strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, the bill combined aid for Israel with a cut to the IRS as well as left out Ukraine. Therefore, Biden had previously promised to veto it and Chuck Schumer, majority leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate said he would not bring it up for a vote. In order for a bill to become a law, it has to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by the US president. The House bill has sought to provide billions only for the Israeli military, which includes 4 billion for procurement of Israels Iron Dome and Davids Sling defence systems to counter short-range rockets fired at Israel by Hamas from Gaza. Israel also receives 3.8 billion per year in US military assistance as a part of a decade-long plan that began in 2016. The House bill would also add nearly 30 billion to the US budget deficit, currently estimated at 1.7 trillion, said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday. Bidens 106 billion request from Congress The US president has sought Congress approval of a broader 106 billion emergency spending package which would include funding for US border security and Israel, Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid. Biden has asked for 61 billion in military aid for Ukraine and 14 billion for Israel. The Senate majority leader has previously said that the upper chamber of the US Congress would consider a bipartisan bill addressing the broader priorities. Source - WION - Agencies",

        "title": "Lebanons militant Hezbollah leader threatens escalation with Israel",
        "date": "November 3, 2023 09:03 pm",
        "content": "Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Friday that his powerful militia is already engaged in unprecedent cross-border fighting with Israel along the Lebanon-Israel border and threatened a further escalation as the four-week-long Israel-Hamas war rages on. In televised remarks  Nasrallahs first since the beginning of the war sparked by the Palestinian militants deadly Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel  he stopped short of announcing his Lebanese militia would fully enter the conflict. Nasrallah also said that Hezbollah, an ally of Gazas militant Hamas rulers, is not deterred by U.S. warnings to stay out of the latest war. Referring to U.S. military deployment in the region, he said American warships in the Mediterranean Sea will not scare us. Hezbollah is prepared for all options, Nasrallah warned, and we can resort to them at any time. The fighting on the Lebanon-Israel border would not be limited to the scale seen until now, he added. His speech had been widely anticipated throughout the region as a sign of whether the Israel-Hamas conflict would spiral into a regional war, following weeks of limited exchanges between the Lebanese militant group and Israeli forces on the Lebanon-Israel border. Some say Im going to announce that we have entered the battle, Nasrallah said Friday. We already entered the battle on Oct. 8. He argued that Hezbollahs cross-border strikes have pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza. Celebratory gunshots rang out over Beirut as thousands packed into a square in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital to watch the speech broadcast via video-link on a massive screen. Nasrallahs address to supporters came a day after the most significant escalation in clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces on the Israel-Lebanon border since the war started  and on the same day as a visit to Israel by the top U.S. diplomat. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to urge protections for civilians in the fighting with Hamas, as Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City. Nasrallah praised the Hamas unprecedented incursion into Israel in which the militants attacked farming villages, towns and military posts, killing more than 1,400 people in Israel. This great, large-scale operation was purely the result of Palestinian planning and implementation, Nasrallah said, suggesting Hezbollah had no part in the attack. The great secrecy made this operation greatly successful. He also said that Oct. 7 had come as proof that Israel is weaker than a spiders web and that one month into the war, it allegedly has not been able to make any achievement. Nasrallah also criticized the strong U.S. backing of Israel in its bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians. While U.S. officials in recent days have pushed more publicly for protecting civilians in Gaza, they have yet to call for a cease-fire. The Hezbollah leader said President Joe Biden had made a fake argument that Hamas cut off childrens heads (without) evidence, but stayed silent for the thousands of children in Gaza who were decapitated and their limbs were torn apart by Israeli bombing. Hamas leaders have been pushing  sometimes publicly  for Hezbollah to widen its involvement in the Mideast war. Nasrallah met last week in Beirut with senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri and with Ziad Nakhaleh of the allied group Islamic Jihad. However, Hezbollah officials have avoided publicly setting a specific red line, saying vaguely that they would join the war if they see that Hamas is on the verge of defeat. So far, Hezbollah has taken calculated steps to keep Israels military busy on its border with Lebanon, but not to the extent of igniting an all-out war. The Israeli military said seven of their soldiers and one civilian had been killed on the northern border as of Friday. More than 50 Hezbollah fighters and 10 militants with allied groups, as well as 10 civilians, including a Reuters journalist, have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border. Israel considers the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite militant group its most serious immediate threat, estimating that Hezbollah has around 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, as well as drones and surface-to-air and surface-to-sea missiles. But a full-on conflict would also be costly for Hezbollah, which fought a 34-day war with Israel in 2006 that ended with a draw  but not before Israeli bombing reduced swaths of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beiruts southern suburbs to rubble. A new all-out war would also displace hundreds of thousands of Hezbollahs supporters and cause wide damage at a time when Lebanon is in the throes of a historic four-year economic meltdown.

        "date": "November 3, 2023 10:50 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, raising concerns about the proposed increase of the Value Added Tax (VAT) to 18, says the move could lead to a further decline in consumption. While recognizing the governments commitment to revenue enhancement in alignment with International Monetary Fund (IMF) obligations, the Ceylon Chamber said it is imperative to evaluate the broader economic ramifications of such a decision. The current economic landscape, characterized by escalating income taxes, elevated electricity tariffs, and rise in fuel prices, suggests that an additional VAT increment will further strain consumers purchasing power, the Ceylon Chamber noted in a statement issued today (Nov. 03). As consumer spending plays a pivotal role in our GDP growth, theres a significant risk that this tax increase could lead to a further decline in consumption. Household consumption expenditure growth has been contracting since the end of 2021. The Ceylon Chamber pointed out that at a time when Sri Lankas focus should be on reviving economic growth through reform measures, such hikes stands to inadvertently lead to further economic contraction, potentially offsetting the intended revenue gains. On that account, the Ceylon Chamber has recommended that the government explore alternative fiscal strategies, such as expenditure rationalization. By refining budgetary practices and reducing undue borrowing, a more balanced and sustainable fiscal path can be charted, the statement read further, adding that the pressing need to modernize the revenue collection mechanisms is evident. Challenges, such as the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) issuing tax default notices spanning several decades, highlight the inefficiencies of our current system. The Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) demands further enhancement for maximum efficacy. A thorough digital transformation, leveraging systems like RAMIS, is crucial for streamlining processes and optimizing revenue collection. The Ceylon Chamber assured that it remains committed to constructive dialogue with the government on these crucial matters, aiming to achieve a fiscal approach that ensures robust and sustainable economic growth for the entire nation.",

        "date": "November 3, 2023 11:52 pm",
        "content": "Addressing the gathering at the opening of the Courts complex in Welimada today (Nov. 03), President Ranil Wickremesinghe has drawn attention to the contrasting approaches of the international community when it comes to addressing human rights concerns in Sri Lanka and Gaza. The Head of State highlighted that both regions are facing significant human rights challenges, but the responses from the West appear to differ significantly. Referring to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, President Wickremesinghe emphasized that every country must adhere to this crucial document. He pointed out that when Hamas attacked Israel on October 07, the Sri Lankan government swiftly condemned the act, reaffirming their support for the principle of Palestinian statehood while denouncing terrorism. This condemnation, he noted, allowed for Israels right of retaliation within the framework of international laws and rules. However, the president expressed concern that such principles did not seem to apply universally. He noted that the killing of over 10,000 people in the Gaza Strip, according to UN agencies, raised questions about the justifiability of warfare within ones own country and the response of the international community. The Sri Lankan leader further pointed out that the West, including the USA, had passed resolutions against Sri Lanka for its human rights record. He questioned as to why there was a difference in the approach taken by these nations towards Sri Lanka and Gaza, where similar issues were prevalent. He stressed that the same rules should apply to both regions. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that, according to international law, measures taken to combat terrorism must fully comply with states obligations under international human rights law, including the protection of fundamental freedoms. He questioned the inconsistency in the application of these principles. Additionally, he expressed concerns about the human rights impact of the economic crisis in Gaza, where food insecurity, fuel shortages, lack of essential medicines and reductions in household incomes were more severe than what Sri Lanka faced last year. President Wickremesinghe concluded by underlining the importance of addressing the grievances and demands of the Tamil and Muslim populations, calling for measures to combat marginalization and discrimination. He questioned the differing standards applied by the West to Sri Lanka and Gaza and suggested that clean hands should be a universal requirement in international matters. The Presidents remarks highlight a pressing issue: the need for consistency and fairness in the international approach to human rights issues, regardless of the region in question.",

        "date": "November 4, 2023 06:19 am",
        "content": "At least 69 people were killed and dozens injured in Nepal on Friday when a strong earthquake struck the western area of Jajarkot, with witnesses saying houses in the area collapsed and buildings as far as New Delhi, India, shook. Nepals National Seismological Centre said the quake was a magnitude 6.4 but the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) later downgraded the magnitude to 5.7 and the U.S. Geological Survey pegged it as a magnitude 5.6. Local officials said it had not been possible to establish contact in the area near the epicenter in Jajarkot, a hilly district with a population of 190,000 and villages scattered in remote hills. Jajarkot local official Harish Chandra Sharma said at least 34 people had been killed in his district while in neighbouring Rukum West district, police official Namaraj Bhattarai said at least 35 deaths had been reported. Rescue and search teams have to clear roads blocked by dry landslides due to the earthquake to reach the affected areas, Bhattarai said. Ramidanda, where the epicentre lies, has not been reached by authorities yet. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed deep sorrow at the loss of life and property in the quake and ordered security agencies to launch immediate rescue and relief operations, in a post on social media X, formerly known as Twitter. At least 20 people were rushed to hospital with injuries, Jajarkot district official Suresh Sunar told Reuters by phone. I am out in the open myself. We are collecting details but due to cold and night it is difficult to get information from remote areas, he told Reuters. Nepals National Seismological Centre said the quake occurred at 11:47 p.m. (1802 GMT) in Jajarkot district of Karnali province. Jajarkot is about 500 km (310 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. Local media footage showed crumbled facades of multi-storied brick houses, with large pieces of furniture scattered. Tremors were felt in neighbouring districts and as far away as Kathmandu, residents said. Houses have collapsed. People rushed out of their homes. I am out in the crowd of terrified residents. We are trying to find details of damages, police official Santosh Rokka told Reuters by phone. The earthquake shook buildings as far as New Delhi, about 600 km (375 miles) away, according to Reuters witnesses. Videos on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, showed people running into the street as some buildings were evacuated. In 2015, about 9,000 people were killed in two earthquakes in Nepal. Whole towns, centuries-old temples and other historic sites were reduced to rubble, with more than a million houses destroyed, at a cost to the economy of 6 billion. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Feud grows as Sports Minister asks SLC and Selection Committee to resign",
        "date": "November 4, 2023 07:54 am",
        "content": "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has urged the Executive Committee (ExCo) of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the Selection Committee to step down from their positions or face drastic action, in light of the Lions crushing defeat to India by a massive 302 runs in the ODI 33 of the ongoing ICC Mens Cricket World Cup. In a press release, the lawmaker said the cricket boards ExCo and the Selection Committee should bear the responsibility for the recent defeats the national team has faced. His remarks followed SLC President Shammi Silvas letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe about the challenging situation that the national cricket board is currently facing, alleging that the day-to-day operations and professional conduct of the cricket board are being greatly affected due to what he said a deliberate harassment from the Sports Ministry. Silva said this interference and continuous condemnation with false accusations about the SLC and its officials are negatively affecting the administrative progress and sought President Wickremesinghes immediate intervention to address the following unresolved issues and ensure that SLC can function independently and efficiently to fulfill all of its responsibilities: The cricket boards chairman also alleged that there was a lack of response from the Sports Ministry, despite the initial communication on August 03, 2023, about securing hosting rights for the ICC World Cup under 19 in Jan 2024. He said this situation indeed is critical and it poses a serious concern for obtaining the necessary governmental support and clearance for this major event, which also promises significant benefits to the country. It is imperative that the Sports Ministry show a sense of urgency and initiate continuous communication in relation to obtaining all necessary clearances and guarantee the effective and successful organization of the upcoming tournament in Sri Lanka, Silvas letter read further. SLC President said he has to attend the ICC meeting on November 17 and give an update on the actual position of the countrys status and the progress made thus far. He further claimed that there was a delay in response from the Sports Ministry regarding the proposed Lanka T-10 Super League, a fast-growing new format of cricket. Despite discussions initially held and a detailed report being submitted as early as mid-2022 and also reminders with additional information were presented on August 18, 2023. Due to the lack of correspondence and support from the ministry, the relevant clearances have been put on hold which invariably delays the progress and planning of the inauguration of the cricket carnival, scheduled to be held from December 10 onwards. Silva also raised concerns about other issues such as SLC ExCo representation and rejection of Japanese opportunities, the participation in Mens ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, the Sri Lanka tour of New Zealand and the Asia Cup Championship 2022. The cricket boards chairman urged the Head of State to look into these critical matters. Meanwhile, the Sports Minister, in a letter addressed to President Wickremesinghe on Friday (Nov, 03), vehemently denied any political interference and stated that the conduct of the SLC has been deplorable in light of the grave allegations and corruption charges levelled against them. Ranasinghe said the allegations made by the SLC chief in his November 02 letter are baseless and false, stressing that all cricket-related activities under the Sports Ministry are supervised by the National Sports Council and the Director General of Sports. As far as I know, the authorities concerned have not approved certain requests made by the Sri Lanka Cricket. They have deemed those requests unproductive and involve a questionable amount of expenditure, which would not be beneficial for the growth of cricket in Sri Lanka. Ranasinghe urged President Wickremesinghe to heed the Auditor Generals report tabled in the parliament on September 19, 2023, as it contains vital information that demands immediate attention. He said the report has made startling revelations of grave corruption, financial misconducts, and irregular procurement activities carried out by the SLC. The document has further recommended initiating legal proceedings against the concerned parties, the sports minister said adding that he has forwarded the report to the necessary parties for due action. He said there are many more controversies and allegations involving the SLC that have led to tarnishing the name of the sport and the country altogether. The sports minister raised concerns about the cricket boards incumbent chairman, saying that he has made choices that have faced allegations of involvement in match-fixing schemes, and there has been a public backlash against SLCs perceived promotion of a betting and gambling culture. The organizations decision to allow such entities to participate in the Lanka Premier League has been met with criticism as betting and gambling is a strictly restrained business while promoting related activities is illegal by several acts of parliament. He also took notice of the fact that the LPL has not brought in any foreign exchange nor any tourists to Sri Lanka and that scheduling the 4th edition of the T20 franchise tournament so close to the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup only resulted in the national teams key players being unable to perform in the most important fixture in the worlds cricketing calendar. The sports minister, with regard to SLCs repeated communications to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to complain of political interference, said this was a deliberate move aimed at preventing any action against them for their corrupt conduct. He said the cricket governing body has been trying to bring pressure from the ICC by threatening the suspension of SLC. I want to bring this grave matter to your attention as this set a bad precedent in Sri Lankan sports, and I call this act a treacherous act against the state and the people of Sri Lanka. Ranasinghe went on to reiterate that, during his tenure as the sports minister, he has never interfered with the operations of SLC and that he has always given his support in every possible manner. However, I am not prepared to stay silent nor be influenced by various political plots and stay put on the apparent corruption in the institutes that are directly accountable to my ministry. Meanwhile, the SLC has called for an urgent and comprehensive explanation from the entire coaching staff and selectors after India demolished the Lions in Mumbai on Thursday (Nov. 02). The cricket board said it understands that losses are a part of sports, but the recent defeats have been particularly disheartening. The SLC said it aims to open a constructive dialogue to identify areas for improvement and ensure a more competitive showing in future matches. The SLC further noted that it expects a prompt and comprehensive response from the coaching staff demonstrating a strong commitment to enhance the teams performance in the remaining matches of the World Cup 2023 and future competitions.",

        "date": "November 4, 2023 08:26 am",
        "content": "State Minister for Higher Education, Suren Raghavan, announced a substantial allocation of funds for the education sector in the year 2024, highlighting the governments commitment to enhancing the quality and accessibility of education in Sri Lanka. As such, a total of Rs. 255 billion will be allocated for primary and secondary education, signifying a pivotal investment in the foundational stages of learning. In addition, a significant allocation of Rs. 210 billion has been earmarked for higher education, further underscoring the nations dedication to fostering advanced learning and research.

Moreover, to empower citizens and provide greater educational freedom, starting in 2025, the entire government investment in education will be granted directly as scholarships to government university graduates, the state minister said further. This empowering initiative is expected to allow students the flexibility to choose the University of their preference, aligning with President Ranil Wickremesinghes vision for transformative changes in the nations public universities. The state minister pointed out that the transformation of Sri Lankas learning and teaching systems is an imperative goal. The significant allocation of Rs. 255 billion for primary and secondary education in 2024 and an additional Rs. 210 billion for higher education reaffirms the governments dedication to fostering a more inclusive, accessible and advanced education system, he said further.

Three militants were killed before they entered the base and the other three had been cornered, the military said in a statement, adding that three grounded aircraft and a fuel tanker had been damaged thus far in the attack. Due to the swift and effective response by the troops, (the attack) has been foiled and thwarted, ensuring the safety and security of personnel and assets, the statement said. The military said an operation is underway to clear the area, and did not mention any casualties amongst security personnel. Islamist militant group Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP) claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement sent to journalists by its spokesperson.

On Friday (Nov. 03), Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe urged the Executive Committee (ExCo) of the cricket governing body and the Selection Committee to step down from their positions or face drastic action over the teams consecutive defeats. In a press release, the lawmaker said the cricket boards ExCo and the Selection Committee should bear the responsibility for the recent defeats the national team has faced.

Sri Lanka was totaled out for a paltry score of 55 runs, making it the second successive lowest score against India after the islanders were bowled out for 50 in the Asia Cup final, in the run-up to the World Cup. The cricket board said it understands that losses are a part of sports, but the recent defeats have been particularly disheartening. The SLC said it aims to open a constructive dialogue to identify areas for improvement and ensure a more competitive showing in future matches. The SLC further noted that it expects a prompt and comprehensive response from the coaching staff demonstrating a strong commitment to enhance the teams performance in the remaining matches of the World Cup 2023 and future competitions.",

        "date": "November 4, 2023 11:55 am",
        "content": "At least 128 people were killed and dozens were injured in Nepal when a strong earthquake struck the western area of Jajarkot, officials said on Saturday, as houses in the area collapsed and buildings as far as New Delhi in neighbouring India shook. The quake occurred at 11:47 p.m. (18:02 GMT) on Friday with a magnitude 6.4, Nepals National Seismological Centre said. The German Research Centre for Geosciences measured the quake at 5.7, downgrading it from 6.2, while the U.S. Geological Survey pegged it at 5.6. The quake is the deadliest since 2015 when about 9,000 people were killed in two earthquakes in the Himalayan country. Whole towns, centuries-old temples and other historic sites were reduced to rubble then, with more than a million houses destroyed, at a cost to the economy of 6 billion. Officials feared the death toll in Fridays quake could rise as they had not been able to establish contact in the hilly area near the epicentre, some 500km (300 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu, where tremors were also felt. The district has a population of 190,000 with villages scattered in remote hills. The number of injured could be in the hundreds and the deaths could go up as well, Jajarkot district official Harish Chandra Sharma told Reuters by phone. Police spokesman Kuber Kadayat said 92 people were killed in Jajarkot and 36 in neighbouring Rukum West district, both in Karnali province. The epicentre was in the village of Ramidanda. At least 85 people were injured in Rukum West and 55 in Jajarkot, an official in the prime ministers office said, while Sharma said at least 50 people were in hospitals in Jajarkot alone. Many houses have collapsed, many others have developed cracks. Thousands of residents spent the entire night in cold, open grounds because they were too scared to go in into the cracked houses as aftershocks struck, Sharma said. I have myself not been able to go in. Search and rescue must clear roads blocked by landslides, triggered by the earthquake, to reach the affected areas, police officer Namaraj Bhattarai said. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal flew to the area early on Saturday with a 16-member army medical team to oversee search, rescue and relief, his office said. Dahal, posting on the X social media platform, expressed deep sorrow at the loss of life and property in the quake and ordered security agencies to launch immediate rescue and relief operations. Local media footage showed crumbled facades of multi-storied brick houses, with large pieces of furniture scattered. Videos on X showed people running into the street as some buildings were evacuated. Houses have collapsed. People rushed out of their homes. I am out in the crowd of terrified residents. We are trying to find details of damage, police official Santosh Rokka said by phone. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "November 4, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "A bomb hidden in a parked motorcycle exploded near a police vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing at least five people and wounding 20 on Friday, police said. The explosion happened in Dera Ismail Khan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, police officer Gul Sher Khan said. The motorcycle was parked near a bus stop and the bomb was detonated remotely when a police bus carrying officers from the city to the nearby Takwara area passed by, Khan said. All of the dead were locals, and the explosion at the busy stop wounded both civilians and police constables, he said. A rescue official, Bilal Faizi, said the wounded were moved to a nearby hospital, where three of them were in serious condition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from any group, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who have stepped up attacks on security forces since 2022. Authorities say the insurgents have become emboldened while living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover of that country in 2021. Dera Ismail Khan is located near the former militant stronghold of South Waziristan, a former sanctuary for militants. Pakistans army carried out massive operations against militants in tribal regions along the Afghan border after an army-run school was attacked by militants killing more than 150 people, mostly school children, in 2014. The army years ago announced that it had cleared the region of local and foreign militants. Occasional attacks have continued, however, raising concerns that the local Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, are regrouping. The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group but are allies of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 as the U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout. Also on Friday, at least 14 soldiers were killed when the military convoy they were traveling in came under attack in the southwest Pakistani town of Pasni, in Baluchistan province. The militarys media wing said a clearing operation was being carried out in the area and the perpetrators of this heinous act will be hunted down (and) brought to justice.

        "content": "A day after the Bangladesh cricket team cancelled their training session in Delhi, Sri Lanka on Saturday also did the same due to dangerous air pollution in the national capital. The Sri Lanka management took the decision to skip the practice session, scheduled on Saturday afternoon, based on the advice from team doctors. Delhi residents continued to grapple with deteriorating air quality as a layer of haze engulfed the city for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday. The pollution levels in the national capital dipped marginally from 475 yesterday to 470 on Saturday. However, the concentration of PM was 2.5, which is 8 times more than the healthy limit prescribed by the World Health Organization. This severe pollution has prompted a ban on non-essential construction work, the closure of primary schools and restrictions on diesel, petrol vehicles operating in and around Delhi. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their ODI World Cup 2023 match at Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium in Delhi on Monday and ICC as well BCCI are monitoring the situation. The ICC and our hosts the BCCI take the well-being of all participants seriously and are monitoring the air quality in Delhi, they said. We are taking expert advice to assess the situation, an ICC spokesperson told ESPNcricinfo. It has been also learnt that the match officials will treat the air pollution just as they would the weather, in deciding whether conditions are fit for play or not on Monday. As per Indian government agencys Air Quality Tracking Warning system, the AQI was likely to be in the severe category on Saturday and remain so until Tuesday, November 7. Notably, many players in Sri Lankas World Cup squad have already experienced playing cricket in polluted Delhi air, when they took part in a Test match at this venue in late 2017. Back then, several players had come off the field to vomit in the dressing room, while others received on-field medical attention for respiratory problems. At least five Sri Lanka fielders had also come out to the field wearing masks. Earlier this week, India skipper Rohit Sharma had also reacted over the worsening air quality in Mumbai and elsewhere in the country, saying it is important to ensure that future generations can live without any fear in India. The BCCI had also said that it would not allow any fireworks displays for the remaining games in Mumbai and Delhi because of the poor air-quality in these two cities. Source: News24 --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Sports  Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe has individually written to all full member countries of the International Cricket Council (ICC) to inform them of the recent controversies concerning the national cricket board. In a media release issued today (Nov. 04), the Sports Ministry accused Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) of misleading the international cricket governing body by implying that it is plagued by political interference. In his letter, Ranasinghe emphasized that interim measures would have to be taken against SLC, assuring that this would be done only to establish good governance principles, to uphold the rule of law and to create a system of governance that promotes ethics and spirit of the game. He mentioned that cricket in Sri Lanka, since 2015, has seen a gradual degradation in the quality of the sport played both internationally and locally, noting that SLC has been besieged with complaints of player disciplinary issues, management corruption, financial misconduct, and match-fixing allegations. The lawmaker went on to say that due to the political crises and disasters, no action could be taken against the cricket board despite several ministers before him having initiated inquiries into the purported misconduct of SLC. Their probes resulted in several reports that substantiate the claims against the SLC officials, he added. However, recent revelations and audit reports published by the Auditor Generals Department, which is an independent government institute, warrants immediate intervention as the minister in charge to bring the perpetrators of financial crimes before the legal system and to establish good governance and transparency in the Sri Lanka Cricket administration, Ranasinghe said further. Ranasinghe also drew attention to the criticism that SLC has attracted for allegedly creating a betting-friendly environment, which devalues the ethics and spirit of the game. The local cricketing fixtures are now solely sponsored by betting companies and illegal cryptocurrency scams, which are banned and blacklisted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The minister expressed concerns about the mismanagement of SLC, saying that it has resulted in significant losses for the country. The team has been severely affected in all departments due to injuries sustained by a few of the main players in a cricket league held just a month before the World Cup, causing a major setback. Commenting on SLCs allegations about political interference on his part, Ranasinghe said he only inquired into the cricket boards financial misconduct. I want to stress the fact that neither myself nor any governmental authority has impinged on the operations of Sri Lanka Cricket in any aspect, the minister reiterated in his letter, alleging that the cricket board has made it a habit to hold the threat of suspension of ICC membership as a symbol of blackmail, threatening him not to act against their financial misconduct. The minister also took issue with the ICCs chairman Greg Barclay and CEO Geoff Allardice, who had demanded endorsement from SLC for the members he had appointed to the committee to look into the cricket board officials misconduct.

The embassy, noting that there are approximately 100 Sri Lankans currently residing in Nepal, mentioned that around 40 of them are students in Pokhara, while another 10 are students in Kathmandu. The remaining 30 to 40 individuals are professionals and their family members who work in international organisations and private entities in Kathmandu, it added.

These pilgrims usually spend a short period of time in Lumbini. However, the Sri Lankan Embassy mentioned that no foreign nationals were reported dead or injured during the earthquake. At least 150 people were reported dead and dozens injured in Nepal when a strong earthquake struck the western area of Jajarkot, officials said on Saturday, as houses in the area collapsed and buildings as far as New Delhi in neighbouring India shook.

        "date": "November 5, 2023 11:31 am",
        "content": "Police held back protesters outside the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, amid widespread anger at the failures that led to last months deadly attack by Hamas gunmen on communities around the Gaza Strip. Waving blue and white Israeli flags and chanting Jail now!, a crowd in the hundreds pushed through police barriers around Netanyahus residence in Jerusalem. The protest, which coincided with a poll showing more than three quarters of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign, underlined the growing public fury at their political and security leaders. Netanyahu has so far not accepted personal responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise assault which saw hundreds of Hamas gunmen storm into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 240 hostage. As the initial shock has faded, public anger has grown, with many families of the hostages held in Gaza bitterly critical of the government response and calling for their relatives to be brought home. In Tel Aviv, thousands demonstrated, waving flags and holding photographs of some of the captives in Gaza and posters with slogans like Release the hostages now at all costs while crowds chanted, bring them home now. Ofri Bibas-Levy, whose brother, along with his four-year-old son Ariel and 10-month-old son Kfir were taken hostage by Hamas, told Reuters that she came to show support for her family. We dont know where they are, we dont know what condition they are kept in. I dont know if Kfir is getting food, I dont know if Ariel is getting enough food. He is a very small baby, said Bibas-Levy. Since the attack, Israel has launched an intense air and ground offensive in Gaza, killing more than 9,000 people, health authorities in the Hamas-run area say, and reducing large areas of the enclave to rubble. Even before the war, Netanyahu had been a divisive figure, fighting corruption charges, which he denies, and pushing through a plan to curb the powers of the judiciary that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets to protest. On Saturday, a poll for Israels Channel 13 Television found 76 of Israelis thought Netanyahu, now serving a record sixth term as prime minister, should resign and 64 saying the country should hold an election immediately after the war. When asked who is most at fault for the attack, 44 of Israelis blamed Netanyahu, while 33 blamed the military chief of staff and senior IDF officials and 5 blamed the Defense Minister, according to the poll.

        "content": "The 11 Sri Lankans who crossed to Egypt from the Gaza Strip have arrived in the island early this morning (05) onboard a flight from Doha in Qatar, Ada Derana reporter said. The group, which is from two families includes two adults and nine children, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that the Consular Affairs Division of the ministry coordinated the arrangements for their return in collaboration with Sri Lanka Missions in Cairo, Ramallah and Tel Aviv. Foreign Ministry officials received the returning Sri Lankan nationals this morning, upon their arrival at Bandaranaike International Airport, Colombo this morning. The entry of the 11 Sri Lankans from Gaza Strip into Egypt via Rafah Border Crossing was facilitated by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Cairo in coordination with the Egyptian authorities on November 02, 2023, the statement added. The Embassy officials visited the Rafah Border to receive the stranded Sri Lankans. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated the arrangements of logistics and air transportation of the returnees with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), according to the ministry. On Thursday (Nov. 02), the group of 17 Sri Lankans who were trapped in the Gaza Strip amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict were permitted to leave the war-torn Palestinian enclave and enter Egypt via the Rafah border crossing, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Tel Aviv communicated. However, on that account, 15 of these Sri Lankans were expected to reach Egypt, while the remaining two were most likely to stay behind in Palestine, according to the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE). Nevertheless, 13 of the 17 Sri Lankans who were permitted to leave Gaza had been placed in an area between the entrance to the Rafah border crossing and Egypt, since the other four persons were not permitted to leave Palestine due to a lack of security. Later on Friday (Nov. 03), the Representative Office of Sri Lanka in Palestine announced that a group of 11 Sri Lankans had reached Egypt after crossing the Rafah border, and that they were preparing necessary arrangements to facilitate the their repatriation. Meanwhile, injured Palestinians and foreign nationals began arriving in Egypt from Gaza for the first time on Wednesday (Nov. 01) since the Israel-Hamas war started to escalate in early October.",

        "title": "Uncertainty looms over Sri Lanka-Bangladesh World Cup clash due to severe air pollution",
        "date": "November 5, 2023 04:48 pm",
        "content": "The notorious air pollution in the national capital of India has shrouded the World Cup clash between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in doubt and it remains to be seen if the health of the players takes precedence over the contest, on Monday. A thick layer of toxic haze has enveloped New Delhi once again, forcing the two teams to cancel their training at least once as Air Quality Index (AQI) remains in the severe category. While Sri Lanka decided to stay indoors on Saturday, Bangladesh braved hazardous conditions to train last evening, wearing masks at the Feroz Shah Kotla. The Tigers had cancelled their opening training session on Friday due to poor quality air. The AQI is above 400-mark on a scale of 500 since Thursday and according to the Air Quality Early Warning System, it is likely to remain severe till Tuesday. On Sunday morning, the AQI stood at 457 according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The International Cricket Council (ICC) has made it clear that a call on future of the match will be taken only on game day when the match officials assess the air quality on Monday. Article 2.8 of ICCs playing conditions, says If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. Both the teams are no strangers to such a situation with the Sri Lankan players resorting to masks during a Test series back in 2017 and Bangladesh cricketers doing the same in a T20 in 2019. A number of Sri Lankan players had faced respiratory issues back then, while some even vomited in the dressing room due to the hazardous conditions. Bangladesh are already out of reckoning, while Sri Lankas semifinal hopes are hanging by a thread, depending more on mathematics and luck than performance. Ranked ninth out of 10 teams, Bangladesh are playing for pride, while Sri Lanka are little better placed at seventh in the standings and will look to hold on to the position to qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Sri Lanka have an overwhelming 42-9 record against Bangladesh in 53 ODIs but the Tigers had defeated the Islanders in the warm-up game ahead of the World Cup and will take inspiration from that win. Sri Lanka are coming into the match after facing a nightmare against Indian pacers, who bundled them out for 55 during a 302-run thrashing and Kusal Mendis and his men will have to pick themselves up quickly against an equally hurt Tigers. While injuries have been an issue, Lankan players have also faltered against high-quality opponents and Bangladesh will have to produce a superlative performance to exploit their weakness. Sadeera Samarawickrama has been the find of the tournament for the Lankans, who have been served well by Pathum Nissanka and skipper Kusal Mendis in their batting from time to time though they lacked consistency. In bowling too, Lankan pacers have blown hot and cold, while lack of key spinners have hurt the team. For Bangladesh, it has been a forgettable outing as they have managed just one win against Afghanistan in the tournament. A chaotic build-up and lack of form of their players have seen them succumbing to their sixth successive loss and become the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup following a defeat to Pakistan in their last game. Their batters have not been able to build partnerships, while the bowlers too have failed to stop the run flow or take wickets, leaving even skipper Shakib Al Hasan bereft of any answers. Squads: Bangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (c), Litton Das (wk), Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Najmul Hossain Shanto (vc), Tawhid Hridoy, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah Riyad, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Nasum Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib Sri Lanka: Kusal Mendis (cwk), Kusal Perera, Pathum Nissanka, Lahiru Kumara, Dimuth Karunaratne, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Maheesh Theekshana, Dunith Wellalage, Kasun Rajitha, Angelo Mathews, Dilshan Madushanka, Dushan Hemantha, Chamika Karunaratne.

The order was issued with the consent of the majority of the judges of the five-member Appeals Court judge bench when the petitions were taken up before the court today (05), according to the reporter. The petitioners, which include the President of the High Court Judges Association, had sought a court order preventing the Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT), formerly known as the PAYE tax, from being applied to members of the judiciary. However, they had pointed out in their petitions that since judicial officers are a group performing independent duties, they cannot be taxed from their salaries as per the Inland Revenue Act. Thus, Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna, Menaka Wijesundara and Neil Iddawela of the five-member judge bench which also comprised of President of the Court of Appeal Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne, Justice D.N. Samarakoon had decided that the relevant petitions should be dismissed. The judges have further declared in their decision that the intervention of the court to determine a verdict on such issues is not justifiable and moral. The majority of the judges have also pointed out that tax decision-making is up to the legislature and the executive, and that the courts should not interfere in them. The three petitions were filed by the Sri Lanka Judicial Service Association, the High Court Judges Association, and the Labour Court Presidents Association.",

        "content": "Russias new nuclear-powered submarine Imperator Alexander III carried out a successful test launch of the Bulava ballistic missile, designed to carry nuclear warheads, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Firing a ballistic missile is the final element of state tests, after which a decision will be made to accept the cruiser into the Navy, the defence ministry said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. President Vladimir Putin has been pushing for Russia to maintain its nuclear deterrent to counter what he calls growing security threats, as ties between Moscow and the West have hit new lows over the war Russia launched in Ukraine in 2022. The intercontinental missile, launched from an underwater position in the White Sea off Russias northern coast, hit a target thousands of kilometres away on the Kamchatka peninsula in the Russian Far East, it said. The ministry did not say when the test occurred. The Borei class strategic-missile cruiser is equipped with 16 Bulava missiles and modern torpedo weapons, it said. Putin took part in a ceremony in December setting the Imperator Alexander III afloat, TASS state news agency said. The navy has three nuclear-powered submarines of the Borei class in service - one is completing tests and three more are under construction, the defence ministry said. The 12-metre (40-foot) long Bulava missile, which has an estimated range of around 8,000 km (5,000 miles) and can carry up to six nuclear warheads, has become the cornerstone in the naval part of Russias nuclear triad.

This comes nearly a year after OpenAIs ChatGPT caught the imagination of businesses and users around the world, spurring a surge in adoption of generative AI technology. Musk co-founded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in 2015 but stepped down from the companys board in 2018. In some important respects, it (xAIs new model) is the best that currently exists, he posted on his X social media platform. As soon as its out of early beta, xAIs Grok system will be available to all X Premium subscribers, Musk posted. X, formerly known as Twitter, rolled out two new subscription plans last week, a 16 per month Premium tier for users willing to pay for an ad-free experience and a basic tier priced at 3 per month. The billionaire, who has been critical of Big Techs AI efforts and what he calls censorship, said earlier this year he would launch a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe to rival Googles Bard and Microsofts Bing AI. The team behind xAI, which launched in July, comes from Googles DeepMind, the Windows parent, and other top AI research firms. Although X and xAI are separate, the companies work closely together. xAI also works with Tesla and other companies. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and a self-described close friend of Musk, said in September that xAI had signed a contract to train its AI model on Oracles cloud. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Halangoda, however, clarified that Sri Lanka have not pleaded with the ICC for a change of venue for Mondays match. We are constantly in touch with our medical panel back in Sri Lanka.

We are constantly in touch with our medical panel back in Sri Lanka. Actually, the professor who is in charge is already in India. He had come for a conference and we are in touch with him through the team doctor. Definitely we will be looking at the index. But obviously, we will be guided by the ICC and I think they have a medical panel here and, so, they will be giving us instructions. Today when we came, we were told to wear masks. But it depends on what the outside index is, and then well make a call on it, said Halangonda as reported by PTI. We didnt make a request to change (the venue). But we were asking the ICC what would happen because when we came here, we saw the Bangladesh team had cancelled (training) and we saw the outside environment, he added. So, we just asked them whats the plan. They said they will have a discussion, and then theyll come back. I think they have installed some equipment here, and theyve got specialists to check and they are helping them out. Meanwhile, the ICC has sought advice from renowned pulmonologist Randeep Guleria and also put in place mitigation measures like installing water sprinklers and adding air purifiers in the dressing rooms to curb the air pollution. The Sri Lankan team manager also informed that the tie will proceed as planned and therefore they will abide by ICCs guidelines. They (ICC) have already informed us that they are planning to go ahead. So, we will do exactly what the ICC tells us to do, Halangoda said. --Agencies",

        "date": "November 6, 2023 06:55 am",
        "content": "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has appointed a seven-member Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. Accordingly, under the authority granted to him by the Sports Law No 25 of 1973, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has formed an interim committee for Sri Lanka Cricket consisting of the following members: 1) Hon. S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge 2) Hon. Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge 3) Hon. Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge 4) Mr. Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman) 5) Mr. Upali Dharmadasa 6) Mr. Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law 7) Mr. Hisham Jamaldeen The Interim Committee for SLC with Arjuna Ranatunga as Chairman will come into effect from today (06) while the earlier board will be temporarily suspended, the Sports Ministry said. Anger over Sri Lankas miserable World Cup campaign had erupted after a humiliating 302-run thrashing by hosts India, with the countrys sports minister demanding the cricket boards resignation. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 55 while chasing 358 in Mumbai on Thursday, the fourth-lowest total at a World Cup tournament. Sports minister Roshan Fernando, who has long been at loggerheads with the board and previously accused it of being traitorous and corrupt, upped the stakes by telling officials and selectors to quit. Sri Lanka Cricket officials have no moral or ethical right to remain in office, the minister said in a statement issued on Friday night. They should voluntarily resign. There was no immediate formal comment from Sri Lanka Cricket, but board officials said it had sought an explanation from coaching staff over the crushing defeat. Sri Lanka has not won the Cricket World Cup since its sole victory in 1996, with Fernando blaming the board for the deterioration of standards since then. Secretary of Sri Lanka Cricket, Mohan de Silva, the boards second highest ranking official, said on Sunday that he had sent his resignation from Australia where he had been diagnosed with a heart condition De Silva said he had been diagnosed during a routine medical check-up in Australia and decided to resign from his elected position on the board. He said his medical condition was obviously due to the stress and anxiety surrounding controversies in cricket, adding his family had asked him to step down. Sri Lanka were at one point 14-6 and were all out for 55, the fourth-lowest World Cup total in history, while chasing Indias 358 in Mumbai on Thursday. On Saturday Ranasinghe wrote to full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) asking for their understanding and support. Sri Lanka Cricket has been besieged with complaints of player disciplinary issues, management corruption, financial misconduct, and match-fixing allegations, Ranasinghe said in the letters, released to Sri Lankan media. The minister was forced by the ICC to withdraw a three-member panel he had appointed last month to investigate corruption at the board after it was deemed to be political interference. Board sources said coaching staff had been called to explain the crushing defeat to India. (With Agencies Inputs)",

        "date": "November 6, 2023 12:35 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli government on Sunday drew ire after Minister Amichai Eliyahu suggested that dropping nuclear weapons on Gaza is one of the options and that no aid should be transferred to Gaza. Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu, an ultranationalist politician part of Netnayahus ruling coalition, told Israels Kol Barama radio he was not entirely satisfied with the scale of Israels retaliation in the Palestinian territory after Hamas fighters carried out a deadly attack on October 7 inside southern Israel. Israels military campaign in Gaza since October 7 has killed 9,488 people, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Eliyahu further backed retaking the territory of the Gaza Strip and restoring the settlements there. On being asked about the fate of the Palestinian population, he said, They can go to Ireland or deserts, the monsters in Gaza should find a solution by themselves. The Israeli Minister asserted that the northern Strip has no right to exist, adding that anyone waving a Palestinian or Hamas flag shouldnt continue living on the face of the earth, Times of Israel reported. The remarks were immediately denounced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that Eliyahus words are detached from reality. Israel and the IDF are acting in accordance with the highest standards of international law in order to prevent harm to uninvolved people, and we will continue to do that all the way to victory, Netanyahu says in a statement. The premieres office also announced that Eliyahu has been suspended from government meetings indefinitely, Times of Israel reported. However, the government ministers raised objections to Eliyahus sacking and called the action meaningless. Times of Israel reported citing Channel 12 news that Netanyahu wanted to fire Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu, but buckled following opposition from far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Ben Gvir, who heads the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, of which Eliyahu is a member, told Netanyahu he would not cooperate with the effort, saying the government should be focusing on destroying Hamas, not educating ministers, according to the network. After this, Netanyahu folded. The Palestinian Authority strongly condemned Eliyahus remarks and referred the Israeli minister as fascist. The statements by fascist minister Eliyahu are an honest declaration and clear acknowledgement of what the occupying state Israel is doing against our people particularly in Gaza, Times of Israel quoted the statement by the Palestinian Foreign Ministry. The Saudi foreign ministry also condemned the extremist suggestion stating that it shows to what extent extremism and brutality have penetrated the Israeli government. The fact that Eliyahu was only suspended and not immediately fired, the Saudi statement continues, reflects the Israeli governments disregard for all values of humanity, morality, religion and law, the Ministry added. Earlier, former PM and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid lambasted Eliyahus assertion calling it a horrifying and insane remark by an irresponsible minister. He also demanded Netanyahu to fire him immediately, Times of Israel reported. He offended the families of the 241 Gaza captives, offended Israeli society and harmed our international standing, Lapid said. He added, The presence of the extremists in the government endangers us and the success of the war goals  defeating Hamas and returning the hostages. Netanyahu must fire him this morning. After much uproar, Eliyahu tried to walk back from his widely slammed assertion that dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza is one of Israels options, posting that its clear to anyone with a brain that the remark about the atom was metaphorical, Times of Israel reported. --Agencies",

The 2023 World Cup playing conditions state a new batter needs to be ready to face their first ball within two minutes of arriving. He did not face a ball within the stipulated time and Bangladesh appealed for him to be given out. The former Sri Lankan captain tried to explain some to the umpires but to no avail. As per the rules, a new batsman has to be ready to face the ball within three minutes. Mathews was out on the field but there was some issue with his helmet. The star all-rounder wasnt ready to bat due to the issue with his gear. Bangladesh decided to appeal against Mathews and the umpire had no option but to adjudge him out. The on-field umpires can only give a batsman out if the opposition players appeal. Mathews would have stayed in the middle had Bangladesh decided to withdraw the appeal. He is the first player to be given Timed Out in international cricket. It has happened only six times before in any format, all in first-class cricket. Mathews walked back to the pavilion without facing a delivery. His wicket left Sri Lanka reeling at 1355. Dhananjaya de Silva has joined Charith Asalanka in the middle. Earlier, Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bowl first. They got an early scalp of Kusal Perera, who managed a score of 4. Pathum Nissanka took the onus after the fall of early wicket and added 61 runs for the second wicket with Kusal Mendis (19). Sadeera Samarawickrama also played a crucial knock of 41 before getting out. It was after his dismissal that Mathews came out to join Asalanka. But he ended up getting dismissed without facing any delivery. With just 2 wins from seven matches, Sri Lanka are placed at the seventh spot in the points table. They are in contention to qualify for the semi-final. With just one win from seven matches, Bangladesh are at the ninth spot. They have crashed out of the tournament. Source: Times Now --Agencies",

        "date": "November 6, 2023 09:50 pm",
        "content": "Leaders of Sri Lankan Tamil parties need to step up their engagement with India for resolving the Tamil issue, according to A. Varadaraja Perumal, former Chief Minister of the once-unified North-Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. In an interview with The Hindu after taking part in a book launch event in Coimbatore on Saturday, Mr. Varadaraja Perumal, who held the CM post nearly for one-and-a-half years during December 1988-March 1990 following the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, said there had to be pressure from the Tamil parties and their leaders, who are not acting in this regard. Recalling how Tamil rebel groups and parties were, during 1983-87, in frequent contact with Indian leaders, both in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu, the former leader of the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) pointed out that a similar relationship did not exist now. Merely sitting at a hotel in Jaffna and writing a letter to Prime Minister Modi would not work, he observed. Conceding that the Indian government too had a responsibility on the Tamil question even though it could not do what it did between 1983 and 1990, the 70-year-old former CM, who shuttles between India and Sri Lanka, said: The Government of India cannot act in isolation. It needs the support of Indian people and leaders. There should be a voice within India for devolution and the political settlement to be worked out in Sri Lanka. This can be possible only if the Tamil leaders maintain close ties with leaders in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu. So, the primary responsibility lies with them. At the same time, no room should be given for any extreme or radical move, Mr. Varadaraja Perumal hastened to add. Emphasising that the 13th Amendment of Sri Lankan Constitution, dealing with devolution through elected bodies of provincial councils, should be properly implemented, he said if it was interpreted on the lines of similar features of the Indian Constitution in India, this will take care of 70 to 75 of the political issues. Also, there was a need to revisit the 13th Amendment and the Indian government should constitute a team of legal experts to study the subject and convey to Sri Lanka how to ensure the proper implementation of the Amendment, against which the Sri Lankan government had never taken the stand per se. There are forces in several Sinhalese parties that favour devolution, besides NGOs and academicians, he said, expressing the hope that with consistent persuasion and perseverance, progress could be achieved in the area of devolution. On measures to be taken for refugees from Sri Lanka living in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Varadaraja Perumal responded that the issue concerning the refugees had to be viewed humanely. While the demand for Indian citizenship could be considered last, there were pressing issues that required to be attended to first. The Indian government could, either individually or jointly with the Sri Lankan government, provide permanent documents to those who wanted to take up proper employment in India or abroad. Similarly, property acquisition rights could be given to the refugees for the purpose of housing. Restrictions on camp refugees visits to Sri Lanka could also be eased, he added.

        "date": "November 7, 2023 10:15 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Courts determination on the constitutionality of the Online Safety Bill and its provisions was communicated to the parliament this morning (Nov. 07) by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse. In its determination, the Supreme Court has noted that the Online Safety Bill could be passed by a simple majority in the parliament following Committee Stage amendments on certain clauses. Pursuant to Article 84(2) of the Constitution, Clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 42, 45, 53, and 56 should be passed by a special majority in the parliament. However, if these clauses are amended during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in the parliament, the Supreme Court has said further. As such, the Supreme Court has arrived at the conclusion that subject to the aforementioned particulars, neither the Online Safety Bill nor its provisions are inconsistent with the Constitution. On October 19, the Supreme Court concluded deliberation of the petitions filed challenging the much-debated Online Safety Bill, which had been tabled in the parliament by the government recently. The hearings were held before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, Achala Vengapulli and Shiran Gunaratne. Accordingly, the judge benchs confidential verdict regarding the relevant petitions was communicated to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. During the October 18 parliamentary session, the Speaker revealed that 45 petitions in total had been filed against the proposed legislation. Petitions were filed by many parties including social activist and independent journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara; Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith; the Socialist Youth Union (SYU); General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara; SJBs Rehan Jayawickrama; former BASL presidents Saliya Peiris and Geoffrey Alagaratnam; National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris, challenging various provisions included in the legislation, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. The petitioners had sought an order determining that if the relevant bill were to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament, followed by a referendum. The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns.",

        "date": "November 7, 2023 10:53 am",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again rejected the idea of a ceasefire in Gaza unless hostages are released, and also addressed Gazas future after the war in an exclusive interview with ABC News World News Tonight anchor David Muir. President Joe Biden and top administration officials have been pressuring Israel for temporary humanitarian pauses in the fighting so more aid can enter Gaza and more civilians can escape the fighting in the Palestinian enclave. Biden and Netanyahu discussed the matter as recently as Monday, according to the White House, though no apparent agreement was reached. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the administration considered the parties to be at the beginning of this conversation. What theyre proposing is a humanitarian pause, there will be no pause? Muir pressed Netanyahu, shortly after he had spoken with Biden. Well, therell be no ceasefire, general ceasefire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages, Netanyahu responded. As far as tactical little pauses, an hour here, an hour there. Weve had them before, I suppose, will check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave. But I dont think theres going to be a general cease-fire. Netanyahu continued, I think it will hamper the war effort. Itll hamper our effort to get our hostages out because the only thing that works on these criminals in Hamas is the military pressure that were exerting. Muir then asked Netanyahu if there would be such a pause if Hamas to agree to the release of hostages. According to Israeli officials, 241 people are being held by the militant group. There will be a cease-fire for that purpose, Netanyahu responded. The month-long conflict has killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. That number includes 4,104 children. In Israel, more than 1,400 people have died and 6,900 have been injured, the prime ministers office has said. Future control of Gaza? The Biden administration has been walking a diplomatic tightrope as it defends Israels right to self-defense against Hamas but also tries to reduce civilian deaths and looks ahead to a path forward for Palestinians after the conflict is over. Muir, noting Biden previously said it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza, asked Netanyahu who should govern the territory when the fighting ends. The prime minister indicated he believes Israel will have a role to play for an indefinite period. Last month, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant suggested the final phase of the was would be to sever Israels responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip and establish a new security reality for the citizens of Israel. Those who dont want to continue the way of Hamas, Netanyahu told Muir. It certainly is not -- I think Israel will, for an indefinite period will have the overall security responsibility because weve seen what happens when we dont have it. When we dont have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldnt imagine. Asked if the Biden administration agrees with or supports Netanyahus view, Kirby said discussions about Gazas future are ongoing and nothing has been decided. What we support is that Hamas cant be in control of Gaza anymore, Kirby said. We cant go back to Oct. 6. We are having conversations with our Israeli counterparts about what governance in Gaza should look like post-conflict and I dont believe that any solutions have been settled upon one way or the other, Kirby continued. Whos going to do what and for how long. So, thats an active discussion that were having with, not only Israel but other partners in the region because clearly whatever it looks like, it cant look like what it did, as I said on the sixth of October.
