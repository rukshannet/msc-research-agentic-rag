        "content": "During a discussion on the 178th Anniversary of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka (RASSL) at the Mahaweli Centre on Thursday (April 27), President Ranil Wickremesinghe shared his intentions to establish the Institute of History, with the aim of bringing together the museum, archives, archaeology, cultural triangle, and universities with the RASSL as the focal point. The President emphasized that this institute should not be in competition with RASSL or any other institute. Rather, it should work collaboratively with these institutions to enrich the process. Once the final draft of the Institute of History is ready, it will be discussed with the relevant parties such as the universities, Archaeology, and RASSL. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of protecting libraries and the need to collect various collections from museums, archives, and universities, including unpublished theses. He also highlighted the importance of funding projects and urged officials to prioritize them. Regarding historical programs, the President emphasized the need to resolve funding issues related to the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology, seeking assistance from the legal draftsman to finalize a copy, followed by the establishment of a committee to carry out the functions and appoint members. He is hopeful that these efforts will give a better impetus to the study of history in the country, as many people do not study history. The Head of State further assured monetary assistance to establish air conditioning units to preserve library books and urged the organization of conferences that were postponed due to COVID. During his visit to the RASSL Library, the President inspected the facility and took an official photograph with council members, as well as signed the Visitors Book. During a discussion held at the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka (RASSL), the President of the RASSL, Dr. Malini Dias presented the 175th anniversary medal, two scholarly books, and a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Additionally, Dr. Bohingamuwa and Ms. Hasula Wickramasinghe presented RASSL journals, while Dr. Chandana Jayawardhena handed over Science and Technological volumes to the President. Past President of the RASSL, Archt. Ashley De Vos and other RASSL Council members were also in attendance.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has expressed its displeasure at the Land Reforms Commission for not submitting its annual reports despite the repeated insistence of the committee to submit up-to-date annual reports which were last submitted in 2015. The issue came up when COPE chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara looked into the status update of the Land Reforms Commission following the recommendations issued at the meeting on December 22, 2022. It is reported that despite the insistence of the COPE at the previous meeting for a protocol for the conferring of lands by the commission, there has been no progress. A request was made by the COPE chairman to submit a detailed report into the conveyance lands and an instruction to the ministry to conduct an inquiry as to why protocol was not established. MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, in particular, raised the query of the lack of protocol during the conveyance of the Rassagalawatta land for which a specific report was sought. These reports are to be called in two months again. The chairman instructed the ministry to expeditiously conduct an inquiry into missing files beginning at Ministry level. Further, an order was given to complete this as soon as possible by providing the necessary technical infrastructure for digital data capture and acquisition of data on lands-related missing files. The Ministry Secretary was asked to report back in 30 days with an update as to progress. The COPE chairman instructed the Land Reforms Commission to adopt specific internal procedures in contemplating and initiating legal action in respect to issues arising from lands which have been leased.",

        "date": "April 29, 2023 09:13 pm",
        "content": "The second phase of free rice distribution to low-income families was inaugurated at the Velanai Divisional Secretariat Auditorium on Friday (April 28) under the aegis of Sagala Ratnayake, the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff. Attending the event, Ratnayake said emphasized the governments commitment to uplift the low-income population. He said the government has paid special attention to this matter as part of its program to strengthen the countrys economy, which includes the implementation of a social security program. The program, which focuses on the Thelippalai and Velanai areas of Jaffna, was implemented in conjunction with the governments paddy procurement and disposal program for the 20222023 high season, with the Sri Lanka Army making a significant contribution. The distribution of rice to low-income families was carried out by Ratnayake. Expressing his views at the event Mr. Ratnayake said: I am proud to share with you the Presidents vision of providing 10 kg of rice to low-income people, which was started as a relief program for the poor and benefited paddy farmers by allowing them to receive the right price for their harvest. Additionally, small paddy mill owners have also gained strength from this program. We initiated the first phase of this rice distribution before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and now we are launching the second phase in the Jaffna District today. The Presidents aim was to start the first program in the Jaffna District, and I express my sincere gratitude to the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Police for taking steps to provide this rice to the people in need. Speaking further, he said a program is being prepared to develop the agriculture and tourism industry in the Northern region and strengthen the economy of the people. The social security program is also being built to eliminate poverty and uplift low-income people in line with the program to strengthen the countrys economy, he added. He further noted that time has come to implement that program and strengthen the process of tracing missing persons. We believe that these efforts will lead to a prosperous and peaceful Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "Fishermen in Tamil Nadu have upped their ante against the state and central governments not intervening in releasing their boats seized by the Sri Lankan navy. The fishermen have stated that since 2018, 109 fishing boats were impounded by the Sri Lankan authorities along with the fishermen on various charges including that they have crossed International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). The fishermen were arrested and jailed and their boats, fishing nets and their catch were seized. While the arrested fishermen were released after 15 days of judicial custody, the boats, nets and catch were never returned. The fishermen under the network of Anaithu Meenavar Kootamaippu (All Fishermen Union Federation) held a one-day protest and called upon the state and central governments to immediately intervene and to provide compensation for them as they were not in a position to go to sea for fishing. This is due to the fact that the boats are impounded in Sri Lanka. The fishermen association leaders have met Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, M.K. Stalin, and appraised him to intervene with the Union government for the release of these boats. The leaders have also sought an appointment with the Indian External Affairs Minister (EAM), S. Jaishankar to seek his intervention with the Sri Lankan government on a government-to-government interaction. The fishermen are also worried as many have had no jobs for the past several months as they dont have boats to move to the deep sea for fishing. The families are expecting immediate intervention from the state and central governments to release their boats. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "title": "Texas man kills 5 neighbors after they complained of gunfire",
        "date": "April 30, 2023 10:14 am",
        "content": "A Texas man went next door with a rifle and fatally shot five of his neighbors, including an 8-year-old boy, after they asked him to stop firing rounds in his yard because they were trying to sleep, authorities said Saturday. The suspect, identified as 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza, remained at large more than 18 hours after the shooting and authorities warned that he might still be armed. The attack happened just before midnight Friday near the town of Cleveland, north of Houston, on a street where some residents say it is not uncommon to hear neighbors unwind by firing off guns. San Jacinto County Sheriff Greg Capers said Oropeza used an AR-style rifle, and as the search for him dragged into Saturday evening, authorities had widened their efforts to as far as 10 to 20 miles from the murder scene. He said Oropeza may still have a weapon but that he believes authorities have the rifle used in the shooting. Capers said they found clothes and a phone while combing a rural area that includes dense layers of forest but that tracking dogs had lost the scent. He could be anywhere now, Capers said. Capers said the victims were between the ages of 8 and 31 years old and that all were believed to be from Honduras. All were shot from the neck up, he said. The attack was the latest act of gun violence in what has been a record pace of mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year, some of which have also involved semiautomatic rifles. The mass killings have played out in a variety of places  a Nashville school, a Kentucky bank, a Southern California dance hall, and now a rural Texas neighborhood inside a single-story home. Capers said there were 10 people in the house  some of whom had just moved there earlier in the week  but that that no one else was injured. He said two of the victims were found in a bedroom laying over two children in an apparent attempt to shield them. A total of three children found covered in blood in the home were taken to a hospital but found to be uninjured, Capers said. FBI spokesperson Christina Garza said investigators do not believe everyone at the home were members of a single family. The victims were identified as Sonia Argentina Guzman, 25; Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21; Julisa Molina Rivera, 31; Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18; and Daniel Enrique Laso, 8. The confrontation followed the neighbors walking up to the fence and asking the suspect to stop shooting rounds, Capers said. The suspect responded by telling them that it was his property, Capers said, and one person in the house got a video of the suspect walking up to the front door with the rifle. The shooting took place on a rural pothole-riddled street where single-story homes sit on wide 1-acre lots and are surrounded by a thick canopy of trees. A horse could be seen behind the victims home, while in the front yard of Oropezas house a dog and chickens wandered. Rene Arevalo Sr., who lives a few houses down, said he heard gunshots around midnight but didnt think anything of it. Its a normal thing people do around here, especially on Fridays after work, Arevalo said. They get home and start drinking in their backyards and shooting out there. Capers said his deputies had been to Oropezas home at least once before and spoken with him about shooting his gun in the yard. It was not clear whether any action was taken at the time. At a news conference Saturday evening, the sheriff said firing a gun on your own property can be illegal, but he did not say whether Oropeza had previously broken the law. Capers said the new arrivals in the home had moved from Houston earlier in the week, but he said he did not know whether they were planning to stay there. Across the U.S. since Jan. 1, there have been at least 18 shootings that left four or more people dead, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, in partnership with Northeastern University. The violence is sparked by a range of motives: murder-suicides and domestic violence; gang retaliation; school shootings; and workplace vendettas. Texas has confronted multiple mass shootings in recent years, including last years attack at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde; a racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019; and a gunman opening fire at a church in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs in 2017. Republican leaders in Texas have continually rejected calls for new firearm restrictions, including this year over the protests of several families whose children were killed in Uvalde. A few months ago, Arevalo said Oropeza threatened to kill his dog after it got loose in the neighborhood and chased the pit bull in his truck. I tell my wife all the time, Stay away from the neighbors. Dont argue with them. You never know how theyre going to react, Arevalo said. I tell her that because Texas is a state where you dont know who has a gun and who is going to react that way. A previous version of this story, based on information from a San Jacinto County prosecutor, incorrectly identified one of the victims as 15 years old. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 30, 2023 11:39 am",
        "content": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan has warned the powerful people that violent protests will break out in the country if the elections were not held. Pakistan would face a Sri Lanka-like situation, he added. This is not a warning, it is my analysis; the people till now have remained peaceful at the party rallies and public gatherings with a hope that the elections would be held soon. However, if they were denied their right to vote then they will come out onto the streets and no one would be able to control the situation, the former Prime Minister said while addressing an interactive session with party workers through a video link here Saturday. He said till now the coalition government was running away from the elections, fearing that they would lose and Imran Khan will return to power. While keeping in mind Pakistans precarious economic situation, till now I have taken party decisions that did not hurt our fragile economy, but if the elections were delayed the situation would get out of control, he added. On behalf of the nation, he urged all Supreme Court justices to put their differences behind them and unite for the sake of the country. Pakistan was on the verge of collapse; if the countrys Constitution was breached, for which attempts were being made, there will be a law of jungle in the country. The nation was looking towards the Supreme Court for supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of the law in the country, he said. Khan also announced to stage rallies in Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar to mark Labour Day on Monday; I would lead the rally in Lahore from Liberty Chowk to Nasir Bagh while PTI senior leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Pervez Khattak would lead the rallies in Islamabad and Peshawar, respectively. He said that on Monday they would show solidarity with the labour class and express their support for the supremacy of the Constitution and Pakistan. Thus, he urged people from all sections of society, especially the lawyers, to participate in the rally to express their demands for their rights. Talking about the negotiation with the government over holding elections simultaneously in the country, the PTI chief cast doubts over the governments sincerity. We agreed to hold talks with the government on the Supreme Courts request and we have to come to the negotiation table with full sincerity. However, he saw mala-fide intentions behind the governments proposal to hold elections simultaneously after this years budget. He disclosed that on Tuesday (May 2), his team would attend the negotiations and if the government commits to dissolve the National and Provincial Assemblies by May 14 then they were ready to move forward and talk about one election in the country. However, he warned that they would not accept the governments demand of dissolving the assemblies after the budget and then hold the elections. He castigated the incumbent rulers for destroying state institutions with the sole aim of giving themselves NROs. National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) have been abandoned to destroy the accountability system in the country and subsequently, enabled them to close corruption cases against them. Now, police and other state institutions were being used to fabricate cases against their opponents. The Elections Commission of Pakistan (ECP), which was responsible for holding free and fair elections in the country, has become a partner with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM); it was acting on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryum Nawaz and Dirty Harry, he alleged. He also castigated the government for undermining the peoples fundamental rights and violating the sanctity of their houses. What happened at PTI President and former Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahis residence could never be imagined in any civilized society and democracy. Earlier, an attack was made on my life and my house. The PTI leaders, including Azam Swati, Shahbaz Gill, Ali Amin, and others, were arrested and tortured. Any of this could not be possible in a civilized society, he lamented. Source - Business Recorder -Agencies",

        "title": "Zimbabwe plans to launch digital currency backed by gold",
        "date": "April 30, 2023 01:26 pm",
        "content": "Zimbabwe will launch a digital currency next month by introducing tokens that are backed by gold reserves and can be transferred between people and businesses as a form of payment, the countrys central bank said Friday. The move is aimed at shoring up Zimbabwes faltering national currency, the Zimbabwe dollar, which is fast depreciating amid yearslong economic woes in the southern African nation. The Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria have already launched digital currencies backed by their central banks, with several other countries, including China, running trial projects. The United Kingdom is moving closer to it by asking for public input on the idea. The U.S. and European Union are considering similar moves. In Zimbabwe, the new tokens will be fully backed by physical gold held by the bank and will go into circulation on May 8, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Gov. John Mangudya said. People can buy the tokens and use them as a way to save their money or conduct person-to-person and person-to-business transactions and settlements, Mangudya said. People will be able to buy the tokens through banks and make transactions using e-gold wallets or e-gold cards held by banks, he said. Trust in Zimbabwes currency is desperately low after people in 2008 had their savings wiped out by hyperinflation, which reached 5 billion percent, according to the International Monetary Fund, nearly a world record. The hyperinflation resulted in the country at one point issuing a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars banknote before the government was forced to temporarily scrap its currency and allow the U.S. dollar to be used as legal tender. In 2019, the government reintroduced a Zimbabwean currency and banned foreign currencies for local transactions. But few took heed and the black market thrived, while the local currency quickly devalued. The government relented and unbanned the U.S. dollar. With memories of that disastrous inflation, many people today prefer to seek scarce U.S. dollars on the illegal market to keep at home as savings or for daily transactions, where U.S. currency is still used. Faith in the Zimbabwe dollar is so low that many retailers and even some government institutions dont accept it. On the official market, the exchange rate is just over 1,000 Zimbabwe dollars to the U.S. dollar. However, its about double that amount of local currency on the illegal  but flourishing  street market, where greenbacks are readily available. Zimbabwe has tried to stave off the depreciation of its currency with unusual ideas before. In July 2022, it launched gold coins as legal tender to stabilize the local currency. But many people struggling to buy everyday basics such as bread found them too pricey. The introduction of the digital currency will ensure that those with low amounts of money can trade them so that we leave no one and no place behind, Mangudya told Zimbabwes The Sunday Mail newspaper last weekend. International gold prices determined by the London Bullion Market Association will dictate the local pricing of the tokens, Mangudya said. More than 80 of the worlds central banks are considering issuing digital currencies or have already done so, the consultancy PwC said in a report last year. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 30, 2023 01:41 pm",
        "content": "Gunfire and heavy artillery fire persisted over the weekend in parts of Sudans capital Khartoum, residents said, despite the extension of a cease-fire between the countrys two top generals, whose battle for power has killed hundreds and sent thousands fleeing for their lives. With ordinary Sudanese caught in the crossfire, the civilian death toll jumped Saturday to 411 people, according to the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, which monitors casualties. In some areas in and around the capital, residents reported that shops were reopening and normalcy gradually returning as the scale of fighting dwindled after the shaky truce. But in other areas, terrified residents reported explosions thundering around them and fighters ransacking houses. Now in its third week, the fighting has wounded 2,023 civilians, the syndicate added, although the true toll is expected to be much higher. The Sudanese Health Ministry put the overall death toll, including fighters, at 528, with 4,500 wounded. In the city of Genena, the provincial capital of war-ravaged West Darfur, intensified violence has killed 89 people, the Doctors Syndicate said. Khartoum, a city of some five million people, has been transformed into a front line in the grinding conflict between Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, the commander of Sudans military, and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the powerful paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces. The outbreak of violence has dashed once-euphoric hopes for a democratic transition in Sudan after a popular uprising helped oust former dictator Omar al-Bashir. Foreign countries continued to evacuate their citizens while hundreds of thousands of Sudanese fled across borders. The first convoy organised by the United States to evacuate hundreds of American citizens from the conflict reached the coastal city of Port Sudan Saturday after a dangerous overland journey escorted by armed drones. Britain, meanwhile, ended its evacuation flights Saturday, after demand for spots on the planes declined. The United Arab Emirates announced Saturday it had started evacuating its own citizens along with nationals of 16 other countries. More than 50,000 Sudanese refugees - mostly women and children - have crossed over to Chad, Egypt, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, the United Nations said, raising fears of regional instability. Ethnic fighting and turmoil have scarred South Sudan and the Central African Republic for years while a 2021 coup has derailed Chads own democratic transition. Those who escape the fighting in Khartoum face more dangers on their way to safety. The route to Port Sudan, where ships evacuate people via the Red Sea, has proven long, exhausting and risky. Hatim el-Madani, a former journalist, said that paramilitary fighters were stopping refugees at roadblocks outside Khartoum, demanding they hand over their phones and valuables. Theres an outlaw, bandit-like nature to the RSF, he said, referring to Dagalos Rapid Support Forces. They dont have a supply line in place. That could get worse in the coming days. Airlifts from the country amid the chaotic fighting also posed challenges, with a Turkish evacuation plane even hit by gunfire outside Khartoum on Friday. On Saturday - despite a cease-fire extended under heavy international pressure early Friday - clashes continued around the presidential palace, headquarters of the state broadcaster and a military base in Khartoum, residents said. The battles sent thick columns of black smoke billowing over the city skyline. But in other areas, residents reported signs that the cease-fire had taken hold. We are not hearing the bombs as we did before, so were hoping that this means they will go back to a political process, said Osman Mirgany, a columnist and editor of the daily al-Tayar, who assessed it was safe enough on Friday to return home to Khartoum after seeking refuge in a far-flung village. But Khartoum residents are forced to live side by side with armed fighters. Many RSF militants have moved into civilian homes and taken over stores and hospitals in the capital. The paramilitary group even transformed Mirganys newsroom into a makeshift base, he said. Residents also must cope without sufficient electricity and running water, among other basic supplies. For the past 14 days weve suffered from a lack of everything, Mirgany said. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 30, 2023 07:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has commented on the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to contribute to the countrys development, during a recent discussion at the Presidents Office. He has instructed officials from the Ministry of Technology to form a presidential task force comprising AI experts and prepare a concept paper to promote AI usage in the country. The President highlighted the potential of Artificial Intelligence in various fields, including agriculture, education, health, fisheries, and industry, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The President noted that the current annual contribution to Sri Lankas gross national income through computer and information technology is around USD 1.9 billion, with no known amount from AI technology. He instructed officials to develop a system to track AI contributions. Additionally, he stressed the importance of taking prompt action to increase AIs contribution to the gross domestic product in the coming years, according to the PMD. Expressing his views, the President further said, We have identified the modernization of agriculture and fisheries, tourism, and improvement of supply centers as urgent areas for development in our economic reforms. Additionally, we have placed a greater focus on the technology industry. As we see the world progressing with artificial intelligence, it is crucial for Sri Lanka to focus on this technology and invest in it. The private sector needs to be involved in this initiative. I called for this discussion today to seek your opinions on how we can proceed with this. How can we kick-start these programs? What are the advantages and disadvantages of investing in AI? These are some of the issues I want to discuss with you. The government plans to allocate one billion rupees for AI technology next year. To develop this technology in the country, we need to create an appropriate environment, which requires an institution and data. So, I am eager to hear your suggestions on how we can develop these programs. We are aiming to create a digital economy and it will require a lot of effort in the coming months. Fortunately, the government has already prepared the necessary plans. However, it is important to note that only 2500 engineers are produced in our country every year. I have suggested that we should aim to produce at least 10,000 engineers to meet the demands of the digital age. When it comes to artificial intelligence, we should consider Singapore and India as role models. It is true that East Asia, South Korea, Japan, and China are making progress in artificial intelligence, but no country in West Asia has reached that stage yet. This presents a clear opportunity for us, and we must have strategies in place to implement this program promptly. In order to achieve this, we should start by improving university research departments. During the discussion on the integration of AI technology into the wider model of digitization in Sri Lanka, the Minister of State for Technology, Kanaka Herath, and the Secretary of the Ministry, Niranjan Gunawardena, a Senior Professor, shared their views. The participants focused on the development of infrastructure necessary for related research activities and the latest trends in the field. The scholars who attended the discussion also expressed their views on future steps that need to be taken for the advancement of the field, the PMD said. Mrs. Chandani Wijewardena, Senior Additional Secretary to the President for Strategic Affairs, along with representatives from the Sri Lanka Artificial Intelligence Association, universities, national innovation institutes, and experts in the field of information technology were among those who participated in the discussion, it added.",

I didnt table those agreements in the parliament. Now, an unnecessary problem has arisen after tabling this in parliament. President and the government can finalize the agreement after signing it with a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, he said. I think it may have been tabled in parliament for more democracy. Sirisena, who also commented on the Easter Sunday terror attack, stated that there are a number of instances where terrorist organizations had attacked the countries. More than fifty thousand died in an attack in the U.S. on September 11Those terrorists are the same people who attacked Sri Lanka. He also expressed that even if some individuals are in a hurry, these issues cannot be resolved quickly in two days. Many countries took 10-15 years to resolve such issues.

        "date": "May 1, 2023 08:20 am",
        "content": "Today is International Workers Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large. The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement. May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers. The date was chosen to be International Workers Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers. While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as Haymarket Martyrs. In Sri Lanka, the holiday is tied to labour movements for trade unions and political parties. The first May Day rally in Sri Lanka was held in 1933 under the leadership of A.E. Gunasinghe, who formed the Labour Party to ensure workers rights. May Day was declared an official holiday in Sri Lanka in 1956 under the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna government, led by former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Labour Day commemorates past labour struggles against workers rights violations, including lengthy workdays and weeks, poor conditions and child labour. Several political parties and trade unions in Sri Lanka are preparing to mark International Workers Day, with various events including rallies and processions organized in towns across the country today. The United National Partys (UNP) May Day rally will be held at the Sugathadasa Stadium in Colombo this evening with the participation of several leading members of the party. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not expected to take part in any of the UNPs May Day events. Meanwhile, the May Day rally of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will take place in Campbell Park in Borella, led by the partys leader former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Samagi Jana Balavegayas (SJB) May Day parade themed Struggle at the workplace for the victory of the motherland is scheduled to be commenced near the P.D. Sirisena playground in Maligawatte, going on to gather at the E.A. Gunasinghe playground in Borella. The May Day rally of the National Peoples Power (NPP) has been organized in front of the Viharamahadevi Park, while the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) will commence their procession from Delkanda Junction towards Ananda Samarakoon Open Air Theatre, where the partys rally will be held. Moreover, the Supreme Lanka Coalition (Uttara Lanka Sabhagaya) has organized their May Day rally in Colombo Hyde Park this evening. In the meantime, two other major political parties have organized the May Day rallies outside Colombo. Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) rally will be held in front of the Kandy Central Market, while the Nidahasa Janatha Sandhanaya will hold their May Day rally in front of the Sahas Uyana in Kandy. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Police have taken steps to deploy special security meaaures for the May Day rallies and demonstrations that will be held today. The Police Media Spokesperson SSP Nihal Talduwa says that all security measures are in place for the May Day rallies which are scheduled to be held today (May 01). Speaking to media yesterday, SSP Talduwa stated that nearly 3,500 police officers have been deployed in the field for the May Day parades and rallies in Colombo City and for traffic duties too. When the matter of how to deal with the traffic in a way that does not obstruct the general public is considered, they have agreed to hold their parades using only one lane of the road. Thereby, we urge the organizers of those parades to act accordingly, he added.",

        "content": "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa says the working people of the country have to celebrate the International Workers Day in a situation where they are facing many serious crises as a country and that it is a result of arbitrary autocracy caused by a short-sighted regime for several years. In his May Day message, he charged that the current government is trying to apply childish, unsuccessful and plaster solutions to suppress the serious economic crisis that the country is facing by selling off the national resources and it will only result in a desert land where the country has lost all its local resources. Premadasa stressed that the actual situation is far more serious than the picture they are painting to deceive people and, that we are coming closer to a grave tragedy day by day. He alleged that Workers Day is celebrated in a situation where people have lost all hope, getting tears instead of smiles, threats and repression instead of democracy as burdens the government has imposed on the people, and it is now very well known that only a group with a sustainable program can change this situation completely and establish human freedom and the development of the country. The reality is that a country cannot be built from failed crony capitalism or outmoded socialism and it can only be done through a middle path based on true nationalism, the SJB leader added. He said that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is the only force that can take up the challenge of building our country as a great country free of extremism, casteism, and terrorism, and he invited all working people of the nation with respect and pride to join with that reliable program to build a strong camp. May Day message issued by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa! Working people around the world celebrate their traditions, histories and achievements every year on 01st May. The International Workers Day is celebrated in memory of the historic and life sacrificed struggle of the Chicago workers demanding an eight-hour work day in 1886, and the working people of Sri Lanka also remember that historic day. The working people of our country have to celebrate the International Workers Day in a situation where we are facing many serious crises as a country and it is a result of arbitrary autocracy caused by a short-sighted regime for several years. The current government is trying to apply childish, unsuccessful and plaster solutions to suppress the serious economic crisis that the country is facing by selling off the national resources and it will only result in a desert land where the country has lost all its local resources. With election of President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to power, our country underwent a historic decline and through the current administration, that journey of failure is going forward very successfully. The actual situation is far more serious than the picture they are painting to deceive people and, we are coming closer to a grave tragedy day by day. Peoples lives are collapsing into a serious abyss day by day, and a large number of people have lost their jobs. The government has reached the level of completely eliminating the dignity of work and mocking workers. No pay hike has been introduced for years and the culture of political revenge has grown to a level of suppression. The tragedy is that about 40 of the countrys spending on education and health has been cut. 85 of the population is facing tragedies such as borrowing money, reducing spending on education and health, spending savings, while about 68 of the population is reducing the amount of food consumed, reducing the number of meals, etc. 14.3 of the population is living below the poverty line. The Central Bank has made predictions that the pressure of the economic crisis may worsen for this reason. Our country celebrates Workers Day in such a situation! Workers Day is celebrated in a situation where people have lost all hope, getting tears instead of smiles, threats and repression instead of democracy as burdens the government has imposed on the people, and it is now very well known that only a group with a sustainable program can change this situation completely and establish human freedom and the development of the country. The reality is that a country cannot be built from failed crony capitalism or outmoded socialism and it can only be done through a middle path based on true nationalism. Samagi Jana Balawegaya is the only force that can take up the challenge of building our country as a great country free of extremism, casteism, and terrorism, and we invite all working people of the nation with respect and pride to join with that reliable program to build a strong camp!",

Speaking to the media in the Urapola area, the State Minister also mentioned that most of that revenue has been generated by Sri Lanka Customs. He said the target of the Inland Revenue Department for the whole year is USD 1,665 billion as stated in the budget and that the target for the first quarter is Rs. 302 billion. There is a pattern of revenue collection. We divide the quarters based on that. Accordingly, State Minister Siyambalapitiya expressed that the Inland Revenue Department needed to generate USD 302 billion, and that nevertheless, they have earned USD 316 billion. That means they have generated a revenue of 105, he added. The most important thing is that if we look at the first quarter of the Excise Department, the revenue generated is at 64. We are specifically looking at that revenue. The use of legal alcohol has decreased. On the other hand, illegal drugs are being used. We have to find out whether it poses a health problem.

        "date": "May 1, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the United National Party May Day celebrations held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo today (01) through video technology, said that the country should not focus on short-term politics; instead, we should think about the future, specifically 2048, and work towards making Sri Lanka a developed country. He extended an invitation to all UNP members to transform the party into one that breaks free from traditional politics and charts a new path towards progress for the country, the PMD reported. The President also spoke about the importance of addressing the ethnic problem and reaching an agreement by the end of the year. He emphasized the need for all parties to come together and work towards a resolution that benefits all communities in Sri Lanka. In his address, President Wickremesinghe also reflected on Sri Lankas history as a country with the second strongest economy in Asia. He credited the progress made by leaders such as Mr. D.S. Senanayake and J.R. Jayawardene who took the country forward with the open economy. Furthermore, the President highlighted his commitment to rebuilding Sri Lanka according to President Jayawardenes program. With the support of the UNP and its members, he is determined to make Sri Lanka a stronger and more prosperous nation. He emphasized that the UNP is a party that always prioritizes the countrys interests and engages in policy-based politics. The President also highlighted that the partys policy is to always be truthful with the people. President Wickremesinghe recalled that the UNP was the first party to state in its election manifesto the need to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to address the economic crisis, while other parties were making promises that they could not keep. The President acknowledged that the UNP had to face criticism for its stance, but stood by its policy. The President stated that he expects to reach an agreement by the end of the year to solve the ethnic problem that has been a long-standing issue in the country. With the UNPs commitment to policies that benefit all communities in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe expressed his optimism about achieving a resolution that is beneficial for everyone. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe virtually; After assuming the presidency, I have had the opportunity to address the United National Party and all of you who support the party. When I took office as president, the country was experiencing its worst economic crisis in 30 years. The economy had completely collapsed, and people were suffering from shortages of food and fuel, leading to protests on the streets. Additionally, some individuals attempted to exploit this crisis to undermine the democratic system and the parliament. Today, the countrys economy has achieved stability, with no shortage of food, and a functional democratic system where the parliament operates without any threats. Furthermore, everyone has the opportunity to carry out their work without hindrance. Prior to assuming the presidency, I reflected on one thing: the United National Party prioritizes the welfare of the country. The United National Party is a political party that is close to my heart. In fact, in the United National Partys 2020 election manifesto, we explicitly stated our intention to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with a goal of securing 7 billion. As a party, we were the only ones who mentioned these critical points. On the other hand, other parties made empty promises they could not fulfil despite knowing the existence of the countrys economic problem. After honestly sharing our partys policies, the United National Party ended up in the national list. Our policy is to be transparent with the people, even if it means conveying unpleasant truths. We announced our goals for 2020 and 2021 without hesitation. As the economic crisis deepened in 2022, I met with the former President, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and recommended that he seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund. During the discussions on this matter, the former President summoned a meeting of the party leaders in parliament. While other opposition groups refused to attend, I, along with the Tamil National Alliance, actively participated in the discussions. My motivation was not rooted in politics, but in properly managing the countrys economy and alleviating the burdens on its citizens. For this reason, I took on the role of the presidency, as I had faith in my ability to revive the economy and work alongside supportive ministers to achieve these outcomes. My self-assuredness stemmed from my previous experience in successfully rebuilding the countrys economy after the governments collapse in 2001. During that time, I not only managed to revive the economy but also strengthened it. Similarly, in 2015, when the countrys economy faced a setback, I saw an opportunity to bolster it and achieve a primary budget surplus. With this confidence in mind, I accepted the responsibility to face the current economic crisis head-on. By now, we have been able to stabilize the countrys economy and establish a sense of political stability. The parliament is functioning smoothly, and many individuals are working within the frameworks of democracy and law. I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the ministers, MPs, political parties, organizations, and, most of all, the United National Party who have supported me throughout this process. Our progress thus far has been made possible through our agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which was recently approved by a majority vote in parliament last Friday. I would like to express my gratitude to MP Wajira Abeywardena, who represented the United National Party, as well as Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara, for their unwavering support in this matter. Without their contributions, we would not have been able to move forward. Our next step is to execute the IMF agreement and put in place the necessary rules and regulations to restore the countrys economy to a stable state by 2024. However, I am not content with just returning to the status quo. It is imperative that we move beyond our current economic system and establish an economy that can achieve a rapid GDP growth rate of 6  7 annually. To illustrate this point, I have two examples: one is from the time of DS Senanayake, where we had the second strongest economy in Asia and were even able to lend to England. The other is from the tenure of JR Jayawardena, where we advanced with an open economy, and Sri Lanka became the second country in Asia to adopt this system. After our success, China followed suit. Therefore, I am determined to pursue a new economic model that will elevate Sri Lankas economy to new heights and foster continued growth and prosperity for our citizens. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka must forge ahead once again. It is futile to compete with Afghanistan to determine who has the weakest economy. Instead, we must focus on building a robust and developed economy. Similar to the approach taken by J.R. Jayawardene, we must pursue numerous new projects and embrace the new economy to achieve our goals. Failure to do so will leave us with no future to look forward to. We must not only consider our own future but also that of our countrys youth. It is our responsibility to ensure that they inherit a prosperous and thriving Sri Lanka. Therefore, let us work together to implement new strategies and policies that will lay the foundation for a thriving economy and a better future for our citizens. As we approach the centenary of our independence in 2048, our goal should be to become a country with a developed economy, just like India aims to achieve in 2047 and China in 2049. Let 2048 be the year of development for Sri Lanka. We are not only building this economy for the present generation but also for the youth and children of the future. Our economy should be highly competitive, open, and based on social justice. It should incorporate a green and digital economy, as well as a competitive export market. We are making efforts to reach that stage, and we seek the support of everyone to make it a reality. Do not focus on short-term politics; instead, let us think about the future, specifically 2048, and work towards making Sri Lanka a developed country. We must not repeat the mistake of making false promises to win support for today and tomorrow. Instead, we must adopt a new path towards a competitive, open, green, and digital economy that is socially just, especially focused on the export market, and built for the benefit of todays youth and children. To achieve this goal, we must break away from the old political system and embrace change. As members of the United National Party, we must become a party of the future, thinking anew and striving to transform Sri Lanka. This is my appeal to all of you. My intention is to address the ethnic problem in the country while implementing the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. We are currently in discussions and I hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution by the end of this year. It is important for us to move forward while respecting and protecting the rights of all communities including the majority Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and Burgher minorities without marginalizing anyone. We are all committed to achieving this goal. Another issue that we need to address is the growing demand for change in our political and economic systems, particularly from the youth. As leaders, it is our responsibility to listen to their voices and take action. To this end, we have decided to appoint five youth representatives to both the Selection Committees and Monitoring Committees of the Parliament, which will be completed by May. Additionally, we plan to submit the Jana Sabha draft to the Parliament, following former Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas proposal. Let us work together towards building a new, competitive, and sustainable economy that is inclusive and just for all communities in Sri Lanka. As we strive towards this common goal, we must also move forward with a new constitution that reflects our shared values and aspirations. I call on everyone to join hands and build a better future for our beloved country. Hence, I urge all members of the United National Party to embark on this new path. During the last election, some MPs from the SJB chose to abstain from voting. We all share the same goal of building an open economy. Therefore, let us unite and work together by forming a parliament and a government. To the Tamil parties, I say that it is futile to distance oneself from this endeavor. If we are to address the issues faced by the Tamil community in this country, let us collaborate within this system, particularly in the Parliament as part of the government. After sharing the Cabinet proposals on the new program with the parties and discussing them with the National Councils of the Parliament, we have now achieved a broad consensus on the matter. This twenty-five-year program is an ambitious one, but with the support and cooperation of all, we can move forward without fear. It is our commitment to implement this program and develop our country to its fullest potential. As we embark on this journey, I hope to have the support of all of you. Addressing the May-Day celebration at the Sugathadasa Stadium United National Party Deputy Leader Presidential Senior Adviser on Climate Change Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene: I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who joined us in the UNP May Day celebration to commemorate the Working Peoples Day. It is the United National Party that has always fought for and protected the rights of the working people in our country. The UNP established factories and provided job opportunities, enabling the working people to lead a better life. Furthermore, the UNP introduced several measures to ensure professional rights, including the right to education. We created the middle school system to expand the educational horizons of the children of the working people. While some parties turned the working people into an oppressed class and confined them to agitational struggles, the UNP never arrested the working people for protests. Instead, we aimed to provide them with the necessary privileges to live fulfilling lives. For the working people to enjoy these privileges, we need a strong economy. Our country should be developed and not remain in the developing stage. However, to achieve this goal, we need to change the traditional political system. In the past, some political parties ruled based on short-term policies, which brought happiness to the people for a short time. If we want long-lasting development, we need to make long-term policies and plans. This is why President Ranil Wickremesinghe introduced the Jayagamu 2048 program. Though most of us may not be alive in 2048, we need to give our children the opportunity to live in a developed country. Mr. Wickremesinghe presented this program, and we must support the President to implement it successfully. If we work towards this goal, we can stand amongst developed countries in the future. To achieve our aim, we must put aside our party differences and work together. President Wickremesinghe will take the lead on this platform, and with your support both now and in the future, we can achieve our goals. I am grateful for your unwavering support and respect. UNP National Organizer, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security  Chief of Presidential Staff Mr Sagala Ratnayake  When we think of May Day, we often imagine hardworking labourers drenched in sweat. However, the younger generation sees a different picture  a young person working on a computer or in a modern factory. After gaining independence, UNP leaders focused on industrialization, free healthcare, and industrial parks in the country. Its important to consider if this progress is still present today, as changing policies with each new government has been a long-standing weakness in the country. In 2019, when the government changed and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes administration was pushed to the opposition, the policies also changed, leading to a crisis in the country. But when the crisis hit, Mr. Wickremesinghe stepped in as the President and took responsibility for the country. He revamped the tax policy, changing it to a modern policy that takes from the wealthy. Although it was a difficult decision, the President realized the importance of increasing indirect taxes and income tax to stabilize the economy. Mr. Wickremesinghe also worked to eliminate gas and fuel queues and managed foreign relations properly. Measures were taken to stabilize and reorganize the economy. Fertilizer was provided during the Yala and Maha seasons, resulting in a good harvest. Import restrictions were put in place to protect foreign exchange, but now, with the economy gaining stability, the government is taking steps to relax them. The tourism industry is improving, and the rupee is strengthening. When Mr. Wickremesinghe took over as President, the inflation rate was at 70 percent. By the end of last month, it had decreased to 50 percent, and the government aims to bring it down to single digits by the end of this year. The foreign reserves, which were previously zero, now stand at 1.3 million US dollars, and commodity prices are decreasing. Due to existing agreements with the International Monetary Fund, the people of the country are already benefiting from these changes. To achieve the countrys development goals in 2048, we must focus on developing the tourism industry, creating industries, attracting investors, developing renewable energy, and strengthening the economy. Mr. Wickremesinghe has a vision and mission to lead this program, and we must all work together to make it successful. United National Party Chairman, Member of Parliament Mr. Wajira Abeywardena  As I listened to the Presidents important message on May Day, I couldnt help but feel proud of my party and our commitment to protecting the future of our country. Despite the partys past struggles, the majority of people in this gathering have continued to believe in our cause. I believe that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is more than qualified to lead our nation, despite some questioning his qualifications. For nearly thirty years after 1994, foreign and domestic forces were in constant conflict, but Mr. Wickremesinghe has always been a leader who stood strong. His resilience in the face of countless attempts to put him down has been admirable. Tragically, past leaders of our party who tried to recover the country met untimely deaths, some even on the streets. Fortunately, Mr. Wickremesinghe, a leader who can save our bankrupt country, has been protected. Thanks to his leadership, people from all over Sri Lanka have come together to Colombo for the May Day celebrations in Colombo. Since taking office as President, he has provided diesel, petrol, and fertilizer without fail. Its important to support him regardless of caste or religion. Mr. Wickremesinghe is the only leader who can raise Sri Lanka to the top of the world and Asia. President Wickremesinghe is also working to make the whole parliament a government, just as Mr. D.S. Senanayake brought together all the political parties to win the countrys independence from imperialists. The recent protest that resulted in setting fire to the house of President Wickremesinghe was a shocking reminder of the risks he faces, but he did not falter. Its clear that we have no other choice than to support him in achieving the goal of a developed country by 2048 through protecting and strengthening national leadership. UNP General Secretary Mr Palitha Range Bandara  Today, I am filled with great pride as I stand at Sugathadasa Home Stadium on International Labour Day, under the blessings of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. As a political leader, it is my role to take on major challenges and emerge victorious. The United National Party, of which I am a proud member, has always accepted challenges and emerged triumphant. Throughout history, our party has fearlessly faced challenges, unlike other political parties who have shied away from them. Our founder, Mahamanya Mr.D. S. Senanayake, was a true leader who took on the responsibility of freeing our country from imperialism and creating a free motherland without any bloodshed. Following in his footsteps, Mr. J.R. Jayawardene took over a country that was in shambles and transformed it into a thriving nation that was no longer marginalized on the world stage. Our party has always prioritized leaders who accept and overcome challenges, and this legacy continues to this day. As a proud citizen of this country, I can attest that there was a time when the people did not elect Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as their president. However, he never held any animosity towards the people and instead dedicated himself to serving the country. In 2001, the countrys economy had completely collapsed and Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe took on the role of Prime Minister. Within three months, he transformed the economy from negative growth to a thriving one. Even in 2015, he continued to lead the country with his exceptional management skills as the Prime Minister. And as the President in 2022, he accepted the challenge of bringing the bankrupt state under proper control. Throughout history, United National Party leaders have always taken on challenges to move the country forward. As a party, our theme is to transform the country into a developed state by 2048, giving the people an opportunity to enjoy and live in a developed nation. Our leaders have a clear plan to develop the country, and none have shown more vision and sacrifice than Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is the only leader with a vision to build this country and bring it to its full potential. Let us all unite and support the program to achieve the goal of making our country a fully developed state by 2048. Mr. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Deputy Leader of the United National Party  Last year, we celebrated May Day in a very difficult time as the United National Party. It was said that the coffin of our party was nailed when we lost the 1956 election. It was said that we were buried in 1970. In 1988 the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna tried to destroy us with the T56. In 1993, the LTTE tried to destroy our former leaders with bombs. In 2020, they split the party into two and tried to destroy us. But today, we have become the party that decides the future of the country. In the end, the leader of our party became the president of the country. When this country collapsed, none other than Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe took up the challenge. Today, he is taking this country forward step by step. You all know that he embarked on this journey amid many insults and smear campaigns. Some people said that maybe he would take revenge after becoming the president. But he did not take revenge on anyone. What he did was to make the country internationally recognized at a time when this country had no recognition. Today, the Opposition is facing a great fivefold tragedy as there are no fuel queues, no power cuts, lower petrol and no gas queues and price hikes, and since the country has received IMF assistance. The opposition used these issues that were affecting the country to further their political aims. President J.R. Jayawardene became president after he turned 70. He was president twice. And today, President Ranil Wickremesinghe will become the President of this country upon reaching 70. He has made a big change in this country, created a better future for the youth, and is shouldering the program of building a developed country by 2048. Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake  As a former Minister, I understand the significance of May Day. Today, we celebrate it at a crucial juncture. In the past, we had an era of queuing. However, the current leadership has solved those problems and brought the country forward. This issue has impacted not just the working population, but also the countrys investors. It is time for us to think differently. We should no longer fight just for our rights, but also for the country to enter a new era. We need to create an environment in our country where investors can run their businesses successfully. There should be a peaceful environment in the country where everyone can live and benefit, including the working people. It is important for us to understand this reality. Today, on this May Day, we wake up with a new perspective. Lets put the country first and work towards its development. If we work for the country, there will be no need to fight for our rights. Those rights will always reach us. To strengthen the countrys economy, there must be reconciliation between the working people and the investors. I deliberately used the term working people instead of workers on purpose. When we think of a worker, we only think of a hired labourer, a farm worker, or a mine worker. However, todays situation has changed with the universal shift towards digitization. Radical changes have taken place, and that difference is visible today. Therefore, we must work towards enhancing the countrys economy and creating an environment where everyone can benefit. Minister of Tourism and Lands Mr. Harin Fernando  As I listen to the Presidents address, I feel an immense sense of joy. This is the President of my political party, and I cant help but wonder if we could hold a parade to celebrate. The Presidents speech had a clear aim and vision, setting us apart from other political parties. Without a clear direction, no one can make progress, which is why the leadership of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who served as Prime Minister six times, is crucial. Those who shied away from challenges in the past are no longer relevant today. It will take time for our party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, to overcome our obstacles, but we are making progress. The President has given me an important task to lead. As the Minister of Tourism, I am working tirelessly to ensure that our country becomes the number one tourist destination in the world next year. The amount received from the IMF is not as significant as the 2.5 billion that my Ministry, the Ministry of Tourism, and the Ministry of Foreign Employment have generated so far. If we continue to work towards our goal and make the right changes, building a prosperous country is not impossible. The Presidents vision is not just for the present, but for future generations. He wants to save the country for our children and grandchildren, which is why he has set his sights on winning in 2048. A year ago, we had no oil, and people struggled to feed themselves. Thanks to the efforts of Ranil Wickremesinghe, that period is now behind us. Our May Day theme is Winning 2048, which sets us apart from the main opposition, who only want to cause conflict. We want to empower our youth to become entrepreneurs and take ownership of their futures. The President believes that we cannot waste time answering the questions of those who are not invested in our countrys progress. Instead, we must focus on transforming employees into entrepreneurs who can contribute to our economy. As a member of the UNP, I know that we are an unbeatable force when we work together. Lets take the theme of winning in 2048 to every village and junction in the country. Even if we are not alive in 2048, we can create a better tomorrow for our children. Lets join hands and work towards a brighter future for Sri Lanka. The resolution presented by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Mr. Manusha Nanayakkara at the United National Party May Day celebration- At the United National Party May Day celebration, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Mr. Manusha Nanayakkara presented a resolution that addressed the situation of workers during the economic collapse caused by the last Covid epidemic. He criticized those who used workers as a political tool instead of ensuring their safety and well-being. However, as a party that values universal virtues and promotes freedom from narrow frameworks, and having a responsibility towards the future of employees, it was us who established the Employees Trust Fund and increased the interest rate given to the Employees Provident Fund, making informal employees into regular employees, introduced a compensation formula when dismissing employees, introduced the Labour Disputes Act, and had the Gratuity Act passed. It should be reminded that it was us who took steps towards establishing financial stability and not them. As a party with universal virtues that won freedom for the country, freed from racist, religious, and narrow frameworks, as well as a party with liberal results, I have submitted the following proposals for the security of human resources for a better tomorrow. The interest rate provided by the Employees Provident Fund. We also aim to formalize informal employees and provide them with regular employee benefits. In addition, we plan to introduce a compensation formula that would protect the rights of employees when they are dismissed. We aim to bring the Labor Disputes Act into effect to ensure fair resolution of disputes between employers and employees. Finally, we propose to pass the Gratuity Act to ensure that employees receive gratuity payments upon leaving their jobs. It is important to remember that it was our party that took steps towards establishing financial stability in the country, and not our opponents. As a party that values human resources and their contributions to the economy, we will continue to strive towards providing them with the security they deserve. The resolution presented proposals for the security of human resources in the future, including: 1. A unified labour legal system that promotes small and medium entrepreneurship, creates a strong entrepreneur, and safeguards labour rights while ensuring the sustainable safety and social security of the worker should be formulated and adopted in the legislature. 2. An active and effective program should be implemented to increase the number of workers who contribute to the Employees Provident Fund, increase the number of contributing institutions, and include informal sector employees in the fund. 3. An extensive social security network should be implemented to stabilize the countrys open economic policy. This includes implementing a wide social security network for workers in the unorganized sector, who are not included in formal social security systems, and a contributory unemployment insurance system for employment termination or loss, similar to developed countries. 4. Strategic programs should be implemented to create a human resource suitable for the modern world of work, which aligns with the strategic plan for a developed country in 2048. 5. The labour and foreign employment sectors should be digitized to create an economically productive human resource and ensure the safety and welfare of expatriate workers. 6. Legal provisions should be established to ensure the safety and health of workers in all workplaces, recognizing occupational safety and health as a fundamental right, as recognized by the International Labour Organization. 7. A formal legal framework should be formulated to prevent gender-based discrimination in the workplace, increase womens labour force participation, and provide maternity benefits to employed women through a social security fund. 8. A program should be created to protect the dignity, professionalism, and rights and welfare of workers in any profession. 9. Steps should be taken to encourage disabled and persons with special needs as human resources. 10. A plantation worker fit for the modern world of work should be created with strong rights and welfare. 11. A national market information system based on private and public labour markets should be implemented to gather big data for policy formulation for future technological changes in the world of work. --PMD",

        "content": "The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) says that bus fares will not be revised although the price of diesel has been reduced by Rs. 15. Joining a press briefing today (May 01), the President of the association Gamunu Wijeratne stressed that the transport minister has not taken any measures in order to provide quality public transport services. Although the minister held the position all the time in the recent past, he did not work to provide a quality public transport service. At present the people have to suffer the consequences of that. He also claimed that in particular, they are practically unable to provide the benefit for the people even if diesel has been reduced by Rs. 15. The reason is that by reducing the fare by one or two rupees, the people will not receive that benefit practically. Even we dont get it, he alleged. Commenting further, Wijeratne pointed out that the union has decided to have a certain system which allows people to pay the fare with a debit card on an electronic system, with or without the conductor, where they can definitely provide this relief to the people. If the government provides that project tomorrow, we can reduce the bus fare tomorrow. Otherwise, there is absolutely no way we can reduce this bus fare, since people will not receive this relief in practice in this manner, he stressed.",

        "title": "Erdogan says Turkish forces killed IS chief in Syria",
        "date": "May 1, 2023 03:09 pm",
        "content": "Turkish forces have killed the leader of the Islamic State group during an operation in Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said late Sunday. Recep Tayyip Erdogan told TRT Turk television in an interview that the IS leader, code-named Abu Hussein al-Qurayshi, was killed in a strike conducted on Saturday. Erdogan said the Turkish intelligence agency, MIT, had been following him for a long time. We will continue our struggle against terrorist organizations without discriminating against any of them, Erdogan said in the interview. A member of the Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces military police told The Associated Press that the MIT clashed with IS militants on a farm in the village of Miska in Aleppo province late Friday night. As the fighting intensified, Al-Qurayshi, who was hiding in a building on the farm, blew himself up. Investigators were searching the hideout for evidence and other information. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitor added that Turkish drones flew over the area, as Turkish-backed Syrian opposition groups closed off roads leading to the area where the clashes took place after Ankara put them on high alert. There was no immediate confirmation from the IS group. Turkey has conducted numerous operations against IS and Kurdish groups along the Syrian border, capturing or killing suspected militants. The country controls large swaths of territory in northern Syria following a series of land incursions to drive Kurdish groups away from the Turkish-Syrian border. Abu Hussein al-Qurayshi was named leader of the militant group after its previous chief was killed in October, with an IS spokesman calling him one of the veteran warriors and one of the loyal sons of the Islamic State. He took over leadership of IS at a time when the extremist group has lost control of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria. However, he had been trying to rise again, with sleeper cells carrying out deadly attacks in both countries. Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hunted down by U.S. forces in a raid in northwest Syria in October 2019. His successor, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, was killed in a similar raid in February 2022. He was followed by Abu al-Hassan al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, who according to the U.S. military was killed in mid-October in an operation by Syrian rebels in Syrias southern province of Daraa. None of the al-Qurayshis are believed to be related. Al-Qurayshi is not their real name but comes from Quraish, the name of the tribe to which Islams Prophet Muhammad belonged. IS claims its leaders hail from this tribe and al-Qurayshi serves as part of an IS leaders nom de guerre. The Islamic State group broke away from al-Qaida about a decade ago and ended up controlling large parts of northern and eastern Syria as well as northern and western Iraq. In 2014, the extremists declared their so-called caliphate, attracting supporters from around the world. In the following years, they claimed attacks throughout the world that killed and wounded hundreds of people before coming under attack from different sides. In March 2019, U.S.-backed Syrian fighters captured the last sliver of land the extremists once held in Syrias eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq.

        "date": "May 1, 2023 04:30 pm",
        "content": "A Chinese state-owned firm said on Monday it plans to take its investment in Sri Lanka to 2 billion by building a major logistics hub. Sri Lanka is looking to kickstart its economic recovery after defaulting on its foreign debt last year, when shortages of essentials such as food, fuel and medicines sparked widespread anti-government protests. The investment by the China Merchants Group in a large logistics complex at Colombo Port, with an estimated construction cost of 392 million, is the first major foreign investment in Sri Lanka since the default. The logistics centre project will take CMGs accumulated investment in Sri Lanka to... over 2 billion US dollars, making it the largest foreign investment enterprise in the island, the company said in a statement on Monday. CMG will have a 70 percent stake in the company set up to build the logistics complex at Colombo, the only deep-sea port between Dubai and Singapore. Describing the project as South Asias largest logistics hub, CMG said it expects to complete it by the end of 2025. CMG also manages the port complex at Hambantota on the southern tip of Sri Lanka. That port was considered among the white-elephant projects launched by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ruled the country for a decade until 2015. Rajapaksa borrowed heavily from China for projects that many criticised as a debt trap that led to the worst economic crisis in Sri Lankas history. Unable to repay a huge loan taken from China in 2017 to build Hambantota port, Sri Lanka handed it over to CMG for 1.12 billion on a 99-year lease. China has loaned billions for projects in Asia, Africa and Europe under its gargantuan Belt and Road Initiative, which critics say is saddling nations with debt. Neighbouring India as well as the United States have also expressed concern about China gaining a naval advantage in the Indian Ocean with its access to Sri Lankas ports. Sri Lanka has insisted that its ports will not be used for any military purposes. Source - AFP -Agencies",

French unions pushed the president to scrap a higher retirement age. South Koreans pleaded for higher wages. Spanish lawyers demanded the right to take days off. Migrant domestic workers in Lebanon marched in a country plunged in economic crisis. While May Day is marked around the world on May 1 as a celebration of labor rights, this years rallies tapped into broader frustrations. Climate activists spraypainted a Louis Vuitton museum in Paris, and protesters in Germany demonstrated against violence targeting women and LGBTQ people. Celebrations were forced indoors in Pakistan and tinged with political tensions in Turkey, as both countries face high-stakes elections. Russias war in Ukraine overshadowed scaled-back events in Moscow, where Communist-led May Day celebrations were once massive affairs. Across Asia, this years May Day events unleashed pent-up frustration after three years of COVID-19 restrictions. This years events had bigger turnouts than in previous years in Asian cities, as activists in many countries argued governments should do more to improve workers lives. Across France, thousands marched in what unions hope are the countrys biggest May Day demonstrations in years, mobilized against President Emmanuel Macrons recent move to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Organizers see the pension reform as a threat to hard-fought worker rights, while Macron argues its economically necessary as the population ages. The monthslong protest movement shows workers hope to be treated differently, Laurent Berger, head of the influential moderate union CFDT, said at the Paris march Monday. While marchers appeared largely peaceful, police detained 22 people in Paris and dispersed protesters in Lyon with tear gas after troublemakers smashed bank windows and other property. French police have come under fire for using drones to film disruptions on Monday in some cities. Union members marched from Calais in the north to Toulouse in the south, joined by environmental activists and other groups fighting for economic justice, or just expressing anger at Macron and what is seen as his out-of-touch, pro-business leadership. Activists opposed to the 2024 Paris Olympics and their impact on society and the environment also demonstrated. In Turkey, police prevented a group of demonstrators from reaching Istanbuls main square, Taksim, and detained around a dozen protesters, the independent television station Sozcu reported. Journalists trying to film demonstrators being forcibly moved into police vans were also pushed back or detained. The square has symbolic importance for Turkeys trade unions after unknown gunmen opened fire on people celebrating May Day at Taksim in 1977, causing a stampede. Dozens were killed. President Recep Tayyip Erdogans government has declared Taksim off-limits to demonstrations, though small groups were allowed to enter Taksim to lay wreaths at a monument there. In Pakistan, authorities banned rallies in some cities because of a tense security situation or political atmosphere. In Peshawar, in the countrys restive northwest, labor organizations and trade unions held indoor events to demand better workers rights amid high inflation. In the eastern city of Lahore, where political parties are barred from holding rallies before a local May 14 poll, a workers march converged on the Punjab Assembly. More than 70 marches were held across Spain, led by the countrys powerful unions, who warned of social conflict if low salaries compared to the EU average dont rise in line with inflation. They also praised incentives to move Spain to a four-day working week. Blue-collar workers led the protests, but white-collar professionals were also making demands in a country that stills bears the scars of previous recessions, and where the working day is traditionally long. The Illustrious College of Lawyers of Madrid urged reforms of historic laws that require them to be on call 365 days of the year, regardless of the death of family members or medical emergencies. In the last few years, lawyers have tweeted images of themselves working from hospital beds on IV drips to illustrate the problem. In South Korea, tens of thousands of people attended various rallies in its biggest May Day gatherings since the pandemic began in early 2020. The price of everything has increased except for our wages. Increase our minimum wages! an activist at a Seoul rally shouted at the podium. Reduce our working hours! In Tokyo, thousands of labor union members, opposition lawmakers and academics demanded wage increases to offset the impact of rising costs as they recover from damage from the pandemic. They criticized Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishidas plan to double the defense budget, and said the money should be spent on welfare, social security and improving peoples daily lives. Kishida has promised to focus on raising wages. In Indonesia, people attending the rally demanded the government repeal a job creation law they argue would benefit business at the expense of workers and the environment. Job Creation Law must be repealed, protester Sri Ajeng said. Its only oriented to benefit employers, not workers. In Taiwan, thousands of workers protested what they call the inadequacies of the self-ruled islands labor policies, putting pressure on the ruling party before the 2024 presidential election. Gathering in the capital, Taipei, medical workers wearing protective gear held placards with messages calling for subsidies, while others held banners criticizing President Tsai Ing-wens labor polices. In Lebanon, hundreds of Communist Party and trade syndicate members, as well as a group of migrant domestic workers, marched through downtown Beirut. The country is in the throes of a crippling economic crisis and spiraling inflation, with around 75 of the population now living in poverty. Protests in Germany kicked off with a Take Back the Night rally organized by feminist and queer groups on the eve of May Day to protest against violence directed at women and LGBTQ people. Several thousand people took part in the march, which was largely peaceful despite occasional clashes between participants and police. Numerous further rallies by labor unions and leftist groups are planned in Germany on Monday. Elsewhere, some communities held May Day festivals that harkened back to pagan ceremonies celebrating spring. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "May 1, 2023 08:48 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the United National Party May Day celebrations held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo today (01) through video technology, said that the country should not focus on short-term politics; instead, we should think about the future, specifically 2048, and work towards making Sri Lanka a developed country. He extended an invitation to all UNP members to transform the party into one that breaks free from traditional politics and charts a new path towards progress for the country, the PMD reported. The President also spoke about the importance of addressing the ethnic problem and reaching an agreement by the end of the year. He emphasized the need for all parties to come together and work towards a resolution that benefits all communities in Sri Lanka. In his address, President Wickremesinghe also reflected on Sri Lankas history as a country with the second strongest economy in Asia. He credited the progress made by leaders such as Mr. D.S. Senanayake and J.R. Jayawardene who took the country forward with the open economy. Furthermore, the President highlighted his commitment to rebuilding Sri Lanka according to President Jayawardenes program. With the support of the UNP and its members, he is determined to make Sri Lanka a stronger and more prosperous nation. He emphasized that the UNP is a party that always prioritizes the countrys interests and engages in policy-based politics. The President also highlighted that the partys policy is to always be truthful with the people. President Wickremesinghe recalled that the UNP was the first party to state in its election manifesto the need to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to address the economic crisis, while other parties were making promises that they could not keep. The President acknowledged that the UNP had to face criticism for its stance, but stood by its policy. The President stated that he expects to reach an agreement by the end of the year to solve the ethnic problem that has been a long-standing issue in the country. With the UNPs commitment to policies that benefit all communities in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe expressed his optimism about achieving a resolution that is beneficial for everyone. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe virtually; After assuming the presidency, I have had the opportunity to address the United National Party and all of you who support the party. When I took office as president, the country was experiencing its worst economic crisis in 30 years. The economy had completely collapsed, and people were suffering from shortages of food and fuel, leading to protests on the streets. Additionally, some individuals attempted to exploit this crisis to undermine the democratic system and the parliament. Today, the countrys economy has achieved stability, with no shortage of food, and a functional democratic system where the parliament operates without any threats. Furthermore, everyone has the opportunity to carry out their work without hindrance. Prior to assuming the presidency, I reflected on one thing: the United National Party prioritizes the welfare of the country. The United National Party is a political party that is close to my heart. In fact, in the United National Partys 2020 election manifesto, we explicitly stated our intention to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with a goal of securing 7 billion. As a party, we were the only ones who mentioned these critical points. On the other hand, other parties made empty promises they could not fulfil despite knowing the existence of the countrys economic problem. After honestly sharing our partys policies, the United National Party ended up in the national list. Our policy is to be transparent with the people, even if it means conveying unpleasant truths. We announced our goals for 2020 and 2021 without hesitation. As the economic crisis deepened in 2022, I met with the former President, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and recommended that he seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund. During the discussions on this matter, the former President summoned a meeting of the party leaders in parliament. While other opposition groups refused to attend, I, along with the Tamil National Alliance, actively participated in the discussions. My motivation was not rooted in politics, but in properly managing the countrys economy and alleviating the burdens on its citizens. For this reason, I took on the role of the presidency, as I had faith in my ability to revive the economy and work alongside supportive ministers to achieve these outcomes. My self-assuredness stemmed from my previous experience in successfully rebuilding the countrys economy after the governments collapse in 2001. During that time, I not only managed to revive the economy but also strengthened it. Similarly, in 2015, when the countrys economy faced a setback, I saw an opportunity to bolster it and achieve a primary budget surplus. With this confidence in mind, I accepted the responsibility to face the current economic crisis head-on. By now, we have been able to stabilize the countrys economy and establish a sense of political stability. The parliament is functioning smoothly, and many individuals are working within the frameworks of democracy and law. I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the ministers, MPs, political parties, organizations, and, most of all, the United National Party who have supported me throughout this process. Our progress thus far has been made possible through our agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which was recently approved by a majority vote in parliament last Friday. I would like to express my gratitude to MP Wajira Abeywardena, who represented the United National Party, as well as Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara, for their unwavering support in this matter. Without their contributions, we would not have been able to move forward. Our next step is to execute the IMF agreement and put in place the necessary rules and regulations to restore the countrys economy to a stable state by 2024. However, I am not content with just returning to the status quo. It is imperative that we move beyond our current economic system and establish an economy that can achieve a rapid GDP growth rate of 6  7 annually. To illustrate this point, I have two examples: one is from the time of DS Senanayake, where we had the second strongest economy in Asia and were even able to lend to England. The other is from the tenure of JR Jayawardena, where we advanced with an open economy, and Sri Lanka became the second country in Asia to adopt this system. After our success, China followed suit. Therefore, I am determined to pursue a new economic model that will elevate Sri Lankas economy to new heights and foster continued growth and prosperity for our citizens. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka must forge ahead once again. It is futile to compete with Afghanistan to determine who has the weakest economy. Instead, we must focus on building a robust and developed economy. Similar to the approach taken by J.R. Jayawardene, we must pursue numerous new projects and embrace the new economy to achieve our goals. Failure to do so will leave us with no future to look forward to. We must not only consider our own future but also that of our countrys youth. It is our responsibility to ensure that they inherit a prosperous and thriving Sri Lanka. Therefore, let us work together to implement new strategies and policies that will lay the foundation for a thriving economy and a better future for our citizens. As we approach the centenary of our independence in 2048, our goal should be to become a country with a developed economy, just like India aims to achieve in 2047 and China in 2049. Let 2048 be the year of development for Sri Lanka. We are not only building this economy for the present generation but also for the youth and children of the future. Our economy should be highly competitive, open, and based on social justice. It should incorporate a green and digital economy, as well as a competitive export market. We are making efforts to reach that stage, and we seek the support of everyone to make it a reality. Do not focus on short-term politics; instead, let us think about the future, specifically 2048, and work towards making Sri Lanka a developed country. We must not repeat the mistake of making false promises to win support for today and tomorrow. Instead, we must adopt a new path towards a competitive, open, green, and digital economy that is socially just, especially focused on the export market, and built for the benefit of todays youth and children. To achieve this goal, we must break away from the old political system and embrace change. As members of the United National Party, we must become a party of the future, thinking anew and striving to transform Sri Lanka. This is my appeal to all of you. My intention is to address the ethnic problem in the country while implementing the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. We are currently in discussions and I hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution by the end of this year. It is important for us to move forward while respecting and protecting the rights of all communities including the majority Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and Burgher minorities without marginalizing anyone. We are all committed to achieving this goal. Another issue that we need to address is the growing demand for change in our political and economic systems, particularly from the youth. As leaders, it is our responsibility to listen to their voices and take action. To this end, we have decided to appoint five youth representatives to both the Selection Committees and Monitoring Committees of the Parliament, which will be completed by May. Additionally, we plan to submit the Jana Sabha draft to the Parliament, following former Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas proposal. Let us work together towards building a new, competitive, and sustainable economy that is inclusive and just for all communities in Sri Lanka. As we strive towards this common goal, we must also move forward with a new constitution that reflects our shared values and aspirations. I call on everyone to join hands and build a better future for our beloved country. Hence, I urge all members of the United National Party to embark on this new path. During the last election, some MPs from the SJB chose to abstain from voting. We all share the same goal of building an open economy. Therefore, let us unite and work together by forming a parliament and a government. To the Tamil parties, I say that it is futile to distance oneself from this endeavor. If we are to address the issues faced by the Tamil community in this country, let us collaborate within this system, particularly in the Parliament as part of the government. After sharing the Cabinet proposals on the new program with the parties and discussing them with the National Councils of the Parliament, we have now achieved a broad consensus on the matter. This twenty-five-year program is an ambitious one, but with the support and cooperation of all, we can move forward without fear. It is our commitment to implement this program and develop our country to its fullest potential. As we embark on this journey, I hope to have the support of all of you. Addressing the May-Day celebration at the Sugathadasa Stadium United National Party Deputy Leader Presidential Senior Adviser on Climate Change Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene: I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who joined us in the UNP May Day celebration to commemorate the Working Peoples Day. It is the United National Party that has always fought for and protected the rights of the working people in our country. The UNP established factories and provided job opportunities, enabling the working people to lead a better life. Furthermore, the UNP introduced several measures to ensure professional rights, including the right to education. We created the middle school system to expand the educational horizons of the children of the working people. While some parties turned the working people into an oppressed class and confined them to agitational struggles, the UNP never arrested the working people for protests. Instead, we aimed to provide them with the necessary privileges to live fulfilling lives. For the working people to enjoy these privileges, we need a strong economy. Our country should be developed and not remain in the developing stage. However, to achieve this goal, we need to change the traditional political system. In the past, some political parties ruled based on short-term policies, which brought happiness to the people for a short time. If we want long-lasting development, we need to make long-term policies and plans. This is why President Ranil Wickremesinghe introduced the Jayagamu 2048 program. Though most of us may not be alive in 2048, we need to give our children the opportunity to live in a developed country. Mr. Wickremesinghe presented this program, and we must support the President to implement it successfully. If we work towards this goal, we can stand amongst developed countries in the future. To achieve our aim, we must put aside our party differences and work together. President Wickremesinghe will take the lead on this platform, and with your support both now and in the future, we can achieve our goals. I am grateful for your unwavering support and respect. UNP National Organizer, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security  Chief of Presidential Staff Mr Sagala Ratnayake  When we think of May Day, we often imagine hardworking labourers drenched in sweat. However, the younger generation sees a different picture  a young person working on a computer or in a modern factory. After gaining independence, UNP leaders focused on industrialization, free healthcare, and industrial parks in the country. Its important to consider if this progress is still present today, as changing policies with each new government has been a long-standing weakness in the country. In 2019, when the government changed and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes administration was pushed to the opposition, the policies also changed, leading to a crisis in the country. But when the crisis hit, Mr. Wickremesinghe stepped in as the President and took responsibility for the country. He revamped the tax policy, changing it to a modern policy that takes from the wealthy. Although it was a difficult decision, the President realized the importance of increasing indirect taxes and income tax to stabilize the economy. Mr. Wickremesinghe also worked to eliminate gas and fuel queues and managed foreign relations properly. Measures were taken to stabilize and reorganize the economy. Fertilizer was provided during the Yala and Maha seasons, resulting in a good harvest. Import restrictions were put in place to protect foreign exchange, but now, with the economy gaining stability, the government is taking steps to relax them. The tourism industry is improving, and the rupee is strengthening. When Mr. Wickremesinghe took over as President, the inflation rate was at 70 percent. By the end of last month, it had decreased to 50 percent, and the government aims to bring it down to single digits by the end of this year. The foreign reserves, which were previously zero, now stand at 1.3 million US dollars, and commodity prices are decreasing. Due to existing agreements with the International Monetary Fund, the people of the country are already benefiting from these changes. To achieve the countrys development goals in 2048, we must focus on developing the tourism industry, creating industries, attracting investors, developing renewable energy, and strengthening the economy. Mr. Wickremesinghe has a vision and mission to lead this program, and we must all work together to make it successful. United National Party Chairman, Member of Parliament Mr. Wajira Abeywardena  As I listened to the Presidents important message on May Day, I couldnt help but feel proud of my party and our commitment to protecting the future of our country. Despite the partys past struggles, the majority of people in this gathering have continued to believe in our cause. I believe that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is more than qualified to lead our nation, despite some questioning his qualifications. For nearly thirty years after 1994, foreign and domestic forces were in constant conflict, but Mr. Wickremesinghe has always been a leader who stood strong. His resilience in the face of countless attempts to put him down has been admirable. Tragically, past leaders of our party who tried to recover the country met untimely deaths, some even on the streets. Fortunately, Mr. Wickremesinghe, a leader who can save our bankrupt country, has been protected. Thanks to his leadership, people from all over Sri Lanka have come together to Colombo for the May Day celebrations in Colombo. Since taking office as President, he has provided diesel, petrol, and fertilizer without fail. Its important to support him regardless of caste or religion. Mr. Wickremesinghe is the only leader who can raise Sri Lanka to the top of the world and Asia. President Wickremesinghe is also working to make the whole parliament a government, just as Mr. D.S. Senanayake brought together all the political parties to win the countrys independence from imperialists. The recent protest that resulted in setting fire to the house of President Wickremesinghe was a shocking reminder of the risks he faces, but he did not falter. Its clear that we have no other choice than to support him in achieving the goal of a developed country by 2048 through protecting and strengthening national leadership. UNP General Secretary Mr Palitha Range Bandara  Today, I am filled with great pride as I stand at Sugathadasa Home Stadium on International Labour Day, under the blessings of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. As a political leader, it is my role to take on major challenges and emerge victorious. The United National Party, of which I am a proud member, has always accepted challenges and emerged triumphant. Throughout history, our party has fearlessly faced challenges, unlike other political parties who have shied away from them. Our founder, Mahamanya Mr.D. S. Senanayake, was a true leader who took on the responsibility of freeing our country from imperialism and creating a free motherland without any bloodshed. Following in his footsteps, Mr. J.R. Jayawardene took over a country that was in shambles and transformed it into a thriving nation that was no longer marginalized on the world stage. Our party has always prioritized leaders who accept and overcome challenges, and this legacy continues to this day. As a proud citizen of this country, I can attest that there was a time when the people did not elect Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as their president. However, he never held any animosity towards the people and instead dedicated himself to serving the country. In 2001, the countrys economy had completely collapsed and Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe took on the role of Prime Minister. Within three months, he transformed the economy from negative growth to a thriving one. Even in 2015, he continued to lead the country with his exceptional management skills as the Prime Minister. And as the President in 2022, he accepted the challenge of bringing the bankrupt state under proper control. Throughout history, United National Party leaders have always taken on challenges to move the country forward. As a party, our theme is to transform the country into a developed state by 2048, giving the people an opportunity to enjoy and live in a developed nation. Our leaders have a clear plan to develop the country, and none have shown more vision and sacrifice than Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is the only leader with a vision to build this country and bring it to its full potential. Let us all unite and support the program to achieve the goal of making our country a fully developed state by 2048. Mr. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Deputy Leader of the United National Party  Last year, we celebrated May Day in a very difficult time as the United National Party. It was said that the coffin of our party was nailed when we lost the 1956 election. It was said that we were buried in 1970. In 1988 the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna tried to destroy us with the T56. In 1993, the LTTE tried to destroy our former leaders with bombs. In 2020, they split the party into two and tried to destroy us. But today, we have become the party that decides the future of the country. In the end, the leader of our party became the president of the country. When this country collapsed, none other than Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe took up the challenge. Today, he is taking this country forward step by step. You all know that he embarked on this journey amid many insults and smear campaigns. Some people said that maybe he would take revenge after becoming the president. But he did not take revenge on anyone. What he did was to make the country internationally recognized at a time when this country had no recognition. Today, the Opposition is facing a great fivefold tragedy as there are no fuel queues, no power cuts, lower petrol and no gas queues and price hikes, and since the country has received IMF assistance. The opposition used these issues that were affecting the country to further their political aims. President J.R. Jayawardene became president after he turned 70. He was president twice. And today, President Ranil Wickremesinghe will become the President of this country upon reaching 70. He has made a big change in this country, created a better future for the youth, and is shouldering the program of building a developed country by 2048. Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake  As a former Minister, I understand the significance of May Day. Today, we celebrate it at a crucial juncture. In the past, we had an era of queuing. However, the current leadership has solved those problems and brought the country forward. This issue has impacted not just the working population, but also the countrys investors. It is time for us to think differently. We should no longer fight just for our rights, but also for the country to enter a new era. We need to create an environment in our country where investors can run their businesses successfully. There should be a peaceful environment in the country where everyone can live and benefit, including the working people. It is important for us to understand this reality. Today, on this May Day, we wake up with a new perspective. Lets put the country first and work towards its development. If we work for the country, there will be no need to fight for our rights. Those rights will always reach us. To strengthen the countrys economy, there must be reconciliation between the working people and the investors. I deliberately used the term working people instead of workers on purpose. When we think of a worker, we only think of a hired labourer, a farm worker, or a mine worker. However, todays situation has changed with the universal shift towards digitization. Radical changes have taken place, and that difference is visible today. Therefore, we must work towards enhancing the countrys economy and creating an environment where everyone can benefit. Minister of Tourism and Lands Mr. Harin Fernando  As I listen to the Presidents address, I feel an immense sense of joy. This is the President of my political party, and I cant help but wonder if we could hold a parade to celebrate. The Presidents speech had a clear aim and vision, setting us apart from other political parties. Without a clear direction, no one can make progress, which is why the leadership of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who served as Prime Minister six times, is crucial. Those who shied away from challenges in the past are no longer relevant today. It will take time for our party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, to overcome our obstacles, but we are making progress. The President has given me an important task to lead. As the Minister of Tourism, I am working tirelessly to ensure that our country becomes the number one tourist destination in the world next year. The amount received from the IMF is not as significant as the 2.5 billion that my Ministry, the Ministry of Tourism, and the Ministry of Foreign Employment have generated so far. If we continue to work towards our goal and make the right changes, building a prosperous country is not impossible. The Presidents vision is not just for the present, but for future generations. He wants to save the country for our children and grandchildren, which is why he has set his sights on winning in 2048. A year ago, we had no oil, and people struggled to feed themselves. Thanks to the efforts of Ranil Wickremesinghe, that period is now behind us. Our May Day theme is Winning 2048, which sets us apart from the main opposition, who only want to cause conflict. We want to empower our youth to become entrepreneurs and take ownership of their futures. The President believes that we cannot waste time answering the questions of those who are not invested in our countrys progress. Instead, we must focus on transforming employees into entrepreneurs who can contribute to our economy. As a member of the UNP, I know that we are an unbeatable force when we work together. Lets take the theme of winning in 2048 to every village and junction in the country. Even if we are not alive in 2048, we can create a better tomorrow for our children. Lets join hands and work towards a brighter future for Sri Lanka. The resolution presented by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Mr. Manusha Nanayakkara at the United National Party May Day celebration- At the United National Party May Day celebration, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Mr. Manusha Nanayakkara presented a resolution that addressed the situation of workers during the economic collapse caused by the last Covid epidemic. He criticized those who used workers as a political tool instead of ensuring their safety and well-being. However, as a party that values universal virtues and promotes freedom from narrow frameworks, and having a responsibility towards the future of employees, it was us who established the Employees Trust Fund and increased the interest rate given to the Employees Provident Fund, making informal employees into regular employees, introduced a compensation formula when dismissing employees, introduced the Labour Disputes Act, and had the Gratuity Act passed. It should be reminded that it was us who took steps towards establishing financial stability and not them. As a party with universal virtues that won freedom for the country, freed from racist, religious, and narrow frameworks, as well as a party with liberal results, I have submitted the following proposals for the security of human resources for a better tomorrow. The interest rate provided by the Employees Provident Fund. We also aim to formalize informal employees and provide them with regular employee benefits. In addition, we plan to introduce a compensation formula that would protect the rights of employees when they are dismissed. We aim to bring the Labor Disputes Act into effect to ensure fair resolution of disputes between employers and employees. Finally, we propose to pass the Gratuity Act to ensure that employees receive gratuity payments upon leaving their jobs. It is important to remember that it was our party that took steps towards establishing financial stability in the country, and not our opponents. As a party that values human resources and their contributions to the economy, we will continue to strive towards providing them with the security they deserve. The resolution presented proposals for the security of human resources in the future, including: 1. A unified labour legal system that promotes small and medium entrepreneurship, creates a strong entrepreneur, and safeguards labour rights while ensuring the sustainable safety and social security of the worker should be formulated and adopted in the legislature. 2. An active and effective program should be implemented to increase the number of workers who contribute to the Employees Provident Fund, increase the number of contributing institutions, and include informal sector employees in the fund. 3. An extensive social security network should be implemented to stabilize the countrys open economic policy. This includes implementing a wide social security network for workers in the unorganized sector, who are not included in formal social security systems, and a contributory unemployment insurance system for employment termination or loss, similar to developed countries. 4. Strategic programs should be implemented to create a human resource suitable for the modern world of work, which aligns with the strategic plan for a developed country in 2048. 5. The labour and foreign employment sectors should be digitized to create an economically productive human resource and ensure the safety and welfare of expatriate workers. 6. Legal provisions should be established to ensure the safety and health of workers in all workplaces, recognizing occupational safety and health as a fundamental right, as recognized by the International Labour Organization. 7. A formal legal framework should be formulated to prevent gender-based discrimination in the workplace, increase womens labour force participation, and provide maternity benefits to employed women through a social security fund. 8. A program should be created to protect the dignity, professionalism, and rights and welfare of workers in any profession. 9. Steps should be taken to encourage disabled and persons with special needs as human resources. 10. A plantation worker fit for the modern world of work should be created with strong rights and welfare. 11. A national market information system based on private and public labour markets should be implemented to gather big data for policy formulation for future technological changes in the world of work. --PMD",

        "title": "Janet Yellen warns US could run out of cash by June 1",
        "date": "May 2, 2023 07:59 am",
        "content": "The United States could run out of money to pay its financial obligations - risking a catastrophic default - as early as the start of June, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday (May 1), as policymakers tussle over raising the debt ceiling. Last week, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to lift the national borrowing limit, but only with drastic cuts as they sought a showdown with President Joe Biden, a Democrat, over what they see as excessive spending. Republicans were determined to muscle the Limit, Save, Grow Act through the lower chamber of Congress to strengthen their position in negotiations with Biden, who has refused to agree to spending cuts. But the act has no chance of becoming law as it is opposed by Democrats controlling the Senate and White House. The impasse has raised the possibility of Congress and White House overseeing the first national debt default. Our best estimate is that we will be unable to continue to satisfy all of the governments obligations by early June, and potentially as early as Jun 1, if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time, said Yellen on Monday, in a letter addressed to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other leaders. While the United States hit its US31.4 trillion borrowing limit in January, the Treasury has taken extraordinary measures that allow it to continue financing the governments activities. But if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before current tools are exhausted, the government risks defaulting on payment obligations, with profound implications for the economy. Given the current projections, it is imperative that Congress act as soon as possible to increase or suspend the debt limit in a way that provides longer-term certainty that the government will continue to make its payments, Yellen said. BIDEN-MCCARTHY TALKS The White House said late on Monday that Biden called McCarthy that afternoon to invite him to a meeting on May 9 with the other chief Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress. A source familiar with negotiations told AFP that Biden spoke on Monday with McCarthy on extending the national debt and avoiding a default. As head of the narrow Republican majority in the House, McCarthy has primary control over US budget issues. In a statement late on Monday, McCarthy appeared unbowed, accusing Biden of threatening to bumble our nation into its first ever default. He called on the president and the Senate to get to work - and soon to accept spending cuts and avert the crisis. In an earlier letter, Yellen said it was unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures would run out before early June. She added on Monday that the latest expectations are based on current available data and noted that the actual date when Treasury exhausts its measures could be a number of weeks later from the early June estimate. SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RISK Because tax receipts through April have been less than the Congressional Budget Office anticipated in February, we now estimate that there is a significantly greater risk that the Treasury will run out of funds in early June, said CBO director Phillip Swagel in a separate statement on Monday. In an earlier report, the CBO projected that extraordinary measures would likely be exhausted between July and September, although it also acknowledged uncertainty in its expectations. House Republicans are running out of time to avert an economic catastrophe of their own making, said Brendan Boyle, a top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Todays update from the Treasury Department needs to be a wakeup call for Speaker McCarthy, he added, saying that the Speaker has wasted enough of the Houses time appeasing his extreme allies. But House Republicans, in a tweet after the Treasurys announcement, doubled down on the need to limit Washington spending. Source: AFP --Agencies",

In a statement, the High Commission mentioned that the out-of-court settlement reached between the Nigerian authorities and Idun Maritime Ltd., the vessel owner, enabled the High Court to end the detention of the vessel and drop off the charges. The vessel was detained along with 26 crew members, including 8 Sri Lankans, it added. Sri Lanka will coordinate with the vessel owner regarding the repatriation of the Sri Lankan crew at the earliest, once the conditions are fulfilled by the shipping company, which will arrange the safe return of the crew, the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Nairobi said. As requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, the High Commission in Nairobi, which is concurrently accredited to Nigeria, has provided assistance and ensured the welfare and safety of the Sri Lankan crew until the legal process was over. Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Kenya, Veluppillai Kananathan, has also met the Sri Lankan crew in Lagos, Nigeria, on November 13, 2022, and took necessary action to ensure their welfare and accommodation on board the vessel, instead of being sent to judicial custody. High Commissioner Kananathan ensured payment of salaries and other entitlements to the Sri Lankans in full. The High Commissioner was able to convince the shipping company to enhance the salaries of the Sri Lankan crew until their release. The High Commission worked jointly with the Indian High Commission in Abuja, as the crew also comprised 16 Indian nationals, the High Commission added.",

        "date": "May 2, 2023 12:38 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised Asias economic forecast on Tuesday as Chinas recovery underpinned growth, but warned of risks from persistent inflation and global market volatility driven by Western banking-sector woes. The reopening of Chinas economy will be pivotal for the region with the spillover to Asia seen focused on consumption and service-sector demand rather than investment, the IMF said. Asia and Pacific will be the most dynamic of the worlds major regions in 2023, predominantly driven by the buoyant outlook for China and India, the IMF said its regional economic outlook report. As in the rest of the world, domestic demand is expected to remain the largest growth driver across Asia in 2023. Asias economy is expected to expand 4.6 this year after a 3.8 increase in 2022, contributing around 70 of global growth, the IMF said, upgrading its forecast by 0.3 of a percentage point from October. China and India will be key drivers with an expansion of 5.2 and 5.9, respectively, though growth in the rest of Asia is also expected to bottom out this year, the report said. But the IMF cut next years Asian growth forecast by 0.2 of a point to 4.4, and warned of risks to the outlook such as stickier-than-expected inflation, slowing global demand as well as the impact of U.S. and European banking-sector stress. While spillovers to the region from stress in U.S. and European financial sectors have been relatively contained thus far, Asia remains vulnerable to tightening financial conditions and to sudden and disorderly repricing of assets, the IMF said. And while Asia has strong capital and liquidity buffers to fend off market shocks, the regions highly leveraged corporate and household sectors are significantly more exposed to a sharp increase in borrowing costs, it added. The IMF also urged central banks in Asia - excluding Japan and China - to keep monetary policy tight to bring down inflation, which could remain stubbornly high due in part to robust domestic demand. The costs of failing to bring inflation below target are likely to outweigh any benefits from keeping monetary conditions loose, the IMF said. Insufficient tightening in the short term would require disproportionately more monetary tightening later to avoid high inflation becoming ingrained, making a larger contraction more likely. While China will be a key driver of the regions growth, the countrys property sector remains a risk that policy makers need to address to ensure an even recovery in the sector, the IMF said. Recent moves by the government to ease financing to developers had largely benefited bigger developers. Still, regions in China with smaller, weaker players had yet to show signs of a recovery, said Thomas Helbling, deputy director of the Asia and Pacific Department at the IMF. While the governments (recent) effort has stablised the market, it should proactively support the restructuring of weaker developers which are still suffering, said Helbling at a media briefing in Hong Kong. Chinas policymakers have been trying to stabilise the sector that accounts for a quarter of national GDP after a string of defaults among developers and a slump in home sales. For regions with weaker housing markets the recovery has yet taken place. We need further policy measures to limit potential risks, said Helbling. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

The attacker, who has not been publicly identified, then turned the gun on himself, according to state broadcaster UBC and others. The victim, Charles Engola, served in the government of President Yoweri Museveni as the junior minister in charge of labor. He was a retired army colonel. Army spokesman Brig. Felix Kulayigye said in a short statement that an unfortunate incident led to the killing of Engola. We shall inform the public the details as we jointly investigate the matter, Kulayigye said on Twitter. The shooting took place inside Engolas home in a suburb of the Ugandan capital, Kampala. Police detectives are now at the scene. The motive was not immediately clear, but the local press said there had been an apparent dispute over the guards wages. Witnesses claim that the soldier was yelling that he had not been paid for a long time despite working for a minister, the online newspaper NilePost reported. The incident is likely to create shockwaves in a country where other high-profile officials have been killed in gun attacks over the years.

        "title": "Hollywood writers strike over pay in streaming TV gig economy",
        "date": "May 2, 2023 04:11 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of film and television writers will go on strike starting Tuesday, throwing Hollywood into turmoil as the entertainment business grapples with seismic changes triggered by the global streaming TV boom. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) called its first work stoppage in 15 years after failing to reach an agreement for higher pay from studios such as Walt Disney Co and Netflix Inc. The last strike lasted 100 days and cost the California economy more than 2 billion. The companies behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing, the WGA said in a statement on its website. The Guild represents roughly 11,500 writers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Members were scheduled to start picketing outside of Hollywood studios starting Tuesday afternoon. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the studios, said late on Monday it had offered generous increases in compensation to writers but the two sides were unable to reach a deal. Media companies are facing a tough economic backdrop. Conglomerates are under pressure from Wall Street to make their streaming services profitable after investing billions of dollars on programming to attract subscribers. The rise of streaming has led to declining television ad revenue, as traditional TV audiences shrink and advertisers go elsewhere. On top of that, the threat of a recession in the worlds biggest economy also looms. The last WGA strike, in 2007 and 2008, cost the California economy an estimated 2.1 billion as productions shut down and out-of-work writers, actors and producers cut back spending. STICKING POINTS Producers were prepared to increase their offers of higher pay and residuals, the AMPTP said, but were unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon. The primary sticking points, the group said, were proposals that would require a company to staff a show with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, whether needed or not. The WGA countered that the studios responses to its proposals have been wholly insufficient, given the existential crisis writers are facing. The companies have broken this business. They have taken so much from the very people, the writers, who have made them wealthy, the Guild added. Writers say they have suffered financially during the streaming TV boom, in part due to shorter seasons and smaller residual payments. Half of TV series writers now work at minimum salary levels, compared with one-third in the 2013-14 season, according to Guild statistics. Median pay for scribes at the higher writerproducer level has fallen 4 over the last decade. Artificial intelligence is another issue at the bargaining table. The WGA wants safeguards to prevent studios from using AI to generate new scripts from writers previous work. Writers also want to ensure they are not asked to rewrite draft scripts created by AI. Until the conflicts are resolved, some TV programming will be disrupted. Late-night shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, which use teams of writers to pen topical jokes, are expected to immediately stop production. That means new episodes will not be available during their traditional TV time slots or on the streaming services that make them available the next day. Further ahead, the strike could lead to a delay of the fall TV season. Writing for fall shows normally starts in May or June.

        "title": "Met Gala 2023: Stars gather for event celebrating Karl Lagerfeld",
        "date": "May 2, 2023 04:28 pm",
        "content": "The fashion world has gathered in New York City for the annual Met Gala once again - this year themed on the late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld. The event, known for its star-studded guest list and extravagant outfits, included pearls, starched collars, and black and white to honour the designer. The invitation-only fundraiser for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted about 400 guests. Lagerfelds cat was also honoured. At least two celebs dressed as Choupette. For this years theme - Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty - attendees were asked to wear clothes in honour of Karl. For decades, Lagerfeld was at the helm of some of the biggest-name fashion houses in the world, including Chanel and Fendi. The designer, who died in 2019 at the age of 85, most often wore dark sunglasses with his white hair pulled back into a ponytail. He was often pictured alongside Choupette, his famously pampered pet. Retired tennis star Roger Federer, Grammy-winning songstress Dua Lipa, actress Penélope Cruz and writer, actor and producer Michaela Coel were invited to be this years co-chairs, alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Brittney Griner, the WNBA basketball star who was jailed in Russia, attended on Monday night alongside her wife. Two stars - Karlie Kloss and Serena Williams - used the night as an opportunity to announce their pregnancies. Last year, the Metropolitan Museums Great Hall was festooned with 275,000 pink roses. But the decorations are nothing compared to the outfits that celebrities flaunt on their way into the event. Much of the publics gaze is on the red carpet and the lavish outfits of those in attendance - which last year included Kim Kardashian wearing a 4.8m (3.84m) rhinestone-studded dress once worn by Marilyn Monroe. This year, Kardashian wore a Schiaparelli design dripping in pearls, which was designed after a visit last week to the Karl Lagerfeld office in Paris, where she said she was getting a little inspiration for the Met. I just wanted to feel glamorous, she told Vogue on the red carpet. I wanted pearls - what is more Karl. Her sisters Kylie and Kendall were also in attendance. Individual tickets for the event this year are priced at 50,000, with tables beginning at 300,000. Actresses Priyanka Chopra and Elle Fanning, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz-Beckham and singer Rita Ora and her husband Taika Waititi also attended. Rapper Lil Nas X arrived looking like some sort of mythical creature, clad in pearls and painted silver. Embattled actor Jonathan Majors had been slated to attend as a guest of Valentino, but mutually agreed with the fashion house not to attend on the heels of assault charges stemming from a March incident. Choupette was another notable invitee who was not in attendance this year - although pop star Doja Cat and actor Jared Leto both dressed like the feline. Many people invited me to walk the red carpet of the Met Gala 2023 in tribute to Daddy, but we preferred to stay cosy and at home, said a post on the cats official Instagram page. We pay tribute to my Daddy every day since his parting and we are very moved to see one more day dedicated to him. But not everyone was happy with the Karl Lagerfeld theme - when it was announced months ago, several figures in the fashion industry highlighted controversial comments he has made in the past, particularly about womens bodies. When the BBCs Nada Tawfik, reporting from the red carpet, asked Wintour about his past remarks, the Vogue boss said it was a night to celebrate Lagerfelds body of work, not the man.

In February 2021, at the invitation of the Commander, Sri Lanka Air Force, a 22 aircraft contingent of the Indian Air Force participated in the 70th anniversary celebrations In addition, the Indian Air Force was the first responder by deploying its assets expeditiously for providing 12T medical supplies in May 2020 and 100T nano fertilisers in November 2021. In August last year, Vice Chief of Indian Navy Vice Admiral S N Ghormade paid a two-day visit to Sri Lanka and handed over a Dornier maritime surveillance aircraft to the island nations Navy to further boost bilateral defence partnership. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe was present at the handover ceremony which took place as India celebrated the 75th anniversary of its independence. The ceremony to hand over the aircraft also happened a day before Yuan Wang 5, a Chinese missile and satellite tracking ship docked at Sri Lankas Hambantota port. Indias concerns come amidst Chinas growing influence in Sri Lanka - which is currently struggling to come out of a severe economic crisis. Beijing has loaned billions of dollars to Sri Lanka as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to build infrastructure in Asia. However, some of the infrastructure projects under the BRI have not worked in Sri Lankas favour. In 2017, for example, China Merchants Port Holdings took a majority share with a 99-year lease in Hambantota port - where the Yuan Wang 5 was docked - after Colombo struggled to repay the debt incurred to build it.

Accordingly, the government has initiated several key recovery strategies, with the establishment of a National Productivity Commission being a flagship project. Despite on-going economic constraints, the government allocated funds for the commissions establishment in the Budget 2023. An inter-ministerial Working Group has been appointed to lead the task, comprising members from various ministries, departments, and organizations. The Working Group aims to explore international insights on productivity materialization, and to this end, the Government reached out to the Australian Productivity Commission, which is recognized as an international standard. In response, the Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka expressed their willingness to support Sri Lanka in this regard. To facilitate knowledge-sharing, the Australian Productivity Commission conducted a virtual session on April 27th, 2023, for the Sri Lankan Working Group assigned to establish the commission. The event was hosted by the Presidential Secretariat. This initiative marks another engagement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Sri Lanka, reflecting their support for Sri Lankas economic reforms and revival.",

        "date": "May 2, 2023 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan took the crown for Asias fastest inflation from Sri Lanka as a weaker currency and rising food and energy costs drove price gains to a record in April. Consumer prices rose 36.4 in April from a year earlier, the highest since 1964, according to data released by the statistics department Tuesday. That compares with a median estimate for a 37.2 gain in a Bloomberg survey and a 35.4 increase in March. The data shows Pakistans inflation outpaced price gains in Sri Lanka that eased to 35.3 in April and is starting to show signs of recovery from an economic crisis. The Pakistani rupee is one of the worst performing currencies globally so far in 2023, declining 20 to the dollar, and making imported goods more expensive. Transport prices climbed 56.8 while food inflation quickened 48.1 in April from a year earlier, data showed. Clothing and footwear prices gained 21.6 and housing, water and electricity costs rose 16.9. Pakistans inflation is expected to rise further after authorities raised taxes and fuel prices to meet the IMFs conditions for the revival of a 6.5 billion loan program. The bailout funds would be crucial for helping Pakistan to pay for essential imports like food and fuel and to avoid a default next month. However, the IMF is seeking financing assurances before restarting aid. To rein in price pressures, the State Bank of Pakistan hiked its benchmark interest rate last month to 21  the highest since central bank data going back to 1956. Rising inflation could keep borrowing costs elevated for the South Asian nation that struggling with a slow recovery after last years floods. The central banks next monetary policy review is due on June 12. High prices are adding further pressure on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who is also grappling with a political crisis. His rival Imran Khan is seeking early elections and has threatened to return to street protests if his demands are not met. Source - Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "date": "May 2, 2023 07:18 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has spoken on Sri Lankas debt restructuring process, stating that encouraging signs have been seen thus far, although Sri Lanka is not completely out of the woods. In an interview with Channel News Asia (CNA), the Minister said there is a glimmer of hope for us, but we are not out of the woods when inquired as to where Sri Lankas optimism pertaining to economic recovery is coming from, despite the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicting that things will get worse later this year, before seeing gradual improvement in 2024. Sabry, who is currently attending the ADB annual meeting in Incheon, South Korea, noted that there are several factors contributing towards this optimism, including the stabilisation of the US Dollar, the increase of inbound tourists and the fact that inflation too, is relatively under control as opposed to the rates recorded in 2022. We have, in fact a 11.2 gain on the dollar which has helped us to stabilise our prices, and with that of course the migrant worker are sending the money through the normal channels, he said, adding that although it is possible to see a further recession in the coming few months, we should be able to see some sort of growth next year. Meanwhile, when questioned on Sri Lankas readiness for the first review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is due to take place in September, the Minister assured that there is a sense of stability in the country, and that all queues and shortages have been eliminated. Thus, he noted that lots of progress has been made with regard to several necessary actions and prerequisites which were due to be taken prior to the approval of the EFF, despite a few minor exceptions. Speaking on the debt restructuring process as a whole, Sabry emphasised that the process should be one that is equal for all, with a universal application of debt relief. He further highlighted the benefits of debt restructuring, adding that without it, Sri Lankas debts will no longer be sustainable, which will ultimately affect both investors and creditors as no proper investment will be made against such a backdrop. Therefore, he emphasised that the longer the restructuring process takes, the more adverse the impact will be on the investors. But they all understand that, he said with regard to Sri Lankas investors and creditors. I know some tough negotiations are around the corner, but so far, the signs are encouraging from our friends, both bilateral and otherwise. Commenting on the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia and its impact on Sri Lanka, the Foreign Affairs Minister noted that since the island nation received its main coal supply from Russia, they are currently looking for alternatives for the short term. He explained, however, that measures are underway to establish a steady source of renewable energy within the country by 2030, as there is a very good catchment for both wind and solar power with Sri Lanka being an island. He noted, however, that nearly 35 of the islands electricity generation is powered by coal, and thus, the government is currently looking for alternate suppliers. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry also addressed recent concerns as to whether Chinas latest investment would give the country a naval advantage to use Sri Lanka as a military hub, asserting that the matter was completely out of the question. We will not let anyone use Sri Lanka as a military hub or port for anyone that is very, very clear, he said, adding that the investment was solely a commercial arrangement.",

        "title": "Ex-officer Thao convicted of aiding George Floyds killing",
        "date": "May 2, 2023 08:00 pm",
        "content": "A former Minneapolis police officer who held back bystanders while his colleagues restrained a dying George Floyd has been convicted of aiding and abetting manslaughter. Tou Thao, who already had been convicted in federal court of violating Floyds civil rights, was last of the four former officers facing judgment in state court in Floyds killing. He rejected a plea agreement and, instead of going to trial, let Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill decide the verdict based on written filings by each side and evidence presented in previous cases. His 177-page ruling, filed Monday night, was released Tuesday. Thaos actions were not authorized by law. ... There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Thaos actions were objectively unreasonable from the perspective of a reasonable police officer, when viewed under the totality of the circumstances, Cahill wrote. Prosecutors argued in their filings in January that Thao acted without courage and displayed no compassion despite his nearly nine years of experience, and that he disregarded his training even though he could see Floyds life ebbing away. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25, 2020, after officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned him to the ground with his knee on Floyds neck for 9 12 minutes. Bystander video captured Floyds fading cries of I cant breathe. Floyds killing touched off protests around the world and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. Chauvin, the senior officer at the scene, was convicted of murder and manslaughter in April 2021 and later pleaded guilty in the federal case. Two other officers  J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane  pleaded guilty to state charges of aiding and abetting manslaughter and were convicted with Thao in their federal case. Unlike the other three former officers, Thao maintained that he did nothing wrong. When he rejected a plea deal in state court last August, he said it would be lying to plead guilty. However, prosecutor Matthew Frank wrote that Thao knew that his fellow officers were restraining Floyd in a way that was extremely dangerous because it could stop his breathing  the exact condition from which Floyd repeatedly complained he was suffering. Yet Thao made the conscious decision to aid that dangerous restraint: He actively encouraged the other three officers, and assisted their crime by holding back concerned bystanders, Frank added. Defense attorney Robert Paule argued that the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Thao knew that Chauvin was committing a crime or that Thao intended to help in a crime. Every one of Thaos actions was done based upon the training he received from the Minneapolis Police Department, Paule wrote. He argued that Thao reasonably believed that Floyd was experiencing a disputed condition known as excited delirium that some medical examiners have attributed as a cause of other in-custody deaths, particularly when someone has taken drugs. Paule said the actions Thao took were aimed at helping to get Floyd medical attention quickly. He said Thao was not aware that Floyd was not breathing or had no pulse. But Frank noted that witnesses who believe excited delirium is a real condition testified previously that Floyd displayed none of the symptoms. The judge ordered a presentence investigation and set Aug. 7 as the sentencing date. Minnesota sentencing guidelines recommend four years on the manslaughter count. He will serve his state term concurrent with his 3 12-year federal sentence. The agreement between the prosecution and defense specified that if the judge convicted Thao of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, the state would drop a more serious aiding and abetting second-degree murder count with a presumptive sentence of 12 12 years. Cahill based his decision on exhibits and transcripts from Chauvins murder trial, which he presided over, and the federal civil rights trial of Thao, Kueng and Lane last year. Thao was specifically convicted then of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care and of failing to intervene and stop Chauvin. Thao testified during that trial that he was relying on the other officers to care for Floyds medical needs while he served as a human traffic cone to control a group of about 15 bystanders and traffic outside a Minneapolis convenience store where Floyd had tried to pass a counterfeit 20 bill. Thao told the court that when he and Chauvin arrived, the other officers were struggling with Floyd. He said it was clear to him, as the other officers tried to put Floyd into a squad car, that he was under the influence of some type of drugs. His body camera video showed he told onlookers at one point, This is why you dont do drugs, kids. When an off-duty, out-of-uniform Minneapolis firefighter asked if officers had checked Floyds pulse, he ordered her, Back off! Thao acknowledged he heard onlookers becoming more anxious about Floyds condition and that he could hear Floyd saying, I cant breathe. But Thao said he didnt know there was anything seriously wrong with him even as an ambulance took him away. The judge didnt accept Thaos claims of innocence. Thao was trained on MPDs use of force and medical policies, which are consistent with generally accepted policing practices, Cahill wrote. Under those policies and practices, it was objectively unreasonable to (among other things): encourage fellow officers to engage in a dangerous prone restraint for 9 minutes and 24 seconds; encourage those officers not to use a hobble; actively assist their restraint by acting as a human traffic cone; and prevent bystanders from rendering medical aid. Thaos actions were even more unreasonable in light of the fact that he was under a duty to intervene to stop the other officers excessive use of force and was trained to render medical aid. Thao is Hmong American, Kueng is Black and Lane is white. Source  AP News - Agencies",

        "content": "The Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), Janaka Ratnayake, alleges that a committee, appointed on the recommendation of the Minister of Power and Energy, has prepared a proposal and a Bill to abolish the Ceylon Electricity Board Act and transfer its resources to 14 companies established under the Companies Ordinance No. 7 of 2007. Speaking at a press briefing in Colombo today (02), Ratnayake claims that if the proposals in the relevant draft are implemented, all the power plants belonging to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will be distributed amongst different companies. The national transmission system as well as the distribution systems are being broken up into separate companies. The power to purchase electricity is also transferred to another company, he charged. In addition to this, the PUCSL Chairman stressed that the inclusion of the provision that the rivers and reservoirs that supply water to the power plants should be managed according to the priority of the companies that own the hydropower plants will also challenge the rights of the people related to agricultural and drinking water needs. Ratnayake further accused the said committee of acting outside of their jurisdiction, alleging that the proposed draft is aimed at achieving personal ambitions. It must be said that this committee have done tasks that are not related to them. The Cabinet of Ministers has only assigned this committee to study the institutional structure of the Ceylon Electricity Board as mentioned in the Sri Lanka Electricity Restructuring Act No. 38 of 2002 and to make recommendations for the implementation of that institutional structure. The institutional structure that referred there is the structure of generation, transmission and distribution. But the draft prepared by this committee is aimed at achieving their personal ambitions. The draft contains objectives that favor personal and political goals rather than actual reforms in the electricity industry, he said in this regard. The Chairman also claimed that in the event the aforementioned proposal is implemented, it is clear that the energy security of this country will fall into a dangerous situation due to the privatization of these distribution companies in the future. Under this situation, instead of an independent agency that protects the rights of electricity consumers and the public, a puppet-like regulatory agency controlled by the minister will emerge, he warned.",

The bill is part of a wider overhaul of Japans laws on sex crimes, which will also expand the definition of rape. It explicitly prohibits the taking, distribution and or possession of photographs of someones genitals without their consent. It also criminalises the act of taking photographs of people being manipulated without their knowledge into sexual positions. Specifically, the bill bans the filming of children in a sexual manner without justifiable reason. In Japan, child models - mostly girls - are routinely portrayed in sexually provocative ways. For instance, some have been asked to pose in lingerie or swimsuits. According to local media reports, photographs of athletes in sporting attire have sometimes also been used for sexual or malicious purposes. Offenders would face imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to 3 million Japanese yen (17,500; 22,000). The reforms are expected to be passed in June this year. It comes after growing public outcry for stronger laws criminalising acts facilitated by mobile phone photography. In 2021, Japanese police made more than 5,000 arrests for clandestine photography - a record number and about three times the cases in 2010. About seven in 10 flight attendants in Japan have also reported that their photos were secretly taken, according to a survey by a national aviation trade union published in March. Already, most cell phone manufacturers in Japan have installed audible shutter sounds on their mobile devices, to prevent secret filming. Several Asian countries have laws against voyeurism but enforcement varies. In South Korea, those convicted of secretly filming images of a sexual nature face a fine of up to 10 million won (6,000; 7,500) or a maximum prison sentence of five years. But the Korean Women Lawyers Association said just 5 of 2,000 illicit filming cases that went to court between 2011 and 2016 resulted in jail time. In Singapore, someone convicted of voyeurism can face up to two years in jail, fines, caning, or a combination of these penalties. Voyeuristic crimes involving victims younger than 14 years old will mean mandatory imprisonment, plus fines and caning. Japan has been looking at several penal code changes to strengthen legislation against sex crimes, after multiple rape acquittals in 2019 caused national outcry. In February this year, a panel of the Japanese Justice Ministry proposed raising the age of consent from 13 to 16. The statute of limitations for reporting rape will also be increased to 15 from 10 years. The ministrys proposal also aims to criminalise the grooming of minors and expand the definition of rape. Currently, Japan has the lowest age of consent in advanced countries, and the lowest in the G7 group. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has urged the public to remain aware of their health and symptoms related to COVID-19, although no there is no imminent threat of another outbreak in the country. Speaking exclusively to Ada Derana on the recent incline in the number of COVID cases being reported, Media Spokesman of the GMOA, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe noted that although there is no grave threat of there being another COVID-19 outbreak similar to those Sri Lanka saw over the last few years, members of the public must remain cautious of their health. Accordingly, he emphasised that those belonging to vulnerable categories such as pregnant women, young children, elders and those being treated for long-term illnesses, although non-contagious, such as kidney or heart-related diseases, diabetes, cancer must take extra care in maintaining a good health status. When inquired as to whether Sri Lankans should brace themselves for another COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Wijesinghe assured that there is no such need to panic, as it is evident that such recurrences have not taken place in countries with successful vaccination rates against the fatal virus. Over 90 have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, while around 60 have received the booster shot as well, he explained. Thus, the medical professional noted that there are no plans underway to launch another phase of the vaccination programme as neither they, the GMOA, nor the Minstry of Health see an urgency for such drastic measures. Dr. Wijesinghe did, however, state that it remains important to take precautionary measures such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.",

        "date": "May 3, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "Economies across the Middle East and Central Asia will likely slow this year as persistently high inflation and rising interest rates bite into their post-pandemic gains, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday. The IMFs Regional Economic Outlook blamed in part rising energy costs, as well as elevated food prices, for the estimated slower growth. The report said that while oil-dependent economies of the Gulf Arab states and others in the region have reaped the benefits of elevated crude prices, other countries  such as Pakistan  have seen growth collapse after an unprecedented flooding last summer or as economic woes worsened. The regional slowdown also comes as an explosion of fighting in Sudan between two top rival generals  who only a year ago as allies orchestrated a military coup that upended the African countrys transition to democracy  threatens a nation where IMF and World Bank debt relief remains on hold. Rising interest rates, used by central banks worldwide to try to stem inflations rise, increase the costs of borrowing money. That will affect nations carrying heavier debts, the IMF warned. This year were seeing inflation again being the most challenging issue for most of the countries, Jihad Azour, the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the IMF, told The Associated Press. For those who have high level of debt, the challenge of increase in interest rate globally, as well as also the tightening of monetary policy, is affecting them. The IMF forecast predicts regional growth will drop from 5.3 last year to 3.1 this year. Overall, regional inflation is expected to be at 14.8, unchanged from last year, as Russias war on Ukraine continues to pressure global food supplies and affect energy markets. It will be even worse in Pakistan, where the IMF projected inflation to more than double, to about 27. Pakistan and IMF officials have held repeated talks over the release of a stalled key tranche of a 6 billion bailout package loan to Islamabad. The IMF warned that financial conditions worldwide will tighten this year, brought on in part by two bank failures in the United States in March. The sudden collapse of Credit Suisse before it was purchased by UBS also strained markets. For Sudan, Azour acknowledged the challenge as the country faces a humanitarian crisis brought on by the weeks of fighting there. The violence has also worsened a debt crisis that has gripped the country for decades as it faced Western sanctions. We have worked with the government of Sudan, for the Sudanese people, in order to help them by achieving a debt operation that would allow Sudan to have a debt relief of more than 50 billion, Azour said. But unfortunately, the recent developments ... put in a halt to all of of those efforts, he added. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",
