        "title": "Trump to announce 25 steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation",
        "date": "February 10, 2025 09:17 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25 tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday. He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country. And very simply, its, if they charge us, we charge them, Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan. The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data. By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79 of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024. Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defence, shipbuilding and auto, Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X. We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries. Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japans Nippon Steel (5401.T), opens new tab to invest in U.S. Steel (X.N), opens new tab, it would not allow this to become a majority stake. Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management, Trump said of U.S. Steel. Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump. Quota Questions Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy. Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trumps announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements. Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to (the U.S.), that is, 60 of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China? Francois Legault, premier of Quebec, said on X. All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty. Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 in 2019 after Trumps initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as Chinas global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals. Matching Rates Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure that were treated evenly with other countries. The new U.S. president has long complained about the EUs 10 tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5. He frequently states that Europe wont take our cars but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year. The U.S., however, enjoys a 25 tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab, Ford (F.N), opens new tab and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), opens new tab U.S. operations. The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12 for India, 6.7 for Brazil, 5.1 for Vietnam and 2.7 for European Union countries. Border Steps In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canadas and Mexicos actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25 on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless Americas two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps. Asked whether Mexicos and Canadas actions were good enough, Trump replied: No, its not good enough, Trump said. Something has to happen, its not sustainable, and Im changing it. Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 10, 2025 12:36 pm",
        "content": "World leaders and technology executives are convening in Paris on Monday to discuss how to safely embrace artificial intelligence at a time of mounting resistance to heavy-handed red tape that businesses say stifles innovation. Eagerness to rein in AI has waned since previous AI summits in Britain and South Korea that focused world powers attention on technologys risks after ChatGPTs viral launch in 2022. As U.S. President Donald Trump tears up his predecessors AI guardrails to promote U.S. competitiveness, pressure has built on EU policymakers to pursue a lighter-touch approach to AI to help keep European firms in the tech race. Some EU leaders, including summit host French President Emmanuel Macron, and tech companies are hoping flexibility will be applied to the blocs new AI Act to help homegrown startups. Theres a risk some decide to have no rules and thats dangerous. But theres also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules, Macron told regional French newspapers in an interview published on Friday. We should not be afraid of innovation, he said. Trumps early moves on AI underscored how far the strategies to regulate AI in the United States, China and EU have diverged. European lawmakers last year approved the blocs AI Act, the worlds first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. Brussels is finalising an accompanying code of practice. Moreover, Trumps brakes-off approach has emboldened the regulation-cautious U.S. Big Tech groups from which Europe needs to seek investment, said British think-tank Chatham House. Meanwhile, Chinas DeepSeek challenged U.S. and British AI leadership last month by freely distributing a human-like reasoning system, galvanizing geopolitical and industry rivals to race faster still. An unpredictable global scramble to develop AI is underway, as the U.S. turns inward and China boasts new capabilities, Chatham House said. Trump is not sending the U.S. AI Safety Institute to Paris, in a troubling sign to those hoping for global risk-based rules governing AI. Competitiveness Top political leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Chinas Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the summit. Others on the attendance list are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Macron is due to meet with Guoqing on Monday and Vance on Tuesday, the Elysee said. The plenary session is on February 11. Top executives such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are slated to give talks as well. Executives will partake in an invitation-only dinner with political leaders on Monday. Google Senior Vice President James Manyika said at a press reception on Sunday that the opportunities from AI were now in much greater focus. Delegations are also expected to discuss how to manage AIs massive energy needs as the planet gets hotter, as well as AI for the developing world. A non-binding communiqué has been in progress. Macron is eager to promote Frances national industry, with a focus on areas where Europes second-largest economy has an advantage: free, open-source systems, and clean energy to power data centers. Ahead of the summit, France struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates for a major AI data center representing investments of up to 50 billion. Launching a new app with generative AI software, the CEO of Nvidia-backed French startup Mistral told Reuters: The French and the whole world are realising that European players count and that they provide cutting-edge technology.

        "date": "February 10, 2025 12:40 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is expected to decide today (10) whether power cuts will be required to be imposed as the Norochcholai coal power plant remains disconnected from the national grid. A special discussion regarding the situation is scheduled to take place today, as authorities assess the electricity supply following the island-wide power outage that occurred yesterday (09) at approximately 11.15 a.m. The disruption was linked to an incident at the Panadura grid substation. Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody attributed the outage to an accident caused by a monkey entering the substation. However, the CEB explained that the incident led to an imbalance in the power system, triggering the widespread blackout. Efforts were made to restore power, but the process was hindered due to low electricity demand on Sunday. While the CEB had fully restored power by 6.00 p.m., all three generators at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant were automatically disconnected due to the activation of its protocol system. This shutdown resulted in a loss of 900 megawatts to the national grid. As electricity demand increased after 6.00 p.m., several areas experienced power outages. To counteract the shortfall, the CEB obtained electricity from thermal power plants, ultimately restoring power across the island by 9.45 p.m. Despite these efforts, the CEB has stated that it will take approximately four days to restart the three generators at the Norochcholai plant. Todays meeting will focus on strategies to manage the electricity demand and avoid power cuts during this period. Meanwhile, Minister Jayakody issued a press release addressing the power outage, stating that the absence of a proper system to balance the national power supply was a result of past government policies. The statement further criticized previous administrations for implementing unplanned and short-sighted energy programs, which, according to the ministry, contributed to the recent disruption.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramunas (SLPP) National Organizer and Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa claims that the government is hypocritical in their approach to the MPs riot-damage compensation controversy, since the government accepts valuations by the Government Valuation Department only when it benefits the incumbent administration. Rajapaksa made this remark speaking to the media in Polonnaruwa on Sunday (09) after invoking blessings at the Somawathiya Temple. Commenting on this regard, the MP noted: The governments approach is hypocritical. When Mahinda Rajapaksas residence is valued by the Government Valuation Department, it is right to the government. However, when the valuation department estimates the value of the property damaged by them, it is wrong. People believed the lies spread by the incumbent government on the election stage and brought them to power. A lot of people wanted to experiment with the incumbent administration. However, today the government has caused them injustice. The government itself proves the lies they spread on stage. They came to power by making promises which cannot be kept. When they are confronted with the impossibility of keeping their promises, they resort to political suppression in typical JVP fashion as their mode of governance, Rajapaksa added. Responding to a question regarding his connection with the controversy of the Krrish Tower, he stated, My connection to Krrish is about Rugby. The public will be able to see who really dealt with the Krrish company when the matter is taken up in court. Rajapaksa also alleged the government of constantly lying to the people, expressing, The question is if the government ever said the truth. The cabinet spokesperson lied about a court report received by the Speaker of the house. I try my best to find an instance when the government spoke the truth.",

But midway through Sheerans rendition of Shape of You, a khaki-uniformed policeman yanked out his guitar and microphone cables, according to images published on social media, prompting the singer to throw up his hands in frustration. Local police said they had previously denied Sheeran permission to busk in the area, and that a citizen had called a helpline to report the infringement once he had started playing. We rejected it because Church Street is a very busy area and we try to keep the people moving there, Shekhar H. Tekkannavar, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru Central division, told CNN on Monday. But Sheeran claimed the street gig had been given the all-clear. We had permission to busk, Sheeran said on Instagram shortly after the incident on Sunday. (The street performance) was planned out before, it wasnt just us randomly turning up.

        "date": "February 10, 2025 08:26 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has announced that the power generated by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is expected to be added back to the national grid by Friday, February 14. CEB Engineer Dhammika Wimalaratna stated that efforts are underway to expedite the restoration process: We believe we will be able to restore the power supply to normal within the next three to four days. By February 14, we expect full restoration, which would eliminate the need for demand management. However, we are also working to restore power earlier than expected, and if successful, we will notify the public in advance. He further noted that the ongoing one-and-a-half-hour power cuts may be reduced in the coming days as the restoration progresses. Earlier, the CEB announced that island-wide power cuts would be implemented on Monday (10) and Tuesday (11), with one-and-a-half-hour outages occurring between 3:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. to manage electricity demand effectively. On February 09, Sri Lanka faced a widespread power outage that affected the entire island at around 11.15 a.m. The cause of the outage was linked to an incident at the Panadura grid substation, where a monkey reportedly entered the substation, triggering an imbalance in the power system. As a result, the islands electricity supply was disrupted. The power restoration process faced difficulties due to low electricity demand, which was typical on a Sunday. However, while power was fully restored by 6.00 p.m., a subsequent issue arose at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, where the automatic protocol system disconnected all three generators. This disconnection caused a loss of 900 megawatts to the national grid, exacerbating the power shortage. By 6.00 p.m., the demand for electricity began to rise, which led to further power outages in various regions. To mitigate the shortfall, the CEB sourced additional electricity from thermal power plants. After a sustained effort, the power was fully restored to the island by 9.45 p.m.",

        "date": "February 11, 2025 06:41 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said Monday that a precarious ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas should be canceled if Hamas doesnt release all the remaining hostages it is holding in Gaza by midday on Saturday  though he also acknowledged that such a decision would be up to Israel. In comments to reporters after signing a series of executive orders, Trump said, If theyre not here, all hell is going to break out and said he feared many scheduled for release are actually already dead. Trump also said, however, Im speaking for myself. Israel can override it. Those comments came after Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel that Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. ownership of the war-torn territory  contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population. Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it into the Riviera of the Middle East, Trump, in an interview with Fox News Bret Baier airing Monday, said No, they wouldnt when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland. Well build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is, Trump said. In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent. Arab nations have sharply criticized the Trump proposal, and Trump is set to host Jordans King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily. Trumps comments risked jeopardizing the already tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza after 15 months of war, with the existing framework for negotiations calling for the massive humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for civilians in Gaza. After Trumps initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza temporarily and for an interim period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction. Trump last week didnt rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan. Egypt on Monday reiterated its rejection to the transfer of Palestinians from their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, warning that such proposals threaten the foundations of people in the Middle East. In a statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem its capital is the base for comprehensive and just peace in the region. The statement said Egypt rejects any violations to the Palestinians right of self-determination  and independence, and upholds the right of return for Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homeland, in a reference to hundreds of thousands who were forced to flee their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war. A senior Hamas official blasted Trumps latest remarks about the U.S. ownership of Gaza as absurd. Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas politico bureau, said these comments reflect a deep ignorance of Palestine and the region. In comments released by Hamas early Monday, he said Trumps approach toward the Palestinian cause will fail. Dealing with the Palestinian cause with the mentality of a real estate dealer is a recipe for failure, he said. Our Palestinian people will thwart all transfer and deportation plans.

        "date": "February 11, 2025 07:20 am",
        "content": "Former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. W.A. Wijewardena is of the view that the government is constrained by its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the benchmarks set by the Economic Transformation Act, making it challenging to achieve the targeted revenue of 15.1 of GDP this year. He expressed that the government should introduce new taxes to achieve the revenue targets set for the year in order to not lose the fourth tranche of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. The government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been constrained in its budgetary policy formulation by two factors which have been beyond its control. One is the loan agreement signed by the previous government with the IMF which President Dissanayake has agreed to implement without any amendment, Dr. Wijewardena said. The second one is the economic transformation act that was passed by the Parliament just before the new President was elected where in which the government has several benchmarks to fulfill in terms of the law when they prepare its budget for the 2025. One of the requirements under the IMF as well as the economic transformation act is that Sri Lanka should attain revenue of the government amounting to 15.1 of the GDP for 2025, which comes to about Rs. 5.5 trillion. That is a massive target for the government, he added. Without having new taxes introduced on people, there is no possibility for the government to reach this level. If the government is unable to reach this level the fourth tranche of the IMF will not be delivered to Sri Lanka. It will also be non-compliant with the economic transformation act. In addition to that, there had been certain contentious taxes that had been proposed by the previous government to IMF  one is the property tax. Now this tax has been abandoned by the present government and as a result it will have to introduce a new tax to raise the same revenue because of the revenue loss, Dr. Wijewardena expressed. Because of these reasons the budget cannot deliver that much of provisions to the people as it has to confine its budgetary policy within the IMF as well as the prescribed limits of theeconomic transformation act, said the ex-Deputy Governor of the CBSL.",

Signs of the cores deformation appeared in waves from earthquakes that were strong enough to reach Earths center. The research team used that same earthquake data for a 2024 study to resolve a longstanding debate over the inner cores rotation. They found that the inner core once spun faster than Earth itself. But beginning around 2010, the solid inner cores spin slowed. Its now revolving backward, relative to the rest of the planet. Their new study, published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, builds on that discovery, using earthquake data gathered from 1991 to 2023. The scientists prior work on core rotation helped them interpret variations in the height of seismic waves, defining them as indicators of changes to the surface of the inner core, said Dr. John Vidale, a coauthor of the previous study and lead author of the new study. We can compare the signals that we see when the inner core is returned to the same position as it was in some other time and see if theres differences that cant be explained by the rotation, Vidale, Deans Professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern Californias Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, told CNN. Shape changes in the core could hold clues about the forces deep inside Earth that power our magnetosphere, the invisible lines of magnetic energy that protect our planet from solar weather and deadly radiation, the researchers reported. Earth evolves on a geological timescale, so observing changes on an annual timescale is always intriguing, as it enhances our understanding of inner core dynamics, said Dr. Yoshi Miyazaki, an associate professor in the department of Earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Previous studies have already discussed how inner core rotation has changed over the past decade, and this study introduces a new perspective  non-rotational changes  adding another dimension to the discussion. I believe this will further fuel these debates, Miyazaki, who was not involved with the new research, told CNN in an email. Almost science fiction Of all Earths layers, the inner core is the most remote and mysterious. This solid sphere of iron and nickel is about 70 the size of the moon, with a radius of approximately 759 miles (1,221 kilometers). Temperatures in the inner core are as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius), and pressures can reach up to 365 gigapascals (GPa)  more than 3 million times greater than Earths average atmospheric pressure on land. While direct observation of the core is impossible, scientists study it by analyzing changes in the size and shape of seismic waves as they pass through the core. Earthquakes generate two types of waves. Primary waves, or P waves, are the first waves produced by a quake, and move the ground in the same direction that the wave is moving. Shear waves, or S waves, are slower than P waves and move the ground perpendicular to the waves direction. Amplitude changes in a type of core-penetrating P wave  PKIKP waves  hinted at deformations in the inner cores shallowest level, according to the new study. At the boundary where the solid inner core meets the liquid of the outer core, the spheres surface might be more malleable than it is at deeper levels. Its almost science fiction to visualize whats happening on the surface of the inner core, Vidale said. Its a place thats so different from our day-to-day lives, with different timescales, different materials and incredible forces. And yet, we can get down there and learn more about it by just sifting through some of the latest observations. Movement like landslides The scientists analyzed 168 paired waves from quakes in 42 locations near the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. Tracking the speed and direction of the cores rotation gave the researchers a way to detect changes in the shape of the core. Once they knew the cores rotation speed, they could model its position and then compare different PKIKP waves that reached the core as it revolved into the same spot. Amplitude changes in those paired waves could then be assigned to shape changes in the core, rather than rotation changes, according to the study. However, what that deformation of the inner core might look like is harder to pin down. Maybe the topography is going up and down. Maybe its sloughing around like landslides, Vidale said. The most likely thing is the outer core is just pushing on the inner core and moving it around a little bit. While just one inner core location showed signs of deformation between 2004 and 2008, there may be more that are yet to be detected, the researchers reported. Its hard to know if we are looking at an anomalous or a normal location, Vidale said. But one guess would be that some amount of deformation is happening fairly often in many places. As Earths solid inner core spins, the molten outer core churns and sloshes. Their interactions generate magnetic energy, which unspools to enfold our planet in the magnetosphere. But the liquid outer core is shrinking. Millimeter by millimeter, the inner core has siphoned molten metal from the liquid core surrounding it, Vidale said. It likely took billions of years for the inner core to cool and solidify, and over the next few billion years, the inner core will continue to cool, sipping drops of liquid metal from the outer core, until Earths entire core is a solid metal sphere, he added. Thatll kill the magnetic field, Vidale said. There wont be the moving iron down there anymore. However, such an event is billions of years in our future. And before that could happen, Earth will likely be obliterated as our sun expands into a red giant and swallows the inner planets of the solar system, Vidale said. Until then, scientists should have ample time to investigate the unseen workings at the heart of our planet and discover what Earths internal spinning, churning and shape-shifting might hold in store for the planet. Regarding the impact on life, as mentioned in the papers introduction, inner core growth plays a crucial role in generating Earths magnetic field, which protects us from harmful solar radiation, Miyazaki said. While a direct connection between life on Earths surface and the ICB (inner-outer core boundary) remains distant, what happens at the ICB still has some implications for Earths long-term evolution.

However, the CEB confirmed today that no power cuts will take place tomorrow as it is possible to meet the Poya Day lower demand with the available generation capacity. The CEB decided to implement island-wide power cuts on Monday (10) and Tuesday (11), as a result of an issue which arose at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, where the automatic protocol system has disconnected all three generators. Accordingly, one-and-a-half-hour outages will occur between 3.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. today affecting the entire island to manage the electricity demand effectively. The power supply disruptions will take place in different zones, each experiencing a one-and-a-half-hour outage during the specified time period. The Ceylon Electricity Board has provided several platforms for the public to check the ongoing Demand Management (power cut) schedules amid island-wide power interruptions. However, the CEB confirmed today that no power cuts will take place tomorrow as it is possible to manage the existing electricity demand.

        "content": "Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros organisations received 260 million from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to influence political affairs and destabilise multiple nations, including India and Bangladesh, according to a news report. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), an account link to Trump alleged, George Soros received 260,000,000.00 from USAID and used this money to spread chaos, change governments and personal gain in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, India, UK, and the US. His remarks add to the growing scrutiny of US foreign aid, particularly as Trumps administration has frozen USAIDs budget. Funding of Soros-Linked Organizations Reports indicate that over the past 15 years, USAID granted more than 270 million to organisations affiliated with Soros. One such organisation, the East-West Management Institute, partnered with Soros Open Society Foundations and received USAID funding. The revelation has fueled concerns over the US governments role in international political movements. Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, has supported Trumps administration in highlighting USAIDs financial backing of what they call woke and controversial projects. Musks involvement has further amplified Republican criticisms of foreign aid being used for regime change and political influence. In India, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long accused Soros of backing opposition groups and funding critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP leaders claim Soros initiatives aim to destabilise the Indian government and interfere in national politics. Source: Financial Express --Agencies",

        "date": "February 11, 2025 02:28 pm",
        "content": "The United States has lifted a pause on food donations, the U.N. World Food Programme said, ending a suspension that an aid watchdog on Monday warned had left 500,000 metric tons of food currently at sea or ready to be shipped in limbo. We can confirm that the recent pause concerning in-kind food assistance to WFP - purchased from U.S. farmers with Title II funds - has been rescinded, WFP said in an X post on Sunday. This allows for the resumption of food purchases and deliveries under existing USAID agreements. Washington had stopped purchases of commodities produced by U.S. farmers for donation - despite a waiver for emergency food assistance - after U.S. President Donald Trump paused all foreign aid for 90 days so contributions could be reviewed to see if they aligned with his America First foreign policy. The U.S. also told WFP to stop work on dozens of U.S.-funded grants, orders that were received five days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued the food waiver. Several of the suspended grants were under the Food for Peace Title II program, which spends about 2 billion annually on the donation of U.S. commodities. The program, which makes up the bulk of U.S. international food assistance, is co-administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment. The USAID grants that WFP was told to stop work on are worth tens of millions of dollars and provide food aid in impoverished countries including Yemen, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Haiti and Mali. A lack of detail in the Trump administrations effort to slash and reshape U.S. foreign aid has created chaos and confusion, say humanitarian officials, who have been left to work out whether to take the financial risk of continuing programs without assurance that they are covered by a waiver. The Office of Inspector General for USAID said in a report released on Monday that uncertainty put more than 489 million of food assistance at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion. The report by the auditor said USAID staff had identified more than 500,000 metric tons of food currently at sea or ready to be shipped that had been sourced under the Title II program. Because this funding source was not included under the Secretarys emergency food assistance waiver, these commodities were held in limbo, subjecting them to spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and potential diversion, the report said.

        "date": "February 11, 2025 04:47 pm",
        "content": "In recent months, several highly anticipated South Indian films have fallen prey to online leaks, evidently leaving filmmakers frustrated. However, the Telugu film industry is taking a firm stand now. Determined to protect their hard work, filmmakers have announced plans to crack down on piracy, with arrests expected soon. Indias highest-grossers of recent times, including Pushpa 2: The Rule, Kalki 2898 AD, Devara: Part 1, Game Changer, Thandel and HanuMan, were released on illegal websites in HD prints hours or days after its release. Prominent Tollywood filmmakers like Allu Aravind, Bunny Vas and Dil Raju, along with actors Vishwak Sen and Anjali, have voiced their concerns over the growing piracy menace. Their message is clear  the industry is united and ready to take a strong stand against these illegal activities. Complaints have been filed, and arrests have been made, but filmmakers say that true change must come from the audience. They are urging moviegoers to support cinema by watching films in theatres and rejecting piracy. Chandoo Mondetis recently released Thandel, starring Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi, made impressive waves at the box office, grossing Rs 62 crore worldwide in its opening weekend. However, the films success was overshadowed by a shocking piracy incident. Producers Aravind and Vas were stunned to discover the movie being screened on an APSRTC bus through a cable network. Adding to their dismay, the films HD print has reportedly circulated across WhatsApp and Telegram groups. Piracy went down for a while thanks to our efforts and the advent of OTT, but its rearing its ugly head again. We want to curb it now before it does more damage. People seem to have forgotten its illegal to both upload and download such prints, pointed out Aravind while talking to the press in Hyderabad. He added, We have filed complaints, and arrests will be made soon. As for the film being screened in a government RTC bus, is it out of innocence? Its hard to see when a film is doing well, but these things happen. Vas emphasized that the production team would take decisive legal action, just as they did when Geetha Govindam and Taxiwaala prints were leaked. Those people are still languishing in jail; we wont leave anyone. An overseas print of Thandel was screened on an RTC bus going from Palasa to Vijayawada. I will inform Pawan Kalyan (Deputy CM of AP) about this; we intend to fight back because it affects box office numbers. APSRTC Chairman Konakalla Narayana Rao has ordered an inquiry into it. Vas and Aravind have urged the public to report any instances of Thandel piracy by contacting them at 9573225069. Additionally, the Film Chambers anti-piracy cell continues to play a crucial role in addressing such concerns. Meanwhile, Vishwak Sen recently spoke to the press, apologizing for a political remark made by his co-star, 30 Years Prudhvi, during the pre-release event of their upcoming film Laila. Clearly emotional and almost in tears, Vishwak shared that he had received threats because of the incident. 25,000 tweets are saying Boycott Laila because Prudhvi made a political comment. Some have threatened to leak the films HD print on opening day. I apologise because this happened at our event. I am not well-versed enough to talk politics; I am only 29. We worked hard on this film, so please, its heartbreaking, he pleaded. Shankars Game Changer, starring Ram Charan and Kiara Advani, also faced a major piracy setback when it was illegally broadcast on a cable TV channel and leaked online shortly after its January release. Producer Dil Raju filed a cyber complaint against 45 individuals, revealing that the leak occurred after they refused to comply with an extortion demand. He said, Please do not encourage piracy in buses or elsewhere. A lot of hard work goes into making a film, and its best experienced in theatres with an auditorium full of people enjoying it as much as you do. Anjali, who acted in the film, added, As an actor, I can only take responsibility for how well I played my character. To hope a movie works at the box office is something we strive for with promotions. But beyond that, Ill need more time to speak about Game Changer than we have. Everyone knows why Im saying that. Sometimes, we get hurt; it hurts so badly. So, thats all it is. Pirated sites often carry malware, posing serious security threats. Poor video quality, incomplete content, and potential legal consequences under the Copyright Act of 1957 are just a few risks. Is that really worth it for a less-than-stellar viewing experience? Lets support creators and say no to piracy for a better, safer, and more creative film future! Source: News 18 --Agencies",

Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: no thank you but we will buy twitter for 9.74 billion if you want. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a 500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House. OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models. Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure. Musks lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money. Its time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was, Musk said in a statement on Monday. We will make sure that happens. Altman said to staff in a message the companys board intends to make clear it has no interest in Musks supposed bid, according to a report, by The Information on Monday. He told Axios on Tuesday OpenAI was not for sale. Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft , did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Emanuel Capital and others. xAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Musks offer earlier on Monday. xAI recently raised 6 billion from investors at a valuation of 40 billion, sources have told Reuters. Throwing a Wrench This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things, said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance. The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, its a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. OpenAI was valued at 157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to 40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of 300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January. Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds. Musks stock in Tesla is valued at roughly 165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his 44 billion buyout of X, which was then called Twitter, in 2022. To finance such a bid, Musk could sell part of his stake in Tesla or take a loan against his stake, or use his stake in rocket company SpaceX that is worth tens of billions of dollars as collateral, according to an uninvolved investment banker, who requested anonymity. Musks offer to buy OpenAIs nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAIs current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation, said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAIs board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Led by the Deputy Director General of the National Institute of Education, the delegation includes key officials overseeing Sri Lankas education system, directors of early childhood development and primary education, policy and planning experts, and senior representatives from UNICEF Sri Lanka. Their visit, scheduled from February 11, will involve interactions with Haryanas school education department, site visits to primary schools, and discussions on best practices. Before reaching Haryana, the delegation engaged with Union government officials in Delhi, including Archana Sharma Awasthi, Joint Secretary, Department of School Education  Literacy, and academicians from NCERT. They were briefed on Indias National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Samagra Shiksha, the National Curriculum Framework, and the NIPUN Bharat Missionwhich aims to ensure foundational learning for all children by the end of Class 3. The discussions highlighted Indias emphasis on mother tongue-based learning and holistic education reforms. The visit follows the release of the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024 on January 28, which showcased Haryanas strong performance in foundational literacy and numeracy, particularly in Classes 3, 5, and 8, indicating a significant recovery post-pandemic. Haryana, considered a frontrunner in implementing NEP 2020 reforms, has set benchmarks in early education, drawing international interest. Launched on July 30, 2021, as part of the NIPUN Bharat Mission, Haryanas initiative focuses on strengthening Hindi and English literacy alongside numeracy skills. Officials believe that Haryanas approach can serve as a model for Sri Lanka, which is looking to adopt similar strategies to enhance its primary education system. Source: The New Indian --Agencies",

        "content": "The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) is calling for relief measures in the upcoming 2025 Budget to help businesses recover from years of economic challenges. President of the National Chamber of Exporters Jayantha Karunaratne emphasized the need for tax reductions and cost-cutting initiatives to enhance Sri Lankas global competitiveness. We have faced numerous difficulties over the last four to five years, and this year, we hope for relief that will enable us to operate more efficiently, Karunaratne stated. A key expectation from the budget is a reduction in the 30 corporate tax, particularly for exporters, as Sri Lankas tax rates are significantly higher than those of competitor nations. With higher taxes, we struggle to compete, reinvest, and expand into new projects and infrastructure, he added. Karunaratne also highlighted concerns over high production costs, which hinder profitability and growth. We look forward to measures that will ease production expenses and encourage exporters to contribute more to national income, he said. Additionally, he noted that while not directly linked to the budget, the potential removal of the SVAT could impact cash flow, further complicating business operations. The National Chamber of Exporters urges the government to implement policies that support exporters, ensuring sustained economic growth and increased foreign revenue. By incentivizing exports, the country will benefit from higher income and improved tax collection, Karunaratne concluded. The Appropriation Bill 2025 (Budget Speech) is expected to be presented to the Parliament on 17 February 2025, with the Budget debate to be held for 26 days from February 18 to March 21, 2025.",

        "title": "Israel says Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not free hostages by Saturday",
        "date": "February 12, 2025 08:43 am",
        "content": "Israels prime minister has warned Hamas it will end the ceasefire in Gaza and resume intense fighting if the Palestinian group does not return our hostages by Saturday noon 10:00 GMT. Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered Israeli forces to amass inside and around Gaza in response to Hamass announcement that it was postponing freeing more hostages until further notice. Netanyahu did not specify whether he was demanding the release of all 76 remaining hostages, or just the three due to be freed this Saturday - but a minister said he meant everyone. Hamas responded by saying it remained committed to the ceasefire deal and that Israel was responsible for any complications or delays. The group has accused Israel of violating the three-week-old ceasefire deal, including by blocking vital humanitarian aid - a claim Israel has denied. Hamass decision to delay this weekends scheduled release prompted US President Donald Trump to propose that Israel cancel the agreement altogether and let hell break out unless all of the hostages were returned by Saturday. Following a four-hour meeting of Israels security cabinet on Tuesday, Netanyahu said in a video statement that he welcomed President Trumps demand. He added: In light of Hamass announcement regarding its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I instructed the IDF Israel Defense Forces to amass forces inside - and surrounding - the Gaza Strip. This action is being carried out at this hour and will be completed very soon. He then issued an ultimatum that he said had the security cabinets unanimous approval. If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end the IDF will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas. There were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all the remaining hostages or not. One source told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that it would be willing to continue the ceasefire if the next group of three hostages were freed as planned on Saturday. But later, transport minister and war cabinet member Miri Regev wrote on X: We made a very clear decision: We adhere to US President Donald Trumps statement regarding the release of the hostages - on Saturday, everyone will be released! The IDF said it had raised the level of readiness of its Southern Command - which is responsible for operations in Gaza - and that it would be reinforced with additional troops, including reservists. Hamas also reiterated on Tuesday its rejection of Trumps controversial plan for the US to take over post-war Gaza and permanently relocate the two million Palestinians living there so that it could be rebuilt and turned into the Riviera of the Middle East. Hamas said Trumps remarks were racist and constitute a call for ethnic cleansing, aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause and denying our peoples inalienable national rights. The Palestinian Authority and Arab states have also categorically rejected the plan, while the UN warned that any forced displacement would be prohibited under international law and tantamount to ethnic cleansing. Netanyahu has praised the presidents revolutionary vision for Gaza. Earlier on Tuesday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim told the BBC that the door was open for US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to intervene and get the ceasefire deal back on track. We dont wish that this deal will fall apart, he said. We are doing the maximum to avoid any obstacles, any challenges, and therefore we are ready to hand over prisoners next Saturday if the situation is rectified through the mediators. He accused Israel of continuous violations of the ceasefire deal, including delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to areas in northern Gaza by between 48 and 72 hours and obstructing deliveries of urgently needed food, medical and shelter supplies. The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The remaining 17 Israeli hostages - two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50 - are supposed to be released over the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of those hostages are dead, but only one has been named. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,210 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gazas population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70 of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

        "content": "Deputy Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Chathuranga Abeysinghe states that there is no possibility of reducing taxes within this year, as the government is required to collect 15.1 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in taxes in accordance with agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A reduction in indirect taxes, in particular, will have to be implemented gradually. We cannot expect a tax reduction this year. It is necessary to collect the required amount of taxes amounting to 15.1 of GDP, as stipulated by the IMF. However, once we emerge from this process and revenue collection efficiency improves, it will be possible to extend concessions to products from various industries, he stated. Furthermore, he emphasized the governments long-term objective of providing tax concessions, particularly for technological investments in the banking sector and industries. The upcoming budget, scheduled for February 17, will outline these initiatives. The government intends to offer the necessary facilities and support to industries, aiming to create a conducive environment for industrial growth in the coming years, he added. Deputy Minister Abeysinghe also revealed plans to introduce a new tax policy for industrial imports. We are implementing a new tax framework known as the Tariff Policy. Under this policy, we aim to reduce or eliminate taxes on production inputs. Every industrialist now has a clear understanding of the imported inputs required for their production processes. This is the essence of the tariff policy, he explained. Addressing concerns within the industrial sector, he highlighted challenges posed by tax-free imports and undervaluation of invoices. Despite the efforts of local industries, certain imports enter the market at significantly low prices without paying the necessary taxes, sometimes with manipulated invoice values. To counter this, we are introducing protective measures under the anti-dumping policy, which will provide support to the industrial sector, he added. He further clarified that tax policies may vary across industries, but an overall reduction in taxes cannot be expected in the forthcoming budget.",

        "content": "The body of water formerly known in the United States as the Gulf of Mexico is now listed for US-based users of Google Maps as the Gulf of America. The change follows an executive order by US President Donald Trump renaming the area. Google has previously said it has a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources. People using Maps in the US will see Gulf of America, and people in Mexico will see Gulf of Mexico. Everyone else will see both names, it said in a statement Monday. Google said last month it would also change the name of Mount McKinley, the nations highest peak, from Denali following Trumps order. Former President Barack Obama renamed the Alaska landmark to Denali in 2015 as a nod to the regions native population. But that change hasnt been made on Google Maps as of Tuesday. Both changes stem from an executive action that Trump signed shortly after taking office, saying the changes honor American greatness. The order criticized Obamas decision to rename McKinley as an affront to President McKinleys life, his achievements, and his sacrifice. Drawing parallels to Trump, the order notes that McKinley championed tariffs and was assassinated in an attack on our Nations values and our success. The US Federal Aviation Administration also issued a notice Monday regarding the geographical name changes. Please be advised that the FAA is in the process of updating our data and charts to show a name change from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and a name change from Denali to Mount McKinley, the agency said. The US Coast Guard, responsible for patrolling the nations maritime coastal waters, has also begun incorporating the new Gulf of America name change in its public notices. Calendar changes Some Google users have also begun noticing changes on Google Calendar that some say appear to deemphasize diversity. For example, certain holidays and events, including Pride Month and Black History Month, are no longer displayed by default on the first day of the respective months, sparking some people to criticize the company on its message boards. However, a Google spokesperson told CNN that the changes were implemented last year as part of broader revamp of the calendar tool based on user input. Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries around the world, said a Google spokesperson. We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing  and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasnt scalable or sustainable. So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.

He further stated that the lack of performance by some officers was also a reason for the transfers. This has been an ongoing process. There have been no transfers for nearly three years. There is no political influence in this. Some officers have been reassigned to general duties, while others have been given good positions. No one can claim that there is politics involved.

CEB Spokesman Dhammika Wimalarathana expressed that a final decision on whether any further power cuts will be implemented or not, will be reached as the restoration activities of Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is currently underway. The CEB decided to implement island-wide power cuts on Monday (10) and Tuesday (11), as a result of an issue which arose at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, where the automatic protocol system has disconnected all three generators, while restoring the island-wide blackout that occurred on Sunday (09). Accordingly, one-and-a-half-hour outages were implemented between 3.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. affecting the entire island to manage the electricity demand effectively. However, the CEB confirmed that no power cuts will take place today (12) as it is possible to meet the Poya Day lower demand with the available generation capacity.",

        "date": "February 12, 2025 02:39 pm",
        "content": "Climate change-induced gale-force winds, erratic monsoons, and a turbulent sea are now hindering the smooth operation of the India-Sri Lanka ferry service, which was resumed with much fanfare 17 months ago. Remained in suspended animation for 41 years due to the civil war that ravaged the neighbouring island nation, the age-old sea route was rejuvenated under the joint auspices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then Sri Lankan President Renil Wikramsinghe. Since its formal launch on October 14, 2023, adverse weather has halted its operations at least four times, with long durations of keeping the vessel ashore. The fifth relaunch scheduled for tomorrow (February 13) has also been postponed at the last minute, citing the continuing roughness of the sea. When contacted, a spokesperson for Thiruchirapally-based Subham Ferry Services, which operates the service on behalf of the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), stated that the relaunch is expected to occur on February 16, provided that the weather conditions improve. Online tickets from Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu to Kankesanthurai in Jaffna will be available a day before the launch. The company expressed concern regarding previous trip cancellations at the last minute, leading to refund complications. According to the current plan, the ferry service will operate six days a week, excluding Tuesdays. A ticket for a single person travelling to Jaffna will cost 4,500. The company has also developed travel packages for Indian tourists, including visits to Mannar, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, and Anuradhapura. Any Indian citizen with a passport and a return ticket can travel to Sri Lanka using the ferry, as the visa is available on arrival. Sundararaj Ponnusamy, Chairman and Managing Director of Subham Group, stated that the companys older vessel, Shivaganga, will be used initially. The vessel will depart from Nagapattinam port at 7 AM, with the return journey starting at 2 PM. The duration of each of the journeys is expected to be around three hours. He emphasised that the fare is designed to be affordable for middle-class travellers. Another vessel will be added to the trip by the end of March. The two-way fare has been lowered from 9,700 to 8,500, making the journey more affordable. Passengers can carry up to 10 kg of baggage for free, but any excess baggage will incur a charge. Additionally, the total baggage limit has increased to 70 kg, up from the previous limit of 50 kg, with 23 kg permitted at no extra cost. Onboard facilities have been improved. Ponnusamy informed that toilets and other passenger amenities have been redesigned. We have expanded our snack options and will now offer fresh milk, coffee, tea, and cold beverages. Additionally, a duty-free shop will be introduced on the vessel, allowing passengers to purchase goods at discounted prices, he said. Researchers identify global warming as the primary cause of the current situation in the Gulf of Mannar, located in the Indian Ocean between India and Sri Lanka. The northeast monsoon arrived very late, and its effects are still ongoing. In the coming days, there will likely be unprecedented and accelerated warming in the ocean, which may lead to rougher sea conditions. It is essential to have better vessels that can withstand the challenges posed by the sea, said ocean expert Dr. Mahesh Rangathanathan. The ferry service from Nagapattinam to Kakesanthurai is viewed as Indias strategic initiative to strengthen its presence in Sri Lankan waters. Additionally, this service aims to monitor smuggling and infiltration activities in international waters. Intelligence sources suggest it will also help maintain and enhance the cultural relationship between India and Sri Lanka. Source: Hindustan Times --Agencies",

        "content": "One Direction has rejected an offer to reunite at the Brit Awards to honour their late bandmate Liam Payne. According to The Sun, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik were approached about a tribute performance but decided against it. It has been a really emotional time for the lads, and it was decided it would just be too much, a source told the outlet. They have grieved in private and dont feel the need to do a big, showy tribute for the sake of it. The decision may disappoint millions of fans hoping for a long-awaited One Direction reunion, but insiders say the timing isnt right. Apart from anything else, Zayn lives in America now, and they are all at different places in life. A One Direction reunion is not on the cards at all, the source added. One Direction last performed together in 2015 before announcing their indefinite hiatus in 2016. Since then, all members have pursued solo careers, with Styles, Horan, Tomlinson, and Malik achieving individual success in music. Payne, who also released solo music, tragically passed away in October 2024 at the age of 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Although the band wont reunite, Brit Awards host Jack Whitehall is set to pay a heartfelt tribute to Payne during the ceremony on March 1. The music industry and fans continue to mourn his loss, remembering his contributions to one of the biggest boy bands of all time. Source: The Express Tribune --Agencies",

        "content": "Greeces parliament elected its former speaker, Constantine Tassoulas, as the countrys president on Wednesday, approving the conservative governments nominee for the largely ceremonial role. The decision to nominate him has angered protesters who rallied outside parliament last month seeking justice over a deadly 2023 train crash. They say that on Tassoulas watch as parliamentary speaker, lawmakers failed to investigate any political responsibility over Greeces worst rail disaster. Two years later, a judicial probe is still in progress. Parliament is the only body that can investigate politicians under Greek law. Tassoulas, 66, a lawyer and father of two who has been a lawmaker since 2000 and has previously served as Greeces culture minister and deputy defence minister, won the backing of 160 lawmakers in Wednesdays vote in the 300-seat parliament. He will succeed Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Greeces first female president, whose five-year term expires in March. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said last month that he chose Tassoulas on account of his political experience, widespread acceptance, and his unifying spirit. Political analysts view Tassoulas nomination as aimed at strengthening Mitsotakis grip on power. His conservative New Democracy party has a small parliamentary majority with 156 seats but is under mounting pressure, opinion polls suggest. Centre-left and leftist opposition parties had proposed other candidates and did not back Tassoulas nomination on Wednesday. For decades, failure by parliament to elect a president in Greece could lead to a snap election. After a reform, following a decade-long financial crisis, the process can involve up to five voting rounds in parliament, with the threshold gradually falling to the majority of those present in the chamber. Tassoulas will be sworn in as head of state on March 13. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
