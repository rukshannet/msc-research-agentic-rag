        "date": "May 11, 2023 03:19 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasized that Sri Lanka will not support any work that hinders the unity of Asia. The President revealed this while participating in the ceremony held on Wednesday afternoon (May 10) to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo, which is the first international conference hall, built in Asia. The President pointed out that there are many differences between the Asian geopolitics and the politics of the Pacific region and that we should recognize those differences and work to preserve peace and stability. Stating that ASEAN plays an important role, and must ensure that ASEAN is further strengthened in the coming decades, the President said ASEAN outlook is one which also emphasizes the fact that while the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are two different, distinct oceans, they are interconnected now, that is of value, because the geopolitics the Indian Ocean is quite different from Asia Pacific. As far as we are concerned, we have been free of the great power rivalry so far. We should not allow that to come into the Indian Ocean, the President said. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that in order to advance Sri Lanka as a country with a strong economy in the next decades, Sri Lanka can be taken forward by utilizing the non-aligned policy, the Panchaseela and the Asian policy. Those general facts are still valid today and said that this Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall is a good example that can be pointed out regarding the unity of Asia, he added. A Coffee Table Book written on the history of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall was also presented to the President while a commemorative stamp worth Rs.25 was also issued to mark the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further mentioned: We received this as a gift. I would also like to say that we should continue to maintain unity in Asia. It should be remembered here that only the countries of the Indian Ocean have not experienced disharmony in the world power struggle. With the ambition of becoming world powers, some groups have undermined the unity between the countries of the Pacific Ocean and dragged them into a state of war. We must work together to prevent this from happening to the Indian Ocean. I also emphasize that Sri Lanka will not support in any way, to break the unity of Asia. Already we have a number of military bases around the horn of Africa. They came in when piracy was at its height. And as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, we are of the view that they should work with the African Union, which is responsible for the regional security of the African continent. Commemorative gifts were also given to the organizations that have generated more income to the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall from event and exhibition sectors during the past 50 years. The Book Publishers Association for the exhibition sector and the British Council for the event sector received commemorative gifts from the President.",

The civil society organization, stating that it welcomes the long-awaited Anti-Corruption Bill, went on to challenge certain provisions of the law through its petition, on the basis that they are unconstitutional. The TISL says the law must be enacted in accordance with accepted international norms, whilst safeguarding fundamental rights ensured by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. TISL has challenged 37 clauses of the Anti-Corruption Bill in total, including clauses 28(3), 161 and 119. In its petition, TISL raised concerns that several provisions of the Bill are disproportionate and could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing, the right to information and the freedom of expression, and could affect the concepts of transparency and accountability. The Attorney General has been named as the respondent in this petition. Attorney-at-Law Pulasthi Hewamanna appears for the petitioners with Attorneys-at-Law Githmi Wijenarayana, Fadhila Fairoze, Piumi Madhushani, Harini Jayawardhana, Lasanthika Hettiarachchi and Sankhitha Gunaratne, as instructed by Attorney-at-Law Niluka Dissanayake.

        "date": "May 11, 2023 05:56 pm",
        "content": "Disney says its flagship streaming service lost 4m subscribers in the first three months of the year amid a wider cost-cutting drive. At the same time the Disney platform narrowed its losses by 400m (316.5m). The home of Mickey Mouse, the Star Wars franchise and Marvel movies is under pressure to make its streaming business profitable as the traditional film and television market shrinks. Shares in the company fell by around 5 in after-hours trading in New York. Most of the subscriber losses came from its Hotstar service in Asia, which lost streaming rights to Indian cricket matches last year. Disney also lost around 300,000 customers in the US and Canada after raising subscription prices. It comes as Disneys streaming business reduced its operating losses to 659m for the first three months of this year. That was down from 1.1bn in the previous quarter. Disney chief executive Bob Iger said the improved financial performance reflects the strategic changes weve been making throughout the company to realign Disney for sustained growth and success. He previously said Disney had reached a turning point and would become profitable by next year. Earlier this year, the entertainment giant reported its first fall in subscriber numbers and announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs. The latest announcement comes after thousands of Hollywood TV and movie screenwriters held their first strike in 15 years last week. They are calling for better pay and working conditions as the transition to streaming has upended the traditional television and film industry. The last writers strike was in 2007. It lasted 100 days and cost the industry an estimated 2bn. On Wednesday, Disneys chief financial officer Christine McCarthy declined to put a figure on how much the latest strike could cost the company. The walkout has already shut down several Disney projects, including those set to run on Disney. Disney has poured billions of dollars into its streaming platforms in recent years, transforming it from a company rooted in traditional television, movies and theme parks into one of the streaming industrys major players. It now has a total of more than 231 million subscriptions across its three streaming platforms, which also include the sports-focused ESPN and wider entertainment site Hulu. Disney has close to 158m subscribers around the world, although that is still behind rival Netflixs 232.5m subscribers. Source - BBC - Agecies",

        "date": "May 12, 2023 01:32 am",
        "content": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka is working closely with several Ministries and relevant authorities to develop a project to mainstream e-mobility through the conversion of 500,000 Tuk-Tuks to electric vehicles (EVs) or e-Tuk- Tuks over a 5-year period. In a statement issued in this regard, the UNDP stated that the project aims to support the conversion of petrol three-wheelers to electric three-wheelers as a means for enhancing mobility as a driver of low-carbon, inclusive, equitable development pathways within Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, like many other global nations, is working towards adopting greener and cleaner approaches for a more sustainable and resilient future. With the prevailing socio-economic crisis in the island, a shift towards adopting sustainable mobility approaches has been identified as a necessity for a green recovery process, the statement read. The proposed three-phased project consists of an incubation phase, a demonstration phase and an acceleration phase. The incubation phase will test the conversion process, the demonstration phase will support conversions and the acceleration phase will use market forces for conversion through concessional financing and infrastructure development. Speaking at a project launch briefing held today (11 May), Minister of Transport and Highways Bandula Gunawardena stated, This pilot project will serve as a platform to launch electric three wheelers in the country. Electric three wheelers will not only benefit individual operators but also contribute to spring boarding the countrys economic recovery process. Highlighting the UNDPs role in the pilot project, Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, This pilot project is a part of UNDPs Green Development Portfolio which is currently being developed. This portfolio aims to build solutions and support Sri Lankas development in catalyzing low-carbon, green, and inclusive development within which sustainable transportation and e-mobility play a key role. Through this pilot project UNDP will support the Government to establish a viable system which can be scaled up and will prioritize marginalised groups, including women and persons with disabilities while keeping equality and equity at the core of our work. The incubation phase will support the conversion of 200 petrol three-wheelers to electric three- wheelers. Accordingly, tuk-tuks not older than 10 years from the date of manufacture, and those with a petrol 4-stroke three-wheeler will be eligible, while parties from Makumbura and Pettah will also be eligible, priority will be given to applicants whose livelihood is dependent on a single three-wheeler, and preferential selections are given to women owners operators and persons with disabilities. Nishantha Anurudda Weerasinghe, Commissioner General of Motor Traffic noted the importance of the project and the role of DMT in promoting e- Mobility in Sri Lanka, stating DMT has established a system for the registration of electric three wheelers in Sri Lanka. We have also developed specifications for electric three wheelers with the support of UNDP. We believe that this intervention will encourage petrol three-wheel owners to come forward and convert their three wheelers to electric three wheelers The strict selection criteria is expected to minimise the risk of failure due to technical issues, the risk of delay in conversions due to limited capacity and will test the performance of different technologies available in the market-opportunity for project stakeholders to test the market for energy efficiency (kmkWh), actual range per charge and functionality of safety features. The findings from the incubation phase will then be used in designing the demonstration phase. Taking into consideration the above aspects, Pettah and Makumbura have been identified as viable locations for the initial conversion pilot in the Western Province. Thus, it has been decided that 100 petrol three-wheelers will be converted to electric three-wheelers from each location. During the pilot phase, UNDP will cover the full cost of conversion to electric three-wheeler and through this aims to support the revival of micro levelinformal sector economic activities to inject much needed currency into the local economy.",

The police had initiated investigations after receiving a complaint about a man assaulting two doctors on duty at Ward No. 72 on May 08. The doctors of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital engaged in a one-day token strike, urging the police to arrest the assailant.",

        "content": "The main suspect arrested over the death of the 16-year-old schoolgirl in Kalutara has been remanded until May 26. He was produced before the Kalutara Magistrates Court. On May 06, the naked corpse of a 16-year-old girl was found near the railway tracks in Kalutara, after she reportedly fell to her death from the third floor of a five-storey hotel in the area. Danushka Gayan Sahabandu, a 29-year-old resident of Isuru Uyana in Kalutara, was arrested on May 09, three days after the teens body was recovered. During preliminary interrogations, the suspect, however, denied all murder accusations. He told the police that the girl had, in fact, jumped off the hotel building. He divulged that he visited the hotel on May 06 along with another young couple (a young woman aged 19 and a 22-year-old male) and the 16-year-old girl after renting two rooms on the third floor. He also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. The suspect also mentioned that he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to meeting her for the first time on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old. Soon after his arrest, Kalutara Magistrates Court, on 10 May, allowed the police to detain him for a period of 48 hours for further questioning. Meanwhile, the wife of the hotel owner was arrested on Thursday (May 11) on account of failing to properly check the deceaseds National Identity Card (NIC) before accommodating her at the said hotel. Initial probes had revealed that the NIC produced by the 16-year-old girl to rent a room at the hotel belongs to one of her friends. The young couple in question and the driver of the car in which the group arrived at the hotel, are also currently under arrest. They have been remanded until May 15 after being produced before the court. On Thursday, on the directives of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the investigations into the tragic incident were handed over to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID).",

        "title": "Elon Musk says he has found new CEO for Twitter",
        "date": "May 12, 2023 12:40 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk said on Thursday he has found a new chief executive for Twitter, but did not name the person, while the Wall Street Journal reported that Comcast NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino was in talks for the job. Musk said in a tweet: Excited to announce that Ive hired a new CEO for XTwitter. She will be starting in 6 weeks! Musk said he will transition to the role of chief technology officer of the social media platform within the next few weeks. Musk, who took over as CEO of Twitter when he completed his 44 billion purchase of the company in October, said in December that he would step aside as CEO once he found someone foolish enough to take the job. He said that he would then run Twitters software and servers teams. The WSJ cited people familiar with the situation in saying that Yaccarino was in talks for the top post. Reuters reported after Musks tweet that Yaccarino could be his choice to lead Twitter, according to a Silicon Valley executive and a former Hollywood executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. Yaccarino, the top advertising sales executive at NBCUniversal, interviewed Musk at an advertising conference in Miami last month. At the conference, Yaccarino encouraged the audience to welcome Musk with applause and lauded his work ethic. Many of you in this room know me, and you know I pride myself on my work ethic, she said, adding, Buddy, I met my match. Yaccarino joined NBCU in 2011, after 15 years at Turner Entertainment and has been credited with dragging the networks ad sales operation into the digital future. As broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers that their brand messages were not an afterthought. Yaccarino did not respond to calls seeking comment on Thursday. When asked for comment, an NBCUniversal spokesperson said, Linda is in back-to-back rehearsals for the Upfront, referring to a presentation NBCUniversal will host for advertisers in New York on Monday. Yaccarinos exit would be another big blow to the company after Comcast said last month that NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell was leaving after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, following a complaint that prompted an investigation. ANCHOR IS LOOSENED Musk has previously not named any prospective candidates. Speculation was rife on Thursday among tech and media insiders and on Blind, an anonymous messaging app for tech employees. Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and a top executive at Musks brain-chip startup Neuralink, Shivon Zilis, were among names that were being discussed. Musk, who has come under fire from investors in his Tesla (TSLA.O) electric car company as being distracted by his attention to Twitter, said he will transition to the role of Twitters executive chair, along with the role of CTO, overseeing product, software and system operations. Musks post about a new Twitter CEO came about 15 minutes before the close of Wall Street on Thursday, and Tesla shares closed 2 higher. The shares rose a further 1.6 in after-hours trade. The boat anchor called Twitter is loosened from Musks ankle. Now he can get back to spending more time creating value at Tesla, said Craig Irwin, analyst at Roth MKM. Musk has long said he intended to find a new leader for Twitter. In a Twitter poll started by Musk in December, 57.5 users voted for him to step down as CEO of the social media platform. The billionaires first two weeks as Twitters owner in October were marked by rapid change. He quickly fired Twitters previous CEO, Parag Agrawal, and other senior leaders, and then laid off half its staff in November. Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, has said he took over Twitter to prevent the platform from becoming an echo chamber for hate and division. He also said he would defeat spam bots on the platform, a key area of his tussle with Twitters board over his back and forth on the buyout of the company. He said last month that Twitter was roughly breaking even. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 12, 2023 02:23 pm",
        "content": "A fact-finding report from the UN Human Rights Office has concluded there are strong indications that more than 500 people were killed  the vast majority summarily executed  by Malian troops and foreign military personnel during a five-day military operation in the village of Moura in the Mopti region of central Mali in March 2022. These are extremely disturbing findings, said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. Summary executions, rape and torture during armed conflict amount to war crimes and could, depending on the circumstances, amount to crimes against humanity. The report is the result of an extensive human rights fact-finding mission conducted over several months by UN staff in Mali. Malian authorities denied requests by the team to access the village of Moura itself. The report is based on interviews with victims and witnesses, as well as forensic and other information sources, such as satellite imagery. The report details how events unfolded day-by-day in Moura. The operation - described by the authorities as an anti-terrorist military operation against an al-Qaeda-affiliated group known as Katiba Macina  began on 27 March 2022, a busy weekly market day in Moura. According to witnesses, a military helicopter flew over the village, opening fire on people, while four other helicopters landed and troops disembarked. The soldiers corralled people into the centre of the village, shooting randomly at those trying to escape. Some Katiba Macina militants in the crowd fired back at the troops. At least 20 civilians and a dozen alleged members of Katiba Macina were killed. Then, over the next four days, at least 500 people are believed to have been summarily executed, the report says. The fact-finding team has obtained extensive personal identification details, including the names of at least 238 of these victims. Witnesses reported seeing armed white men who spoke an unknown language operating alongside the Malian forces and at times appearing to supervise operations. According to witnesses, Malian troops were rotated in and out of Moura daily, but the foreign personnel remained for the duration of the operation. A day after the assault, soldiers began going house to house searching for presumed terrorists, apparently selecting and summarily executing people with long beards, people wearing ankle-length trousers, or who had marks on their shoulders - interpreted as a sign that they habitually carried weapons, and even those who merely showed signs of fear. Witnesses told the fact-finding team that a group of men who had been rounded up in the south-east of the village were led away by soldiers and shot in the head, back or chest, and their bodies thrown into a ditch. They reported that those who resisted or tried to flee were also executed by the Malian armed forces and the armed white men and dumped into the ditch. At least 58 women and girls were raped or subjected to other forms of sexual violence. In one shocking instance, soldiers reportedly brought bedding from a house, placed it under trees in the garden, and took turns raping women they had forced there. Dozens of other people were detained. Some of the detainees were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during questioning and while in detention in Moura, Sévaré, as well as at the National Agency for State Security (ANSE) in the capital Bamako. One victim said he and other detainees were punched, slapped, and kicked in the head, as soldiers called them jihadists, accusing them of killing their own brothers and destroying their country. Another victim detailed how soldiers took him to State security premises where he was tortured and electrocuted for hours as he was questioned. The Malian authorities announced the opening of an investigation shortly after the attack took place, but more than a year later and pending the final outcome of the investigation, continue to deny wrongdoing by their armed forces. Türk stressed that investigations into such serious reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law must be conducted in an independent, impartial, and transparent manner, with a view to holding those responsible to account. It is vital that Malian authorities take all necessary steps to ensure that Malian forces engaged in any military and law enforcement operations, including foreign military personnel under their command or control, fully respect the rules of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, Türk said. - Agencies",

When the case against Rambukwella was called before High Court Judge Nawaratne Marasinghe, the defence attorney made a request to temporarily relax the travel ban as his client needs to travel overseas to attend the Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting 2023 and other official work. Accepting the request, the high court judge allowed Rambukwella to lift the travel ban from May 23 to November 30 and ordered the Controller-General of Immigration  Emigration to let him travel overseas. The case had been filed by the Bribery Commission against Rambukwella, former Chairman of Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Vimal Rubasinghe and former Director General of SLRC Chandrapala Liyanage, alleging that they had misappropriated Rs. 1 million by purchasing 600 GI pipes in 2014 during Rambukwellas tenure as the Mass Media Minister. Meanwhile, the overseas travel ban on Ranawaka too was relaxed from May 13 to September 23 by Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatta. Ranawakas attorney told the court that his client wishes to travel to Canada to visit his daughter, thus seeking a court order directing the Controller-General of Immigration  Emigration to temporarily lift the travel ban. The former minister is accused of concealing evidence and fabricating evidence related to the 2016 road accident in Rajagiriya, which resulted in serious injuries to a youth.",

        "date": "May 12, 2023 04:20 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans ex-prime minister Imran Khan has been freed from custody, a day after the Supreme Court ruled his dramatic arrest on corruption charges was illegal. Judges released Mr Khan on protected bail, meaning he cannot be re-arrested for at least two weeks. Earlier, Mr Khan told the BBC he believed he would be detained again immediately after his release. The 70-year-olds arrest escalated tensions between him and the military. Many analysts believe Mr Khans election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military, which both parties denied. But he later fell out with the army. After a series of defections, and amid mounting economic crisia, he lost his majority in parliament. Since being ousted less than four years into his term, he has become one of the militarys most vocal critics, and analysts say the armys popularity has fallen. And his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party says the charges against him - which relate to gifts given to him by foreign leaders while he served as prime minster - are politically motivated. His dramatic arrest outside the courthouse in the capital Islamabad on Tuesday sparked outrage among Mr Khans supporters. At least 10 people were killed and some 2,000 arrested as unrest swept the country. Those protests included an attack at a military commanders home residence in Lahore, which was set on fire. While this weeks violence petered out after the army was deployed in Islamabad and other areas, such as Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the country remains on edge. There was a large security presence at the court on Friday. Speaking to the BBC before his bail hearing, Mr Khan said he feared immediate re-arrest once released, urged authorities against a move as there might be huge reaction which will go out of control. Because mobs are out of control, no-one controls mobs. How am I supposed to control what happens afterwards? he told the BBC. While the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the circumstances of the arrest were illegal, the corruption charges against him still stand. Mr Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges on Wednesday, when a judge formally indicted him with corruption for the first time in the dozens of cases he faces. And Mr Khan told the BBC on Friday that he was also facing dozens of additional charges, including counts of terrorism, sedition and blasphemy. Source: BBC -Agencies",

Accordingly, 22-year-old Fathima Munawwara, a resident of Weligalla, Elpitiya in the Gampola area, was missing for six days before a 24-year-old area resident reportedly confessed to her murder today (12 May). Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said that the suspect in question was a goat herder, and, upon questioning, had revealed that he had come across the girl when she had walked by him while he was cutting grass in the area, gathering food for the goats. Investigations thus far have revealed that the suspect had attempted to molest 22-year-old Fathima at the time, and had later taken her to a forested area after she rejected his advances, where he later killed her and buried the body. Police are, however, yet to recover the girls body, Thalduwa said. Fathima Munawwara was last seen while on her way to work, walking in search of a bus from her house towards the Weligalla town.

        "date": "May 12, 2023 07:43 pm",
        "content": "The Parliament of Sri Lanka has approved the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate matters relating to the damage caused by both the MT New Diamond and X-Press Pearl vessels. The setting up of the 21-member Parliamentary Select Committee was approved in Parliament today (12 May). Accordingly, the committee will be tasked with investigating and making suitable recommendations relating to the disasters caused by both international vessels which were gutted in separate fires within Sri Lankas territorial waters. On September 03, 2020, the MT New Diamond was engulfed in flames about 65km off the Sangamankanda Point on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. An explosion of a boiler in the main engine room had led to this unfortunate turn of events, which resulted in the death of one crew member and a major oil spill. The tanker was transporting 270,000 metric tons of crude oil from the port of Mina Al Ahmadi in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip at the time of the incident. It was also reported that 1,700 metric tons of diesel required for the use of the tanker were stored onboard. On May 20, 2021, Sri Lanka witnessed what is considered one of the worst marine environmental disasters after the Singapore-flagged container ship vessel MV X-Press Pearl, only three months after being commissioned, caught fire some 16km off Colombo. At the time of the incident, it was transporting at least 1,500 containers including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, other chemicals and low-density polyethylene pellets. The fire that raged for nearly two weeks resulted in a massive spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful substances into the sea before the wreckage of the vessel sank on June 02, 2021 while being towed away to deeper waters. It was revealed that the fire had been the result of a reaction of the chemicals being transported on the ship, from which 25 crew members were evacuated safely.",

        "title": "President pledges to modernize SL education sector within 10 years",
        "date": "May 12, 2023 09:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (May 12) pledged to modernize the countrys education sector to create a young generation equipped with knowledge and nourished with abilities within the next 10 years. Pointing out that a cabinet committee has already been appointed for the modernization of education, the President also stated that he would work on immediate reforms. He also pointed out that, had the money spent on corporations during the past 10 years been invested on education, Sri Lanka would now have the best education in Asia. President Wickremesinghe stated this while attending the opening ceremony of Sri Lankas first skills and job exhibition Skills Expo 2023, under the theme An ability for Life  A job for Ability, at the BMICH, Colombo earlier today. The exhibition is held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike hall, at BMICH Premises on May 12, 13 and 14 from 9.00 am to 8.00 pm and is open to the public, free of charge. The Sri Lanka Skills Expo 2023 exhibition will be a valuable opportunity for members and policy makers from many fields in Sri Lanka to exchange their ideas and enhance skills in those fields and it is expected that it will make a significant contribution to the economic development of the country. The President inaugurated the Sri Lanka Skills Expo 2023, and did not forget to engage in friendly conversation with the public who were present at the exhibition. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented; First and foremost, I would like to commend everyone for organizing this exhibition. Looking back at last year, we had our doubts on whether such a training exhibition could be organized. In addition to the turbulent environment in this country, the countrys economy was collapsing. We have now resumed the effort of rebuilding the countrys economy. I could have prepared a fresh budget to control our expenses. When I looked at the expenses of our country for the last 10 years, I noticed that we spent money on corporations while neglecting education. Had we given the money that was used for Sri Lankan Airlines, Electricity Board, and Petroleum Corporation to the education and health sector, we would be in a position to compete with the countries that have the best education systems in South Asia. Unfortunately, we did not do that, and now we have to pay the debt. I am trying my best to pay off this debt as soon as possible within the next 10 years. I have decided that we will not allocate funds for similar projects in the future. There were several such programs, and we still have no idea what happened to that money. We must first work to curb these expenses and reduce them. I understand that we cannot reduce the governments expenses by saying that we will reduce them; we must grow the countrys economy rapidly. I have restricted subsidies to education, health, social security, and housing. Additional funds may be provided for these areas. Our country needs a strong educational system, and the most crucial aspect of this system is providing pupils with the necessary information. We live in a knowledge-based society, and if we can provide the necessary knowledge to everyone, the future development of our country will be confirmed. Sri Lanka is a country that can create a knowledge-based economy, and therefore plans should be developed to provide knowledge. We also need plans to provide qualifications for jobs after providing school education. Today, many organizations are engaged in this activity. Our educational system has not been upgraded as much as is required now. We are 10-15 years behind, and we must now reconsider and move forward. The government alone cannot provide the necessary training to impart this knowledge. The majority of such training and knowledge is obtained outside the government. We must collaborate with private and international organizations that have this knowledge. This year, I consolidated the Ministry of Education under one minister to ensure appropriate implementation of this task. He must monitor the entire system and make appropriate arrangements. I have formed a special cabinet committee to oversee education, and we will start modernization of education from here. We are entering a new world. Our educational system will transform within the next ten years because we must prepare education for an unknown future. A strong program is required for this, and it is my goal that the youth will be educated about this. We will establish a perfect society that is prepared with the required information and abilities for the future. Arrangements are being developed to supply the required funds beginning in 2024.",

        "date": "May 12, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "As investigations into the mysterious death of the 16-year-old schoolgirl in Kalutara progress, suspicions have arisen as to whether she was trafficked to the main suspect. The police suspect that the young man (22), who was at the hotel with his teenage girlfriend, had suggested selling the 16-year-old schoolgirl for Rs. 20,000 to the main suspect who was recently arrested in connection with the incident. According to police suspicions, the 22-year-old youth had received a portion of this sum for setting the main suspect up with the teen. On May 06, the naked corpse of a 16-year-old girl was found near the railway tracks in Kalutara, after she reportedly fell to her death from the third floor of a five-storey hotel in the area. Danushka Gayan Sahabandu, a 29-year-old resident of Isuru Uyana in Kalutara, was arrested on May 09, three days after the teens body was recovered. During preliminary interrogations, the suspect, however, denied all murder accusations. He told the police that the girl had, in fact, jumped off the hotel building after receiving a phone call. He divulged that he visited the hotel on May 06 along with another young couple (a young woman aged 19 and a 22-year-old male) and the 16-year-old girl after renting two rooms on the third floor. He also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. The suspect had also mentioned that he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to meeting her for the first time on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old. Soon after his arrest, Kalutara Magistrates Court, on May 10, allowed the police to detain him for a period of 48 hours for further questioning. Following the detention period, he was produced before the Kalutara Magistrate who ordered to place him in remand custody until May 26. During todays court proceedings, the defence attorney told the magistrate that it is not yet determined whether the girls death was a murder or a suicide. In his initial statement given to the police, the suspect had confessed that they have had no sexual intercourse, despite being intimate with one another. According to him, the teen had received a call during which she yelled at the caller using foul words. After the call ended, she had climbed on to the chair beside the window, and jumped off the building, he had said. The defence attorney further told the court that the police have yet to find out who made this purported phone call to the teen. Raising concerns about the heart condition his client is suffering from, the defence attorney went on to seek special security for the suspect while in prison. Meanwhile, the police made a request from the court to refer the 29-year-old to a forensic pathologist to uncover if the bite marks found on the body of the deceased belongs to the main suspect. Granting leave for the request, the magistrate ordered the suspect to be presented before a forensic pathologist on May 16, and to place him behind bars on remand until May 26. The young couple in question and the driver of the car in which the group arrived at the hotel, are also currently under arrest. They have been remanded until May 15 after being produced before the court. Meanwhile, the wife of the hotel owner was arrested on Thursday (May 11) on account of failing to properly check the deceaseds National Identity Card (NIC) before accommodating her at the said hotel. Initial probes had revealed that the NIC produced by the 16-year-old girl to rent a room at the hotel belongs to one of her friends. On Thursday, on the directives of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the investigations into the tragic incident were handed over to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). Against this backdrop, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) has deemed the hotel building in question an illegal construction. In a report, the UDA listed nine discrepancies with the construction in question, adding that the approval of the Kalutara Municipal Council had not been obtained prior. Meanwhile, the police and the navy have launched a joint search operation to locate the mobile phone used by the teenage girl, which is said to have been discarded into Kalu River by the 22-year-old in custody.",

        "content": "A program to generate income for Sri Lanka through Health Tourism is expected to be prepared, says Sagala Ratnayake, the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff. His remarks came during the event organized at the Colombo Foundation on the occasion of International Nurses Day. Ratnayake emphasized that in a country like Sri Lanka, which boasts a beautiful environment, the Health Tourism program is highly advantageous, and that the nursing centre should devise new programs to help generate revenue for the country. Looking to the future, I believe we should be creative and explore new avenues for economic growth. With our countrys beautiful environment, we can develop health tourism as a potential source of income. Let us work together as a nation to build a brighter future for all. As a Sri Lankan, I am aware that many Sri Lankans living in England and Australia come back to our country to receive medical treatment. However, we should not view this as a negative thing. Ratnayake said Sri Lanka should turn this into a business opportunity and develop this aspect of the countrys healthcare system further. Speaking on the significant demand for Sri Lankan nurses in foreign countries, Ratnayake said, however, some are facing difficulties due to language barriers and a lack of proficiency in English. As a nation, we need to solve these issues and capitalize on this demand. We must strive to create a better country for our young people, and we must take steps towards achieving that goal. Fortunately, inflation in our country is currently decreasing, and prices for goods are becoming more reasonable for consumers. If we had not received support from the International Monetary Fund, the situation could have been much worse. Its essential that policies remain consistent, regardless of changes in government. The government is committed to providing adequate income for all Sri Lankans, and we respect and appreciate the service of each and every citizen to our country.",

        "date": "May 13, 2023 12:51 pm",
        "content": "In a significant operation, the Colombian Navy has intercepted the largest narco-submarine ever found in the country. The massive vessel, measuring 30 meters long and three meters wide, was seized in the Pacific Ocean while carrying an astounding three tons of cocaine. Its intended destination was Central America, a major transit route for drug trafficking to the United States, the worlds largest consumer of Colombian cocaine. Images released by authorities depict the dark-colored submarine docked onshore, surrounded by numerous packages of narcotics cleverly camouflaged with Toyota labels. Three individuals were also apprehended at the scene. This seizure represents a historic milestone, surpassing all previous records since Colombia began keeping track in 1993. Over the past three decades, the Colombian Navy has intercepted a total of 228 similar vessels used to transport large quantities of drugs from the Pacific Ocean to the United States or even across the Atlantic to Europe. The detained crew members, all Colombian nationals, claimed they were forced by a drug trafficking organization to operate the semi-submersible and transport the illegal substances to Central America. Following the operation, the three individuals, aged 63, 54, and 45, were transported to Tumaco in southern Colombia to face legal proceedings. The Navy estimates that this seizure dealt a significant blow to the criminal organization, with an estimated market value of approximately 103 million. These homemade narco-submarines, constructed in Colombia, travel just below the waters surface, allowing them to cover long distances while evading detection. Colombian legislation imposes severe penalties of up to 14 years in prison for the use, construction, commercialization, possession, and transportation of these semi-submersibles. Despite decades of efforts to combat drug production, Colombia continues to face challenges, with record levels of cocaine production reported. In 2021, around 204,000 hectares of coca crops were cultivated, resulting in the production of approximately 1,400 tons of cocaine hydrochloride, as reported by the United Nations. The fight against drug trafficking remains an ongoing struggle, with profound impacts on the country and the international community. Source - Dominican Today - Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are in talks for new initiatives to further enhance collaboration in the shipping sector. Thereby, Minister of Ports, Shipping  Aviation Nimal Siripala De Silva, together with State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, held discussions on May 12 with Bangladeshi State Minister of Shipping holding Cabinet rank, Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury in this regard. Minister De Silva appreciated the long-standing friendship between the two countries and emphasized the importance of shipping connectivity as one of the key areas selected for bilateral collaboration, especially in the context that 40 of Bangladeshs exports, mainly apparel, which are bound to Western Europe and US, are transported from Chattogram using the Port of Colombo. Both Ministers agreed on the necessity of finalizing the proposed Agreement on Coastal Shipping between the two countries and also the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to facilitate the Feeder Services between the ports of Colombo and Chattogram. They decided to form a Working Group of legal experts to finalise the legal issues, if any, relating to pending bilateral instruments and to also form an additional working group to discuss the operational related issues. The Second Session of the Joint Working Group and Joint Secretary level talks will be held in Sri Lanka during the course of the year. Minister De Silva explained the facilities offered through the terminals of Colombo Port and the cost and time efficiency that Bangladeshi exporters can enjoy by using the Port of Colombo. He further informed about the ongoing development projects related to the shipping sector as well as the port development projects in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and invited Bangladesh investors to invest in Sri Lankas shipping sector through Public Private Partnerships. State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya explained the promising opportunities available for cooperation in the areas of fishing and blue economy between the countries and invited the Bangladesh authorities to collaborate with Sri Lanka for the mutual benefit of both countries. Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya are in Dhaka to attend the 6th Indian Ocean Conference.",

        "title": "Baby born from three peoples DNA in UK first",
        "date": "May 13, 2023 05:03 pm",
        "content": "A baby has been born using three peoples DNA for the first time in the UK, the fertility regulator has confirmed. Most of their DNA comes from their two parents and around 0.1 from a third, donor woman. The pioneering technique is an attempt to prevent children being born with devastating mitochondrial diseases. Fewer than five such babies have been born, but no further details have been released. Mitochondrial diseases are incurable and can be fatal within days or even hours of birth. Some families have lost multiple children and this technique is seen as the only option for them to have a healthy child of their own. Mitochondria are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy. Defective mitochondria fail to fuel the body and lead to brain damage, muscle wasting, heart failure and blindness. They are passed down only by the mother. So mitochondrial donation treatment is a modified form of IVF that uses mitochondria from a healthy donor egg. There are two techniques for performing mitochondrial donation. One takes places after the mothers egg has been fertilised by the fathers sperm and the other takes place before fertilisation. However, mitochondria have their own genetic information or DNA which means that technically the resulting children inherit DNA from their parents and a smidge from the donor as well. This is a permanent change that would be passed down through the generations. This donor DNA is only relevant for making effective mitochondria, does not affect other traits such as appearance and does not constitute a third parent. The technique was pioneered in Newcastle and laws were introduced to allow the creation of such babies in the UK in 2015. However, the UK did not immediately press ahead. The first baby born via this technique was to a Jordanian family having treatment in the US in 2016. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the HFEA) is saying less than five babies have been born as of 20 April 2023. It is not giving precise numbers to prevent the families being identified. These limited details have emerged after a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian newspaper. News that a small number of babies with donated mitochondria have now been born in the UK is the next step, in what will probably remain a slow and cautious process of assessing and refining mitochondrial donation, said Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust. There has been no word from the teams in Newcastle so it is still uncertain whether the technique was successful. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Research Institute, said: It will be interesting to know how well the mitochondrial replacement therapy technique worked at a practical level, whether the babies are free of mitochondrial disease, and whether there is any risk of them developing problems later in life. There is technically a risk of reversion where any defective mitochondria that are carried over could gain in number and still result in disease. It had once been estimated that up to 150 such babies could eventually be born each year in the UK. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "The Department of Meteorology has issued an alert for naval and fishing communities about strong winds and rough seas, as the very severe cyclonic storm Mocha has now intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm. In an advisory, the department said it is dangerous to engage in activities in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Galle via Mannar, Kankesanthurai, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Pottuvil, Hambantota and Matara. The naval and fishing communities are also requested to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard. Earlier today, the Meteorology Department said the extremely severe cyclonic storm Mocha is likely to move north-northwestwards and across southeast Bangladesh and north Myanmar coasts around the noon of May 14. Due to this system, the wind speed is expected to be 55-65 kmph and can increase up to 75-85 kmph in sea areas bounded by 05N - 15N and 82E - 87E. Meanwhile, the wind speed will be 115-125 kmph and can increase up to 145 kmph in sea areas bounded by 10N - 20N and 87E - 100E during in the coming hours.

        "title": "Youth representatives to engage with Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees",
        "date": "May 13, 2023 08:32 pm",
        "content": "The orientation workshop for youth representatives of the Sectoral oversight Committees of Parliament took place at Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla today (13 May). Addressing the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that in 25 years when the country has reached the path of success, the youth could proudly claim that, It was the step taken by us today that led to the system change which paved the way for the countrys success. The President mentioned that the opportunity has been provided to the youth to contribute to the journey towards a developed Sri Lanka in 2048. He noted that providing the youth representatives the chance to participate in the Sectoral Oversight Committees of the Parliament is a novel approach and emphasized that it has not yet been done in any country in the world. The President also expressed his confidence that this is the system change that the youth demanded and that they will take maximum advantage of this opportunity. The Orientation workshop was organized by the Parliament of Sri Lanka with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa also expressed their views during the occasion. Following the publication of a newspaper advertisement, these youth representatives were chosen for the Sectoral Oversight Committees related to 17 subject areas established in the Parliament. Accordingly, among the applications received by the Secretary General of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, nearly 550 eligible youth representatives between 18-35 years were invited to this workshop. These Sectoral Oversight Committees function with the participation of Parliamentarians representing all political parties in the Parliament. According to the provisions of the amended standing orders passed by the Parliament, the Chairperson of a Committee can call five youth representatives each to assist the Committees regarding the inquiries led by these Committees, so it is expected that the youth representatives will be selected in relation to each Committee. Speaking further President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; Today there are 535 youth Parliamentary representatives present on this occasion. Today you all come here to participate in the functions of the Parliament; not as an observer, but as young representatives in the Parliamentary Committees. I think this has happened for the first time in the world. Only the MPs can participate in a Parliamentary Committee, a US Senate Committee, or a Congressional Committee. But under the standing orders made by our Prime Minister, Speaker and Leader of the Opposition, you have been given the opportunity to participate as youth representatives in the Parliamentary Committees. As mentioned by the Prime Minister, apart from the report of the members of the Committee, you too get the opportunity to include your views in it. We only see debates and QA sessions inside the Parliamentary Chamber. But today the function of any Parliament is done through Committees. There are many Committees such as Oversight Committees and Finance Committees. If we approve funds for certain work, there are Oversight Committees to look into the spending of those funds. There are Oversight Committees to look into the implementation of law and there are also a number of Committees like the Committee on Public Finance. Therefore, you get the opportunity to participate in all activities in the Parliament other than speaking, voting and attending the Chamber. This has happened for the first time in the world. When we started this program, some said that this is useless and a waste of time. Some had a big question as to what this was. But a group of youth submitted their names fearlessly. We have selected the best 535 of them for this purpose. After all of you participate in this program and make this program a success, we can select the others for the next program. Although selecting youth representatives was not a problem this time, it will become a big challenge in the future as we expect more applications for the next program. It is on these programs that we should focus our attention on. You have got this opportunity today. Only a few people in history got this opportunity. I was lucky enough to get a Deputy Minister position in Parliament at the age of 28. Before that, as I came to the Parliament with then the Leader of Opposition Mr. Jayawardene, I was able to know how the Parliament functioned. But many do not get that opportunity. Today you have got that opportunity. So I would like to say to you, to get the full advantage of it. How did this system come about? Last year there was a big confusion in this country. It was at that time that I discussed with the former Speaker Mr. Karu Jayasuriya as to how we could answer this issue. There was no answer to confusions before this. All 225 members of the Parliament were asked to be thrown into the Diyawanna Lake. Doing so will only harm the environment. Anyway, other Party Secretaries will appoint another 225 here. So it is not really a solution. Burning houses or surrounding the Parliament and trying to capture it, are not solutions either. There were issues then. Why did we go bankrupt? What happened to our economy? Those questions have to be answered. When I was a child, Sri Lanka was second only to Japan. But where are we today? These issues cannot be solved like this. Accordingly, Mr. Karu Jayasuriya and I discussed together how we can change this system. He was the one who later called me and said that we will include youth representatives in the Oversight Committees and other Committees. I told him to give me a report about it and I gave it to the Speaker. Whether you take the party leaders or the Cabinet, now all of you are included in this. We should especially thank him for submitting this proposal. I dont think anyone else will have the opportunity you have. When the economy had collapsed, the country had gone bankrupt and when everyone thinks that this system cannot be continued, a major restructuring is being carried out. Our economy is being restructured, costs are being cut, and new systems are on the way. Now the fuel is distributed based on price formulas. At the same time, many of our corporations have to be restructured. We are thinking of a new education system. In particular, the Government has planned to bring 05 laws on climate change and several laws on womens rights. There are many other new laws underway. Therefore you will get the opportunity to discuss these and express your views. You will get to know how the money is spent, why the money is allocated to certain subjects and why money is not allocated to other subjects. There is currently a Research Department in Parliament to help you. In addition, we will establish a new office called the Parliamentary Budget Office. Support can be obtained from other Ministries. We have planned to convert the J. R. Jayawardene Centre into a political education institution. Then you will get the opportunity to take full advantage of this. As members of the Parliament, as Chairpersons, we must do that work. We never turned this into a conflict of opinion in the Parliament Chamber. In some cases, there were conflicts between parties and MPs. The Chairpersons and Councilors of this Oversight Committees have a duty to hold those meetings, as well as participate in them and to discuss not only the daily affairs but important matters. I suggest to the Speaker that these Committees should meet every month. If the Committee meetings are not held, the Chairperson should be inquired. If MPs do not attend the meetings, it should be looked into. If they fail to attend for two months, change them. Otherwise, the opportunities available to this group will be lost. Take full advantage of this opportunity. This is a historic moment. For the first time, a Parliament appoints representatives like this. This has not happened anywhere. Our Parliament is also an old Parliament. Its history dates back to 1835. How many Parliaments are older than ours? They are the Parliaments in UK, USA, Denmark and Switzerland. Various programs have been carried out in this Parliament. Today there is a new system. The Commonwealth Parliamentary group can also be informed about this initiative and they can also be invited to come. And I will also inform the International Parliamentary Union We can get support from the UK Parliament and US Congress to continue this program. Those responsibilities have been entrusted to you. Members of Parliament and youth representatives should join together and carry out this work. We will not end this work here. How can we become a developed country? We cannot always remain to be a developing country. We want a better future. For that, there should be a good economy and the law should be implemented. Give your views on it. In particular, Mr. Karu Jayasuriya is bringing the Jana Sabha Act to establish a Jana Sabha in every Grama Niladhari division. That would be another special opportunity for youth to participate. The selections for the youth Parliament have now become very limited. The National Youth Service Council is discussing with all the youth organizations at divisional secretariat levels about these selections. There are a number of other new measures. This system should be changed. It can be done in accordance with the constitution. Instead of waiting for the next Parliament to be appointed, now is the opportunity to get together and do this work. So lets accept this challenge. Lets provide successful solutions. In another 25 years, all of you can say that Sri Lanka has become a developed country now, because of the steps we had taken today. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena As we enter a special phase in our countrys development, I am reminded of President Ranil Wickremesinghes pledge to fulfil a task that we have now been able to implement. Today, more than 500 youth representatives are present for 17 Sectoral Oversight Committees, ushering in a new era of participatory democracy. It is both our responsibility to create a new political chapter through this approach. Reflecting on the past, its been 60 years since the youth were given the right to vote. Before that, we did not have a voice in shaping our countrys future. Unfortunately, due to the improper utilization of our countrys resources, weve witnessed a huge wastage over the years. Without proper supervision, our countrys resources were not being utilized effectively. This is where the contribution of educated and intelligent young people is critical, not only to discuss proposals but to implement them. If Parliaments Standing Orders have necessary deficiencies, they should be open to discussion. Only then can this program be successful in establishing the countrys law, creating political stability, and moving the country forward with a new economy. I see it as a national task to provide clear participation in building the future of Sri Lanka. The United Nations Development Program has been providing great support to our country, making it possible to bring the results of new participation. We have many challenges to overcome, but with enthusiasm, commitment, and determination, we can overcome them. We need to embark on a new journey through creativity, not just focus on the challenges ahead. We must also think about the young generation who drop out of education and fail in general and advanced-level studies. We need to think about this problem anew. The President is taking steps to provide them with the necessary training and technical knowledge. Lets shift from traditional thinking and make the opinions held by Oversight Committees and the suggestions of the youth a great strength for our countrys progress. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena As I sit here in Parliament, I feel proud to be part of a turning point in our countrys political history. This is the first time that such a program has been implemented, and its an honor to be part of it. The Presidents idea of using youth representation for this purpose is a testament to his belief that the ideas and suggestions of the youth are necessary for the governance of the country. He established the Youth Parliament and the National Youth Service Council in the distant past to further this belief. The General Secretary of the Parliament also played a key role in making these activities successful. Our country has faced some unfortunate eras, including two youth rebellions and a thirty-year war. Weve experimented with various solutions to restore the affairs of the country, and recently, we faced a big crisis. Some people thought of fighting and burning houses as a solution, but it only led to more problems. Its after such a difficult time that weve come to where we are today. I have been appointed as a guest representative of the Sectoral Committees, which strictly supervise every act and law passed in the country. Deficiencies are discussed before being adopted in Parliament and its the responsibility of the youth to provide an intellectual dialogue based on their studies. Its expected that the future program of the country will be prepared, corrected, and well-implemented based on these discussions. The opinions of all these people are important for our country. Weve faced rebellions and wars, and our economy has collapsed. But we have strength, we have a valuable environment, and we have intelligent people. We should not kneel before another country. Its time for us to come together and work towards a better future for Sri Lanka. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa It is often seen politics there is a huge gap between declaratory policy and action policy. Many are talking of walk the talk. I believe that today will be a turning point in our country if what has been announced is implemented, the beginning is optimistic, and if this is implemented in a cultured and an efficient manner. As the opposition, we see this process in a positive aspect. As an opposition, even if the shortcomings of the Government are pointed out, in a cultured political system, when something correct, optimistic, substantive and positive happens, it is impossible to look away without praising it. One must have the guts to appreciate good as good. This decision taken by the President and all of you is very optimistic. If something good happens to the country in the process of recovering the bankrupt Sri Lanka from that bankruptcy, it should be appreciated. The tripartite Governance of the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary is recognized in the democratic system. There should be distribution of powers. Protection and balance between these three institutions is very important. Today, 530 youth representatives participate in 17 Sectoral Oversight Committees in this country to properly implement that protection and balance process. If this action is taken as a ranking when comparing the steps taken today with other countries in the world, Sri Lanka is in the first place. This can be called the best process in the world that listens to the youth and gives the youth participation in the democratic process. It is a matter of great joy. There have been many youth riots in this country. Even if we dont recall that unpleasant past, we should learn from it. The time has arrived to come together for the common duty of the country, even though we are on various contradictions on policies, theories and philosophies. It should add value to the country and not to share positions. Unconditional support is given to continue the optimal steps taken. Azusa Kubota Resident Representative for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka Im pleased and deeply humbled to be part of the orientation program for youth representatives of the Sectoral Oversight Committees in more than 60 countries. UNDP supports parliamentary strengthening initiatives because we firmly believe in the important role played by the legislature in fostering democracy and promoting sustainable and inclusive development. Our global collaboration with the parliaments around the world focuses on strengthening all core functions of the Parliament. These functions include lawmaking, oversight, representation and budget scrutiny. While doing so, we hope to further enhance the inclusivity and representation of the peoples. We promote a greater oversight of transparent governance processes and to improve the effectiveness of its functioning. The current program we have with the Parliament of Sri Lanka is one of such flagship partnerships in the Asia Pacific region. For over a decade, UNDP has been supporting Sri Lankas parliament to strengthen responsiveness, inclusiveness and representation. Its lawmaking processes. For example, working together with our fellow parliamentary development partners. We have continued to strengthen its public relations and communication functions. One concrete result is inclusion of hearing impaired segments of the society in the Parliament process through the provision of real time sign language interpretation services. In an ideal world, the look of the parliaments on the world should reflect the diversity of the society they represent. However, we know societal barriers and systemic factors often make equal and inclusive representation in its followers forms impractical or impossible in many countries. Attaining an equal representation of women in the parliament continues to face notable challenges. Here in Sri Lanka, it remains as a little over 5 of the seats represented by women. Bringing about changes will require bold policies, such as the introduction of a quota and long term transformation in systems and norms. Therefore, innovative mechanisms such as the one being launched today are catalytic in fulfilling the existing gaps in representation and inclusivity, at least as a short term measure. We in UNDP greatly value the importance of youth representation and participation in the work of the Parliament. All religious leaders led by the Maha Sangharatna and Ministers, Parliamentary Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake, Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse, Deputy Chairman of the Committee MP Angajan Ramanathan, Chairman of the Parliamentary Caucus for Youth Hesha Withanage and a group of invited guests and youth representatives attended the event.",

        "content": "A prison guard of the Magazine New Remand Prison in Colombo has reportedly been assaulted by three unidentified persons. Accordingly, three unknown persons had broken into the said prison guards private residence in Minuwangoda and had him kneel on the floor, after which they had beaten the guard up while threatening his life. The suspects had fled soon after, Police said, adding that it is likely that the attack took place on the directives of an inmate at the Magazine New Remand Prison. The victimised prison guard has been identified as Sanka Kusal Marasinghe, who reportedly took strict legal action against those involved in heroin trafficking rings within the prison. Upon further investigations, Ada Derana also found out that the prison guard in question had previously successfully busted several heroin trafficking rings, and had received death threats via telephone calls from various numbers. As per a statement obtained from the guard, Police further stated that the suspects are believed to have arrived on a motorcycle at around 04:00 a.m. last morning (12 May) clad in black jackets and had knocked on the door of the guards private residence. They had subsequently attempted to bind the guards hands with zip-ties, however had later held a pistol to his head, threatening to kill him if he made any further attempts against the heroin trafficking rings within the prison. They had also threatened him to refrain from reporting the matter to the Police, claiming that they would take care of the matter if he did so, the prison guard said, adding that one of the three had videoed the entire assault. The prison guard had then lodged a complaint at the Minuwangoda Police, after which he was admitted to the Minuwangoda Hospital. He was, however, transferred to the Gampaha Hospital this afternoon (13 May) for further treatment. While the Department of Prisons has commenced an internal investigation into the matter, the State Intelligence Service has also commenced probes into the attack.",

I cried because we are foreigners and we came here to learn how to make traditional French bread, Tharshan Selvarajah told AFP on Thursday. I am very happy to have won the prize. Fifteen baguette connoisseurs on Wednesday selected Selvarajahs version of the iconic French bread as the best among 175 anonymous contenders. Members of the jury, including six ordinary Parisians, had to rate dozens of baguette on their taste, crust, crumb, air bubbles, and overall aspect. Dont drink at the start or you wont be able to make it to the end of the tasting, Paris official Olivia Polski warned judges before they started. A video she shared on Twitter shows her then ringing up the baker based in eastern Paris to tell him the good news. Noooo, he can be heard saying on the other end of the line. Selvarajah told AFP he always makes his long loaves with love, while smiling, laughing and singing, and the result is well-cooked, delicious and crusty. He has won 4,000 euros (more than 4,300) and the opportunity to supply baguettes to the presidential palace. Im so happy that the president will taste my bread. Just taking it to the palace is exciting, he told AFP. UN cultural body UNESCO awarded the baguette world heritage status in November last year. Source - AFP - Agencies",

        "date": "May 14, 2023 09:46 am",
        "content": "The Australian Government has announced that it will gift a former Royal Australian Air Force Beechcraft KA350 King Air aircraft (registration A32-673) to the Sri Lankan Government. The aircraft will be used to enhance Sri Lankas sovereign aerial maritime surveillance capability. This was conveyed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe when an Australian delegation led by the Australian High Commissioner HE Paul Stephens met the President at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday (12 May). The gift of the aircraft is part of the Australian Governments commitment to strengthening and enhancing the cooperation and collaboration that is the foundation of the strong bilateral relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka. A key focus of this relationship remains the continued cooperation on countering all forms of transnational crime, including drug smuggling, as well as strengthening border management through intelligence sharing and the deterrence, disruption, interception and return of maritime people smuggling ventures under the border security operation known as Operation Sovereign Borders. The Australian Government greatly values this cooperation, which has led to the disruption of a significant number of maritime people smuggling ventures, and has protected the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable people by preventing criminal exploitation, dangerous sea voyages and loss of life at sea. Following the Australian Minister for Home Affairs visit to Sri Lanka in June last year, the Department of Home Affairs has driven forward a number of new initiatives in these areas, in partnership with a number of Sri Lankan Government departments. In pursuing these initiatives, Australia has emphasised the importance of supporting Sri Lanka to develop sovereign capabilities As part of the gift of the aircraft, the Australian Government will also provide sustainment support for a period of 12 months, after which sustainment will become the sole responsibility of the Sri Lanka Government The Australian Government is confident that this gift will further strengthen the strong bilateral relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka, and will help to enhance Sri Lankas ability to counter transnational crime and protect its borders. Deputy High Commissioner Ms Lalita Kapur, First Secretary Mr Brett Zehnder and Defence Advisor Captain Ian Cain were also present at this meeting.",

Finlands Käärijä, a green-bolero-sleeved rapper, came second. He won the viewer vote with Cha Cha Cha, but it was not enough to overtake Loreens lead after the result from the juries in the 37 participating countries. I am seriously overwhelmed, Loreen told reporters. Comparing her win to 2012, she said: Its like coming back to a family. Loreen is the only person after Irelands Johnny Logan to win the contest twice, and her victory puts Sweden level with Ireland as the most successful Eurovision countries, 49 years after Abbas famous victory. The 67th edition of the musical festival was held in the City of Pop on behalf of Ukraine, last years winner, which was unable to host this year because of Russias invasion. Organisers had to walk a tightrope between putting Ukraine centre stage and steering clear of any overt political messages, which are not allowed in the contest. They largely succeeded. Kalush Orchestra, 2022s winner, mixed video recorded in Ukraine with live performance in Liverpool in an opening sequence that included a cameo appearance from Britains Kate, Princess of Wales, playing the piano. But as the contest was underway, Russian missiles hit the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil, home to electro-pop duo Tvorchi, this years entry from the country. Local authorities, writing on Telegram, said the strike had injured two people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was barred from addressing worldwide viewers - who numbered 160 million last year - by contest organiser the European Broadcasting Union. It said that granting his request, which was made with laudable intentions, would be against the non-political nature of the event and its rules prohibiting making political statements. UKRAINIAN SPIRIT Nonetheless, the show, watched by thousands in person on the banks of the River Mersey and by millions on TV, was infused with the spirit of Ukraine, notably in a rendition of Youll Never Walk Alone jointly sung in the arena and in Ukraine and which brought many in the audience to tears. The 26 acts in the final spanned musical styles from ballads to heavy rock to rap, and included a handful of bizarre performances that the contest is renowned for. Germany finished bottom of the table, just behind Britain, but no country received the dreaded nul points. Pam Minto, a 37-year-old support worker, said she hoped her city did Ukraine proud. Weve just loved the whole event right across Liverpool from start to finish. Its just been amazing, she said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

SriLankan Airlines in 2021 witnessed a loss in revenues of 49.7 billion Sri Lankan Rupees. The SriLankan Airlines in 2022 witnessed a loss of 168.58 billion Sri Lankan Rupees while the loss during 2021 stood at 49.7 billion, the statement from the national carrier said. SriLankan Airlines is one of the 52 loss making state enterprises that the International Monetary Fund had recommended for restructuring whilst approving the near 3 billion dollar bail out facility mid March. The airline in its history had only made profits between 1998 and 2008 the period of its management being vested in the Emirates Airlines. Immediately after receiving the first tranche of the IMF bail out, the government set up the state owned enterprise restructuring unit (SRU) under the ministry of finance to divest the businesses that have been a burden on the economy. The SRU was tasked with appointing reputed qualified consultancy firms to carry out the divestiture process of the state enterprises. The SriLankan statement on losses came as the IMF staff team arrived on Thursday to check on Sri Lankas progress on the reforms envisaged before its scheduled review in September.

Mocha has a diameter of more than 500 kilometers and its impact will be felt in many areas of Bangladesh, the BMD Director Md Azizur Rahman. According to a special bulletin of the BMD, the cyclone, packing winds of up to 215 miles per hour, brought destructive winds and a potentially devastating storm surge. Streets in coastal city Sittwe were turned into rivers as the biggest storm to hit the Bay of Bengal in more than a decade surged through the seaside town. The water is gradually rising, social worker Wai Hun Aung told AFP from Sittwe. The tide has reached to the drain in front of a school... Soon we will move our important belongings upstairs. The wind ripped apart homes made of tarpaulin and bamboo at one camp for displaced Rohingya at Kyaukphyu in Myanmars Rakhine state. Its residents were anxiously watching the rising sea tide, camp leader Khin Shwe told AFP. We are now going to check whether sea water is increasing to our place... if the sea water rises, our camp can be flooded. In Teknaf in Bangladesh, high winds uprooted trees, brought traffic to a halt and sent residents running for cover, an AFP correspondent said. Our camp houses, which are constructed with bamboo and tarpaulins, can be blown away in soft, light winds, Mohammad Sayed, 28, told AFP from Nayapara refugee camp in Coxs Bazar. The schools, which are designated as cyclone shelters ... are not strong shelters that can withstand the winds of a cyclone. We are scared. Officials said there were no report of casualty so far of the cyclone in the affected areas. Thousands left Sittwe on Saturday, packing into trucks, cars and tuk-tuks and heading for higher ground inland as meteorologists warned of a storm surge of up to 3.5 meters. Bangladeshi State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman told journalists that they have taken adequate measures to support the affected people. The Myanmar Red Cross Society said it was preparing for a major emergency response. Cyclone Mocha is the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr, Azizur Rahman, head of Bangladeshs Meteorological Department, told AFP. Sidr hit Bangladeshs southern coast in November 2007, killing more than 3,000 people and causing billions of dollars in damage. Cyclones  the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the Northwest Pacific  are a regular and deadly menace on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean where tens of millions of people live. Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmars Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, killing at least 138,000 people.

Freedom does not come easily. You have to snatch it. You have to sacrifice for it, the 70-year-old leader said in a speech broadcast on YouTube on Saturday night a day after he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. He called for supporters to hold protests at the end of your streets and villages across the country on Sunday evening for one hour starting at 5:30pm (12:30 GMT). Khan, who has been slapped with a slew of cases since he was removed from power last April, was freed on bail on Friday after his detention in a corruption case was declared unlawful by the top court. Several top leaders of Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party still remain under arrest. Khans arrest, which his supporters called a kidnapping, shocked the nation, triggering street protests. Calling for his release, supporters blocked roads and damaged property belonging to the military, who they blame for Khans removal. Sunday morning was quiet after several days of violence and political chaos. Khan has remained steadfast in his demand for immediate elections. He has emerged as the countrys most popular leader and has held numerous rallies since his removal to call for national elections. Khan survived an assassination attempt last year during one of his large rallies for which he has blamed the countrys powerful army. The army chiefs actions have made our military bad. It is because of him, not because of me, Khan said from his home in Lahore. On Friday, he told reporters that one man, the army chief was behind his arrest. Pakistans military has staged three coups since the country was founded in 1947. It has directly ruled over the country for more than three decades and enjoys massive influence in domestic politics. The military has historically intervened, citing economic or political instability in the country. However, despite widespread fears about another intervention during months of tumult, the military said it stood by the democratic process. The armys senior leadership, the chief of army staff, places its complete trust in democracy. There is no question of martial law, chief military spokesman Major-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Geo News channel on Saturday. Thousands arrested Meanwhile, Khan has distanced himself from the attacks against the militarys installations at the protests, denying his party workers were involved and calling for an independent investigation into the violence. The army, which denies the accusations made by Khan, on Saturday warned against attempts to create misperceptions against the institution. At least nine people died in the unrest last week, police and hospitals have said. No official casualty figures have been announced yet. Hundreds of police officers were injured and more than 4,000 people detained, mostly in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, according to authorities. At least 10 senior PTI leaders, including a former foreign minister, have been arrested since the protests began, one of Khans lawyers said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the head of a shaky coalition, on Saturday warned that those involved in facilitating, abetting and perpetrating the violence should be arrested within 72 hours. Major social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter remain inaccessible. The Ministry of Interior had instructed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to suspend mobile internet services across the country, and blocked access to the three social media networks, on Tuesday night. Mobile data services had been partly restored around the country as of Saturday. The political upheaval in the country has been simmering for months, with Khan attempting to disrupt the coalition government by dissolving two provincial parliaments he controlled and agitating for early elections. Khan is a cricket star-turned-politician who was removed as prime minister in April 2022 in a parliamentary no-confidence vote. He accuses an army role in his removal.

        "date": "May 14, 2023 06:41 pm",
        "content": "The new leadership of the Saudi-Sri Lanka Parliamentary Friendship Association vowed on Saturday to take bilateral ties to the next level by focusing on people-to-people connections that have been boosted by the Kingdoms focus on tourism. Established in Riyadh in 2002, the parliamentary association aims to strengthen relations between Sri Lankas MPs and Saudi Shoura councilors in all fields of cooperation. Environment Minister Naseer Ahamed, who was elected as the associations new president on May 10, told Arab News he will focus on economic, political, social and cultural issues during his tenure. I look at the need for stronger relations in the larger context of the Middle East and South Asia region and geopolitical priorities, he said. I hope to take that to the next level. Ahamed, a graduate of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, has ties with the Kingdom going back decades. He entered Sri Lankan politics in the 1990s and has served as a member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, a presidential adviser, and chief minister of Eastern Province. In April last year, he was appointed to lead the Ministry of Environment and oversee Middle Eastern affairs. Ahamed said that he prioritizes the importance of people-to-people relations in establishing stronger ties between countries. Our mission is to develop people-to-people contact. This can be done more easily now since Saudi Arabia has opened up for tourists, he said, referring to the Kingdoms huge investment in tourism infrastructure under Vision 2030. The last time a Saudi Shoura delegation visited Sri Lanka was in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. Ahamed said that he was planning to increase interaction between the parliamentary associations members for the sake of new collaborations between their countries. There are several areas where the two countries could develop new areas of cooperation, he said. The association will provide the necessary platform to extend areas of cooperation to new fields of interests. Source - Arab News - Agencies",

He further explained that the measure was taken in attempts to further encourage such interests amongst the youth, and to allow those already interested in such activities to have a farm or animal husbandry of their own. Thus, as part of the first phase of the programme, 50 youths from the Hambantota district will be granted loans of Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2 million at an interest rate of 6.5, the Minister stated, adding that the relevant officials of state banks have been instructed to act accordingly.",

        "date": "May 14, 2023 07:36 pm",
        "content": "Turks voted on Sunday in one of the most consequential elections in the countrys 100-year history, a contest that could end President Tayyip Erdogans imperious 20-year rule and reverberate well beyond Turkeys borders. The presidential vote will decide not only who leads Turkey, a NATO-member country of 85 million, but also how it is governed, where its economy is headed amid a deep cost of living crisis, and the shape of its foreign policy. Opinion polls have given Erdogans main challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who heads a six-party alliance, a slight lead, with two polls on Friday showing him above the 50 threshold needed to win outright. If neither wins more than 50 of the vote on Sunday, a runoff will be held on May 28. Polling stations in the election, which is also for a new parliament, close at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). Turkish law bans the reporting of any results until 9 p.m. By late on Sunday there could be a good indication of whether there will be a runoff. With Erdogan slightly trailing his rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the elections are being intently watched in Western capitals, the Middle East, NATO and Moscow. A defeat for Erdogan, one of President Vladimir Putins most important allies, will likely unnerve the Kremlin but comfort the Biden administration, as well as many European and Middle Eastern leaders who had troubled relations with Erdogan. Turkeys longest-serving leader has turned the NATO member and Europes second largest country into a global player from Libya and Syria to Ukraine, modernized it through megaprojects such as new bridges, hospitals and airports, and built a military industry sought by foreign states. But his volatile economic policy of low interest rates, which set off a spiralling cost of living crisis and inflation, left him prey to voters anger. His governments slow response to a devastating earthquake in southeast Turkey that killed 50,000 people added to voters dismay. Kilicdaroglu has pledged to set Turkey on a new course by reviving democracy after years of state repression, returning to orthodox economic policies, empowering institutions who lost autonomy under Erdogans tight grasp and rebuilding frail ties with the West. Thousands of political prisoners and activists, including high level names such as Kurdish leader Selahattin Demirtas and philantropist Osman Kavala, could be released if the opposition prevails. POLARISED POLITICS I see these elections as a choice between democracy and dictatorship, said Ahmet Kalkan, 64, as he voted in Istanbul for Kilicdaroglu, echoing critics who fear Erdogan will govern ever more autocratically if he wins. I chose democracy and I hope that my country chooses democracy, said Kalkan, a retired health sector worker. Erdogan, 69 and a veteran of a dozen election victories, says he respects democracy and denies being a dictator. Illustrating how the president still commands support, Mehmet Akif Kahraman, also voting in Istanbul, said Erdogan still represented the future even after two decades in power. God willing, Turkey will be a world leader, he said. Voters elsewhere in the country also expressed views for and against Erdogan, a polarising figure hoping to extend his tenure as the longest-serving ruler since modern Turkey was established 100 years ago. Erdogan, voting in Istanbul, shook the hands of election officials and spoke to a TV reporter in the polling station. We pray to God for a better future for our country, nation and Turkish democracy, he said. He later travelled to Ankara, despite having said he would monitor the election from Istanbul. A smiling Kilicdaroglu, 74, voted in Ankara and emerged to applause from the waiting crowd. I offer my most sincere love and respect to all my citizens who are going to the ballot box and voting. We all miss democracy so much, he told the assembled media. The parliamentary vote is a tight race between the Peoples Alliance comprising Erdogans Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP) and the nationalist MHP and others, and Kilicdaroglus Nation Alliance formed of six opposition parties, including his secularist Republican Peoples Party (CHP), established by Turkeys founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Voting was being monitored by a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which said it would deliver a preliminary statement on Monday on its findings. CHANGE OR CONTINUITY Erdogan, a powerful orator and master campaigner, has pulled out all the stops on the campaign trail. He commands fierce loyalty from pious Turks who once felt disenfranchised in secular Turkey and his political career has survived an attempted coup in 2016, and numerous corruption scandals. However, if Turks do oust Erdogan it will be largely because they saw their prosperity and ability to meet basic needs decline, with inflation that topped 85 in Oct. 2022 and a collapse in the lira currency. Kilicdaroglu says he would seek to return Turkey to the parliamentary system of governance, from Erdogans executive presidential system passed in a referendum in 2017. He has also promised to restore the independence of a judiciary that critics say Erdogan has used to crack down on dissent. Erdogan has taken tight control of most of Turkeys institutions and sidelined liberals and critics. Human Rights Watch, in its World Report 2022, said Erdogans government has set back Turkeys human rights record by decades. Kurdish voters, who account for 15-20 of the electorate, will play a vital role, with the Nation Alliance unlikely to attain a parliamentary majority by itself. The pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) is not part of the main opposition alliance but fiercely opposes Erdogan after a crackdown on its members in recent years. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "May 15, 2023 11:03 am",
        "content": "Rescuers early Monday evacuated about 1,000 people trapped by seawater 3.6 meters (12 feet ) deep along western Myanmars coast after a powerful cyclone injured hundreds and cut off communications. Damage and at least five deaths have been reported, but the true impact was not yet clear in one of Asias least developed countries. Strong winds injured more than 700 of about 20,000 people who were sheltering in sturdier buildings on the highlands of Sittwe township such as monasteries, pagodas and schools, according to a leader of the Rakhine Youths Philanthropic Association in Sittwe. He asked not to be named due to fear of reprisals from the authorities in the military-run country. Seawater raced into more than 10 low-lying wards near the shore as Cyclone Mocha made landfall in Rakhine state Sunday afternoon, he said. Residents moved to roofs and higher floors, while the wind and storm surge prevented immediate rescue. After 4 p.m. yesterday, the storm weakened a bit, but the water did not fall back. Most of them sat on the roof and at the high places of their houses the whole night. The wind blew all night, the rescue group leader said. Water was still about 1.5 meters (5 feet) high in flooded areas Monday morning, but rescues were being made as the wind calmed and the sun rose in the sky. He asked civil society organizations and authorities to send aid and help evacuate residents. At least five deaths have been reported in Myanmar by local media and rescue groups. Several injuries were reported in neighboring Bangladesh, which was spared the predicted direct hit. Mocha made landfall near Sittwe township with winds blowing up to 209 kilometers (130 miles) per hour, Myanmars Meteorological Department said. By Monday morning, it was downgraded from its severe status and was steadily weakening over land, according to the India Meteorological Department. The State Administration Council issued disaster declarations for 17 townships in Rakhine state. High winds crumpled cell phone towers, but in videos collected by local media before communications were lost, deep water raced through streets and wind blew off roofs. Myanmars military information office said the storm had damaged houses and electrical transformers in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It said roofs were torn off buildings on the Coco Islands, about 425 kilometers (264 miles) southwest of the countrys largest city, Yangon. Volunteers previously said shelters in Sittwe did not have enough food after more people arrived there seeking help. Mocha largely spared the Bangladeshi city of Coxs Bazar, which initially had been in the storms predicted path. Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the cyclone veered east. About a dozen people were injured on Saint Martins Island, while some 300 homes were either destroyed or damaged, leading Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo reported. U.N. agencies and aid workers in Bangladesh had prepositioned tons of dry food and dozens of ambulances in the refugee camps that house more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims who fled persecution in Myanmar. In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar with a storm surge that devastated populated areas around the Irrawaddy River delta. At least 138,000 people died and tens of thousands of homes and other buildings were washed away. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune city, said cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are becoming more intense more quickly, in part because of climate change. Climate scientists say cyclones can now retain their energy for many days. Cyclone Amphan in eastern India in 2020 continued to travel over land as a strong cyclone and caused extensive devastation. As long as oceans are warm and winds are favorable, cyclones will retain their intensity for a longer period, Koll said. Tropical cyclones, which are called hurricanes or typhoons in other regions, are among the worlds most devastating natural disasters when they hit densely populated coastal areas.

The other thing is that the country can know with whom the public mandate lies, MP Ganesan claimed.",

        "content": "The use of fingerprint machines for marking attendance has been made mandatory for government employees from today (May 15). The circular related to the matter was issued on May 12 with the signature of the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, K.D. N. Ranjith Asoka. The Ministry states that the use of fingerprint machines was temporarily suspended in the past few years as a result of the Covid epidemic situation. However, fingerprinting has been made compulsory once again, after information was reported that some employees had taken advantage of it, by mentioning their arrival time as 08.00 a.m., although they had arrived to work at 10.00 a.m. Many government employees have reportedly obtained overtime allowances in such a manner, and it is reported that this situation was more commonly observed within the Ministry of Health. Accordingly, the use of fingerprint machines has been made mandatory for all government employees from today, in order to prevent such fraudulent actions.",

During a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on May 14, the President stressed the need for comprehensive development in the Western Province through a formal city development plan, stating that informal development could become uncontrollable. The Western Province contributes about 50 per cent to the countrys economy, making its development crucial, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Wickremesinghe instructed officials to present the development plan for the Eastern Province to the Cabinet. He also reminded everyone that the first plan related to the development of the Western Province was presented by Minister Indika Gunawardena in 1997 but was never implemented, the PMD said. The plan presented by Surbana Jurong Company in Singapore in 2004 also suffered a similar fate. The President urged officials to discuss the revised plan proposed by the company in 2015 and come to an urgent decision on the basic development plan needed for the Western Province, with further amendments if necessary. The President was presented with the main development plan proposed to be implemented in the Western Province through the Urban Development Authority, and officials also discussed the release of land and land acquisition for the implementation of development works.

        "date": "May 15, 2023 03:15 pm",
        "content": "Three suspects including the main suspect in the death of the 16-year-old girl outside a hotel in Kalutara have been ordered to be further remanded until May 26, after being produced before the Kalutara Magistrates Court today (May 15). Meanwhile, the hotel owners wife who was arrested in relation to the incident has been granted bail, according to Ada Derana reporter. On May 06, the naked corpse of a 16-year-old girl was found near the railway tracks in Kalutara, after she reportedly fell to her death from the third floor of a five-storey hotel in the area. Danushka Gayan Sahabandu, a 29-year-old resident of Isuru Uyana in Kalutara, was arrested on May 09, three days after the teens body was recovered. During preliminary interrogations, the suspect, however, denied all murder accusations. He told the police that the girl had, in fact, jumped off the hotel building after receiving a phone call. He divulged that he visited the hotel on May 06 along with another young couple (a young woman aged 19 and a 22-year-old male) and the 16-year-old girl after renting two rooms on the third floor. He also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. The suspect had also mentioned that he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to meeting her for the first time on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old. Soon after his arrest, Kalutara Magistrates Court, on May 10, allowed the police to detain him for a period of 48 hours for further questioning. Following the detention period, he was produced before the Kalutara Magistrate who ordered to place him in remand custody until May 26. Meanwhile, the wife of the hotel owner was arrested on Thursday (May 11) on account of failing to properly check the deceaseds National Identity Card (NIC) before accommodating her at the said hotel. Initial probes had revealed that the NIC produced by the 16-year-old girl to rent a room at the hotel belongs to one of her friends. On Thursday, on the directives of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the investigations into the tragic incident were handed over to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). Against this backdrop, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) has deemed the hotel building in question an illegal construction. In a report, the UDA listed nine discrepancies with the construction in question, adding that the approval of the Kalutara Municipal Council had not been obtained prior.",
