She explained, Some reduction is seen in the first three harvest cycles. There is a decrease in the coconut production this year mainly due to the two factors of low rainfall and high temperature in the coconut growing regions. Until April of next year, we will get a low harvest than expected.

        "title": "TikToks founder becomes Chinas new richest person",
        "date": "October 31, 2024 10:52 am",
        "content": "China has a new richest person  and its the entrepreneur behind the wildly popular, and controversial, app TikTok. Zhang Yiming, 41, co-founder of TikToks parent company ByteDance, topped the 2024 Hurun China Rich List, released Tuesday. His wealth reached 49.3 billion, as assessed by research, media and investment group Hurun Inc, which publishes the ranking of the countrys richest people. Zhangs ascendency comes after ByteDances global revenue grew 30 last year to 110 billion, Hurun said. Since its official launch in May 2017, TikTok has been catapulted to mass global popularity as well as becoming an era-defining social media platform beloved by many young people around the world  and a trailblazing example for other Chinese companies eager to break into US and global markets. But its also now facing mounting legal battles in the US, where according to Hurun it has nearly 200 million users. There, TikTok is battling state and federal lawsuits related to alleged failures to protect children using the app, while it and ByteDance are fighting a law that could force a nationwide ban of the app if TikTok doesnt spin off its US operations. The law  signed in April  follows years of US allegations that TikToks ties to China could potentially expose Americans personal information to the Chinese government. TikTok strongly denies the allegations, which come as a growing China-US rivalry has fueled broader American national security concerns about Chinese tech firms. TikTok has also rejected the allegations relating to child protection. Other countries have also cited national security concerns, including India which has banned TikTok. Western allies such as Britain, Canada and Australia have restricted TikToks use on government devices. But those regulatory hurdles have done little to dent TikToks growing global appeal among users. Zhang owns 20 of ByteDance, which he co-founded with college roommate Liang Rubo in Beijing in 2012. He stepped down as its CEO 2021 after building ByteDance into one of the biggest names in Chinese tech. ByteDance also holds Chinas popular news app Toutiao and Douyin, TikToks sister app in China. Zhangs rise to the top of the rich list knocked Chinas bottled water king Zhong Shanshan out of the lead spot for the first time in three years, though he remained second. Zhong faced a wave of online vitriol earlier this year from nationalists who accused him of a lack of patriotism in a campaign that hit the price of shares of his beverage company. In third place was Pony Ma, founder of multimedia and entertainment giant Tencent, which owns Chinas ubiquitous messaging and payments platform WeChat. Billionaires on the decline Overall, the number of US-dollar billionaires in China shrank to 753, down 142 from the previous year. China has also lost 432 or just over a third of its billionaires since a peak of 1,185 in 2021, Hurun said. The number of people ranked on the list  1,094  also shrank overall for the third consecutive year. The list includes those individuals assessed to have at least 5 billion yuan (roughly 700 million) as of the end of August. The list also includes those living in Hong Kong and Macao as well as in the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan. Hurun Report chairman Rupert Hoogewerf chalked the decline up to a difficult year for Chinas economy and stock markets. China is grappling with steep economic challenges, with a real estate crisis, high local government debt and lagging consumer spending among factors ratcheting global concern about the health and trajectory of the worlds second-largest economy. The number of individuals on the list was down by 12 in the past year to just under 1100 individuals and 25 from the high point of 2021, when we managed to find 1465 individuals with 5 billion (yuan), he said in a statement. The old guard, represented by real estate developers, have given way to a new guard of tech, new energy, consumer electronics, especially smart phones, ecommerce, especially cross-border ecommerce, consumer products and healthcare, he said.

        "date": "October 31, 2024 11:35 am",
        "content": "The Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has seen its quarterly revenues soar, beating Teslas for the first time. It posted more than 200bn yuan (28.2bn, 21.8bn) in revenues between July and September. This is a 24 jump from the same period last year, and more than Elon Musks company whose quarterly revenue was 25.2bn. However, Tesla still sold more electric vehicle (EVs) than BYD in the third quarter. It comes as EV sales in China have been getting a boost from government subsidies to encourage consumers to trade their petrol-powered cars for EVs or hybrids. BYD also notched a monthly sales record in the last month of the quarter, in a sign that momentum continues to build for Chinas bestselling car maker. But there is a growing backlash abroad against the Chinese governments support for domestic car makers like BYD. Earlier this week, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3 on imports of Chinese made EVs came into force across the bloc. Chinese EV makers were already facing a 100 tax from the United States and Canada. The tariffs are in response to alleged unfair state subsidisation of Chinas car industry. As of last week, official data showed 1.57 million applications had been submitted for a national subsidy of 2,800 per each older vehicle traded in for a greener one. Thats on top of other government incentives already in place. China has been counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy, and the EU is the largest overseas market for the countrys electric car industry. Its domestic car industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades and its brands, such as BYD, have begun moving into international markets, prompting fears from the likes of the EU that its own companies will be unable to compete with the cheaper prices.

Joining the groundbreaking ceremony for Indiana-based SHIELD companys new seatbelt factory in Sri Lanka, the US Ambassador said that SHIELDs decision to shift its facility in China to establish a manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka is a testament to the growing interest of U.S. investment in Sri Lanka. The United States is already the largest export market for Sri Lanka, and its wonderful to see greater U.S. investment directly here, as well. We want to see even greater bilateral trade and investment expand both ways in the years to come, she added. Speaking further during the event, Ms Chung added: Manufacturing moves like this one, driven by customer demand to diversify supply chains, represent a great opportunity for Sri Lanka. If the new government can strengthen the investment climate, implement anti corruption measures, and strengthen business-friendly governance and transparency, there is potential for even more manufacturers to make similar moves. Youve heard the phrase: If you build it, they will come. I strongly believe companies will come if the investment climate is strong. And that means more jobs, prosperity, more RD for Sri Lanka. The partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka is built on shared goals and mutual respect. From boosting farmers crop yields to, expanding the school lunch program to address the urban poor in Colombo, to strengthening Sri Lankas maritime security, our collaboration is driven by a common vision: improving lives, fostering economic growth, and ensuring regional stability, the US Ambassador highlighted.",

        "date": "October 31, 2024 04:09 pm",
        "content": "As India gears up for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, people are divided over whether they should celebrate by setting off firecrackers, which worsen the countrys chronic air pollution. Diwali, which will be celebrated Thursday, is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many Indians light earthen oil lamps or candles. But every year the festivities are tinged with worries over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can takes days to clear. The capital, New Delhi, which is among Indias worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali. Authorities there and in some other states have banned the use and sale of firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for more sustainable options like environmentally friendly firecrackers and light shows, but the rule is often flouted. Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores. Some residents in New Delhi say the ban doesnt make much difference, while others see it as a necessary measure to fight pollution. Vegetable vendor Renu, who only uses one name, loves celebrating Diwali in the city. Every year her kids set off firecrackers at night. She tells them to be careful but not to refrain from using them. Diwali is a day of celebration and happiness for us which comes only once a year, and I feel the ban should not be there, she said. Others are against it. Unlike most kids, Ruhaani Mandal, 13, doesnt light firecrackers. She acknowledges it is fun, but says it is hazardous for people and animals. I have seen firsthand the struggle of my father, who has lost his sense of smell due to pollution, and I see how his health worsens after Diwali celebrations, she said. New Delhi and several northern Indian cities typically see extremely high levels of air pollution between October and January each year, disrupting businesses and shutting schools and offices. Authorities close construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog that envelopes the skyline. This year, thick, toxic smog has already started to engulf New Delhi. On Wednesday, authorities reported an AQI of over 300, which is categorized as very poor. Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. A high level of tiny particulate matter can lodge deep into the lungs and cause major health problems, including chronic respiratory diseases. New Delhis woes arent only due to firecrackers. Vehicular emissions, farm fires in neighboring states and dust from construction are the primary causes of the capitals air pollution woes. But health experts say the smoke emitted from firecrackers can be more hazardous. The smoke that is produced by firecrackers contains heavy metals like sulphur, lead and toxic gases like carbon monoxide and fumes of heavy metals that are dangerous to our respiratory system, said Arun Kumar Sharma, a community medicine professor at New Delhis University College of Medical Sciences. Meanwhile, authorities in New Delhi have largely failed to enforce a strict ban on the use of firecrackers to avoid offending millions of Hindus across the country, for whom Diwali is one of the biggest festivals. To sidestep the ban, many sellers offer firecrackers online, some with the convenience of home delivery. Shopkeeper Gyaanchand Goyal said the ban on firecrackers has disadvantaged sellers like him and affected their biggest source of income during the festive season. The government enforces a restriction on firecrackers solely to demonstrate their commitment to the environment. Other than that, I dont think there are any other consequences of this ban, he said.

Addressing a public meeting of the National Peoples Power (NPP), the Premier went on to say that the NPP-led government would initiate legal action against every person who misappropriated public funds. Commenting further, Dr. Amarasuriya added: Ranil Wickremesinghe has claimed that I am not well versed in the Constitution and offered to teach me about it. Should I attend his lessons? He was rejected by the people 17 times, yet he refuses to give up. One of the major tenets of the Constitution is the sovereignty of the people. It is clear that Ranil Wickremesinghe has failed to grasp this concept. If he did, he would not have postponed elections, refused to abide by the decisions of the Constitutional Council, and threatened its members or influenced the judiciary to obtain favourable rulings. He should first understand these basic concepts before teaching me about the Constitution. Therefore, we request Ranil Wickremesinghe to focus on his own affairs. The people have granted us a mandate, and we are executing our duties in accordance with that mandate. Under no circumstances would we seek advice from Ranil Wckremesinghe. We do not require the advice of those who scammed the Central Bank. Legal action will be taken not only against those implicated in the Central Bank bond scam but also against every person who misappropriated public funds, she expressed.",

Two female students of the Southern Campus of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) have been reported dead after the bus they were travelling in, while on a field trip, hit the curb and toppled across the Dunhinda Road in Badulla. The injured passengers were immediately rushed to the Badulla Hospital, according to Ada Derana reporter. Meanwhile, six injured persons are receiving treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Badulla Hospital. The bus carrying a group of KDU students had reportedly overturned at around 7:45 a.m. today. The accident had occurred between the third and fourth-kilometer posts on the Badulla-Mahiyanganaya main road, near the Dunhinda access road, after the bus collided with an embankment. According to police, a significant number of university students have sustained serious injuries in the accident. At the time of the accident, there were a total of 41 persons travelling in the bus, including university students. Local residents quickly intervened to assist in rescuing the injured from the bus, with great effort. As a result, steps were taken to immediately admit 39 injured persons to the Teaching Hospital Badulla. Dr Palitha Rajapaksha, from the Emergency Treatment Unit of Badulla Teaching Hospital, stated that six patients in serious condition are currently receiving treatment in the ICU, while the others are being treated in the general ward. In the meantime, he noted that those who require surgery are being directed for urgent operations, and he expressed his commitment to trying to save the lives of the students. The group consisted of two army personnel, five instructors, and students. They were involved in the accident while on their way for a field inspection after staying at the Uva Management Development Institute. Although the cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the police suspect that the speeding bus may have collided with the embankment due to a brake failure.",

Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, representing Johnston Fernando, stated that on the October 23, when the case was called, the defendant did not appear in court but instead went to give a statement to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the unregistered luxury car allegedly belonging to him, which was found parked at a star-class hotel in Colombo.

        "date": "November 1, 2024 01:49 pm",
        "content": "Rapper Young Thug pleaded guilty Thursday in Atlanta to gang, drug and gun charges and will be released from jail, though he could be put back behind bars if he violates the terms of his sentence. The 33-year-old Grammy winning artist, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, entered his pleas without reaching a deal with prosecutors after negotiations between the two sides broke down, lead prosecutor Adriane Love said. That left the sentence completely up to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker. Young Thugs plea comes two and a half years after he was arrested and charged and nearly a year after the prosecution started presenting evidence in the problem-plagued trial. Jury selection at the courthouse in Atlanta began in January 2023 and took nearly 10 months. Prosecutors have called dozens of witnesses since opening statements last November in the trial of six defendants. The trial has faced many delays, including in July when the original judge was removed after two defendants sought his recusal, citing a meeting the judge held with prosecutors and a state witness. Young Thug pleaded guilty to one gang charge, three drug charges and two gun charges. He also entered a no contest plea to another gang charge and a racketeering conspiracy charge, meaning that he decided not to contest those charges but can be punished for them as if he had pleaded guilty. The judge imposed a sentence of 40 years with the first five to be served in prison but commuted to time served, followed by 15 years on probation. If he successfully completes that probation without any violations, another 20 years will be commuted to time served. But if he violates the conditions, he will have to serve those 20 years in addition to any penalty for a probation violation. Young Thug must stay away from the metro Atlanta area for the first 10 years of his probation, except for weddings, funerals, graduations or serious illness of family members, the judge said. But she also ordered him to return to the Atlanta area four times a year during his probation to make a live anti-gang, anti-gun violence presentation at a school or a community organization serving children. She said that can count toward the 100 hours of community service she ordered him to perform each year during probation. Hes also not allowed to associate with gang members or with the victims or other defendants in the case, with the exception of his brother and the rapper Gunna, with whom he has contractual obligations. He also cannot promote any criminal street gang or gang activity and cant use hand signs or terminology that promotes a street gang. Additional conditions include submitting to random drug screens and not possessing a gun. But he is allowed to travel both nationally and internationally for work, even while on probation. Love had outlined for the judge the evidence she would have presented to prove Young Thugs guilt, including some of his rap lyrics. She asked the judge to sentence him to 45 years, with 25 years in prison and the remaining 20 years on probation. The rappers lead attorney Brian Steel said they vehemently disagree with many of the statements Love made and said it was offensive that the state is using Young Thugs lyrics against him. Steel said the evidence against his client is weak and accused prosecutors of misrepresenting and hiding evidence, saying Young Thug was falsely accused. Steel said he told his client that he thought they were winning the trial and should go through to a jury verdict. But he told me, I cant wait another three months if there is any possibility I could go home because I have children that are hurting. I have things to do, Steel said. Steel asked the judge to impose a sentence of 45 years with five in prison commuted to time served and 40 years on probation. Young Thug asked the judge to let him go home, saying he wouldnt be in a similar situation again. Ive learned from my mistakes, you know. I come from nothing and Ive made something and I didnt take full advantage of it. Im sorry, he said. The judge said she appreciated that he realized the impact that he has on people worldwide. She said rap music may involve a lot of posturing but that children emulate some of the dangerous behavior mentioned in songs. She encouraged Young Thug to use his talent and influence to encourage kids to do the right thing. I want you to try to be more of the solution and less of the problem, Whitaker said. A tremendously successful rapper, Young Thug started his own record label, Young Stoner Life or YSL. Prosecutors have said he also co-founded a violent criminal street gang and that YSL stands for Young Slime Life. He was charged two years ago in a sprawling indictment accusing him and more than two dozen other people of conspiring to violate Georgias anti-racketeering law. He also was charged with gang, drug and gun crimes. Three of his Young Thugs co-defendants had already pleaded guilty this week after reaching deals with prosecutors. The pleas leave the fates of two other co-defendants still undecided. Nine people charged in the indictment accepted plea deals before the trial began. Twelve others are being tried separately. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Apple sells 46 billion worth of iPhones over the summer as AI helps end slump",
        "date": "November 1, 2024 02:16 pm",
        "content": "Apple snapped out of a recent iPhone sales slump during its summer quarter, an early sign that its recent efforts to revive demand for its marquee product with an infusion of artificial intelligence are paying off. Sales of the iPhone totaled 46.22 billion for the July-September period, a 6 increase from the same time last year, according to Apples fiscal fourth-quarter report released Thursday. That improvement reversed two consecutive year-over-year declines in the iPhones quarterly sales. The iPhone boost helped Apple deliver total quarterly revenue and profit that exceeded the analyst projections that sway investors, excluding a one-time charge of 10.2 billion to account for a recent European Union court decision that lumped the Cupertino, California, company with a huge bill for back taxes. Apple earned 14.74 billion, or 97 cents per share, a 36 decrease from the same time last year. If not for the one-time tax hit, Apple said it would have earned 1.64 per share  topping the 1.60 per share predicted by analysts, according to FactSet Research. Revenue rose 6 from last year to 94.93 billion, about 400 million more than analysts forecast. But investors evidently were hoping for an even better quarter and appeared disappointed by an Apple forecast that implied its revenue for the October-December quarter covering the holiday shopping season might not grow as robustly as analysts envisioned. Apples stock price shed about 2 in Thursdays extended trading, leaving the shares hovering around 221  well below their peak of about 237 reached in mid-October. The latest quarterly results captured the first few days that consumers were able to buy a new iPhone 16 line-up that included four different models designed to handle a variety of AI wizardry that the company is marketing as Apple Intelligence. The branding is part of Apples effort to distinguish its approach to AI from rivals such as Samsung and Google that got a head start on bringing the technology to smartphones. Even though the iPhone 16 was specifically built with AI in mind, the technology didnt become available until Apple released a free software update earlier this week that activated its first batch of technological tricks, including a feature designed to make its virtual assistant Siri smarter, more versatile and more colorful. And those improvements are only available in the U.S. for now. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Thursday conference call. Cook said plans to expand the AI iPhone features into other countries in December, as well as roll out other software updates that will inject even more of the technology in the iPhone 16 and two high-end iPhone 15 models that are also equipped with the special computer chips needed for the slick new features. The December expansion will include an option to connect with OpenAIs ChatGPT to take advantage of technology that Apple isnt making on its own. More languages Investors are betting that as Apples AI becomes more broadly available, it will prompt the hundreds of millions of consumers who are using older iPhones to upgrade to newer models in order to get their hands on the latest technology. We believe its a compelling upgrade reason, Cook asserted. But Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro believes iPhone sales would already be accelerating at a faster pace if consumers were blown away by Apples AI technology, increasing the pressure on the company to do an overall better job to impress the public.

        "date": "November 1, 2024 09:49 pm",
        "content": "Prospects of a ceasefire between Israel and its foes Hamas and Hezbollah ran aground on Friday as Israeli airstrikes killed at least 64 people in the Gaza Strip, according to medics in the Palestinian enclave, and battered Beiruts southern suburbs. U.S. envoys had been working to secure ceasefires on both fronts ahead of the U.S. presidential election next Tuesday. But Hamas did not favour a temporary truce, its Al-Aqsa Hamas television reported on Friday. The ceasefire proposals failed to meet its conditions that any deal must end the year-long war in Gaza and include a withdrawal of Israeli forces from there, it said. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his priority was to enforce security despite any pressure or constraints. His office said he relayed this message to U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk in Israel on Thursday. Israel meanwhile pressed on with its military offensives against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon on Friday. Medics in Gaza said about 64 people were killed and dozens more injured overnight and into Friday morning in Israeli strikes on the city of Deir Al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of Al-Zawayda, all in the central area of Gaza as well as in its south. Fourteen people were killed by an Israeli strike at the gate of a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in Nuseirat, according to medics at the camps Al-Awda Hospital. Another 10 were killed in a car in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, medics said. The Israeli military said its troops had killed what it called armed terrorists in central Gaza and the northern Jabalia area. It had no immediate comment on the reported school strike, although it habitually denies deliberately attacking civilians. Israel also pummelled Beiruts southern suburbs on Friday morning with at least 10 strikes, Reuters journalists said. It was the first bombardment on the area - once a densely-packed district and Hezbollah stronghold - in nearly a week. The strikes came after Israel issued evacuation orders for 10 separate neighbourhoods. Hassan Saad, speaking in a street in Lebanons capital Beirut, told Reuters: This is a brutal war and Israel does not have the right to do this...There must be a limit put for Israel because it does not abide by any of the laws or human morality. Another Beirut man, Ali Ramadan, said he believed the Israeli airstrikes were a way to put pressure on Lebanon in the ceasefire negotiations. The hostilities have whittled away any hope a truce could be reached before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Hamas television, quoting a leading source in the group, said the ceasefire proposals did not meet its conditions. The proposals do not include a permanent cessation of aggression, withdrawal of occupation forces from the Gaza Strip, or the return of displaced people, the source said. Nor did they address Palestinians need for security, relief and reconstruction, and the full reopening of border crossings, the source said. The delegation also demanded the provision of food, medicine and shelter, and said any agreement must include an exchange of Palestinians held in Israels jails for the Israeli hostages captive in Gaza. Israels Netanyahu, addressing graduating troops on Thursday, said: Agreements, documents, proposals are not the main point. The main point is our ability and determination to enforce security, thwart attacks against us and act against the arming of our enemies, as necessary and despite any pressure and constraints. This is the main point, he said. Israeli Stubbornness Lebanons caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati on Friday accused Israel of blocking any progress in the negotiations. Israeli statements and diplomatic signals received by Lebanon confirm the Israeli stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction, he said. Israel on Thursday also bombed the Baalbek region in Lebanons east, home to UNESCO-listed Roman ruins. A cultural group that organises yearly festivals amid the ruins said some cracks were visible due to nearby Israeli strikes. Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Palestinians a day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israels retaliatory offensives have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and reduced most of Gaza to rubble, Palestinian authorities say, and also killed around 2,800 people in Lebanon, according to the health ministry there. In northern Israel close to the Lebanese border, a farmer and four Thai workers were killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack on Metula on Thursday, Israeli authorities said. Two more civilians were killed by shrapnel near the town of Kiryat Ata, further south near the port city of Haifa. The Iran-backed Hezbollah says it only fires at military targets in Israel.

        "content": "Rescue workers scoured piles of concrete and twisted metal for survivors on Friday after a roof collapsed at the entrance of a railway station in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, killing 14 people. Cranes and bulldozers helped sift through the wreckage alongside dozens of rescuers and construction workers, while medical staff and ambulances waited nearby. The collapse of a 35-metre (115-foot) length of roofing occurred at noon (1100 GMT) on a sunny day in the city about 70 km (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Belgrade. Bodies were pulled from the rubble throughout the afternoon and into evening. Our windows were open as it was warm outside and I heard a huge rumble and saw a plume of dust, thats all I saw. Later I heard what happened, said Vera, an 86-year-old pensioner who lives about 200 meters (yards) away. Earlier in the afternoon rescuers freed two women who had been trapped under the rubble. They were in critical condition, said Vesna Turkulov, the head of the Vojvodina medical centre where they were taken. The search and rescue operation was complicated by the sheer weight of the concrete and was expected to continue through the night, said Luka Causic who heads the interior ministrys centre for emergency management. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic told Tanjug news agency earlier he did not expect the death toll to rise significantly. Five of those killed have not yet been identified, said Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, promising justice. It is difficult to say anything meaningful, he said in a televised address. As the president of Serbia I demand that all those who are responsible for this are ... punished. As the night fell, hundreds of people lit and laid candles outside the Novi Sad city hall to honour the victims of the disaster, some of them in tears. Whats there to say? I have worked at that railroad, I know it. This is terrible, said Dragan Vujicic, a 70-year old pensioner. Train departures have been halted from the station, according to N1 news channel which reported that a building reconstruction had been completed this summer, but that the part of the roof that collapsed had not been included in the project. This is a black Friday for all of Serbia and Novi Sad, Prime Minister Milos Vucevic told reporters. Regardless of the fact that this building was constructed in 1964, we will insist that those responsible for this tragedy are identified. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Spain mounts biggest peacetime disaster recovery operation as death toll reaches 211",
        "date": "November 2, 2024 09:07 pm",
        "content": "The deadliest flash floods in Spains modern history have killed at least 211 people and dozens were still unaccounted for, four days after torrential rains swept the eastern region of Valencia, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday. In a televised statement, Sanchez said the government was sending 5,000 more army troops to help with the searches and clean-up in addition to 2,500 soldiers already deployed. It is the biggest operation by the Armed Forces in Spain in peacetime, Sanchez said. The government is going to mobilize all the resources necessary as long as they are needed. The tragedy is already Europes worst flood-related disaster since 1967 when at least 500 people died in Portugal. Hopes of finding survivors were boosted when rescuers found a woman alive after three days trapped in a car park in Montcada, Valencia. Residents burst into applause when civil protection chief Martin Perez announced the news. Meanwhile, volunteers flocked to Valencias City of Arts and Sciences centre for the first coordinated clean-up organised by regional authorities. The venue has been turned into the nerve centre for the operation. In Valencias Picanya suburb, shop-owner Emilia, 74, told Reuters on Saturday: We feel abandoned, there are many people who need help. It is not only my house, is all the houses and we are throwing away furniture, we are throwing away everything. When is the help going to come to have fridges and washing machines? Because we cant even wash our clothes and we cant even have a shower. Nurse Maria Jose Gilabert, 52, who also lives in Picanya, said: We are devastated because there is not much light to be seen here at the moment, not because they are not coming to help, they are coming from all over Spain, but because it will be a long time before this becomes a habitable area again. The storm triggered a new weather alert in the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Valencia, where rains are expected to continue during the weekend. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe, and elsewhere, due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

A foreign national is also among the arrestees, the minister revealed. He stated that the suspects have been arrested in connection with the intelligence information received indicating a potential attack in the Arugam Bay area, as well as incidents involving the photographing of major financial sites in Colombo. Minister Herath noted that they immediately acted upon receiving information about a potential danger to foreign tourists to safeguard their safety and ensure national security. The opposition was waiting to take advantage of this issue. That is the truth, he charged. So far, we have arrested six individuals. A Maldivian and five Sri Lankans are in custody and investigations are ongoing. From those investigations, we still cannot say what kind of plan or attempt this was. Because it is not possible to draw such a conclusion from the information obtained from the 06 arrested persons and the investigations. Therefore, there is no need for a wrong interpretation about this, however, the people of the country want to ensure that security, he added. The minister stated that the three-member Cabinet convened the National Security Council (NSC) immediately, and the necessary instructions were given by the President as the defense minister.",

        "date": "November 3, 2024 07:59 am",
        "content": "Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to retaliate against attacks by Israel and its ally the United States targeting Tehran and groups it supports in the region. The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front, Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran. He was referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed armed groups that include Yemens Huthi rebels, Lebanons Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak in October last year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, drawing in those Iran-aligned groups and others from Iraq and Syria. Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamass unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23. On October 26, Israel conducted air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehrans October 1 attack on Israel, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. At least four soldiers were killed in the attack which Iran said caused limited damage to a few radar systems. Iranian media said a civilian was also killed. In his speech, Khamenei paid tribute to the slain soldiers, saying their efforts in confronting Israel will not be forgotten. Israel has warned Iran against responding to the October 26 attack. The United States announced Friday the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defence destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes. Khamenei said Iran was certainly doing everything that should be done to prepare the Iranian nation, whether in terms of military, in terms of weapons, or in terms of political work, without elaborating. Also on Saturday, the Revolutionary Guards spokesman Ali Mohammad Naini said Iran would respond decisively to Israel. The enemy should learn that it cannot commit any evil (it wants); it will undoubtedly receive a crushing response to its evildoing, said Naini, the Fars news agency reported.

        "title": "29 Nigerian children may be sentenced to death for protesting against cost-of-living crisis",
        "date": "November 3, 2024 10:40 am",
        "content": "Twenty-nine children could be facing the death penalty in Nigeria after they were arraigned Friday for participating in a protest against the countrys record cost-of-living crisis. Four of them collapsed in court due to exhaustion before they could enter a plea. A total of 76 protesters were charged with 10 felony counts, including treason, destruction of property, public disturbance and mutiny, according to the charge sheet seen by The Associated Press. According to the charge sheet, the minors ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to several mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds more were arrested at a protest demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people. The death sentence was introduced in the 1970s in Nigeria, but there have been no executions in the country since 2016. Akintayo Balogun, a private lawyer based in Abuja, said the Child Rights Act does not allow any child to be subject to criminal proceedings and sentenced to death. So taking minors before a federal high court is wrong, ab initio, except if the government is able to prove that the boys are all above 19 years, Balogun said. The court eventually granted 10 million naira (5,900) bail to each the defendants and imposed stringent conditions they are yet to meet, Marshal Abubakar, counsel to some of the boys, said. A country that has a duty to educate its children will decide to punish those children. These children have been in detention for 90 days without food, Abubakar said. Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough, a civil society organization promoting good governance in Nigeria, said authorities have no business prosecuting children. The chief justice of Nigeria should be ashamed, she is a woman and a mother, Adamolekun said. Despite being one of the top crude oil producers in Africa, Nigeria remains one of the worlds poorest countries. Chronic corruption means the lifestyle of its public officials rarely mirrors that of the general population. Medical professionals often strike to protest meager wages. The countrys politicians and lawmakers, often accused of corruption, are some of the best-paid in Africa. Even the presidents wife  her office nowhere in the constitution  is entitled to SUVs and other luxuries funded by taxpayers. Nigerias population of over 210 million people  the continents largest  is also among the hungriest in the world and its government has struggled to create jobs. The inflation rate is also at 28-year high and the local naira currency at record lows against the dollar. On Thursday, Nigeria was classified as a hotspot of very high concern, in a report from United Nations food agencies, as large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity in the West African country.

Chasing a target of 73 runs, Sri Lanka reached their goal with six balls remaining. Sri Lankas captain, Lihuru Madhusanka, opted to bowl first, a decision that proved successful as his bowlers limited Pakistan to a modest total. Despite a valiant effort from Muhammad Akhlaq, who scored 48 runs off just 20 balls, Pakistan struggled to build a substantial score. Akhlaq was eventually dismissed by Madhusanka in the final over. The next highest score for Pakistan came from skipper Faheem Ashraf, who made 13 runs off four balls. Sri Lankas bowling was impressive, with Lakshan and Tharindu Rathnayake taking two wickets each. Nimesh Vimukthi and Lihuru Madhusanka also contributed with a wicket apiece. In the semi-final, Pakistan advanced to the final by defeating Australia, thanks to Faheem Ashrafs outstanding all-round performance. Australia set a challenging target of 108 runs after scoring 1071 in their six overs. The opening pair of Sam Heazlett and Jack Wood gave Australia a strong start with a 56-run partnership. However, Faheem managed to break the partnership by dismissing Wood, who scored 36 runs. Pakistans response was led by explosive starts from their openers, including Asif Ali, who scored 32 runs off eight balls. Muhammad Akhlaq continued the momentum, scoring 32 off 10 balls. Faheem Ashraf, alongside Aamer Yamin, built a crucial partnership that guided Pakistan to victory, with Faheem scoring an unbeaten 19 runs and Yamin adding 24 not out.

        "date": "November 3, 2024 04:27 pm",
        "content": "Moldovans were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that has been overshadowed by meddling allegations and could see Moscow claw back influence in the country at a time when it is trying to draw closer to the European Union. Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu, who has accelerated the nations push to leave Moscows orbit and join the EU, faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, an ex-prosecutor general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party. The fortunes of Sandu, who set Moldova on the long path of EU accession talks in June, will be closely followed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join, re-elected a ruling party seen as increasingly pro-Russian. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). Moldovas future has been thrown into the political and diplomatic spotlight as the war in neighbouring Ukraine rages to the east. Stoianoglo says he supports EU integration but also wants to develop ties with Russia in the national interest. He wants to try to revive cheap Russian gas supplies and said he would meet with President Vladimir Putin if Moldovans wanted it. I voted for a free, stable and blossoming Moldova that isnt standing with its hand out, but develops in harmony based on relations with the West and East, he said after casting his ballot. The outcome of the vote is likely to set the tone for next summers parliamentary elections where Sandus ruling party is expected to struggle to retain its majority and which will determine the stripe of the future government. Today is a crucial day for us... we go in one direction or the other. We didnt have such an important day in the last 30 years, said Mihai David, 58, who voted in Chisinau. My son is in Germany, and Im happy about it, I was there and its much better and we want it to be the same here, said Maria Fefilova, 68, a pensioner. Stoianoglos East-West balancing rhetoric contrasts with Sandus four years in power, during which ties with the Kremlin have unravelled, a slew of Moscows diplomats have been expelled and she has condemned Russias invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Moscow has said that her government is Russophobic. Sandu portrays Stoianoglo as the Kremlins man and a political Trojan horse, painting Sundays vote as a choice between a bright future in the EU by 2030 and one of uncertainty and instability. Stoianoglo says that is untrue and that she has failed to look out for the interests of ordinary Moldovans. He accuses Sandu of divisive politics in a country that has a Romanian-speaking majority and large Russian-speaking minority. FRESH MEDDLING ALLEGATIONS The police have cracked down to try to avoid a repeat of what they said was a vast vote-buying scheme deployed by Russian-backed fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor in the first round and a referendum on the EUs aspirations on Oct. 20. Russia denies interfering, while Shor has denied wrongdoing. He lives in Russia and has openly called on people via social media to vote against Sandu and promised payment for following his instructions. Sandu has said the meddling affected the Oct. 20 results and that Shor sought to buy the votes of 300,000 people, more than 10 of the population. A Moldovan government source said Chisinau had notified several EU nations that it believed Russia would try to disrupt voting by Moldovan expatriates at polling stations in their countries. The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters polling stations in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, Romania, United States and Britain might be targeted by disruption including with the use of bomb hoaxes. Moldovan voters living in the West are seen as largely pro-European and therefore more likely to support Sandu, who has championed Moldovas effort to join the 27-nation bloc by 2030. The EU referendum went to the wire, delivering a slender win of 50.35 for the pro-EU camp. Sandu won 42 of the vote in the first round, falling short of the 50 needed to win outright. Stoianoglo came second with 26. Stoianoglo is expected to benefit from protest votes against Sandus handling of the economy in the poor agricultural nation of fewer than 3 million people. Moldova struggled with the aftermath of the COVID pandemic and the effects of Russias February 2022 invasion of neighboring Ukraine. That sparked a huge influx of refugees and sharply reduced Russian gas supplies, causing high inflation. Ahead of the vote, Sandu campaigned with the slogan Save Moldova. The opposition was quick to counter with a parody slogan: Save Moldova from Sandu. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The incident, which involved a bus carrying a group of students of the Southern Campus of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) toppling across the road, resulted in the death of two female students, and injuries to 40 others. The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in-charge of Badulla, Wasantha Kandewatta stated that a government analysts report on the bus is awaited to aid the investigation. Preliminary assessments suggest the driver may have been operating the vehicle in third or fourth gear at the time of the accident. It is suspected that excessive speed on the steep, winding 4-kilometer stretch of road may have led the bus to skid out of control, according to police. To clarify the exact cause, the police are examining both possible technical malfunctions and driver-related factors. SSP Kandewatta noted that efforts are also underway to analyze data on how the bus was being driven at the time of the incident, including a focus on any technological evidence that could shed light on its speed and gear usage. However, dash cam footage from a car has also surfaced, showing the bus carrying KDU students speeding shortly before the accident had occurred. Meanwhile, of the 40 injured passengers, six have been discharged from Badulla Teaching Hospital after treatment. However, seven others remain in the intensive care unit, with medical teams continuing to monitor their condition closely.",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that the National Peoples Power (NPP) must consolidate its current political authority to bring about the changes that the public desires within the countrys political landscape. Speaking at a rally in Nuwara Eliya today (03), President Dissanayake stated that Nuwara Eliya is a significant district in the upcoming general election. Historically, politics in our country has not focused on uniting the Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities. Instead, political parties have often represented specific ethnic groups, with Tamil parties for Tamil people and Sinhala parties for Sinhala people. As a result, residents of Nuwara Eliya have long lived divided rather than united. For the first time, however, a political movement is aiming to bring together all communities within Nuwara Eliya district, Dissanayake said. Addressing the rally, the Head of the State added: If we were to continue with traditional politics, the power we currently hold would be sufficient, even the position of President would suffice. However, if we were to follow the same path, the public would not have supported the NPP in the presidential elections. Many old leaders continue to hold onto power, even after facing defeat. This is an obstacle to making real, transformative change. To achieve this new vision, we must also secure power in other political centers. Currently, our influence is held by the President and three cabinet ministers. The upcoming November 14 election is crucial for gaining the authority needed to bring about meaningful change. We aim to hold provincial council elections next year and will organize local government elections soon, he expressed. Before this, we must solidify our political power. We plan to form an effective cabinet and assign portfolios systematically. However, these ministers will not receive the same privileges as past ministers. They will not have official residences in Colombo or extensive security details. Furthermore, the President said: We have also planned to increase state sector salaries in the upcoming budget. We have decided to give a reasonable increment for estate workers as well. Additionally, we have decided to recall all diplomats who are politicians from their overseas missions. We assure you that we will relinquish power only after we have successfully rebuilt this nation.",

        "date": "November 4, 2024 08:23 am",
        "content": "Moldovas pro-Western President Maia Sandu has won a second term in a pivotal presidential runoff against a Russia-friendly opponent, in a race that was overshadowed by claims of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country. With nearly 99 of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held Sunday, Sandu had 55 of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared to 45 for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists. The result will be a major relief for the pro-Western government, which strongly backed Sandus candidacy, and her push for closer Western ties on Moldovas path toward the EU. Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova! Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight. She went on to claim that her countrys vote had faced an unprecedented attack through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference by hostile forces from outside the country and criminal groups. You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the peoples power when they choose to speak through their vote, she added. Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that everyones voice deserves respect and that he hopes from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us. It isnt clear if he has publicly commented on his electoral defeat. When polls closed locally at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), turnout stood at more than 1.68 million people  about 54 of eligible voters, according to the CEC. Moldovas large diaspora, which cast ballots in record numbers of more than 325,000 voted, heavily in favor of Sandu in the runoff. In the first round held Oct. 20, Sandu obtained 42 of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority over the second place Stoianoglo. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her victory, by writing on X: It takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges youve faced in this election. Moldovas diaspora played a key role in the presidential vote and in a nationwide referendum held on Oct. 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35 voted to secure Moldovas path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sundays vote were overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldovas judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Sunday, Moldovan police said they had reasonable evidence of organized transportation of voters  illegal under the countrys electoral code  to polling stations from within the country and from overseas, and are investigating and registering evidence in connection with air transport activities from Russia to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Such measures are taken to protect the integrity of the electoral process and to ensure that every citizens vote is cast freely without undue pressure or influence, police said. Moldovas foreign ministry said on Sunday afternoon that polling stations in Frankfurt, Germany, and Liverpool and Northampton in the U.K. had been targeted by false bomb threats, which intended only to stop the voting process. Stanislav Secrieru, the presidents national security adviser, wrote on X: We are seeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process, which he warned had a high potential to distort the outcome of the vote. Secrieru later added that the national voter record systems were being targeted by ongoing coordinated cyberattacks to disrupt links between domestic polling stations and those abroad, and that cybersecurity teams were working to counter these threats and ensure system continuity. Moldovas Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country had received anonymous death threats via phone calls in what he called an extreme attack to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. After casting her ballot in Chisinau, Sandu told reporters: Thieves want to buy our vote, thieves want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater. Outside a polling station in Romanias capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a definitive step toward Moldovas future. People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations, she said. Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave. Moldovan police expose a scheme allegedly plotted by a convicted oligarch In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say 39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anti-corruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over 2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5 voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained conclusive evidence, including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday, at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told The Associated Press that he had urged people to go and vote because its a civic obligation and that they do not name any candidates. We use the goods the country offers us  light, gas, he said. Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace. On Thursday, prosecutors raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Moldovas EU future at stake Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it will not deflate geopolitical tensions. On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections. Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences. Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, said she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. We want a European future for our country, she said, adding that it offers many opportunities, development for our country  and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going 10 steps back as a country. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next years vote could be Moscows main target. In the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Source: AP --Agencies",

The Election Commission has also issued guidelines on the proper voting and preference-marking procedure. Each voter has one vote, which can be cast for a recognized political party or an independent group. To do so, an x mark should be placed in front of the chosen political partys symbol or in the space before the number and symbol of the independent group. Additionally, voters may express their preference for up to three candidates nominated by the selected party or group by placing an x in the space containing the number assigned to each candidate at the end of the ballot paper. The Election Commission clarified that any ballot showing votes for multiple political parties or independent groups, or containing identifiable marks other than the specified x, will be considered invalid.

        "content": "Unprecedented air pollution in the Pakistani city of Lahore has forced authorities to close all primary schools for a week. From Monday, 50 of office workers will also work from home, as part of a green lockdown plan. Other measures include bans on engine-powered rickshaws and vendors that barbecue without filters. This smog is very harmful for children, masks should be mandatory in schools, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said. Lahore, Pakistans second-largest city, topped the world list of cities with the most polluted air for a second time on Sunday. The air quality index, which measures a range of pollutants, exceeded 1,000 on Saturday, well above the benchmark of 300 considered dangerous by the World Health Organization, according to data from IQAir. The level of fine particulate matter in the air, the most damaging to health, also soared well into hazardous levels. Raja Jehangir Anwar, a senior environment official, said the biggest headache causing the smog was the practice of burning crop waste, known as stubble, across the Indian border. Aurangzeb said the fumes were being carried by strong winds into Pakistan. This cannot be solved without talks with India, she said, adding that the provincial government would initiate such discussions through the foreign ministry. The government is urging people to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. Vehicles equipped with pumps are spraying water into the air to help control the smog level. Construction work has been halted in certain areas. The situation will be assessed again next Saturday to establish whether schools should remain shut. Inhaling toxic air can have catastrophic health consequences, including strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and some respiratory diseases, according to the WHO. Last month pupils were banned from outdoor exercise until January and school hours were adjusted to prevent children from travelling when pollution levels are the highest. As a mother, I am full of anxiety, 42-year-old Lilly Mirza told AFP news agency. Last year was not this bad... Somebody needs to tell us what has happened. Did a pollution bomb explode somewhere?

Accordingly, it is stated that this program has been planned to be implemented in 12 selected districts across the country. Although Sri Lanka has successfully eradicated measles, this program has been implemented due to reported measles cases in some areas last year. Dr. Hasitha Tissera, a Senior Epidemiologist at the Ministry of Healths Epidemiology Unit, expressed his opinion in this regard stating that the aim here is to target the younger generation, especially, those who have either not received the measles vaccine at all or have missed it for various reasons. He highlighted the need to identify individuals who have not received complete protection from the vaccine, including those who have only had one dose, and to ensure they receive a second dose. The main goal is to give a dose of measles. Fortunately, we have made great progress through measles in the last 10-20 years. However, if the measles virus enters our community, there is a risk for those who may get measles. This program is done to reduce that risk, he added.",

        "content": "American actor James Van Der Beek says he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The 47-year-old, known for starring in the TV series Dawsons Creek and the film Varsity Blues, told People magazine about his diagnosis and treatment. I have colorectal cancer. Ive been privately dealing with this diagnosis and have been taking steps to resolve it, he told the outlet. Van Der Beek says there is reason for optimism and that he is feeling good. BBC News has reached out to a representative for the actor. Colorectal cancer develops from growths in the colons inner lining and can spread if not treated, according to the Cleveland Clinic. More men develop this form of cancer than women. Increased screenings have helped detect it early - lowering the number of people who die from colorectal cancer, the clinic notes. Van Der Beek starred in multiple popular shows and films in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He played Dawson Leery in the hit TV show Dawsons Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003. He also played a fictionalised version of himself in the cult television show Dont Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and he performed on the 28th US season of Dancing with the Stars. Van Der Beek has continued working through his diagnosis. He has two projects in production, including a Tubi original film called Sidelined: The QB and Me, which is due to come out later this month.

        "content": "Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio is planning to launch its first hybrid model in 2026 and will only sell it in overseas markets, including the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Nio to date has only manufactured pure electric vehicles. It is building the hybrid vehicle to address challenges faced by Chinese firms selling EVs in foreign markets, which have put up trade barriers and been slower to install charging facilities. Development of the extended range hybrid, under the Firefly brand, stems from suggestions by Nios main investor, Abu Dhabi investment vehicle CYVN Holdings, that this could boost sales in Middle Eastern markets, where the infrastructure is not ready for mass adoption of EVs, said the people, who declined to be named as the plan is private. It is scheduled to be launched in late 2026 and delivery will start in 2027, one of the people said. The model will not be sold in China, where Nio would continue to offer only EVs with batteries that can be swapped, they added. Nio declined to comment on the hybrid model plan. The company said that the Firefly brand would use pure EV technology, without elaborating further. Chinese media outlet Yicai first reported Nios plan to develop a hybrid model on Friday. Nio will unveil the first model under the Firefly brand at its annual event on Dec. 21. It is counting on the model to sell into Europeans mass market with designs catering to European consumers preference for nimble small-sized cars. The European Union has imposed new tariffs of more than 20 on Nios EVs to the region for the next five years on top of an existing 10 import duty, which one of the sources said had largely undermined Fireflys competitiveness. While Chinese-made EVs are subject to the tariffs, hybrids are still exempted, encouraging plans of hybrid exports to Europe. Nio received 2.2 billion in investment from CYVN Holdings in 2023, largely relieving liquidity pressure on the Chinese automaker, which has struggled to break even while doubling down on its research and development efforts.

        "date": "November 4, 2024 11:48 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has dismissed the petition filed challenging the decision to hold the General Election on November 14. The three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Shiran Gunaratne and Priyantha Fernando ordered the relevant petition to be dismissed without taking up for hearing following an extended consideration of facts presented. This order was issued after considering the facts presented by the Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General that the date for the election has been properly set by the President in accordance with the Elections Act and that the activities related to the poll have almost been completed by now. On October 21, the civil society activist and convenor of the Api Sri Lanka national organization H.M Priyantha Herath filed a petition with the Supreme Court challenging the decision to hold the General Election on November 14, seeking an order declaring that the decision violates the Constitution. The Attorney General, the Secretary to the President, the Chairman of the Election Commission and its members were named as respondents in the petition. The petitioner has claimed that as per Section 10 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the period for accepting nominations was declared from October 4 to October 11. The petition had further pointed out that according to the Parliamentary Elections Act, the date for polling should be scheduled not less than five weeks and not more than seven weeks from the date of closing of nominations.

        "title": "Spains king and queen pelted with mud in flood-hit Valencia",
        "date": "November 4, 2024 01:13 pm",
        "content": "The King and Queen of Spain have been pelted with mud and other objects by angry protesters during a visit to flood-hit Valencia. Shouts of murderer and shame were directed at the royal couple, Spains prime minister and other leaders as they walked through the town of Paiporta - one of the worst-affected in the region. With mud on their faces and clothes, King Felipe and Queen Letizia were later seen consoling members of the crowd. More than 200 people were killed in the floods, the worst in Spain for decades. Emergency workers are continuing to comb through underground car parks and tunnels in the hope of finding survivors and recovering bodies. There has been anger at a perceived lack of warning and insufficient support from authorities after the floods. Footage showed the king making his way down a pedestrian street, before his bodyguards and police were suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of protesters, hurling insults and screaming. They struggled to maintain a protective ring around the monarch, as some of the protesters threw mud and objects. The king engaged with several, even embracing them. Images showed mud on the faces and clothes of the king, queen and their entourage, who held umbrellas over the monarch as they departed. Spains Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and the head of Valencian regional government, Carlos Mazón, joined the royal couple on the visit, but were swiftly evacuated as the crowd grew increasingly hostile. Spanish media reports that objects were hurled at Sánchez, while footage verified by the BBC appears to show stones being thrown at his car as he was driven away. After he left, the crowd chanted: Where is Sánchez? Im just 16, one boy, Pau, told the BBC through tears. Were helping  and the leaders do nothing. People are still dying. I cant stand this anymore. Another woman said: They left us to die. Weve lost everything: our businesses, our homes, our dreams. The civil guard and mounted officers were later seen attempting to disperse the angry crowd. The royal entourage had intended to travel on to Chiva, another town in the Valencia province badly impacted by the flooding, but that visit has since been postponed. The king later said he understood the anger and frustration of the protestors in a video posted on the royal households Instagram account. The mayor of Paiporta, Maribel Albalat, told the BBC she was shocked by the violence, but that she understood the frustration and desperation of the people. Juan Bordera, a member of the Valencian parliament, called the kings visit a very bad decision. Authorities didnt listen to any warnings, Mr Bordera told the BBC. Its logical that the people are angry, its logical that the people didnt understand why this visit is so urgent, he added. On Saturday, Sánchez ordered 10,000 more troops, police officers and civil guards to the area. He said the deployment was Spains largest in peacetime. But he added that he was aware the response was not enough and acknowledged severe problems and shortages. The flooding began on Tuesday, following a period of intense rainfall. Floodwaters quickly caused bridges to collapse and enveloped towns in thick mud. Many communities were cut off, left without access to water, food, electricity and other basic services. On Sunday, the death toll from the flooding rose to 217, with many more feared missing. Almost all of the deaths confirmed so far have been in the Valencia region on the Mediterranean coast. Some areas have been particularly devastated. Authorities in Paiporta, the town visited today by the royal delegation, have reported at least 62 deaths. Spains meteorological agency AEMET issued its highest level of alert on Sunday for parts of southern Valencia - including the cities of Alzira, Cullera and Gandia. Intense storms forecast to pass the area will not be on the scale of Tuesdays, the agency said, with 90mm (3.45 inches) of rainfall expected. Source: BBC --Agencies",

PUCSL Communications Director Jayanath Herath said the CEB has been directed to provide an updated proposal by November 08. This follows an initial proposal submission by the CEB on October 24, in which the board proposed a reduction of electricity tariffs ranging from 4 to 11. Despite this, several parties have voiced concerns, arguing that the proposed reduction does not sufficiently reflect CEBs recent profitability. They contend that given the boards financial performance over the past months, a more substantial tariff cut is warranted to provide meaningful relief to consumers. Herath stated that once the CEB submits the revised proposal, the PUCSL will prepare a counter-proposal to ensure that the tariff revision aligns more closely with public expectations and recent financial realities.",

        "date": "November 4, 2024 03:41 pm",
        "content": "Three Chinese astronauts who spent six months developing Chinas low orbit space station returned to Earth safely early Monday, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said. The capsule of the spaceship Shenzhou-18 carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in north Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at 1:24 am (Beijing Time). The three astronauts, after staying in orbit for 192 days, were all in good health and the Shenzhou-18 manned mission was a success, the CMSA said. Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut. He served as a crew member in the Shenzhou-13 mission from October 2021 to April 2022. Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future, Ye said. Another astronaut Li Guangsu said that they grew two types of plants -- cherry tomatoes and lettuce -- and they had harvested some lettuce leaves for food. Being able to eat fresh vegetables in space is truly a blessing. These green plants have also brought a touch of green and good cheer to our busy work, Li was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency. China launched the Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship in April this year. During the mission, the Shenzhou-18 crew utilised the scientific experiment cabinets and extravehicular payloads to carry out dozens of experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material science, space life science, space medicine and space technology, Xinhua report said. The three were relieved by another set of three Chinese astronauts, including a woman who docked with the orbiting space station on October 30. China changes crew for the station every six months. China built its space station after it was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) over concerns that Chinas space programme is manned by its military, the Peoples Liberation Army, (PLA). The two robotic arms of the station, especially the long one which has the ability to grab objects including satellites from space, drew international concerns. Early this month China announced its plans for the further development of space programmes which included launching a manned lunar mission, construction of a lunar space station, exploration of habitable planets and extra-terrestrial life to expand its space programme in the next few decades.
