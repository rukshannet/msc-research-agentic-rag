        "title": "Sri Lankan migrants brought to UK from Diego Garcia",
        "date": "December 3, 2024 11:09 am",
        "content": "Migrants stranded for more than three years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia have been brought to the UK. The Sri Lankan Tamils are permitted to remain in the country for six months, with financial support from the Foreign Office, according to documents seen by the BBC. Their journey to the UK marks the end of years of complex legal battles waged over thousands of miles over their fate, but their long-term future remains uncertain. Most of the group of around 60 migrants have been living in a makeshift camp on Diego Garcia - the site of a strategic UK-US military base - since October 2021, when they became the first people ever to file asylum claims there. On Monday, a government spokesperson described the move as a one-off, due to the exceptional nature of these cases and in the interests of their welfare. This government inherited a deeply troubling situation that remained unresolved under the last administration for years, the spokesperson said. Tessa Gregory of UK law firm Leigh Day, which represents some of the migrants, said it was the only sensible solution to end the humanitarian crisis on the island. This vulnerable group which includes 16 children have spent 38 months detained in the most squalid of conditions on Crown land... we hope our clients will now be able to seek safe haven and begin to rebuild their lives, she said. The BBC gained unprecedented access earlier this year to Diego Garcia and the migrant camp there, where the Tamils were housed in groups in military tents, some of which had leaks and rats nesting inside. During their time on the island, there were multiple hunger strikes and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts in response to the conditions, after which some people were transferred to Rwanda for medical treatment. There were also allegations of sexual assaults and harassment within the camp. Migrants have told the BBC it was like living in hell. Those in Rwanda are also set to arrive in the UK on Tuesday. One told the BBC: I hope to turn a new page. I hope my health will improve and I will transform into a new person. Two men with criminal convictions and another under investigation remain on the island, the BBC understands. The Tamils arrival in the UK comes amid uncertainty over the future of the territory. The UK announced in October that it was ceding control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, to Mauritius. But the new Mauritian prime minister has said he has reservations over the deal, which was struck by his predecessor and has still to be signed, and has asked for an independent review. The deal is facing opposition from some politicians in the UK and allies of US President-elect Donald Trump. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has played down the criticism, describing it as a good deal for both Mauritius and the UK, and saying it addresses US concerns about the future of the Diego Garcia base. In recent years, the territory has been costing the UK tens of millions of pounds, with the bulk of this categorised under migrant costs. Communications obtained by the BBC between Foreign Office officials in July warned that the costs are increasing and the latest forecast is that these will be 50m per annum if they were to remain there. In letters sent to the Tamils on Friday from the Home Office, they were told they were being granted temporary entry clearance to the UK outside of the Immigration Rules to allow them to consider their long-term options. It stressed that the offer did not constitute permanent settlement in the UK or recognition of refugee status by the UK government, and said the group would not be permitted to work. The government says the Chagos Islands, known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), are constitutionally distinct from the UK, with the unusual status leading to the long legal dispute. Most of the Tamils have been awaiting final decisions on claims for international protection - which the United Nations says is akin to refugee status - or appealing against rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection, meaning they cannot be returned to Sri Lanka, the BBC understands. Successive governments have previously said that bringing the Tamils to the UK would risk creating a backdoor migration route. But the government said on Monday that arrangements had been made to ensure this did not happen, citing a deal to send future arrivals to St Helena - another UK territory some 5,000 miles away. Once a sovereignty agreement with Mauritius is fully in place they would then take responsibility for any future migrants, the spokesperson said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 3, 2024 11:43 am",
        "content": "Apple has been accused in a new lawsuit of illegally monitoring its workers personal devices and iCloud accounts while also barring them from discussing their pay and working conditions. The complaint filed in California state court on Sunday by Amar Bhakta, who works in digital advertising for Apple, claims the company requires employees to install software on personal devices that they use for work allowing Apple to access their email, photo libraries, health and smart home data and other personal information. At the same time, the lawsuit alleges, Apple imposes confidentiality policies that prohibit employees from discussing working conditions, including with the media, and engaging in legally-protected whistleblowing. Bhakta, who has worked for Apple since 2020, says he was barred from talking about his work on podcasts and instructed to remove information about his working conditions from his LinkedIn profile. Apples surveillance policies and practices chill, and thus also unlawfully restrain, employee whistleblowing, competition, freedom of employee movement in the job market, and freedom of speech, the lawsuit said. Apple in a statement provided by a spokesperson said the claims in the lawsuit lack merit and that its workers are trained annually on their rights to discuss their working conditions. At Apple, were focused on creating the best products and services in the world and we work to protect the inventions our teams create for customers, the company said. Lawyers for Bhakta also represent two women who filed a lawsuit in June accusing Apple of systematically underpaying female workers in its engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions. Apple has said it is committed to inclusion and pay equity. Apple is also facing at least three complaints from a U.S. labor board claiming it has illegally deterred employees from discussing issues such as sex bias and pay discrimination with each other and the media, including by restricting their use of social media and workplace messaging app Slack. The company has denied wrongdoing. The new lawsuit was filed under a unique California law that allows workers to sue their employers on behalf of the state and keep 35 of any penalties that are recovered. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Construction at the Colombo West International Terminal remains ongoing, with phase one of the project still set for completion in early 2025, Sirimevan Ranasinghe, chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, told Bloomberg. Ranasinghe is also a minority shareholder in the project. He informed the news agency that the project would be continuing as per their agreement inked with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. Adani Group is playing a prominent part in expanding the countrys port infrastructure. The Colombo terminal project, which involves a infusion of 1-billion, marks the largest foreign direct investment in Sri Lankas port sector. Ranasinghe said that US financing had not been finalised, and added that it was up to the joint-venture company developing the project to procure the requisite financing. The US International Development Finance Agency committed a 553-million loan last year to help develop the Colombo port, a project majority-owned by Adani Ports. The US funding was widely seen as a way to counterbalance Chinas large infrastructure investments and counter the countrys influence in the region. The tenure of the loan was to be for 20 years, with an equity contribution of 30 by the partners. Adani Group was looking at close to 16 of return on investments from the project. --With inputs from Bloomberg",

        "content": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared martial law in an unannounced late night address broadcast live on YTN television, claiming he would eradicate shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces. He did not cite any specific threat from the nuclear-armed North, however, instead focusing on his domestic political opponents. The surprise move sent shockwaves through the country, which had a series of authoritarian leaders early in its history but has been considered democratic since the 1980s. The Korean won was down sharply against the U.S. dollar. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken hostage of the parliamentary process to throw the country into a crisis. I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order, Yoon said. He did not say in the address what specific measures will be taken. Yonhap news agency reported that the entrance to the parliament building was blocked. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country, Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, which has the majority in parliament, said in a livestream online. The economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably. My fellow citizens, please come to the National Assembly. Yoon cited a motion by the countrys opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, this week to impeach some of the countrys top prosecutors and its rejection of a government budget proposal. South Koreas ministers on Monday protested the move by opposition DP last week to slash more than 4 trillion won from the governments budget proposal. Yoon said that action undermines the essential functioning of government administration. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 4, 2024 08:32 am",
        "content": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift a surprise martial law declaration he had imposed just hours before, backing down in a standoff with parliament which roundly rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media. In South Koreas biggest political crisis in decades, Yoon shocked the nation and declared martial law on Tuesday night to thwart anti-state forces among his domestic political opponents. But outraged lawmakers unanimously rejected the decree. Yonhap news agency said the cabinet had agreed early on Wednesday to scrap the martial law. Protesters outside the National Assembly parliament shouted and clapped. We won! they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum. The main opposition Democratic Party called for Yoon, who has been in office since 2022, to resign or face impeachment. Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down, senior DP member of parliament Park Chan-dae said in a statement. South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot, said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank in the United States. The South Korean won currency came off a more than two-year low against the dollar after Yoons reversal, while exchange traded funds linked to South Korean stocks similarly cut losses. Yoons surprise declaration of martial law, which he cast as aimed at his political foes, was voted down by 190 lawmakers in parliament. His own party urged him to lift the decree. Under South Korean law, the president must immediately lift martial law if parliament demands it by a majority vote. The crisis in a country that has been a democracy since the 1980s, and is a U.S. ally and major Asian economy, caused international alarm. U.S. RELIEVED After Yoons announcement of martial law in a TV address, South Koreas military had said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command. Helmeted troops briefly tried to enter the parliament building. Parliamentary aides were seen trying to push the soldiers back by spraying fire extinguishers. The White House said it was pleased Yoon had backed down. We are relieved President Yoon has reversed course on his concerning declaration of martial law and respected the... National Assemblys vote to end it, a White House spokesperson said. Earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said the United States was watching events in South Korea with grave concern. Some 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to guard against the nuclear-armed North. Yoon did not cite any specific threat from the North, instead focusing on his domestic political opponents. It was the first time since 1980 that martial law has been declared in South Korea. Russel, who was the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama, said South Korea was now looking at the prospect of snap elections. Political uncertainty and domestic strife in South Korea is not our friend. Political uncertainty and domestic strife in South Korea is North Koreas friend, however. You can be sure that North Korea is licking its chops, he said. Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022. He rode a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars, aiming to reshape the political future of Asias fourth-largest economy. But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 for months. His People Power Party suffered a landslide defeat at a parliamentary election in April this year, ceding control of the unicameral assembly to opposition parties that captured nearly two-thirds of the seats. There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948. In 1980, a group of military officers led by Chun Doo-hwan forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls by the opposition, labour and students for the restoration of democratic government.

The claims arose during the parliamentary session yesterday (03), where Dr. Archchuna alleged he was assaulted at the Opposition Leaders Office in the Parliament Complex by MP Sujith Sanjaya Perera. In response, MP Perera clarified his stance today, stating: There is no problem. The new MP Archchuna has made a statement that I attacked him. I never attacked him. However, an incident did occur at the office of the Leader of the Opposition. He came to the office and had an argument with the secretary of the leader of the opposition. At that time, MP Alawathuwala and I sat nearby. I asked him to talk to the party leaders or the Speaker to resolve it. He said, I did not come to talk to you, whereas I responded, mentioning I told you what we know. Perera explained that he had advised Dr. Archchuna to engage with party leaders or the Speaker to resolve his concerns, which the latter dismissed. He further added: Criticizing the opposition leader and staff in such a manner was inappropriate. The incident follows another controversy involving MP Archchuna Ramanathan, who mistakenly occupied the Leader of the Oppositions seat during the inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament. This misstep prompted significant attention, but the MP later apologized during an awareness workshop for new parliamentarians held on November 25.",

College students will be the biggest driver of fertility but they have significantly changed their views on marriage and love, the Jiangsu Xinhua newspaper group said, citing China Population News, an official publication. Colleges and universities should assume the responsibility of providing marriage and love education to college students by offering marriage and love education courses, the publication said. The measures would help create a healthy and positive marriage and childbearing cultural atmosphere. The state council, or cabinet, rallied local governments in November to direct resources towards fixing Chinas population decline and spread respect for childbearing and marriages at the right age, although demographers said the moves were unlikely to resonate with young Chinese. Around 57 of college students polled by China Population News said they did not want to fall in love, mainly because they did not know how to allocate time to balance the relationship between study and love, the publication said. Due to the lack of systematic and scientific marriage and love education, college students have a vague understanding of emotional relationships. Universities could focus on teaching junior college students about population and national conditions, new marriage and childbearing concepts, it said. Senior college students and graduate students could be taught through case analysis, group discussion on maintaining intimate relationships and communication between the sexes. The courses would be able to help them improve their ability to correctly understand marriage and love and manage love relationships. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 4, 2024 04:20 pm",
        "content": "Aliya Fakhri, actress Nargis Fakhris sister, was arrested in New York on charges of murdering her ex-boyfriend and his female friend. The incident took place on November 26, and according to Daily News, District Attorney Melinda Katz said, This defendant maliciously ended the lives of two people by setting a fire that trapped a man and woman in a raging inferno. The victims tragically died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. Aliya has been denied bail as of now. Who is Aliya Fakhri? Not much is known about Aliya, but she is a couple of years younger than Nargis and grew up in Queens, New York. Their father, Mohammed Fakhri, is Pakistani, and their mother, Marie Fakhri, is Czech. The two parents divorced when Aliya and Nargis were young. The incident The tragic incident began when Aliya allegedly set fire to a garage, killing Edward Jacobs and Anastasia Ettienne. According to an eyewitness, the situation was described as an abusive relationship. The witness said, We had to jump over it to escape. Star jumped over with me, but then she went back in to save Jacobs. It was an abusive relationship. She had told everyone before that she was going to burn his house down, that she was going to kill him. We just laughed it off. However, Aliyas mother, Marie, disagreed with the claims, saying, I dont think she would be killing someone. She was a person who was caring for everybody. She tried to help everybody. The arrest Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz announced that Aliya Fakhri had been indicted on several charges, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and arson. If convicted, Aliya could face life imprisonment. The fire allegedly started when Aliya arrived at the residence early in the morning and shouted, Youre all going to die today, before setting the structure on fire. Jacobs, who had been in an on-and-off relationship with Aliya, was trapped on the second floor of the garage and could not escape. Ettienne, who was on the first floor, tried to save Jacobs but was also trapped by the flames. According to the Daily News, prosecutors stated that Jacobs had ended his relationship with Aliya over a year ago, and Aliya struggled to accept the breakup. Jacobs leaves behind three children, including 11-year-old twin boys and a 9-year-old son. Nargis Fakhris response Nargis Fakhri has not commented on the case publicly. However, last week, the actress posted an update about her work on the upcoming film Housefull 5, sharing that the film was in its final schedule. Source: Economic Times --Agencies",

        "date": "December 4, 2024 05:03 pm",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal has ordered the dismissal of a petition filed by the W.M. Mendis  Co. Limited today (04) without taking it up for hearing. W. M. Mendis Distilleries had filed the petition seeking an order invalidating the letter issued by the Department of Excise informing that steps will be taken to suspend the excise licenses issued to the company if the outstanding excise duties were not settled before 30 November 2024. This order was issued by the Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Mahen Gopallawa following an extended consideration of facts, declaring that the petition does not reveal any prima facie case. Appearing for the petitioner during the trial, Presidents Counsel Naveen Marapana stated before the court that the letter issued by the Excise Department to his client mentioning that steps would be taken to suspend the currently issued liquor production licenses if the tax arrears were not paid before November 30, was completely unlawful. The Presidents Counsel further pointed out that it is an arbitrary act to suddenly announce that the license will be suspended on November 30, when the company has already secured licenses to carry out production activities until December 31. He also stated that the Excise department has informed his client that 8 out of 10 liquor production licenses that have been issued to the company will be suspended from today (04). Additionally, the Presidents Counsel stated that the outstanding excise duty of Rs. 5.3 billion owed by his client can be paid if the over Rs. 12 billion in assets currently frozen by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and which belongs to a sister company, Perpetual Treasuries is released. Accordingly, Presidents Counsel Naveen Marapana requested the court to issue an interim injunction to release the funds belonging to Perpetual Treasuries Company, which are being held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, allowing the payment of outstanding taxes of W. M. Mendis Distilleries. Deputy Solicitor General Dr. Avanthi Perera who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General strongly opposed the Presidents Counsels request, stating that the decision taken to suspend the licenses of liquor manufacturing companies that have defaulted on tax payments from November 30 is a policy decision of the government. The Deputy Solicitor General further highlighted that the decision does not apply only to the petitioning company but applies to all liquor manufacturing companies that have defaulted on tax payments. Accordingly, the Deputy Solicitor General requested the court to dismiss the petition without taking it into consideration. After considering the facts presented by both parties, the judge bench ordered the relevant petition to be dismissed without taking it up for hearing.",

Chief executive Brian Thompson was fatally shot in the chest just before 07:00 EST (12:00 GMT) on Wednesday outside the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where he was scheduled to speak at an investor conference later in the day. The 50-year-old was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, officials said. A suspect fled the scene and remains at large, the New York Police Department said. Thompson appeared to be targeted in the attack, with the suspect waiting for him outside wearing a ski mask and cream jacket, police said. Investigators said they have video footage of the shooting, but they did not know the suspects motive. Nothing was taken from the victim, they added. Thompson was named chief executive of UnitedHealthcare in April 2021. He earned 10.2m (8m) working for the company last year. Thompson started at the health insurance provider in 2004, and has held multiple leadership roles, including CEO of the companys government programs division.

        "title": "South Koreas President faces impeachment after martial law debacle",
        "date": "December 4, 2024 09:58 pm",
        "content": "South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday proposed impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol for his sudden decision to declare martial law, which he rescinded after a chaotic standoff between parliament and the army that damaged the countrys standing. Yoons declaration of martial law late on Tuesday attempted to ban political activity and censor the media in South Korea, which has Asias fourth largest economy and is a key U.S. ally. Washington had no advance notice of the decision, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters, adding that he expected to speak with his South Korean counterpart in the coming days. Armed troops had forced their way into the National Assembly building in Seoul but stood back when parliamentary aides sprayed them with fire extinguishers. Lawmakers rejected the martial law decision while protesters scuffled with police outside. On Wednesday evening, civic and labour groups held a candlelight vigil in downtown Seoul calling for Yoons resignation - a reminder of the massive candlelight protests that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in 2017. They then marched to the presidential office. Six South Korean opposition parties submitted a bill in parliament to impeach Yoon, who had already faced accusations of heavy-handed leadership from his opponents and from within his own party, with voting set for Friday or Saturday. A plenary session to formally introduce the bill was scheduled to begin shortly after midnight (1500 GMT) on Wednesday. We couldnt ignore the illegal martial law, DP lawmaker Kim Yong-min told reporters. We can no longer let democracy collapse. The leader of Yoons ruling People Power Party called for Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun to be fired and the entire cabinet to resign. Kim has offered to resign, the defence ministry said. The crisis rattled global financial markets and left South Koreas benchmark KOSPI index .KS11 down 1.4, taking its year-to-date losses to over 7 and making it the worst performing major stock market in Asia this year. The won was stable but close to a two-year low, with dealers reporting suspected intervention by South Korean authorities after overnight talks between Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong. Choi sent an emergency note to global financial chiefs and credit rating agencies late on Wednesday which said the market was functioning as usual, and that the finance ministry was working to alleviate any adverse impact from political turmoil, the ministry said in a statement. No Specific Threats Yoon told the nation in a television speech late on Tuesday that martial law was needed to defend the country from pro-North Korean anti-state forces, and protect the free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats. Within hours, South Koreas parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion for martial law be lifted, with 18 members of Yoons party present. The president then rescinded the declaration of martial law, around six hours after its proclamation. Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. We won! they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum. There are opinions that it was too much to go to emergency martial law, and that we did not follow the procedures for emergency martial law, but it was done strictly within the constitutional framework, a South Korean presidential official told Reuters by telephone. There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South. Yoon was embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the U.S.-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere. But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics as communist totalitarian and anti-state forces as his approval ratings slipped. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to influence-peddling allegations against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions. Seoul appeared largely normal on Wednesday, with the usual rush hour traffic in trains and on the streets. But Hyundai Motors labour union announced plans to stage strikes on Thursday and Friday and some major employers, including Naver Corp and LG Electronics Inc , advised employees to work from home. Sales of canned goods, instant noodles and bottled water had soared overnight, said a major South Korean convenience store chain, which sought anonymity. Im deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and Im very concerned about the future of the country, 39-year-old Seoul resident Kim Byeong-in told Reuters. The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favour. A trial by the constitutional court follows, which can confirm the motion with a vote by six of the nine justices. Yoons party has 108 seats in the 300-member legislature. Dodged A Bullet If Yoon resigned or was removed from office, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would fill in as leader until a new election was held within 60 days. South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot, Danny Russel, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, said of the first martial law declaration in South Korea since 1980. Blinken said he welcomed Yoons decision to rescind the martial law declaration. We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law, he said in a statement. South Korea hosts about 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War. Planned defence talks and a joint military exercise between the two allies were postponed amid the broader diplomatic fallout from the debacle. South Koreas political situation is an internal matter, Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Russia said it was following the tragic events in South Korea with concern. Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022, riding a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars. But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 for months and the opposition captured nearly two-thirds of seats in parliament in an April election. Martial law been declared more than a dozen times since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948. In 1980, a group of military officers forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls for the restoration of democratic government. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "French government collapses in no-confidence vote",
        "date": "December 5, 2024 08:00 am",
        "content": "The French government has collapsed after Prime Minister Michel Barnier was ousted in a no-confidence vote. MPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the motion against him - just three months after he was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron. Opposition parties had tabled the motion after the former Brexit negotiator controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. It marks the first time the countrys government has collapsed in a no-confidence vote since 1962. The development will further Frances political instability, after snap elections in summer led to no single group having a majority in parliament. MPs were required to either vote yes or abstain from Wednesdays vote, with 288 votes needed for the motion to pass. A total of 331 voted in support of the motion. Barnier is now obliged to present the resignation of his government, and the budget which triggered his downfall is defunct. However, he is likely to stay on as caretaker prime minister while Macron chooses a successor. Both the left and far right had tabled motions of no-confidence after Barnier pushed through reforms to social security by invoking presidential decree on Monday, after failing to win enough support for the measures. The left-wing alliance New Popular Front (NFP), which won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, had previously criticised Macrons decision to appoint centrist Barnier as prime minister over its own candidate. Alongside the far-right National Rally (RN), it deemed Barniers budget - which included 60bn (49bn) in deficit reduction - unacceptable. Marine Le Pen, the RN leader, said the budget was toxic for the French. Ahead of the vote, Barnier told the National Assembly that voting him out of office would not solve the countrys financial problems. We have reached a moment of truth, of responsibility, he said, adding that we need to look at the realities of our debt. It is not a pleasure that I propose difficult measures. In an interview with French broadcaster TF1 on Wednesday, Le Pen said there was no other solution than to remove Barnier. Asked about the French presidents prospects, she replied: I am not asking for the resignation of Emmanuel Macron. However, Le Pen added that if we do not respect the voice of voters and show respect for political forces and respect for elections, then pressure on the president will obviously be stronger and stronger. Macron, who has returned to France following a state visit to Saudi Arabia, is due to give a televised speech to the nation on Thursday evening. He is not directly affected by the result of the vote, as France votes for its president separately from its government. Macron had said he would not resign whatever the outcome of Wednesdays vote. He is expected to name a new prime minister swiftly to avoid the embarrassment of a non-existent government - not least because US President-elect Donald Trump is due in Paris this weekend for the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral. No new parliamentary elections can be held until July, so the current deadlock in the Assembly - where no group can hope to have a working majority - is set to continue. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 5, 2024 12:31 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka vowed Thursday to complete its long-delayed foreign debt restructure within the month before a 2025 budget adhering to strict revenue targets set by the International Monetary Fund. The island nation defaulted on its 46 billion external debt in April 2022 after running out of foreign exchange to finance even the most essential imports such as food and fuel. Its economy has recovered after getting an IMF rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the governments ruined finances. Economic development deputy minister Anil Jayantha Fernando said debt restructuring had been delayed by more than two years, costing the country an additional 1.7 billion in accumulated interest. We are hoping to complete the restructure of bilateral debt and international sovereign bonds by December 31, Fernando said. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, voted into office in September, told parliament that his government would present its first revenue and expenditure proposals for next year in February. Dissanayake last month announced it would honour a deal secured by his predecessor to restructure 12.55 billion in international sovereign bonds, a key condition to maintain the 2.9 billion four-year IMF bailout loan. Agreements have yet to be inked to complete the debt restructuring process and allow Sri Lanka to return to international financial markets to raise new loans. A majority of private creditors to the South Asian nation agreed in September to a 27 percent haircut on their loans. Dissanayakes National Peoples Power (NPP) coalition had previously criticised the restructure deal as unfair on the impoverished nation and vowed to renegotiate after coming to power. But since its win in snap parliamentary elections last month he has made a U-turn, saying the economic recovery was too fragile to jeopardise with any changes. As part of the deal agreed in September and ratified by the new administration, bondholders will also take an 11 percent haircut on overdue interest payments. Sri Lanka secured its IMF bailout in 2023 after doubling taxes, withdrawing energy subsidies and raising prices of essentials to shore up state revenue. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 5, 2024 03:57 pm",
        "content": "Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying its new report was a wake-up call for the international community. The London-based rights organisation said its findings were based on dehumanising and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials, satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans. Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them, Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now, she added. The Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack inside southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering a deadly Israeli military offensive on Gaza as Israeli officials vowed to crush the militant group. A total of 1,208 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the Hamas attack, according to an AFP tally based on official data. Since then at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, deemed reliable by the UN. There is absolutely no doubt that Israel has military objectives. But the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent, Callamard told AFP at a press conference in The Hague. She said the organisation had based its findings on the criteria set out in the UN Convention on the Prevention of Genocide. Israel has repeatedly and forcefully denied allegations of genocide, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. But Amnestys 300-page report points to direct deliberate attacks on civilian and civilian infrastructures where there was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives, the use of heavy explosive weapons with a wide radius of destruction in densely populated residential areas, the blocking of aid deliveries, and the displacement of 90 percent of Gazas 2.4 million people. Erasure In the days after the October 7 attack, Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza, with the slogan: No electricity, no water, no gas. Limited supplies have been allowed in since then. Palestinians have been subjected to malnutrition, hunger and diseases and exposed to a slow, calculated death, Amnesty said. The rights group, which is also due to publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas, cited 15 air strikes in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians, including 141 children, for which the group found no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective. The Amnesty report also referenced dozens of calls by Israeli officials and soldiers for the annihilation, destruction, burning or erasure of Gaza. Such statements highlighted not only systemic impunity but also the creation of an environment that emboldens...such behaviour. Governments must stop pretending that they are powerless to terminate Israels occupation, to end apartheid and to stop the genocide in Gaza, said Callamard. States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit, she added. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "Venerable Wadigala Samitharathana Thero has become the first Sri Lankan Buddhist monk to study at Britains prestigious University of Oxford in 105 years. He is currently reading for an MPhil in Buddhist Studies as a Glorisun Scholar at St Cross College, University of Oxford. He studied oriental languages (Sinhala, Pāli, and Sanskrit) and other co-related literature (philology, etymology, grammar, semantics, metrics and prosody, logic and reasoning, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc.) at Siri Sunanda Pirivena, Beliatta and Mahāvihāra Maha Pirivena, Kandy in Sri Lanka. The Venerable Thero was awarded the National First Prize (with a Korean Government Scholarship) for the highest marks in the Buddhist Religious Final Examination in 2013 and the academic honour of Royal Paṇḍita remarking the successful completion of oriental studies in Ceylon in 2016. He had started reading for a BA (Hons) in Philosophy at the University of Peradeniya in 2019, whilst studying the Pāli canon, exegetical commentaries, Vedic, non-Vedic, and Buddhist Sanskrit texts. Further, in recognition of his exceptional achievements in Buddhist studies, the International Buddhist College in Thailand offered him the Outstanding Young Buddhist Scholar Award in 2017. He also received an offer from Oxford Brookes University, along with an International Student Scholarship Award to complete the final two years of the current programme. Accordingly, he took the opportunity and earned a BA (Hons) in Philosophy in submitting a dissertation titled Aristotle and Buddhism: A Comparative Study between the Aristotelian Concept of Eudaimonia and the Buddhist Perspective of Nibbāna in 2023. The Thero received the Tibet Foundation Award, whereby he pursued an MA in Buddhist Studies at SOAS University of London in 2024. Therein, he carried out a breakthrough study on Buddhaghosas Critique of Meditation (Visuddhimagga): An Emphasis on Ethics, Epistemology, and Metaphysics in Buddhist Meditation. Ven. Samitharathana Thero has given several paper presentations at International Research Conferences worldwide held in Zürich, Paris, Oxford, Cambridge, Madrid, Berlin, New York, Colombo, and Kandy, over the past years. He founded the Oxford Buddhist Society to preserve Theravāda Buddhism for the sake of human well-being, and is now playing a vital role as the Founding President. In Michaelmas Term 2024, Ven. Samitharathana Thero matriculated to the University of Oxford (alongside the membership at St Cross College) as a Glorisun Scholar - since he was awarded the Glorisun Graduate Scholarship towards the MPhil in Buddhist Studies this year. In history, Venerable Suriyagoda Sumangala was the first-ever Sri Lankan Buddhist monk to earn a scholarship at Oxford. In Michaelmas Term 1919, he enrolled as a non-collegiate student, and then studied for a BLitt at Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford.",

        "title": "Bitcoin surges above 100,000 for the first time",
        "date": "December 5, 2024 06:42 pm",
        "content": "Bitcoin hit 100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, surging to a new record after President-elect Donald Trump unveiled administration picks seen as holding the keys to ushering in crypto-friendly policies when he takes office in January. Chief among the picks is Paul Atkins, whom Trump intends to nominate to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates cryptocurrency. Atkins, a crypto advocate and former SEC commissioner, is expected to regulate cryptocurrency with a lighter touch than Gary Gensler, who leads the commission under the Biden administration. Gensler, who aggressively fought the industrys expansion in the US, is set to resign on Inauguration Day. Bitcoin touched 100,000 just hours after Atkins was announced as Trumps choice for SEC chair. The new milestone builds on the stunning rally set in motion since Trump was projected to win the presidency on November 6, which fueled a 6,000 one-day spike in bitcoin that brought it to a new record above 74,000. A week later, it hit 90,000. Bitcoin is up 130 for the year so far, with the post-election rally accounting for a significant portion of its gains. Its performance far outpaces the SP 500, which is up 28 over the same period. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had called it not money, labeling it highly volatile and based on thin air. But he took a 180-turn in the months leading up to his reelection as he sought to attract younger male voters, who tend to own more crypto compared to other demographic groups. In July, Trump headlined the largest crypto convention in Nashville, where he vowed to create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and to hold on to bitcoin the government seizes from criminals rather than auctioning it off, which is the current practice. If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA, Trump said. Then in September, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial. That month, he also purchased burgers from a Manhattan bar frequented by crypto enthusiasts using bitcoin. History in the making, he declared. Additionally, Trumps media company, which owns Truth Social, is reportedly in talks to buy crypto trading forum Bakkt, according to the Financial Times. If you like bitcoin at 100,000, youre going to love it at 1 million, Anthony Pompliano, a well-known crypto supporter and founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, an investment firm, said in a post on X Wednesday night. The cryptocurrency industry threw its weight behind Trump and the Republican Party during this election cycle, with leading super PACs donating around 131 million to elect pro-crypto candidates in congressional races. The Trump campaign, which began accepting crypto donations in May, raised millions from the move. Now the community that helped cement his victory is banking on a wave of pro-crypto policies, a reversal from the last four years under the Biden administration. Trump appears ready to oblige. In addition to Atkins, hes nominated Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, a prominent cheerleader for Tether, the company behind one of the worlds biggest crypto assets. Additionally, hes considering creating the first-ever White House role solely dedicated to crypto policy, Bloomberg reported. But crypto hasnt found fans among many current financial regulators. For instance, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell labeled bitcoin as a speculative asset. In his view, bitcoin has many of the same qualities as gold, which US consumers by and large arent using as their main form of payment. Its not a competitor for the dollar. Its really a competitor for gold, he said on Wednesday at a conference. Powell himself, he said, is not allowed to own any cryptocurrenecies. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Frances Macron seeks new prime minister as Barnier resigns",
        "date": "December 5, 2024 09:19 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron met allies and parliament leaders on Thursday as he sought to swiftly appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, who officially resigned a day after opposition lawmakers voted to topple his government. Barnier, a veteran conservative whom Macron appointed prime minister barely three months ago, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he failed to find enough support for a budget aimed at taming a wide deficit. The Elysee Palace said Macron had asked Barnier and his government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed. Three sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Macron aimed to appoint a replacement swiftly, with one saying he wanted to do so before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral - renovated after a devastating fire. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among world leaders expected to attend. Allies in Macrons own camp joined the chorus urging swift action. After the late June and early July snap elections, it took Macron nearly two months to appoint Barnier. I recommend that he proceed quickly to the appointment of a prime minister, its important, we must not leave things up in the air, National Assembly president Yael Braun-Pivet told France Inter radio before meeting Macron around noon. France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a U.S.-style government shutdown. The political turmoil in France further weakens a European Union already reeling from the implosion of Germanys coalition government, and comes just weeks before Trump returns to the White House. It also diminishes Macron, who precipitated the crisis with an ill-fated decision to call a snap election in June that give rise to the countrys polarised parliament. Macron was due to address to the nation at 8pm (1900 GMT). The president had lunch with Francois Bayrou, whose name has been cited by French media as a possible successor to Barnier, Le Parisien newspaper reported. An aide to Bayrou did not respond to a request for comment on whether the veteran centrist had been tapped for the role of prime minister. MACRON WEAKENED As France confronted the need to form a new government for a third time this year, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen jetted into Uruguay looking to finalise a free trade deal between the EU and Mercosur. France has long opposed the accord and Macrons office reiterated its stance on Thursday. Macrons own mandate runs until 2027 and he has so far showed no sign of bowing to opposition calls to resign, though a Toluna Harris Interactive poll for RTL broadcaster showed 64 of voters now want the president to step down. The main culprit for the current situation is Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally (RN) told TF1 TV. A French president cannot be pushed out unless two thirds of lawmakers decide he has gravely failed to fulfil his role, according to a never-yet-invoked article of the constitution. Any new prime minister will face the same challenges of dealing with a fractured parliament, notably passing a 2025 budget at a time when France needs to rein in its public finances. This is the logical conclusion of what France and its lawmakers are at the moment: a mess, 75-year-old Parisian Paulo told Reuters, commenting on the latest developments. Under French constitutional rules, there can be no new parliamentary election before July. Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated, SocGen analysts said in a note. Political uncertainty is likely to dampen both investment and consumer spending. French bonds and stocks rallied on Thursday on what some traders said was profit-taking following the widely expected outcome of the no-confidence vote. But the relief rally is unlikely to last, given the scale of political uncertainty. The fall of Frances government leaves the country without a clear path towards reducing its fiscal deficit and the most likely outcome is less belt-tightening than previously planned, credit rating agency Standard and Poors (SP) said.

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has announced that it will submit its proposal for the revision of electricity tariffs to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) today (06). Responding to an inquiry made by Ada Derana, CEB Chairman Dr. Thilak Siyambalapitiya confirmed that the proposal would be submitted as scheduled. Previously, it was proposed under the former government that electricity tariffs be revised four times annually. However, in 2023, tariff revisions were carried out three times, while two revisions were made this year. The current government has limited tariff revisions to twice a year. The proposal submitted today is expected to revise electricity tariffs for the first half of 2025, with implementation anticipated from the third week of January next year. Meanwhile, a tariff revision proposal set to take effect this December was submitted to the PUCSL in the month of October. This proposal included a reduction of approximately 6 in electricity tariffs. However, the PUCSL identified three major errors in the proposal and requested corrections. Initially, the CEB sought two weeks to address these issues, with the deadline extended to November 8. Upon further requests for extensions, the PUCSL granted additional time until November 22 and later extended the deadline to today. The PUCSL has warned the CEB in writing that if the proposal is not submitted today, the Commission will proceed with the tariff revision independently.",

He further assured that he would firmly stand by this vision at any time, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The President shared these remarks while addressing officials of the Ministry of Digital Economic Affairs after assuming duties as the Minister of Digital Economic Affairs yesterday (05). Highlighting the benefits of digitalization, the President stated that it has the potential to enhance the efficiency of economic activities and elevate the countrys economy to greater heights. The President highlighted that the governments primary objectives are poverty eradication, transforming social attitudes, and advancing digitalization, the statement said. The President emphasized that a countrys development cannot be achieved solely by constructing buildings. Reflecting on the past, he recalled the existence of a dedicated construction ministry two decades ago and noted that currently, construction activities are being undertaken by every ministry. He revealed that during discussions with the Ministry of Education authorities and university chancellors last year, no attention was given to education reforms, with the focus remaining solely on building construction. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also highlighted that despite the Ministry of Labor possessing two large buildings, there has been no reduction in public queues, stressing that digitalization is essential to address such issues effectively, the PMD said. The Ministry has outlined a plan to generate an income of USD 15 billion within the next five years through the digital economy. Efforts will also be directed towards increasing the digital workforce to 200,000 and digitizing the entire country within the same timeframe, it added. Engineer Eranga Weeraratne assumed duties as the Deputy Minister of Digital Economy during this occasion. The event was attended by Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Acting Secretary to the Ministry of Digital Economy Waruna Sri Dhanapala, Senior Advisor to the President on Digital Affairs Hans Wijayasuriya, who is also the Chairman of ICTA, along with a group of officials. --PMD",

        "content": "Donor countries have pledged a record 100 billion three-year replenishment of the World Banks fund for the poorest nations, providing a vital lifeline for their struggles against crushing debts, climate disasters, inflation and conflict. The World Bank made the announcement early on Friday in Seoul at a pledging conference for the International Development Association, which provides grants and very low interest loans to some 78 low-income countries. The total exceeds the previous 93 billion IDA replenishment announced in December 2021. Countries will contribute about 24 billion directly to IDA, but the fund will issue bonds and employ other financial leverage to stretch that to the targeted 100 billion in grants and loans through mid 2028. But the two-day pledging conference fell short of the 120 billion goal that some developing countries had called for, partly because the dollars strength -- pushed up by Donald Trumps U.S. presidential election victory -- diminished the dollar value of significant increases in foreign currency contributions by several countries. At a G20 leaders summit in Brazil last month, Norway increased its pledge by 50 from 2021 to 5.024 billion krone. Thats 455 million at current exchange rates, but at the start of 2024, it would have been worth 496 million. South Korea boosted its pledge by 45 to 846 billion won, (597 billion), Britain by 40 to 1.8 billion pounds, while Spain boosted its contribution to 400 million euros, a pledge worth 423 million -- 10 million less than the day it was announced in October.

The campaign tagline You will come back for more devised some time back, will be discontinued and instead a nation branding strategy developed, Sri Lanka Tourism chairman Buddhika Hewawasam told TTG Asia this week. Hewawasam took over as chairman of the NTO a few weeks after a new government was installed in power following parliamentary elections on November 14. With input from the industry at this meeting in January, we want to develop one national brand (while) also piggybacking on the success and the popularity of Ceylon tea and Sri Lanka in the cricket field, he said. In the future, tourism in Sri Lanka will focus on promoting cricket and its tea, two things which Sri Lanka is famous for. The tagline You will come back for more was developed in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis in 2022, both of which affected tourism. Hewawasam noted: This tagline was created to woo back tourists and is not relevant today as Sri Lanka has won a lot of recognition in recent times internationally. We need to look afresh and come up with a strategy that attracts all markets. Tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka surged to 1.8 million from January to November 2024, up from 1.3 million last year. With a target of over two million visitors, the countrys top source markets include India, Russia, the UK, Germany, and China. He added that a PR company will be appointed in January to launch the promotion campaign. The You will come back for more tagline was developed in 2022 but only launched earlier this year after delays in approval. It was introduced as part of a single campaign, rather than a nation branding effort. Source: TTG Asia --Agencies",

The delegation also included the USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator Anjali Kaur and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, Robert Kaproth. US Assistant Secretary Donald Lu arrived in Sri Lanka yesterday (06) on an official visit while his engagements are expected to advance U.S.-Sri Lankan joint efforts to promote sustainable economic growth, combat corruption, and strengthen people-to-people ties.",

        "date": "December 6, 2024 02:33 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan has called on his supporters to hold a rally next week and threatened to start a civil disobedience movement days after his party led a deadly protest march in Islamabad. In a post on X on Thursday, Khan asked supporters to converge on Dec. 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which is ruled by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. He demanded a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 25 protest march which he said killed at least 12 of his supporters and violence on May 9 last year which killed 8. All arrested political workers should also be released, he said. If these two demands are not met, a civil disobedience movement will start from December 14, and the government will be held responsible for any consequences, Khan said. The government denies any deaths during the Nov 25 protest march, and says that Khans supporters had attacked military installations on May 9 last year. Khan was indicted on Thursday on charges of directing the May 9 attacks, to which he pleaded not guilty. The indictment was the latest in dozens of cases against the 72-year-old former cricket star, who has been in jail since late last year. He and his party say the cases were made up to keep him out of politics at the behest of the military after he had fallen out with the armys generals ahead of his 2022 ouster. The army denies the accusation. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has issued an interim injunction order preventing the implementation of a Gazette notification issued by the previous government to increase the annual fee for liquor licenses. The three-judge bench, comprising Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe, and Priyantha Fernando, issued this order while granting leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by the Sri Lanka Liquor Licensees Association. The petition, which names the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and several others as respondents, argues that increasing the annual fee to Rs. 20 million, stipulated in the 20241 gazette notification, causes severe injustice to license holders and constitutes a violation of their fundamental rights. The petitioners requested the court to issue a directive to relevant authorities to revert to the fee structure back to the one outlined in the 2017 Gazette notification.",

        "date": "December 6, 2024 04:49 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy has seized approximately 45.5 kg of Kerala cannabis found adrift in the waters during a special operation conducted in the sea area near Delft Island, Jaffna. The operation was carried out by SLNS Wasabha of the Northern Naval Command, deploying an Inshore Patrol Craft, last night (05). During the operation, naval personnel discovered two suspicious polythene sacks drifting in the Delft sea area. Upon inspection, the sacks were found to contain approximately 45.5 kg of Kerala cannabis packed into 20 parcels, the Navy said. It is suspected that smugglers may have abandoned the consignment of Kerala cannabis due to the Navys persistent operations, which likely hindered their efforts to bring the contraband ashore, the Sri Lanka Navy said. The gross street value of the seized Kerala cannabis is estimated to be over Rs. 18 million. The haul of Kerala cannabis is currently in the custody of the Navy and will be handed over to the relevant authorities for legal proceedings, the Navy said.",

        "title": "Trump appoints former PayPal exec David Sacks as AI and crypto czar",
        "date": "December 6, 2024 05:26 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his White House A.I.  Crypto Czar, another step towards overhauling U.S. policy. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S., Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether czar was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trumps incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trumps tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, called the choice of Sacks a strong move in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, congrats to czar DavidSacks! Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails, Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters. Jang has co-invested with Sacks in both cryptocurrency and AI startups. He predicted that Sacks will prioritize regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed Californias unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump - who once labeled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke 100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think, Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the PayPal Mafia of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the worlds largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money, he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Police said the former state minister was arrested due to driving under the influence of alcohol. A Land Rover Defender driven by the former parliamentarian had collided with a car in the Kollupitiya area while he was driving under the influence of alcohol, police said. Lohan Ratwatte and his wife Shashi Prabha Ratwatte were granted bail yesterday (05) by the Nugegoda Magistrates Court, following their arrest over charges of using a luxury car illegally imported and assembled in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the court had ordered them released on a cash bail of Rs. 25,000 each and two personal bonds of Rs. 1 million each. The court also issued an overseas travel ban on Ratwatte. Police had found the luxury car in question during an inspection carried out based on information received by the police headquarters regarding a luxury car without number plates at a three-storied house in the Embuldeniya area in Mirihana, belonging to Shashi Prabha Ratwatte, the wife of former State Minister Lohan Ratwatte. During the investigation, both Ratwatte and his wife had explained to the police that his mother-in-law resides in the said house. They had claimed that the car had been brought there a while back by Ratwattes private secretary, who was recently found dead with gunshot injuries in the Katugastota area of Kandy.",

        "date": "December 6, 2024 07:42 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has submitted its electricity tariff revision proposal to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL). In its proposal, the CEB has stated that the existing tariffs will continue further for the next six months. Previously, it was proposed under the former government that electricity tariffs be revised four times annually. However, in 2023, tariff revisions were carried out three times, while two revisions were made this year. The current government has limited tariff revisions to twice a year. The proposal submitted today was expected to revise electricity tariffs for the first half of 2025, with implementation anticipated from the third week of January next year. Meanwhile, a tariff revision proposal set to take effect this December was submitted to the PUCSL in the month of October. This proposal included a reduction of approximately 6 in electricity tariffs. However, the PUCSL identified three major errors in the proposal and requested corrections with further tariff reductions. Initially, the CEB sought two weeks to address these issues, with the deadline extended to November 8. Upon further requests for extensions, the PUCSL granted additional time until November 22 and later extended the deadline to today. The PUCSL had warned the CEB in writing that if the proposal was not submitted today, the Commission would proceed with the tariff revision independently.

        "content": "Sarvajana Balaya Member of Parliament, Dilith Jayaweera emphasized the partys commitment to guiding the government on the right path over the next five years. Delivering his first parliamentary speech today (06), Jayaweera attributed the election results to widespread public frustration, the absence of viable alternatives, and growing disillusionment with political deceit. The political culture, coupled with the allegations of corruption surrounding it and the false images it perpetuates, has disheartened patriotic Sri Lankans who have historically supported the leftist political camp. The votes we received reflect that disappointment. Therefore, do not assume for a moment that we failed to engage with your manifesto, skipped your five lectures, or misunderstood your politics, he said. He further said that he suggested that the election results reflected the oppositions lack of effectiveness and expressed a willingness to offer sincere support, emphasizing a spirit of unity and collaboration. We want to see this government move on the right path for the next five years. That is what we are committed to. Therefore, the way this weak opposition acted is one of the reasons why the people had no option to cast their vote. They talked about the corruption taking place in this countrys politics. That is good. And they talked about the misdeeds that are happening. But even more than that, they said false things. They said false things about me as well. But you need to remember that this vote was cast based on a decision oscillating between those false facts and the true facts, and that was one of the reasons why the people made this decision, he added.",
