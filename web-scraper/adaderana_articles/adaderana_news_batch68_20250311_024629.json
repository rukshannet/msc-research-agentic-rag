        "date": "November 18, 2023 09:56 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricket icon Aravinda de Silva, who was inducted into the International Cricket Council (ICC) Hall of Fame, returned to the island early this morning (Nov.18). Three cricketing greats, namely Aravinda de Silva, Diana Edulji, and Virender Sehwag were added to the prestigious list of legends that comprise the ICC Hall of Fame, following a voting process conducted among existing Hall of Famers, media representatives, and senior executives from FICA and the ICC. The ICC Hall of Fame honours the greatest international cricketers throughout the long history of the sport, and the enduring legacies of de Silva, Edulji, and Sehwag joined as inductees number 110, 111, and 112 respectively. De Silva enjoyed a 19-year international career for Sri Lanka, notably playing a starring role in their memorable run to victory at the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in 1996. As part of this years celebrations, the Class of 2023 was inducted in a special on-field ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai during the first semi-final of the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023 on November 15.

        "title": "Second tranche of IMF loan expected in December  Nimal Siripala",
        "date": "November 18, 2023 10:24 am",
        "content": "The Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, says the disbursement of the second installment of the loan provided under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expected to be received in December. The lawmaker emphasized that the budget proposals outlined by President Ranil Wickremesinghe for the fiscal year 2024 mark the commencement of a comprehensive, long-term initiative aimed at the reconstruction of the national economy. Minister de Silva articulated this perspective during a press briefing convened at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (Nov.17), under the theme One Way to a Stable Country. In his extended remarks, the minister underscored the significance of the current budget, portraying it as the inception of a protracted initiative aimed at revitalizing the national economy, devoid of immediate profit considerations. He emphasized that the budget intricately lays out essential programs and policies for this purpose. While some may label it as an election-oriented budget, the Minister clarified that it is not formulated with anticipation of impending elections but rather as a strategic economic framework. Speaking further, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said: Had this budget been crafted with electoral considerations in mind, crucial development-related proposals and policies might have been neglected and the challenging decisions essential for economic stability might have been circumvented. The authorities could have resorted to inflationary measures such as printing more money or offering greater relief to the general populace. The recent economic crisis and accompanying public demonstrations have significantly eroded the political and social stability of the country. It is imperative to recognize that a nation lacking political and social stability stands at a disadvantage in terms of securing financial aid, credit facilities and investments. Unfortunately, the current administration has been ineffective in adequately addressing these challenges. Despite extending an invitation to the opposition party to assume responsibility for managing the situation, their acceptance of such responsibility has not materialized. During that critical period, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed the challenging responsibility and presented a clear policy direction. He underscored his commitment to implementing projects with a long-term nation-building focus, rather than pursuing short-term, popular initiatives. This approach, as mentioned earlier, may not immediately translate into widespread relief for the populace. However, the President has actively worked to alleviate the hardships faced by marginalized segments of the population. Simultaneously, a comprehensive national economic development program has been set in motion. This years budget has addressed various impediments that have historically hindered the countrys progress, thereby establishing a foundational framework to propel the nation towards sustainable development. While there may be assertions that the people have not tangibly benefited from the 2024 budget, it is crucial to note that significant concessions have indeed been extended to the public. These include salary increments for government employees, augmented allowances for the elderly and disabled, and provisions for education, health, regional development, and granting free land rights. It is imperative to recognize that funding these initiatives necessitates a robust revenue stream for the government. The budgetary allocations and concessions are designed to address the diverse needs of the populace while also ensuring the financial sustainability of these welfare programs. It is imperative to align income with expenditure, a foundational principle encapsulated within the concept of a budget. Governments routinely finance the expenses associated with relief programs by leveraging tax revenues collected from the populace. Maintaining equilibrium between expenditure and income is imperative. Under the current circumstances, augmenting relief efforts necessitates an increase in taxation. It is crucial for the public to comprehend this fiscal mechanism. Despite salary increments by Rs. 10,000, certain factions persist in rallying for additional raises, a stance that, when examined pragmatically, appears more aligned with anti-government sentiments. It is essential for the citizens of our nation to recognize the practical limitations associated with such demands. Critics assert that the preceding governments substantial tax concessions contributed to the economic downturn. Interestingly, this critique tacitly acknowledges the necessity of tax increases. However, when such measures are proposed, opposing sentiments are vocalized through raised slogans. This dichotomy underscores the existence of conflicting perspectives. It is crucial for the public to discern the complexities of this situation. We anticipate the disbursement of the second installment from the IMF by December. Beyond the financial inflow, the paramount significance lies in the trust instilled by other lenders through this transaction. This trust not only facilitates dealings with additional international financial institutions but also serves as a crucial avenue for engagement. It is noteworthy that upon the successful conclusion of our debt restructuring process, we are poised to resume all stalled development activities across the country. The ongoing process of restructuring financially unsustainable government institutions is in progress. Additionally, efforts are underway to reorganize institutions facing challenges in revenue collection. This includes initiatives to minimize corruption within entities such as the Customs, Excise Department, and Income Tax Department, transforming them into entities dedicated to the formal collection of funds for the government. Concurrently, the governments economic programs are advancing successfully. According to the Central Bank, the countrys reserves have reached US 3.5 billion as of today, indicating positive momentum in economic stability and financial management.",

        "date": "November 18, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of Australian students have walked out of class to attend School Strike 4 Climate rallies, backed by a sick note from climate doctors. Signed by three prominent scientists, it concludes: It is my recommendation that they take a sick day to protest for a sick planet. The students called for greater climate action, as the country faces another summer with natural disasters. However some state education officials said schools will not accept the note. Penned by Dr David Karoly, Dr Nick Abel and Dr Lesley Hughes, the letter was available online for students to download. It said they were unfit to attend school because of increased anxiety around government inaction, elevated stress due to the impact of climate change, and feelings of despair about their future. The note is not a formal medical certificate, and education departments in New South Wales and Victoria said it will not be accepted in their schools. The Minister for Education Jason Clare also said students should not be at the Friday strike. I want our kids to be passionate, I want our kids to care about democracy and I want our kids to care about the future, but I also want our kids at school, he said. But students who attended the protests, which were held across nine cities including Melbourne and Sydney, said the governments response demonstrated a failure to take their concerns seriously. They are throwing our future under the bus by approving new coal and gas projects in Australia, year 10 student Joey Thompson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Melbourne on Friday. In Sydney, protesters chanted shame outside the office of Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek. One 16-year-old, Min Park, told the Australian Associated Press she was striking because of Ms Pliberseks approval of new coal and gas projects. She is listening to the fossil fuel lobby instead of doing her job and taking responsibility to protect the health of the planet, she said. Australia has long faced international criticism for being slow to respond to the threat posed by climate change. While the Labour government led by Anthony Albanese promised greater action to halt climate change when elected in May 2022, experts say Australia is still not keeping pace with key allies like the US and the UK. A reform of environmental protection laws which would allow ministers a broader scope of reasons to deny fossil fuel projects is one of the key changes climate experts say Australia needs to make. Originating in Sweden, School Strike 4 Climate is an international movement of students who skip classes on Friday to press for political action on climate change. The Friday rallies are the 11th held in Australia. The largest, in 2019, attracted an estimated 300,000 people across the country. They come after former diplomat and public servant Gregory Andrews was forced to end a hunger strike outside Parliament House in Canberra. Mr Andrews had refused to eat until the government declared a climate emergency, but was taken away by an ambulance on Friday morning. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Israeli forces gave doctors, patients and displaced people at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza one hour to evacuate the medical compound on Saturday, causing a great state of panic and fear, Al Jazeeras Youmna ElSayed reported. A medical source in al-Shifa told Al Jazeera it was impossible to evacuate as the facility, which has been bombarded and besieged by Israeli troops for days, houses about 7,000 people, including patients who are in critical condition. They do not have any ambulances to transfer the patients and premature babies to the south of Gaza, said ElSayed, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. This is what he the source called a crisis, to ask them to evacuate in one hour. Those in al-Shifa include at least 300 patients, some or most of them in serious or critical condition, as well as thousands of displaced families. It also includes at least 35 premature babies who already for eight days now have been out of their incubators because of the lack of oxygen and the lack of electricity, ElSayed said. There were 39 babies who had been left without incubators; four died late on Friday and five are severely ill now, our correspondent added. There is no transportation means in Gaza City and the northern parts because of a lack of fuel. So people are expected to evacuate on foot. And doctors are telling us its impossible to evacuate with this many people on foot. After the Israeli deadline passed, and ElSayed said doctors have told the Israeli army that they will not evacuate and abandon their patients, and none of the displaced families inside the hospital have so far left. She said the medical professionals have said as long as the Israeli army does not provide ambulances to transport these patients out of al-Shifa, there will be no evacuation made by patients or doctors who will not leave their patients behind and added that the Israeli army has not responded to the doctors. The Israeli army instructed people to evacuate through al-Rashid street, not the usual street or route that people evacuating to the south are supposed to take, they usually take Salah al-Din street, ElSayed said. The Israeli army has not provided them with any other solutions, with any means of transportation, with any fuel for ambulances or for any cars to transfer those patients, premature babies, displaced families to the south as they were ordered to do, she added. The hospital has been without food, water, electricity and oxygen for at least a week, while Israeli troops and tanks raided the facility over the last couple of days. Israel claimed Hamas has a command centre underneath the hospital, but found no evidence to support its claim. Hamas and hospital staff have always rejected the Israeli assertions.

Accordingly, the CBSL, in its Friday statement, emphasized that both Dr. Jayamaha and Mr. Jayawardena had submitted their resignations well before the Supreme Court delivered its final judgment in respect of the fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed on the economic crisis. The Governing Body was established, in terms of the provisions of the CBSL Act, No.16 of 2023, as the responsible body to oversee the administration and manage the affairs and determine the general policies of CBSL. In terms of the law, the appointed members of the previously existing Monetary Board continued to serve as the members of Governing Board. Accordingly, Sanjeeva Jayawardena P.C. and A.N. Fonseka, who were appointed members of Monetary Board on 29 June 2021 and 27 July 2022, respectively, continued to serve as the members of Governing Board. However, Dr. Ranee Jayamaha who was a member of Monetary Board since 29 July 2020 had resigned from the Monetary Board with effect from 12 September 2023, and therefore was not a member of Governing Board. Jayawardena PC, appointed member who continued as a member of Governing Board had tendered his resignation with effect from 05 November 2023.",

        "title": "ChatGPT maker OpenAI ousts CEO Sam Altman",
        "date": "November 18, 2023 05:15 pm",
        "content": "The board of the company behind ChatGPT on Friday fired OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - to many, the human face of generative AI - sending shock waves across the tech industry. OpenAIs Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati will serve as interim CEO, the company said, adding that it will conduct a formal search for a permanent CEO. Altmans departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities, OpenAI said in the blog without elaborating. Greg Brockman, OpenAI president and co-founder, who stepped down from the board as chairman as part of the management shuffle, quit the company, he announced on messaging platform X late on Friday. Based on todays news, i quit, he wrote. The departures blindsided many employees who discovered the abrupt management change from an internal message and the companys public facing blog. It came as a surprise to Altman and Brockman as well, who learned the boards decision within minutes of the announcement, Brockman said. We too are still trying to figure out exactly what happened, he posted on X, formerly Twitter, adding, We will be fine. Greater things coming soon. The now four-person board consists of three independent directors holding no equity in OpenAI and its Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. The organization did not immediately answer a request for comment on Brockmans claims. Backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft (MSFT.O), which does not have a board seat in the non-profit governing the startup, OpenAI kicked off the generative AI craze last November by releasing ChatGPT. The chatbot became one of the worlds fastest-growing software applications. Trained on reams of data, generative AI can create human-like content, helping users spin up term papers, complete science homework and even write entire novels. After ChatGPTs launch, regulators scrambled to catch up: the European Union revised its AI Act and the U.S. kicked off AI regulation efforts. Altman, who ran Y Combinator, is a serial entrepreneur and investor. He was the face of OpenAI and the wildly popular generative AI technology as he toured the world this year. Altman posted on X shortly after OpenAI published its blog: i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about whats next later. Altman did not respond to requests for comment. Murati, who has worked for Tesla, joined OpenAI in 2018 and later became chief technology officer. She oversaw product launches including that of ChatGPT. At an emergency all-hands meeting on Friday afternoon after the announcement, Murati sought to calm employees and said OpenAIs partnership with Microsoft is stable and its backers executives, including CEO Satya Nadella, continue to express confidence in the startup, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Information previously reported details of the meeting. Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers, a spokesperson for the software maker told Reuters on Friday. In a statement published on Microsofts website, Nadella said: We have a long-term agreement with OpenAI... Together, we will continue to deliver the meaningful benefits of this technology to the world. EARTHQUAKE The shakeup is not the first at OpenAI, launched in 2015. Tesla CEO Elon Musk once was its co-chair, and in 2020 other executives departed, going on to found competitor Anthropic, which has claimed it has a greater focus on AI safety. Well wishers and critics piled onto digital forums as news of the latest shuffle spread. On X, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt called Altman a hero of mine, adding, He built a company from nothing to 90 Billion in value, and changed our collective world forever. I cant wait to see what he does next. I, and billions of people, will benefit from his future work- its going to be simply incredible. This is a shocker and Altman was a key ingredient in the recipe for success of OpenAI, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. That said, we believe Microsoft and Nadella will exert more control at OpenAI going forward with Altman gone. The full impact of the OpenAI surprise will unfold over time, but its fundraising prospects were an immediate concern. Altman was considered a master fundraiser who managed to negotiate billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft as well as having led the companys tender offer transactions this year that fueled OpenAIs valuation from 29 billion to over 80 billion. In the short term it will impair OpenAIs ability to raise more capital. In the intermediate term it will be a non-issue, said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital. Other analysts said Altmans departure, while disruptive, would not derail generative AIs popularity or OpenAI or Microsofts competitive advantage. The innovation created by OpenAI is bigger than any one or two people, and there is no reason to think this would cause OpenAI to cede its leadership position, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. If nothing else, Microsofts stake and significant interest in OpenAIs progress ensure the appropriate leadership changes are being implemented. As late as Thursday evening, Altman showed no signs of concern at two public events. He joined colleagues in a panel on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in San Francisco, describing his commitment and vision for AI. Later he spoke at a Burning Man-related event in Oakland, California, engaging in an hour-long conversation on the topic of art and AI. Altman seemed relaxed and gave no indication anything was wrong, but left right after his talk was over at 7:30 p.m. The event organizer said at the event that Altman had another meeting to attend.

        "content": "The life and work of stuntman David Holmes who was left paralysed after an accident in 2009 on the set of Harry Potter has been turned into a documentary, which he said was cathartic to make but cannot yet watch. David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived, which premiered in London on Thursday, features archive footage of Holmes working as actor Daniel Radcliffes stunt double as well as scenes of his life today and interviews with his former colleagues and friends, including Radcliffe. Its been really nice for my boys to get together and talk about it. We are living in a society where men dont really talk. So Im really chuffed, Holmes said. A skilled gymnast, Holmes was a teenager when he was chosen to work on the Potter franchise. But a rehearsal for a stunt in which Holmes was pulled back on a harness during a fight scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One went wrong and he broke his neck. It just happened so quickly. It didnt look real. We just thought, this cant be happening, said Marc Mailley, a fellow stunt artist who was there at the time. You can either be a victim or a survivor. I choose to be a survivor, said Holmes, whose challenging medical journey is seen in the new film. Directed by former Harry Potter crew member Dan Hartley, the film is executive produced by Daniel Radcliffe. Hes one of my best friends, Holmes said, explaining how proud he is of Radcliffe, who has continued acting and is starring in on Broadway in the musical Merrily We Roll Along. Holmes hopes his raw documentary might start conversations about stunt performers work and what it is like to be disabled. I am lucky and fortunate enough to be able to live with a broken neck and project past my injury. There are a million people that feel lost and forgotten about in society, he said.

The President, who held discussions with the new Maldivian President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu, yesterday (17), expressed a desire for closer collaboration between Sri Lanka and the Maldives, envisioning a unified Tourist area. The president highlighted the economic shift towards Asia, emphasizing the need for South Asian nations to work together to harness the growing economic power in the region. While acknowledging the individualistic nature of South Asian countries, he proposed a model where selective integration in certain sectors could pave the way for effective collaboration. Turning the spotlight on Sri Lankas economic plans, the President unveiled a series of proposals focused on restructuring and modernization. The key objectives include establishing a competitive economy, embracing digital transformation, energy transition and fostering a green economy. The president emphasized the importance of becoming a regional logistic hub and outlined plans for promoting upmarket tourism, modernizing agriculture and introducing reforms in land ownership.

        "date": "November 18, 2023 09:58 pm",
        "content": "The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) was recently questioned by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) whether the government is properly receiving the Value Added Tax (VAT) paid by the public for various goods, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. At present, about 13,000 institutions have registered for VAT. The IRD officials said that they are investigating the payment of VAT to the government by those institutions. The committee pointed out that the institutions that collect VAT from the public should prepare a system to receive the taxes correctly to the government. This was discussed when the COPA members met in Parliament earlier this week under the chairmanship of State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna to examine the Auditor Generals reports and current performance of the IRD for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, the statement mentioned. The committee chairman asked the officials whether there is a possibility to take over and maintain the RAMIS computer system in the IRD itself. However, the departments officials informed the COPA that they cannot take over and maintain the system due to the lack of proper human resources. It was revealed at the committee meeting that 6 institutions have already been connected to the RAMIS computer system and that the Department of the Registrar of Companies is experiencing delays in getting connected to the RAMIS system due to some technical reason. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the Department of the Registrar of Companies immediately upgrade their system and connect with the RAMIS system. The COPA members also called for a report on its progress before January 01, 2023. The COPA chairman also instructed to provide a comprehensive report on the tax levied under several classifications as well as a complete report on the arrears of Rs. 943 billion to be collected to the committee, it said. The committee also asked the officials about the registration of new taxpayers. According to the officials, about 198,253 new taxpayers have been registered so far in 2023. The IRD officials further commented that it has been identified that there are about 16 million citizens over the age of 18 and special programs are being implemented to include them in the tax payment process. State Ministers Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva, Prasanna Ranaweera, Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Diana Gamage, Members of Parliament Tissa Attanayake, A. L. M. Ataullah, Ashok Abeysinghe, Manjula Dissanayake, Weerasumana Weerasinghe and a group of government officials were present at this meeting, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "date": "November 18, 2023 10:34 pm",
        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegayas (SJB) has drawn attention to bringing up a no-confidence motion against the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) Prof. Ranjith Bandara. SJB Parliamentarian Lakshman Kiriella stated that discussions pertaining to the matter are currently in progress. COPE chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara came under fire for his conduct at the latest committee meeting, for which the officials of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were summoned. This prompted Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to announce on Friday (17) the suspension of COPE meetings until further notice. The Speaker revealed this in response to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa during Day 4 of the ongoing debate on the Second Reading of 2024 Appropriation Bill (78th Budget Speech) regarding the presence of Prof. Bandaras son, Kanishka Bandara at the said COPE meeting, which had also become a controversy. However, the COPE chairman defended his actions in a clarification issued, saying that his son serves as his coordinating secretary. Prof. Bandara said his son was permitted to attend the meeting by the assistant sergeant-at-arms at his request. However, the Speaker told the parliament on Thursday (Nov.16) that an investigation would be conducted into the matter. In addition, the COPE chairman also found himself in hot water after the Opposition Leader revealed some documents in parliament, evidencing that Prof. Bandara served as a consultant for SLC on the Kandy Cricket Campus project, apart from another consultancy firm owned by him which provides services to the cricket body. The Opposition Leader hit out at Prof. Bandara for not disclosing his connection to SLC beforehand and continuing to act as the COPE chairman despite this possible conflict of interest. In a clarification, the SLC said Prof. Bandara does not have any connections to the current administration of the cricket body as his services were obtained from 2017 to 2018 when Thilanga Sumathipala was in office as the SLC president. In the wake of the controversy concerning his hand gesture made during the COPE meeting with SLC officials, Prof. Bandara explained that this was just a tactical maneuver to manage a challenging situation as multiple participants were trying to speak simultaneously.",

Meanwhile, the countrys cricket governing body expressed that with the appointment of Roshan Ranasinghe as the Minister of Sports, SLC has been experiencing continuous undue interferences by the Minister in its governance and operational matters. The interferences by the Minister did make it difficult for SLC to manage its day to-day affairs as envisaged in the said article, compelling the SLC to bring such interferences to the attention of ICC as SLC could not honour its obligations to comply with the said requirements envisaged in the article 2.4(D) of the ICC Articles, SLC claimed further. Furthermore, the statement highlights that in response to the action of the Minister the ICC had explicitly and categorically stated that it would not recognize any interim committees appointed by the Minister and the ICC would only recognize the duly elected office bearers of SLC as their point of contact as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. Therefore the suspension of SLC was a result of continues interferences by the Minister despite numerous warnings resulting in SLC not being able to adhere to article 2.4D in violation of said article and as stated it is quite evident that it was not a result of SLCs communication which was misquoted andor misapprehended by the Leader of SJB in the Parliament, it said. SLC sympathizes with those who may not fully understand the intricacies of how sports associations affiliated with international bodies such as ICC function, the statement added, mentioning that we sincerely request anyone who wants to be critical of SLC to diligently intelligently consider the facts prior to disseminating baseless accusations and statements lacking merit. Speaking during the parliamentary session on Saturday (18), Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa revealed details of a letter said to have been sent by the Chairman of SLC, Shammi Silva to the ICC on political interference in Sri Lankas cricket. Premadasa claimed that the letter, copies of which have been sent to the cricket administration bodies of 12 countries including the Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Jay Shah, has pointed out 05 matters pertaining to the challenges faced by Sri Lanka cricket due to the governments interference.

        "date": "November 19, 2023 11:54 am",
        "content": "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe claims that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to suspend Sri Lanka from international cricket. Ranasinghe made this accusation while quoting a letter allegedly sent by SLC to the ICC on 07 November 2023, during a media briefing which is currently being held in Colombo. Facts have been confirmed that the SLC President and the Executive Board has misled the ICC, the minister said. Meanwhile, the minister quoting a letter said to have been sent by the SLC President to the ICC on November 06, 2023 said the second paragraph of this letter mentions that: Sri Lanka Cricket has yet to be informed of its suspension or the cancellation of its registration as a national sports association and our only intimidation of this news, is through the media. We have no advanced notice on this decision, nor were we afforded the hearing prior to it being made public. Next thing is that, the SLC has clearly misled the ICC regarding the international suspensions imposed on Sri Lanka Rugby and Sri Lanka Football pretending that those were arbitrary decisions taken by me, he alleged. I would like to mention this as the first letter of betrayal of the country, the minister said. He also quoted another letter which is also claimed that the SLC President sent to the ICC dated 07 November 20203, emphasized this is the letter of treason. It says like this: Minister of Sports in Sri Lanka that in the event Interim Committee is appointed to carry out the functions of SLC that ICC would be compelled to suspend the Sri Lanka Cricket board with immediate effect. In addition, it is also imperative to inform that Hon. Minister that the following events that are scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka have to be shifted to other countries including the Under 19 World Cup to be played in January 2024. However, issuing a statement today SLC refuted the recent allegations made in the Parliament regarding the communication between the SLC and the International Cricket Council (ICC). Sri Lankas cricket governing body alleged it is evident that there is a misapprehension and misinterpretation of the contents of the letter under reference, and that the SLC is compelled to clarify its position on the said matter. SLC, as a Full Member of the ICC, is duty-bound and obliged to adhere to the member obligations envisaged in the articles of association of the ICC. In doing so SLC is further obliged to keep the ICC informed of any difficulty andor difficulties of adhering to such obligations. With the appointment of Mr Roshan Ranasinghe as the Hon. Minister of Sports, SLC has been experiencing continuous undue interferences by the Hon. Minister in its governance and operational matters. The interferences by the Hon. Minister did make it difficult for SLC to manage its day-to-day affairs as envisaged in the said article, compelling the SLC to bring such interferences to the attention of ICC as SLC could not honour its obligations to comply with the said requirements envisaged in the article 2.4(D) of the ICC Articles, the statement mentioned.",

        "date": "November 19, 2023 09:45 pm",
        "content": "Australia produced a magnificent performance to beat India in the final to win the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023. The majority of a packed and partisan crowd arrived at the Narendra Modi Stadium hoping to see the host nation end their decade-long wait for a major ICC trophy win. But it was Australia who delivered on the day. The Australian bowling attack combined to turn the screw after a fast-paced powerplay, bowling India out for 240. And Travis Head was the star with the bat, hitting an inspired century to win Australias men their sixth ICC Cricket World Cup crown. Victory for Australia is a crowning moment in what has been a phenomenal year for Pat Cummins side across formats, adding to their win over India in the World Test Championship final in June and their subsequent retention of the Ashes. Tasked with a target of 241 to win the World Cup, Australia got off to a fast but shaky start in the face of a new-ball assault from Indias seam attack. David Warner (7), Mitchell Marsh (15) and Steven Smith (4) all departed cheaply as Australia slipped to 473 inside the opening seven overs, with Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah taking the wickets. But a superb partnership between Head and Marnus Labuschagne won it for Australia, with Head hitting a stunning century and Labuschagne playing the foil at the other end, bedding in with a resolute half-century of his own. Head was caught in the deep with just one run needed to win the game, departing to a standing ovation from his teammates having scored 137 from 120 runs. And Glenn Maxwell scored the winning runs as Australia claimed victory with six wickets and seven overs to spare. Earlier, Australia skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and chose to bowl first in Ahmedabad in-front of a packed crowd. But it was India who got off to a flier, inspired once more by captain Rohit Sharma. The early loss of Shubman Gill didnt halt Indias attacking momentum, as Rohit and Virat Kohli racked up the runs in the first ten overs, with 80 runs coming in the first powerplay, equalling the record for a mens Cricket World Cup final. However, the departure of the skipper for 47 from 31 balls was followed by Shreyas Iyer for 4 in the very next over, and the match took an abrupt turn from that moment on, as the runs dried up through the middle overs. Looking to rebuild in the face of some excellent bowling on a tricky surface, Kohli and KL Rahul bedded in, ensuring India reached at least a competitive total. Wickets fell frequently as Australias bowling attack looked to press home their advantage, and the final Indian wicket came off the last ball of the innings, with the total at just 240. Pat Cummins 234 from ten overs summed up the effort from the Aussie pacers, with Mitchell Starc taking 355 and Josh Hazlewood 260. Adam Zampa provided good control through the middle, finishing with 144, while Glenn Maxwells 135 from six overs included the crucial wicket of Rohit. The innings fell into two distinct sections. Nine fours and three sixes were struck in the first powerplay as India reached 802. But in the following 240 balls of the innings, there were no further sixes, only four boundaries and just seven twos  with all other runs coming in singles. Final: India 240 (50 overs) v Australia The second innings got off to a frenetic start, with David Warner edging the first ball through the slip cordon and scoring 15 runs in a thrilling first over. And the drama built yet further when Mohammed Shami, handed the new ball over Mohammed Siraj, removed Warner in a bizarre second over. Six wides a bye and a leg bye came in Shamis over as the ball swung all over the place, with Warner wafting at one arcing away-swinger to edge to slip. An energised crowd roared on as India pressed hard for more powerplay wickets to boost their chances of defending 240 all out. And Bumrah stood up when his team needed him bagging his teams second, removing the dangerous Mitchell Marsh for a run-a-ball 15, and then dismissing Steve Smith for 4. With three of the top four back in the hutch with the score at 473, India had pulled themselves right back into the contest. But Australia rebuilt as Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne bedded in to lift their side. Head led the charge as Labuschagne laid anchor at the other end, with the opener bringing up a fine fifty. The pairs century stand left Australia in pole position to win the match, with wickets in hand and plenty of overs to spare, and Heads phenomenal century was greeted by complete silence by a shellshocked crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Australias bowlers light up Ahmedabad Rohit Sharma began in his characteristic aggressive fashion, unleashing a brace of fours in the very second over, and then hitting a six and four in the fourth. Even as Josh Hazlewood was under the pump, his partner Mitchell Starc managed to strike in the fifth over. A mistimed front foot pull brought the end of Shubman Gill for four. The flow of runs didnt stop as Virat Kohli set his eye in early, and hit a hat-trick of fours against Starc. However, Indias aggressive run was halted once more towards the end of the first Powerplay. Rohit mistimed a shot towards the off-side and Travis Head ran back from the covers and held on to an absolute stunner. Soon after the first Powerplay, the aggressive Shreyas Iyer also fell for a paltry score, nicking one behind the wicket. The boundaries dried up as India tried to re-settle after the early blows. They went at close to three runs an over between 11-15. Kohli and KL Rahul continued the restructuring of Indias innings. Pat Cummins kept ringing in the changes amongst his bowlers to get a breakthrough, however, India managed to get to the mid-innings mark without another loss. On the back of Kohlis fifth successive fifty in the Cricket World Cup, India seemed to be picking up pace. However, Cummins struck once more for Australia, employing a short ball against the batter, who ended up playing on. This setback pushed India into defensive mode once more. Ravindra Jadeja, sent in at no. 6 ahead of Suryakumar Yadav to get the left-right combination going, was happy to knock the ball around the park along with Rahul. The latter reached his fifty in the 35th over mark. As the ball started to reverse swing, Australias pacers found greater help from the wicket. Josh Hazlewood struck in the 36th over, getting Jadeja to nick one behind the wicket. India eventually reached their 200 in the 41st over. The team needed a push to get them to a solid total. But wickets kept on falling, and Jasprit Bumrah was next to depart, trapped in-front by Adam Zampa, who finished with 144 from his ten overs. And the silence was deafening from the crowd when Hazlewood picked up the key wicket of Suryakumar Yadav, who had bided his time until the last three overs before look to go big, only to top edge one to the keeper. The final-wicket pair looked to boost India in the death overs, and they took their team to 240 when Kuldeep Yadav was run out coming back for a second off the final ball of the innings.

        "title": "Fiery right-wing populist Javier Milei wins Argentinas presidency",
        "date": "November 20, 2023 07:43 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Populist Javier Milei won Argentinas presidential election Sunday, swinging the country to the right following a fiercely polarized campaign in which he promised a dramatic shake-up to the state to deal with soaring inflation and rising poverty. With 97.6 of votes tallied in Sundays presidential runoff vote, Milei had 55.8 and Economy Minister Sergio Massa 44.2, according to Argentinas electoral authority. Presuming that margin holds, it would the widest since Argentinas return of democracy in 1983. In the streets of Buenos Aires, drivers honked their horns and many took to the streets to celebrate in several neighborhoods. Outside Mileis party headquarters, a hotel in downtown Buenos Aires, supporters were euphoric. In his victory speech, the self-described anarcho-capitalist who has been compared to former U.S. President Donald Trump said the reconstruction of Argentina begins today. Argentinas situation is critical. The changes our country needs are drastic. There is no room for gradualism, no room for lukewarm measures, Milei told supporters who chanted liberty, liberty, and let them all leave in a reference to the countrys political class. Massa of the ruling Peronist party had already conceded defeat, saying Argentines chose another path. Starting tomorrow ... guaranteeing the political, social and economic functions is the responsibility of the new president. I hope he does, Massa said. With a Milei victory, the country will shift rightward and a freshman lawmaker who got his start as a television talking head blasting what he called the political caste will assume the presidency. Inflation has soared above 140 and poverty has worsened while Massa has held his post. Milei has proposed to slash the size of the state and rein in inflation, while the government minister he was running against warned people about the negative impacts of such policies. This is a triumph that is less due to Milei and his peculiarities and particularities and more to the demand for change, said Lucas Romero, the head of Synopsis, a local political consulting firm. What is being expressed at the polls is the weariness, the fatigue, the protest vote of the majority of Argentines. Massas campaign cautioned Argentines that his libertarian opponents plan to eliminate key ministries and otherwise sharply curtail the state would threaten public services, including health and education, and welfare programs many rely on. Massa also drew attention to his opponents often aggressive rhetoric and openly questioned his mental acuity; ahead of the first round, Milei sometimes carried a revving chainsaw at rallies. There were lot of voters that werent convinced to vote Milei, who would vote no or blank. But come the day of the vote, they voted for Milei because theyre all pissed off, Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel, said by phone. Everyone talked about the fear of Milei winning. I think this was a fear of Massa winning and economy continuing the way it is, inflation and all that. Milei accused Massa and his allies of running a campaign of fear and he walked back some of his most controversial proposals, such as loosening gun control. In his final campaign ad, Milei looks at the camera and assures voters he has no plans to privatize education or health care. Mileis screeds resonated widely with Argentines angered by their struggle to make ends meet, particularly young men. Money covers less and less each day. Im a qualified individual, and my salary isnt enough for anything, Esteban Medina, a 26-year-old physical therapist from Ezeiza, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a Milei rally earlier this week. Another of Mileis supporters is María Gabriela Gaviola, a 63-year-old entrepreneur doing everything she can to avoid shuttering her company, which manufactures veterinary products, amid surging prices for materials. And the government hasnt helped, including Massa who has held his ministerial post for over a year. The productive sector of this country isnt considered. How long can a country that doesnt produce be OK? said Gaviola, who has taken on two side jobs to keep her company afloat. Truth is, I dont know Milei. Ive heard him a bit. I dont know him, but the one who I already know doesnt help me. I prefer to try something new. Most pre-election polls, which have been notoriously wrong at every step of this years campaign, showed a statistical tie between the two candidates or Milei slightly ahead. Underscoring the bitter division this campaign has brought to the fore, Milei received both jeers and cheers on Friday night at the legendary Colón Theater in Buenos Aires. The acrimony was also evident Sunday when Mileis running mate, Victoria Villaruel, went to vote and was met by protesters angry at her claims that the number of victims from Argentinas bloody 1976-1983 military dictatorship is far below what human rights organizations have long claimed, among other controversial positions. The vote took place amid Mileis allegations of possible electoral fraud, reminiscent of those from Trump and former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Without providing evidence, Milei claimed that the first round of the presidential election was plagued by irregularities that affected the result. Experts say such irregularities cannot swing an election, and that his assertions were partly aimed at firing up his base and motivating his supporters to become monitors of voting stations. Hope shines again in South America, Bolsonaro wrote on X, formerly Twitter. May these good winds reach the United States and Brazil so honesty, progress and liberty return to us all.

        "date": "November 20, 2023 11:48 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) says it unequivocally rejects the baseless and malicious allegations made by the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe, during a media conference held yesterday (19). The SLC further said that it never sought its suspension from the International Cricket Council (ICC). Speaking during the press briefing, Ranasinghe had claimed that SLC forced the ICC to suspend Sri Lanka from international cricket while quoting a letter allegedly sent by SLC to the ICC on 07 November 2023. Facts have been confirmed that the SLC President and the Executive Board has misled the ICC, the minister told reporters on Sunday (19). However, issuing a statement this morning (20), the cricket governing body asserts that the ministers statements were tainted with malice and appeared to be orchestrated to instigate the public, creating undue influence on pending and emerging matters related to the affairs of SLC. Furthermore, the statement mentioned that: The SLC notes with concern that Mr. Ranasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Sports, seems to lack a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies surrounding the affairs of the Parent Body and its affiliated members. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the President of SLC, as a director of the ICC (International Cricket Council) Board of Directors, is duty bound to respect and further the objectives outlined in clause 5 of the Memorandum of Association of the ICC. It is imperative to clarify that each ICC Director, including the President of SLC, has an obligation to apprise the status of SLC affairs when there are reasons to believe that impending actions by the Minister of Sports may jeopardize the fulfillment of obligations set out in the ICCs Articles of Association. Meanwhile, SLC emphasizes in the statement that it has consistently acted in the best interest of the cricket administration in Sri Lanka, striving to address issues through constructive dialogue. Regrettably, these endeavors proved futile, given the continuous and unfounded criticism by the Minister of Sports, aiming to wield unwarranted influence over SLC through the misuse of authority, it added. It is noteworthy to mention that despite lacking any vested authority, the Minister of Sports has taken the unprecedented step of communicating with the ICC and its full members, making false claims that SLC officials were involved in corruption and malpractices based on a Special Audit report, it said, adding that however, it is crucial to emphasize that the said audit report did not reveal any corrupt conduct or malpractice, and the ICC and its Members were well aware of the groundlessness of these allegations. Moreover, SLC believes that the Ministers continuous appeal to the general public and repeated false allegations of corrupt conduct and malpractice by SLC officials appear to be driven by political motives, aimed at enhancing his public image, the statement added.",

Accordingly, the Director of the Medical Supplies Division Dr. Kapila Wickremenayake, Assistant Director Devashantha Soloman, Accountant (Supplies) Neran Dhananjaya and the Stock Controller of the Medical Supplies Division Sujith Kumara were arrested in relation to the incident, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa said. In October, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) had said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), allegedly imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure, was suspended from use while revealing that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which had later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier by the name Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having to do anything with this fraudulent activity and has communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. It was found that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated through the unlawful importation of a batch of 22,500 vials of IVIG. The local medicines regulator recently said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients being treated at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. Nevertheless, the Academy of Health Professionals on November 05, accused that information was revealed that the relevant batch of vials were suspected to have been manufactured within the country itself, while alleging that blood required for the production of the substandard immunoglobulin vials were obtained from the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS).",

Accordingly, the Presidents Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe before the court mentioned that no future actions will be taken regarding the gazette notification issued by the minister until the next court date. The relevant petition was taken up before the new panel of Appellate Court Judges named by the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne as the previous bench recused themselves from hearing the relevant case. The new bench was comprised of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D. N. Samarkoon, as per the decision made by the President of the Court of Appeal. On 07 November, the Court of Appeal issued a 14-day stay order, preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed SLC and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, the court has issued three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board. Subsequently, on 13 November, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the operation of the 7-member Interim Committee appointed by him for the SLC and the relevant gazette notification published in this regard. The motion including the objections related to the relevant stay order, has been filed before the Appeals Court through Attorney-at-Law G.G. Arulpragasam. A seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe on 06 November, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga.

        "title": "Rising gold-backed loans elevate risks for Sri Lankan finance companies - Fitch",
        "date": "November 20, 2023 03:23 pm",
        "content": "Rising gold-backed lending among Sri Lankas finance and leasing companies (FLC) sector is exposing financiers to higher collateral price risk and making them more susceptible to any adverse movements in gold prices, says Fitch Ratings. Sri Lankan FLCs have grown gold-backed loans rapidly in the past several years amid shrinking demand for their core vehicle-financing business. Gold-backed loan balances more than quadrupled between the financial year ending March 2019 (FYE19) and FYE23, raising its share in the sectors gross loans to 18, from 4 at end-FY19. We believe several factors have fuelled this trend, including rising demand for shorter-term financing from borrowers, relatively high product yields, and the liquid nature of gold collaterals that allows lenders to recover defaulted facilities through regular auctions. FLCs cut back their exposure to gold-backed lending in 1QFY24, but we view this as temporary, as it stemmed partly from a drop in local gold prices in 1QFY24 following the global price decline, exacerbated by Sri Lankan rupee appreciation during the period. Excess concentration in gold-backed loans could leave some FLCs prone to large tail risks of devaluations, especially if collateral haircuts are insufficient to protect them from any sudden and precipitous price fall, the rating agency said. This was evident in 2012 and 2013 when sharp declines in gold prices drove an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) and credit costs at many Sri Lankan banks and non-bank financial institutions. Extended loan tenors would leave lenders more exposed to sustained price corrections. Rising competition among the FLCs has led to an uptick in average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. They range between 70 and 80 currently but could deteriorate quickly if gold prices fall or borrowers start to default, adding to accrued interest. Gold-backed lending is not subject to any regulatory LTV cap in Sri Lanka, unlike in markets such as India. The current regulatory capital framework also entices FLCs to build larger gold loan portfolios more quickly than they otherwise would have. It may also cause lenders to underestimate their risk levels and reserve insufficient capital to absorb potential shocks. For instance, gold loans with LTV ratios of up to 70 do not incur any risk weight, and only incremental exposure over the 70 threshold is 100 risk-weighted. This contrasts with India, for example, where gold loans incur the standard 100 risk weight. The drop in local prices in 1QFY24 led to an increase in the risk-weighted share of gold loans to 13, from 8 in FY23, but we expect this to have mostly reversed in subsequent months as gold prices recovered. Sri Lankan FLCs do not factor in borrowers repayment capacity when underwriting a gold-backed loan, focusing solely on collateral value, like in other markets. Collateral risk mitigation therefore becomes more crucial to protect against losses. However, valuation of gold collaterals is at lenders discretion and subject to their own calculation methodologies. The purity of accepted collateral can also vary. This contrasts with markets such as India, where regulators stipulate methods for collateral valuation. The NPL ratio from Sri Lankan FLCs gold-backed lending remains well below that of conventional lending products, due mostly to lenders ability to recover overdues through frequent gold auctions, and borrowers ability to roll over a facility upon maturity by only servicing interest. However, ratios have come under pressure amid the challenging operating environment and borrowers weakened repayment capacities. Among Sri Lankan FLCs rated by Fitch based on standalone strength, the 90 day past-due ratio on gold loans jumped to 5.3 at end-1QFY24, from 1.9 at end-FY22. This is consistent with rising auction volumes, indicating growing defaults in the segment. --Fitch--",

Foxtron shares did recover some ground from earlier losses of as much as 9, ending down 2.7 which gave it a market capitalisation of around 2.7 billion. In addition to inflation and higher interest rates which have raised the cost of buying a car, EV makers are grappling with supply-chain bottlenecks and pricing pressure. The EV market has been flooded by a red sea of price cuts by major players such as Tesla, said an analyst at Mega International Securities, who asked not to be named, citing the firms policies on commenting publicly on listed companies. Foxtron has lost money in 2021 and 2022, and we dont think it will turn that around in the next two years. Foxtron is a joint venture between Foxconn - the worlds largest contract manufacturer for iPhones and other consumer electronics - and local car maker Yulon. It currently has only one client, Luxgen, which is owned by Yulon. Young Liu, chairman of both Foxtron and Foxconn, said, however, the company has a clear strategy for growth. Foxtron will build its foundation in Taiwan, leveraging our own design and service momentum in EV, as well as Foxconns proven business models to guide our entry into the North America, Southeast Asia mainstream markets. The company raised T7.5 billion (235 million) in its initial public offering. Separately, Liu declined to comment on what contingency plans Foxconn has should founder Terry Gou finalise his run for Taiwans president by registering with the election commission, which he has until Friday to do so. China last month announced a tax probe into Foxconn - a move which the Chinese newspaper that revealed the investigation attributed to Beijings unhappiness with Gous decision to run for president.

        "date": "November 20, 2023 04:58 pm",
        "content": "A rare bottle of whisky has been sold for 2.7m (2.1m) - breaking the record for the most expensive wine or spirit sold at auction. The Macallan 1926 single malt is one of the worlds most sought-after bottles of Scotch whisky. It was sold by Sothebys on Saturday, at more than double its estimated price. The auction houses head of whisky said he had been allowed to taste a tiny drop of it beforehand. Its very rich, its got a lot of dried fruit as you would expect, a lot of spice, a lot of wood, Jonny Fowle told the AFP news agency. The whisky spent 60 years maturing in dark oak sherry casks before becoming one of just 40 bottled in 1986. The 40 bottles were reportedly not made available for purchase - instead, some were offered to The Macallans top clients. And whenever any of the bottles have been auctioned over the years there have been extraordinary results - a similar bottle was sold in 2019 for 1.5m. Speaking last month in the run-up to the auction, Mr Fowle said The Macallan 1926 is the one whisky that every auctioneer wants to sell and every collector wants to own. Sothebys said the 40 bottles from the 1926 cask had been labelled in different ways. Two bottles had no labels at all, a maximum of 14 were decorated with the iconic Fine and Rare labels and 12 were labelled by pop artist Sir Peter Blake. A further 12 bottles - including the record-breaking one sold on Saturday - were designed by Italian painter Valerio Adami. It is not known how many of the 12 bottles of The Macallan Adami 1926 still exist. One is said to have been destroyed in an earthquake in Japan in 2011, and it is believed at least one other has been opened and consumed. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "OpenAI appoints new boss as Altman joins Microsoft in Silicon Valley twist",
        "date": "November 20, 2023 05:49 pm",
        "content": "OpenAI named ex-Twitch boss Emmett Shear as interim CEO, while outgoing chief Sam Altman is set to join backer Microsoft in a surprise turn of events for the startup at the heart of an artificial intelligence boom. The appointments, settled late into the night on Sunday, followed Altmans abrupt departure just days earlier as CEO of the ChatGPT maker and ended speculation that he could return. In a statement on the social media platform X, Shear dismissed speculation that OpenAIs board ousted Altman because of a spat over the safety of powerful AI models. He vowed to open an investigation into the firing, consider new governance for OpenAI and continue its path of making technology like its viral chatbot available. Im not crazy enough to take this job without board support for commercializing our awesome models, Shear said, adding: OpenAIs stability and success are too important to allow turmoil to disrupt them like this. OpenAI dismissed Altman on Friday following a breakdown of communications, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Altman was a founding co-chair of the startup that kicked off the generative AI craze a year ago by releasing ChatGPT, a chatbot that became one of the worlds fastest-growing software applications. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in posts on X that Altman would become CEO of a new research group inside the software maker, along with other departing OpenAI colleagues such as outgoing President Greg Brockman who quit following Altmans ouster. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and staked its future on the startup, releasing what it called AI copilots to business customers based on OpenAIs technology. Microsoft had supported a return of Altman to the startup, according to sources, a move that seemed likely only hours prior to Mondays announcements. Teasing his expected reconciliation with OpenAIs board, Altman had posted an image of himself on X on Sunday wearing an OpenAI guest badge with the caption: first and last time i ever wear one of these. We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success, Nadella said. In a separate post on X, Altman shared Nadellas message with the words, the mission continues. The decision not to reinstate Altman as OpenAIs chief confounded efforts by investors and employees to steady the startups path. They feared his abrupt sacking could lead to a mass exodus of talent and impact an upcoming 86 billion share sale. Shortly after the internal announcement of Shears appointment, distraught employees streamed out of OpenAI headquarters in San Francisco, The Information reported. Dozens of staffers internally announced they were quitting the company on Sunday night, according to the report, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Several leaders of the startup posted on X on Monday: OpenAI is nothing without its people. Shear co-founded Twitch and had stepped down from the Amazon.com-owned live video streaming platform earlier this year. Some of the recently departed researchers, such as Szymon Sidor, are joining the new effort at Microsoft, OpenAIs now-former President Brockman said in a post on X. Long in conflict has been OpenAIs mission to build technology to benefit humanity, and that of its investors who have bankrolled the effort expecting a financial return, said analyst Richard Windsor of Radio Free Mobile. This weekend was simply the detonation of a bomb that has been waiting to go off, he said. Governing OpenAI is a non-profit. Its four-person board as of Friday consists of three independent directors holding no equity in OpenAI and its Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

The Cabinet of Ministers has decided for the stocks of sugar which were imported when the import tax was 25 cents to be taken over by the government and sell them through Lanka Sathosa and other supermarkets at a controlled price, he said. Speaking at a press conference in Colombo today (20), he said that the sugar stocks in question will be taken over by the government and provided to Lanka Sathosa and other supermarkets as well as selected cooperatives to be sold at the controlled price of Rs. 275 per kilogram throughout a period of one month. He said that they expect that this will resolve the existing shortage of sugar it the market and will ensure that sufficient stocks of sugar reach supermarket outlets including Lanka Sathosa and selected cooperatives. The minister added that once the stocks of sugar imported when the levy was 25 cents are taken over by the government, the control price imposed on sugar would be removed as it will no longer be necessary because the stocks of sugar imported after that will be under the special commodity levy of Rs. 50.",

The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today arrested four high-ranking officials including the Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health, over the alleged importing of substandard Immunoglobulin vials. Accordingly, the Director of the Medical Supplies Division Dr. Kapila Wickremenayake, Assistant Director Devashantha Soloman, Accountant (Supplies) Neran Dhananjaya and the Stock Controller of the Medical Supplies Division Sujith Kumara were arrested by the CID in relation to the incident. In October, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) had said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), allegedly imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure, was suspended from use while revealing that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which had later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier by the name Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having to do anything with this fraudulent activity and has communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. It was found that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated through the unlawful importation of a batch of 22,500 vials of IVIG. The local medicines regulator recently said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients being treated at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. Nevertheless, the Academy of Health Professionals on November 05, accused that information was revealed that the relevant batch of vials were suspected to have been manufactured within the country itself, while alleging that blood required for the production of the substandard immunoglobulin vials were obtained from the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS).",

This was disclosed when the committee met in Parliament recently (Nov. 17), chaired by State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, to look into the Auditor Generals reports of the Sri Lanka Customs for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 and its current performance. The COPA drew attention to the financial advantage provided to the concerned institution by presenting fake local information during the release of warehouses brought by a private institution for the water development project in the Eastern Province. Accordingly, during the release of the goods which the concerned private company had warehoused as USD 5,139,621, locally prepared forged documents were used to pave way and obtain USD 1,210,743 in excess for the concerned company when the value shown was USD 6,350,364. Thus, COPA recommended that a report in this regard to be given within a month. The status of the introduction of new technology by Sri Lanka Customs was also discussed at the committee meeting held. Accordingly, the officers who were present pointed out that currently a system called Azikuda is being used to maintain data and it is connected to the Ramis system. Furthermore, a new technology system will be introduced in the future. Furthermore, attention was also directed to the measures taken regarding the amendment of the Customs Ordinance Act and the officials mentioned that the amendments in this regard will be submitted to Parliament in January 2024. Due to non-disclosure of correct information while bringing coal to Norochcholai thermal power plant, VAT was not charged as an additional tax in the customs investigation to recover the undercharged VAT of nearly 187 million rupees, and a penalty of 205 million rupees was imposed and 70 of the received amount was allocated to the rewards and welfare of the officials and the committee questioned the officials. Accordingly, officials pointed out that they have started discussions with the Ministry of Finance to start a program so that this kind of things does not happen again. Discussions also took place regarding the use of fingerprints for reporting to duty by customs officials and the officials pointed out that it is difficult to record fingerprints in the most secret operations and in practical situations. COPA suggested the use of fingerprints in other routinely functions and to use a written record during special operations. It was also discussed that the scanner purchased to check the import and export containers could not meet the expected plans. The issue of non-exempted vehicles in the possession of customs was also discussed at the committee meeting held.

The opposition leader emphasized that the government cannot be lenient toward these individuals as the entire country is on alert as to what action would be taken against them. As Premadasa raised questions about the governments stance on the matter, the legal measures which the government intends to implement against them and if the government would recover the losses incurred by the state due to those mentioned in the courts judgement, the ruling party MPs interrupted the address and later approached the opposition leaders seat.

        "date": "November 21, 2023 12:14 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of OpenAI staffers are calling for the resignation of the ChatGPT companys board, and threatening to quit themselves, after a tumultuous weekend that began with the surprise ouster of CEO Sam Altman and ended with Altman being hired by Microsoft. In a letter obtained by CNN, the more than 500 employees accused the OpenAI board of mishandling Altmans firing, failing to provide sufficient evidence for claims that Altman had not been candid with the board, and negotiating in bad faith with the companys executive leadership. Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI, wrote the employees. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. The employees also warned that they would imminently follow Altman to Microsoft unless the board resigns and reinstates Altman and Greg Brockman, the former OpenAI president who was also removed by the board on Friday. Among the signatories is Mira Murati, who as recently as Friday had been named by the board as Altmans interim successor, as well as Ilya Sutskever, OpenAIs co-founder, chief scientist and board member who had been widely reported as having played a role in Altmans dismissal. Muratis promotion has since been superseded by the appointment of incoming interim CEO Emmett Shear, the 40-year-old co-founder of the livestreaming company Twitch. On Monday, as news of the letter emerged, Sutskever posted an apology on X that acknowledged his contribution to the leadership crisis, which appeared to revolve around tensions between Altman and the board about the pace and scope of AI development. I deeply regret my participation in the boards actions, he said. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything weve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company. The letter highlights the internal divides at OpenAI that have burst into public view after Altmans firing, and raises further doubts about the fate of OpenAIs three non-employee board members. That list includes Quora CEO Adam DAngelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown Universitys Center for Security and Emerging Technology. As they sought to manage the fallout of Altmans firing, the letter claimed, members of the board informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with the mission of OpenAI, which is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. The rebuke by some of OpenAIs most senior employees also underscores Altmans loyal following and Microsofts opportunity to benefit from the situation. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees, the letter added. After Sutskever posted his message to X, Altman amplified the apology by quote-posting it. He added a short commentary consisting of three heart emojis. Source - CNN - Agencies",

        "content": "Albanias opposition Democratic Party members set off smoke bombs and lit a small fire, quickly extinguished, in the middle of parliament on Monday in a failed bit to stop the chamber from voting on the 2024 budget. MPs piled chairs in the centre of the chamber and red, green and purple smoke filled the air as security kept protesters back from the seat of Prime Minister Edi Rama. One MP appeared to light a small fire which was passed forward in a container before flames briefly spread and were doused by surrounding MPs. The de-facto leader of the party, Sali Berisha, a former prime minister, has accused the government of trying to silence the opposition in parliament where Ramas Socialist Party has a majority. The battle has no way back, Berisha told reporters after the disturbance in the chamber where the budget passed a first vote in a session that lasted less than five minutes. Our goal is to bring pluralism to parliament. Last month, prosecutors charged Berisha and his son-in-law with corruption over a land deal involving the grounds of a sports club. They accused him of using his influence as premier from 2005 to 2009 to exert pressure for the conclusion of the privatisation procedures in favour of others including his daughters husband. His son-in-law was arrested but Berisha has immunity from prosecution as an MP. He has been ordered not to leave the country. Berisha accuses Rama of orchestrating the prosecution against him. Rama denies the accusation. They (opposition) brought the vocabulary and manners of the street into politics, Rama said on X, previously Twitter, after the disturbance. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

The proposal, tabled by the Minister of Health, was approved by the Cabinet during their meeting held on Monday (20 Nov.). Accordingly, the revision of the permissible levels of Aflatoxin was also discussed in the context of the Thriposha programme, provided under the Maternal and Child Health Program implemented by the Ministry. Thriposha is provided under the aforementioned programme to children with low nutrition levels aged between 6 months and 3 years, and as an additional nutrient for pregnant women and lactating mothers. However, due to the stringent permissible limits for Aflatoxin as prescribed in the existing regulations under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980, the Ministry of Health highlighted the difficulty in procuring maize for the production of Thriposha. Thus, it was proposed that the limitations imposed on Aflatoxin levels in internationally accredited food supplements (5ppb for type B1 and level 10 ppb of total Aflatoxin) be implemented to local food supplement programmes as well.",

        "date": "November 21, 2023 03:02 pm",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was quoted as saying the government should just let people die during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than impose a second national lockdown, the inquiry into how Britain handled the crisis heard on Monday. Patrick Vallance, who was the governments chief scientific adviser during COVID, made a note in his diary on Oct. 25, 2020, about a meeting involving then Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak, who was finance minister. The diary entry shown to the inquiry recorded how Dominic Cummings, Johnsons most senior adviser during the pandemic, had relayed to Vallance what he said he had heard at the meeting. Vallance quoted Cummings in his diary as saying: Rishi thinks just let people die and thats okay. This all feels like a complete lack of leadership. A spokesman for Sunak said the prime minister would set out his position when he gives evidence to the inquiry rather than respond to each one in piecemeal. The inquiry is examining the governments response to the coronavirus pandemic that shut large sections of the economy and killed more than 220,000 people in Britain. It is due to run until the summer of 2026. Senior government officials have repeatedly said the government was unprepared for the pandemic and a toxic and macho culture hampered the response to the health crisis. The danger for Sunak is that evidence at the inquiry undermines his attempt to cast himself as a change to the chaotic leadership of Johnson even though he was one of the most senior ministers in that government. Previous evidence has shown he was branded Dr. Death by one government scientific adviser over his Eat Out to Help out policy in the summer of 2020, which subsidised meals in pubs and restaurants but was criticised by health experts for spreading the virus.

        "content": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has moved the Under 19 World Cup to South Africa from Sri Lanka, the Indian cricket news website Cricbuzz reported. The decision has been taken by the ICC board in view of the administrative uncertainty in Sri Lanka Cricket. The ICC is currently meeting in Ahmedabad. After a detailed deliberations, the board has decided to uphold the November 10 decision to suspend the SLC. The board said that while cricket involving the island team will continue uninterrupted, the suspension, however, will not be overturned, according to the relevant report. It was a unanimous decision by the board that the suspension cannot be lifted. Cricket in the country will continue as normal, a well-placed source told Cricbuzz. Shammi Silva, the president of the SLC, has attended the board meeting, held at ITC Narmada in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, November 21. The board has also decided that the Sri Lanka team will continue to play international cricket despite the suspension of SLC. The game will run through the suspended SLC, which will receive controlled funding, Cricbuzz added. The Under-19 World Cup was scheduled to take place between January 14 and February 15. The dates will clash with the second edition of SA20, which runs from January 10 to February 10 but a top Cricket South Africa (CSA) official told Cricbuzz that both events can be organised simultaneously as the T20 league is being overseen autonomously by a body independent of CSA, Cricbuzz mentioned. The option of holding the event in Oman and UAE were also considered, but South Africa was eventually preferred because of better infrastructure: the requirement was three grounds, and Oman only has one. Furthermore, moving the teams between UAE and Oman would have been an expensive proposition and the Board finally zeroed in on South Africa. CSA has agreed to spare three venues for the mutli-nation championship. SLC chief Silva is of the opinion that the confusion could have been avoided but said cricket in the country will remain uninterrupted. I have requested the ICC board to allow the game to continue and the members have upheld our request, Silva told Cricbuzz. He has also confirmed that Sri Lanka Under-19 team will take part in the U-19 World Cup in South Africa. --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Customs have seized a parcel containing Kush cannabis and cocaine, estimated to be worth over Rs 60 million, which had been sent to Sri Lanka from America via a courier service. The narcotics were found concealed inside sealed cans of food items in the parcel by officers of the Sri Lanka Customs Revenue Inspection Unit. Accordingly, the parcel had contained over 500 grams of cocaine, and 5.16 kilograms of marijuana, Sri Lanka Customs reported, adding that the stock of narcotics has an estimated street value of Rs. 66,940,000. Two persons, including an Assistant Superintendent of Customs, have been arrested in connection with the detection. The first arrestee has been identified as a 46-year-old resident of Wellamptiya, who had come to collect the relevant parcel on behalf of its intended recipient, a woman residing in the Gampaha area. During his questioning, however, the arrestee had revealed that an Assistant Superintendent of Customs, who was reportedly assigned for duty at the courier company in question, had also been involved in the racket. The officer in question was subsequently arrested for further investigations, following which the stock of narcotics and the two suspects were handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for onward legal action.",

        "date": "November 21, 2023 06:44 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara says that the country has lost an opportunity to support rebuilding the tourism industry and the economy as a result of the decision taken by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move the Under 19 World Cup to South Africa from Sri Lanka. During todays parliamentary session, Wijesekara, commenting on the ICCs decision to relocate the tournaments venue, highlighted that on one hand, the fresh players will lose the opportunity to advance their talents, while on the other hand it affects the countrys economy. Furthermore, the minister expressed that all the Members of Parliament should work in tandem to lift the suspension imposed on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the ICC. Therefore, we have to think about the consequences while making decisions. I believe that we, all the 225 Members of Parliament, have to act together in order to lift this ban on SLC, as we did in to bring forth the resolutions against SLC board. Earlier today, the ICC decided to move the Under 19 World Cup to South Africa from Sri Lanka, taking into account the prevailing administrative uncertainty in SLC. The ICC convened a meeting in Ahmedabad today, during which its board, after detailed deliberations, decided to uphold the November 10 decision to suspend the SLC. The board said that while cricket involving the islands team would continue uninterrupted, the suspension, however, would not be overturned, according to Cricbuzz, the Indian cricket news website. The board has also decided that the Sri Lankan team would continue to play international cricket despite the suspension of SLC. The game will run through the suspended SLC, which will receive controlled funding, Cricbuzz added. Nevertheless, SLC chief Shammi Silva confirmed that Sri Lankas Under-19 team will take part in the U-19 World Cup in South Africa.",

        "title": "Netanyahu, Hamas chief indicate deal on Gaza truce and hostages is close",
        "date": "November 21, 2023 08:55 pm",
        "content": "The leader of Hamas said on Tuesday that a truce agreement with Israel was close, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped for good news soon about hostages, the most optimistic signals so far of a deal to pause fighting and free captives. Hamas officials were close to reaching a truce agreement with Israel and the group has delivered its response to Qatari mediators, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement sent to Reuters by his aide. Netanyahu said: We are making progress. I dont think its worth saying too much, not at even this moment, but I hope there will be good news soon, according to remarks released by the Israeli prime ministers office. Netanyahu would convene his war cabinet from 1600 GMT in light of developments in the matter of the release of our hostages, his office said, followed by meetings of his wider security cabinet and the full cabinet. A source briefed on the negotiations told Reuters the long-awaited agreement, which would see the first truce of the war and the first mass release of those held by both sides, was in its final stages and closer than it has ever been. That was echoed by a U.S. official who said it was the closest weve been to a hostage deal. The deal, as described by the first source, envisages the release of around 50 civilian hostages by Hamas and of female and minor-aged Palestinian detainees from Israeli custody, as well as a multi-day pause in fighting. A Hamas official told Al Jazeera TV that negotiations were centred on how long the truce would last, arrangements for delivery of aid into Gaza and details of the exchange of captives. Both sides would free women and children, and details would be announced by Qatar, which is mediating in the negotiations, said the official, Issat el Reshiq. Israels Channel 12 and Channel 13 TV stations both quoted unidentified officials as saying terms of a deal could be reached within hours. Hamas took about 240 hostages during its Oct. 7 rampage into Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), met Haniyeh in Qatar on Monday to advance humanitarian issues related to the conflict, the Geneva-based ICRC said in a statement. She also separately met Qatari authorities. The ICRC said it was not part of negotiations aimed at releasing the hostages, but as a neutral intermediary it was ready to facilitate any future release that the parties agree to. Rain and cold worsen conditions Talk of an imminent hostage deal has swirled for days. Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog said on ABCs This Week on Sunday that he hoped for an agreement in the coming days, while Qatars Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said that the remaining sticking points were very minor. U.S. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials said on Monday a deal was near. The Hamas raid on Oct. 7, the deadliest day in Israels 75-year-old history, prompted Israel to invade Gaza to annihilate the militant group that has ruled there since 2007. Since then, Gazas Hamas-run government says at least 13,300 Palestinians have been confirmed killed, including at least 5,600 children, by Israeli bombardment that has turned much of Gaza, especially its northern half, into wasteland. Around two-thirds of Gazas 2.3 million people have been made homeless, with thousands a day still trekking south on foot with belongings and children in their arms. The central and southern parts of the enclave, where Israel has told them to go, have also regularly come under attack. A day and a night of rain and cold winter weather worsened the dire conditions in Gaza for the displaced, many thousands of whom are sleeping rough or in makeshift tents. 20 reported dead in Nuseirat strike Gaza health authorities said on Tuesday at least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza at midnight. There was no immediate comment from Israel. The already crowded Nuseirat district, which grew out of a camp for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, is just south of the wetlands that bisect the strip and has been the arrival point for huge numbers escaping the fighting further north. Bombing in southern areas leaves Gazans fearing they have no place safe to go. Neighbouring Egypt has allowed the evacuation of some wounded and foreign passport holders, but says it will not accept a mass exodus. Continued bombing targeting displaced people in the South has a clear objective, and that is to force Gazas residents to leave the Strip, Egypts foreign ministry spokesman said on X. Egypt has clearly declared its utter rejection of any enforced displacement attempt of Palestinians. Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in the north despite an Israeli order to flee. All hospitals there have ceased functioning normally, many still housing patients and displaced Gazans. Israel says Hamas uses hospitals as shields for its fighters, which Hamas and the hospitals deny. The World Health Organization said it was working on plans to evacuate three Northern Gaza hospitals: Al Shifa, Al Ahli and the Indonesian Hospital, lamenting this as a last resort. Its robbing the entire population of the north of the means to seek health (care), WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva press briefing. Issam Nabhan, head of the nursing department of the Indonesian Hospital, where the WHO and Gaza authorities say 12 people were killed on Monday by Israeli fire, told Al-Jazeera on Tuesday there were 60 dead bodies on the grounds. There is no oxygen to supply the patients. All those on artificial respiration have died. We speak out to the free world. The Indonesian hospital has become a cemetery, not a hospital.

        "date": "November 21, 2023 09:38 pm",
        "content": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Department of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, with funding from the European Union (EU), has launched a Farmer Field Schools Program to train 6,000 smallholder paddy farmers across four key rice-growing districts on sustainable approaches to paddy cultivation. The 6,000 farmers from Ampara, Badulla, Hambantota and Polonnaruwa districts will be trained by Agriculture Extension Officers on applying the Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) approach in their paddy cultivation to promote the efficient use of fertilizers, water and other inputs. By adopting IPNM and more efficient use of chemical fertilizers, smallholder paddy farmers can reduce costs and improve productivity, leading to better profitability and resilience to future shocks. Many paddy farmers in Sri Lanka rely on traditional cultivation methods, often exceeding the recommended amounts of fertilizers provided by the Department of Agriculture without a full understanding of the respective soil nutrient requirements of their fields. To address these challenges, the Farmer Field School program will facilitate soil testing and efficient fertilizer use through IPNM practices, emphasizing soil management, compost, and biochar production. The program will also focus on implementing good agronomic practices including using high-quality seeds, proper land preparation, the parachute method for seed broadcasting, efficient water management, and effective weed, pest, and disease management, all integral components of IPNM practices. All the above-mentioned activities are being implemented through the project titled RiceUP, an innovative project launched by FAO together with the government of Sri Lanka with EUR 4 million in funding from the EU to tackle the vulnerability of the food security system in Sri Lank. The project aims to respond to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka by protecting smallholder farmer livelihoods through the safe and efficient use of fertilizer along with boosting the production of quality paddy seeds for better productivity in paddy farming. The launch of the Farmer Field Schools comes after 289 Agriculture Extension Officers were trained with the necessary skills and knowledge to guide 6,000 paddy farmers on IPNM practices to enhance yields while reducing dependency on chemical fertilizers. The Agriculture Extension Officers will act as facilitators and work with the selected farmers to adapt appropriate exercises relevant to their local conditions. Through the implementation of sustainable farming practices, including the safe and efficient use of fertilizer and quality seeds, RiceUP aims to enhance productivity, food security, and livelihoods in Sri Lankas paddy farming sector.",

        "content": "At least 37 people have died in a stampede during an army recruitment drive at a stadium in Congo-Brazzaville, the government has said. Some people tried to force their way through stadiums gates in the capital, Brazzaville, causing the stampede, residents have been quoted as saying. Last week, the army announced plans to recruit about 1,500 people between the ages of 18 and 25. Many people were injured in the crush, a government statement said. It did not give a number, but said that a crisis unit has been set up, the AFP news agency reports. According to the Associated Press agency, as many as 700 people a day have been registering over the last week at recruitment centres. Youth unemployment is at around 42 in Congo-Brazzaville, with many young people seeing the army one of the few places where they can secure a job. Details of what exactly happened at Michel dOrnano stadium are sketchy. Thousands of young people had reportedly gathered outside the stadium on Monday. Local sources have told the BBC the registration process was to open on Tuesday morning. Brandon Tsetou, a graduate who survived the crush, said he had queued since early on Monday. According to the organisers, it was to be the last day. Thats why many of us decided to wait until late into the night, hoping to register, he told AP. Some were so impatient that they had to force their way in, causing a stampede that left a number of people dead or injured, which we deplore. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "November 21, 2023 10:12 pm",
        "content": "As the shortage of sugar in the local market continues to prevail, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has removed the maximum retail price (MRP) imposed on the product. This was communicated in a Gazette Extraordinary published by the CAA chairman Shantha Niriella today (Nov.21). As such, the previous gazette notification dated 03 November 2023, through which the price controls on sugar was put in place, has been rescinded with immediate effect. The previous communique had stipulated an MRP of Rs. 295 and Rs. 275 on 1kg of packed and unpackaged white sugar, respectively. It also mentioned that packed and unpackaged brown sugar must be sold at Rs. 350 and Rs. 330 per kilogram, respectively. A day before the price controls were introduced, the Finance Ministry had issued a government notification increasing the Special Commodity Levy on imported sugar from 25 cents to Rs. 50. As these two moves prompted a shortage of sugar in the market, the government, on Monday (Nov.20), decided to acquire the sugar stocks imported under the previous levy of 25 cents per kilogram and sell them to the consumers through Lanka Sathosa, supermarkets and cooperative outlets at a price of Rs. 275 per kilogram, within one month. Trade Minister Nalin Fernando had earlier said that the MRP on sugar would no longer be necessary once the government takes over the imported sugar stocks, as the consignments imported after that would be subjected to the special commodity levy of Rs. 50.",

        "title": "2024 Budget aims to prevent recurrence of economic crisis - Semasinghe",
        "date": "November 22, 2023 03:47 am",
        "content": "The State Minister of Finance, Shehan Semasinghe says the 2024 Budget, characterized by formal economic management, has been unveiled to proactively avert the recurrence of severe economic crises within the country. The lawmaker emphasized the dedicated focus within this years budget to extend relief to those significantly impacted by the economic downturn. Furthermore, there is a deliberate commitment to fostering the establishment and support of small and medium-scale businesses as part of the comprehensive economic strategy, he added. Expressing his views during a discussion held on Monday (20) at the Ministry of Finance on the 2024 budget, State Minister Semasinghe further remarked: The budget presented this year has laid the groundwork for growth across various sectors of the economy. To foster economic growth, it is imperative to restore the country to the pre-crisis economic levels. The groundwork for this resurgence was established in the previous budget. The current years budget is designed to further fortify economic stability and the progress in achieving this stability can be verified by scrutinizing data provided by the Central Bank. During the presentation of the 2023 budget, the nation found itself in a precarious situation, unable to produce a comprehensive budget document. At that critical juncture, the country grappled with profound economic downturn and political-social turbulence, marking a significant crossroads in its history. It is noteworthy to acknowledge that the attained economic stability is a direct outcome of the 2023 budget document. Additionally, the government anticipates a 1.8 economic growth for the upcoming year, with aspirations to surpass that target and achieve a growth rate of 2 or more. The formulation of this years budget took into account agreements established with the International Monetary Fund and the nations creditors. Of particular significance is the commitment to achieving debt sustainability, thereby emphasizing meticulous attention to debt restructuring and various other considerations in the preparation of the budget proposals. The government has prioritized addressing the challenges faced by population groups severely affected by the on-going economic crisis. Special consideration has been given to public servants, who have not seen a salary increase in many years. Consequently, the government has taken the initiative to grant an additional allowance of Rs. 10,000. Furthermore, focused attention has been extended to various vulnerable groups, including low-income earners, kidney patients, individuals receiving disability allowances and those receiving elderly allowances. This comprehensive approach is expected to benefit approximately 3 million families. As per the economic crisis, small and medium-sized businesses, which faced significant challenges, have been a focal point. The current budget allocates over Rs. 30 billion for their rehabilitation. A structured system has been devised to facilitate their access to credit facilities, offering subsidized interest rates in the single-digit range. Furthermore, the government has lifted restrictions on imports, excluding personal-use vehicles, in a move aimed at fostering greater economic flexibility and adaptability. On the fiscal front, W. M. G. Kumaratunga, Director of the Economic Stabilization Unit at the Presidents Office, provided insights into revenue collection. Noting the significant milestone, he projected estimated state revenue of Rs. 3,101 billion by December 31, surpassing the Rs. 3 trillion marks for the first time in history. Comparatively, the revenue as of last 17 stood at Rs. 2,394 billion, with contributions from the Inland Revenue Department Rs. 1,415 billion, Sri Lanka Customs Rs. 832 billion, and the Excise Department Rs. 147 billion. As the year draws to a close, he said an estimated income of Rs. 3,101 billion is anticipated from the combined efforts of the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs and the Excise Department. Additionally, a further Rs.369 billion is expected to be generated in the coming days. This additional revenue comprises Rs.154 billion from the Inland Revenue Department, Rs. 136 billion from Sri Lanka Customs and the remaining Rs. 33 billion from the Excise Department. Consequently, by December 31 of this year, a total state revenue of Rs.2,719 billion is anticipated. However, if efforts align with the estimated target for 2023, this figure would represent the highest state revenue ever recorded in the countrys history. In addition to the ongoing efforts, the Presidents Office has initiated special programs aimed at further augmenting state revenue. Notably, the daily income of Sri Lanka Customs has currently reached an impressive Rs. 5 billion. The aspiration is to achieve a revenue target of Rs. 3 trillion, a milestone that could significantly boost the countrys economy, leading to the creation of a surplus in the primary account.",
