        "title": "Peru ex-President Toledo convicted of bribe-taking, sentenced to 20 years in prison",
        "date": "October 22, 2024 03:50 pm",
        "content": "Peruvian former President Alejandro Toledo was convicted of taking bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison on Monday. The verdict marks Perus first high-profile conviction related to Brazils continent-spanning Lava Jato corruption scandal. Toledo, a 78-year-old economist who holds a doctorate from Stanford University, governed the Andean nation between 2001 and 2006. He was convicted of taking 35 million in bribes from the company formerly known as Odebrecht, according to prosecutors, in exchange for letting it win a contract to build the road that now connects Perus southern coast with an Amazonian area in western Brazil. During the year-long trial, Toledo denied the money-laundering and collusion charges. Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, was at the center of Latin Americas largest graft scandal, after admitting in 2016 that it bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts. Last week, Toledo asked the court to let him serve his sentence at home as he battles cancer. Please let me heal or die at home, he said. The sentence was announced in a room set up in a small Lima prison where Toledo has been detained since last year. Former President Pedro Castillo is also being held there as he faces allegations of rebellion after trying to dissolve Congress in 2022. Two other ex-presidents, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ollanta Humala, are also being investigated in the Odebrecht case. Toledo, who famously shined shoes as a child, was arrested in the United States in 2019 after officials in Peru requested his extradition. Prosecutors relied on testimony from former Odebrecht executive Jorge Barata as well as Toledos ex-collaborator Josef Maiman, who said Toledo received bribes. The former president signed the contract with Odebrecht for the construction of the road, though building it took place over two subsequent administrations. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 22, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated the controlled price of rice will not change. He also highlighted that plans are underway for a long-term program to create an organized agricultural plan, which would provide greater benefits to farmers. President Dissanayake made these remarks during a discussion held today (22) at the Presidential Secretariat with rice millers and officials from the Department of Agriculture, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. During this meeting, participants focused on the current prices of consumer goods, emphasizing the importance of controlling the price of rice, which is a staple food for the population. The President noted to the rice millers that they had purchased paddy from farmers after the controlled price was established, and he believes it is unfair to alter the price of rice at this stage, the PMD said. Additionally, he stressed the necessity for a formal mechanism that ensures farmers receive a fair price for their rice while also enabling consumers to purchase rice at a reasonable cost. President Dissanayake noted that the price of rice has been artificially inflated, attributing this price instability to the long-term lack of enforcement of controlled prices, the statement added. During the discussion, the issue of stock hoarders was addressed, and the President instructed agriculture officials to register this group. Dudley Sirisena, Nipuna Gamlath, Mithrapala Lankeshwara, Jayasiri Gunathilaka, Menaka Gamlath, and other businessmen representing the Rice Mill Owners Association, along with several officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, were also present at the meeting. --PMD--",

The DNA had filed this petition on October 18 following the decision by the Vanni District Returning Officer to reject their nomination submission and the petition requests the Supreme Court to issue a writ order invalidating the decision. After considering the facts presented from both parties, the Supreme Court pointed out that that the rejected nomination paper should be accepted by the relevant District Returning Officer in accordance with the existing laws. Accordingly, the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Shiran Gunaratne and Achala Wengappuli ordered that the decision and its justification would be pronounced in court tomorrow (23). The petition was submitted by Pararajasingham Udayarasa, the authorized officer of the DNA, and two others, naming the Commissioner General of the Election Commission, its members, the Vanni District Returning Officer, and several others as respondents. In the relevant petition, filed through Attorney-at-Law Sanath Wijewardane, the petitioners claim that they have submitted their nomination papers to the District Returning Officer for the Vanni electoral district in order to contest in the upcoming General Election. The petition states that the District Returning Officer rejected their nomination submission at the time, citing that it had not been properly submitted.

        "title": "Putin hosts Global South leaders at BRICS summit meant to counterbalance Western clout",
        "date": "October 23, 2024 08:52 am",
        "content": "Chinas Xi Jinping, Indias Narendra Modi and other world leaders arrived Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies that the Kremlin hopes to turn into a rallying point for defying Western influence in global affairs. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov called it the largest foreign policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed interest in joining. Observers see the BRICS summit as part of the Kremlins efforts to showcase support from the Global South amid spiraling tensions with the West while expanding economic and financial ties. Proposed projects include the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Putin, who will hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines, conferred with Xi, Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday ahead of the summits opening. Xi and Putin announced a no-limits partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Welcoming Xi, Putin described the relations between Moscow and Beijing as one of the main stabilizing factors on the world arena. He vowed to expand coordination on all multilateral forums for the sake of global stability and a fair world order. Amid tectonic transformations unseen for centuries, the international situation is undergoing serious changes and upheavals, Xi said, hailing the unprecedented character of Russia-China ties. Russias cooperation with India has also flourished. New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russias close ties with Indias main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. We fully support the quickest establishment of peace and stability, said Modi, who last visited Russia in July. Putin hailed what he described as a privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India. During a meeting with Ramaphosa, the Russian president emphasized their shared striving for a fair, multi-polar global order and specifically mentioned efforts by BRICS members to create a new independent payment system. After a dinner for the delegations, Putin met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who praised the dynamic development of Moscow-Cairo relations in recent years. On Thursday, Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russias actions in Ukraine. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 23, 2024 09:01 am",
        "content": "A McDonalds sandwich has been making people sick in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). E. coli, a type of bacteria that can cause serious stomach problems, has been found in McDonalds Quarter Pounder sandwiches, the CDC announced on Tuesday. So far, the CDC has recorded 49 cases of illness across 10 states. Ten cases resulted in patients being admitted to hospital and one person has died. Most of the cases were recorded in western and Midwest states, according to the CDC. The fast-food restaurant is working with investigators to determine which ingredients caused the outbreak, according to a statement from the CDC. McDonalds has pulled ingredients for these burgers, and they wont be available for sale in some states, the agency said. It is not yet known which specific food ingredient is contaminated, the CDC added, noting that McDonalds has already stopped using fresh slivered onions and quarter-pound beef patties in several states. The CDC said that the slivered onions are believed to be the likely source of contamination, and investigators with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are working to determine if the onions were sold to any other business. No recalls have been issued yet by the CDC or by other health and food regulators. The first case was recorded on 27 September, investigators say. Victims have ranged in age from 13 to 88. Of the 10 people taken to hospital, one person developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious condition that can cause kidney failure. Another person, who the CDC described as an older adult in Colorado died after eating at McDonalds. Cases have been reported in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. McDonalds shares fell by about 9 on the New York Stock Exchange after the news broke on Tuesday. In a statement, McDonalds said that a preliminary investigation found that a subset of illnesses may be linked to slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder and sourced by a single supplier that serves three distribution centers. The Chicago-based company added that it has instructed all local restaurants to remove this product from their supply and have paused shipments of slivered onions to the region. The sandwich is also being temporarily removed from the menu in several states, the company said, adding: We take food safety extremely seriously and its the right thing to do. Other beef products remain on the menu, McDonalds USA President Joe Erlinger said in a video message. At McDonalds, you can count on us to do the right thing, he said. E. coli are a diverse group of bacteria that normally live in the intestines of humans and animals. Although many are harmless, some produce toxins that can make you sick. Symptoms include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. It usually takes a few days after being infected for symptoms to show. This is not the first E. coli outbreak to affect McDonalds in recent years. In 2022, six children in Alabama were sickened with E. coli after eating chicken McNuggets. Four children were admitted to hospital. Health inspectors later visited the affected restaurant and found several violations, including improper hand-washing and a lack of gloves.

        "date": "October 23, 2024 01:29 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military say they killed the cleric tipped to succeed the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an air strike nearly three weeks ago. Hashem Safieddine died in air strikes on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese Shia Muslim organisation fighting Israel, has not confirmed Safieddines death. Its previous leader, Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli air strike on Beirut on 27 September. After air strikes near the citys airport on 4 October, Hezbollah officials said they had lost contact with Safieddine, while US media cited Israeli officials as saying the cleric had been the target of the bombing. Huge blasts shook the city that night, leaving plumes of smoke that could still be seen into the morning. On Tuesday, the IDF issued a statement saying Safieddine had been killed along with Ali Hussein Hazima, described as commander of Hezbollahs Intelligence Headquarters, in a strike on the organisations main intelligence headquarters in Beirut. It accused Safieddine of directing terrorist attacks against the State of Israel for years, as well as taking part in Hezbollahs central decision-making processes. Hezbollah is a military, political and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel as well as the US, the UK and other countries. Safieddine himself was designated a global terrorist by the US and Saudi Arabia in 2017. A cousin of Nasrallah, he took religious studies in Iran and his son was married to a daughter of Gen Qasem Soleimani, Irans most powerful military commander, who was killed in a 2020 US air strike in Iraq. He is believed to have been aged about 60 at the time of his reported death. In a speech given in Beirut this summer, Safieddine described how Hezbollah viewed its leadership succession. In our resistance, when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination, he was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. Over the past year, at least 2,464 Lebanese people have been killed and nearly 12,000 injured, according to Lebanons health ministry. Hezbollah has attacked Israel with thousands of rockets and drones over the same period, and at least 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, Reuters news agency reports.

The cause and perpetrators of the blast and subsequent gunfire remained unclear. Some media reports claimed a suicide attack had occurred and that there were hostages inside the building. Officials have not confirmed this. Witnesses told Reuters that employees inside the building were taken by authorities to shelters and no one was permitted to leave. They said bombings may have taken place at different exits as employees were leaving work for the day. The state-owned Anadolu Agency said emergency services were dispatched to the site, while television images showed a damaged gate and an exchange of gunfire in a parking lot. The images showed the attackers carrying assault rifles and backpacks as they entered the building. Anadolu also said prosecutors had launched an investigation into the attack. TUSAS is one of Turkeys most important defence and aviation companies. It produces KAAN, the countrys first national combat aircraft, among other projects, and has over 10,000 employees.

        "date": "October 24, 2024 07:26 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police says two persons have been arrested by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) on suspicion of allegedly planning to attack Israeli nationals in Sri Lanka. Security has been heightened at the popular surfing resort of Arugam Bay on Sri Lankas eastern coast, following reports of a potential attack targeting foreign tourists, particularly Israelis. There is information about a possible attack targeting Israelis at a building where they are staying, police spokesman Deputy Inspector General Nihal Thalduwa was quoted as saying. The increased security measures are focused on the Arugam Bay and Pottuvil areas, with around 500 police officers and Special Task Force personnel deployed. As a result, Israels national security council has issued an urgent warning to Israeli citizens to leave popular tourist areas in southern Sri Lanka immediately, and classified the Arugam Bay region as a level four threat, advising Israelis to take precautions, such as concealing their Jewish identity and avoiding large gatherings. The Israeli security establishment is maintaining close communication with Sri Lankan security authorities and closely monitoring the situation, the council stated. It also advised Israelis in other parts of Sri Lanka to exercise caution and avoid holding large public gatherings. The security alert followed a warning from the US Embassy in Colombo, which said it had received credible information about a potential attack in Arugam Bay. US citizens are strongly advised to avoid the area until further notice, the statement said. The Russian Embassy and the UK issued a similar warnings to its citizens, urging them to remain vigilant and avoid large gatherings. Police have assured protection for all foreign nationals. Given the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, we are coordinating with intelligence services to ensure the safety of tourists, Thalduwa said. A hotline (1997) has also been established for tourists to report any suspicious activities. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "October 24, 2024 09:26 am",
        "content": "The United States said for the first time on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that could mark a significant escalation in Russias war against its neighbor. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in Rome, said it would be very, very serious if the North Koreans were preparing to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, as Kyiv has alleged. But he said it remained to be seen what they would be doing there. There is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia, Austin told reporters, using North Koreas formal name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States believes at least 3,000 North Korean troops are undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia. The U.S. determined the North Korean soldiers were transported by ship in early-to-mid October from North Koreas Wonsan region to the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok before being taken to three military training sites in eastern Russia, said Kirby. If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, theyre fair game, he said. Theyre fair targets and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way theyre defending themselves against Russian soldiers. In Seoul, South Korean lawmakers said that Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, the lawmakers told reporters after being briefed by South Koreas national intelligence agency. Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October, Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said after the briefing. The Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022 and has since developed into a war of attrition largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. The United States said the alleged North Korean deployment could be further evidence that the Russian military was having problems with manpower. The Kremlin has previously dismissed Seouls claims about the Norths troop deployment as fake news and a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York called it groundless rumors at a meeting on Monday. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have also denied weapons transfers, but they have pledged to boost military ties and signed a mutual defense treaty at a summit in June. The latest numbers came after Seouls National Intelligence Service said on Friday the North had sent some 1,500 special forces personnel to Russia by ship and they were likely to be deployed for combat in the war in Ukraine after training and acclimatization. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also accused Pyongyang of preparing to send 10,000 soldiers to Russia. On Tuesday he called on his allies to respond to evidence of North Korean involvement in Russias war. NATO allies are consulting on the North Korean deployment to Russia, a NATO spokesperson said. A Biden administration official said Moscow might send the North Koreans to eastern Ukraine or to its own Kursk region, where Russian troops have been fighting to dislodge Ukrainian forces holding a chunk of territory that they seized in an incursion that began in August. Mike Turner, the chair of the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee, said in a statement that U.S. President Joe Biden should allow Kyiv to respond with U.S.-supplied arms if North Korean troops attack Ukraine from Russian territory. If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraines sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops, Turner added. Families Isolated Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker on the South Korean committee, said Pyongyang authorities had tried to keep news of the deployment from spreading. There are also signs of North Korean authorities relocating and isolating those families (of the troops) in a certain place in order to effectively control them and thoroughly crack down on the rumours, Lee said, citing the spy agency. Lee also said the agency confirmed that Russia had recruited a large number of interpreters for the North Korean soldiers, while training them in the use of military equipment such as drones. Russian instructors are assessing that the North Korean military has excellent physical attributes and morale but lacks understanding of modern warfare such as drone attacks, he said. Therefore, there could be many casualties if they are deployed to the front lines. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Russia has suffered more than 600,000 killed or wounded troops in the war in Ukraine. On Tuesday the Souths presidential office urged an immediate withdrawal of the Norths troops from Russia, warning that it may consider supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine if military ties between them went too far.

        "date": "October 24, 2024 09:59 am",
        "content": "Brazilian street artist Mundanos latest work incorporates ash from forest fires and mud from flooding in Brazil to create a giant mural pleading for a stop to deforestation. The mural was inaugurated on Wednesday on the side of an 11-floor building in the center of Latin Americas largest city, adding a colorful and pointed message to Sao Paulos rich collection of graffiti. The 48-meter (157-ft) by 30-meter (98-ft) work depicts tree stumps of a burnt-down forest and the face of an Indigenous woman holding a sign in English that reads: Stop the Destruction. The mural was painted with colors made with the ash from forest fires in Brazil, including the Amazon, where swathes of rainforest have been destroyed by recent blazes in the worst drought on record. Mundano told Reuters he also used mud from massive flooding in southern Brazil earlier this year. The woman depicted in the mural is Indigenous leader Alessandra Korap Munduruku, who led a successful campaign to stop multinational mining companies prospecting on her tribes ancestral lands in the Amazon, for which she won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2023. Mundano said his mural is intended as a protest against businesses that have pushed the agricultural frontier into the Amazon rainforest with large-scale soy plantations and cattle ranching for beef, which have made Brazil one of the worlds top food exporters. The mural specifically targets U.S. grain trader Cargill Inc, temporarily painting the names of Cargill family members on the mural. Mundano said he wanted the Cargill family who owns the company to keep its word that it would remove deforestation from its supply chain. Cargill did not immediately reply to requests for comment. It has pledged to eliminate deforestation from its supply chain of key row crops in Brazil by 2025 and from its South American soy supply chain by 2030. Along with ash and mud, Mundano used clay from Indigenous reservations that have struggled to get their land rights recognized, often in conflicts with farmers. The mural also features paint made from urucum, a red tropical fruit used as body paint by Amazon tribes. This is perhaps the largest mural ever made with natural pigments, said Mundano as he mixed paints for the work. The names we are writing here are of billionaires who still live in a model based on the destruction of ecosystem biomes and contribute to the climate emergency, he said. The mural is a collaboration with the conservation nonprofit Stand.earth, who funded the project. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 24, 2024 11:22 am",
        "content": "In a swift move, Airlineratings.com last week downgraded SriLankan Airlines safety rating from 7 to 6 stars following a disturbing incident aboard flight UL 607. On September 21, 2024, the captain of the flight locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit. The incident was deemed serious enough to warrant an immediate reassessment of the airlines safety credentials. However, after a thorough review and prompt response from the airline, the rating has been restored to 7 out of 7 stars, acknowledging SriLankan Airlines commitment to addressing the incident with transparency and urgency. The Incident and Its Immediate Aftermath On September 21, a flight from Colombo to Melbourne took an alarming turn when the captain of flight UL 607 locked the co-pilot out of the cockpit. This violation of standard operating procedures raised immediate safety concerns for the airline and SriLankan Airlines wasted no time in taking corrective action and has shared this exclusively with AIrlineRatings.com The airline promptly grounded the captain involved, pending the outcome of a full investigation. Shortly after, the captain voluntarily resigned, removing himself from future operations. Additionally, the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) launched an independent investigation, suspending the captains license while the inquiry continued. Although this move wasnt publicly announced (until now), it demonstrates the seriousness with which both the airline and regulatory body are treating the matter. SriLankan Airlines Swift Response SriLankan Airlines proactive stance in handling the situation played a crucial role in restoring their safety rating. In a statement, the airline emphasized that this was an isolated incident in its 45-year history, pointing to its long-standing track record of safety and reliability. The airlines leadership reaffirmed that the safety of passengers and crew remains its highest priority, ensuring that any deviations from its established standards are handled with stringent consequences. The airline also stressed full cooperation with the CAASL investigation, indicating that appropriate penalties would be imposed on the individual responsible for this serious breach. The transparent communication and swift corrective measures taken by SriLankan Airlines underscored its commitment to maintaining a safe operating environment. Restoring the Safety Rating: A Vote of Confidence Acknowledging the airlines efforts and rapid response, Airlineratings reviewed its initial decision to lower the safety score. After evaluating the steps taken by SriLankan Airlines to mitigate the situation, the rating was restored to the maximum 7 stars. This change reflects both Airlineratings confidence in the airlines ongoing commitment to safety and the effectiveness of the measures put in place after the incident. Lessons Learned and Moving Forward The brief fluctuation in SriLankan Airlines safety rating illustrates how seriously the aviation industry takes breaches of protocol, even when they are isolated incidents. It also highlights the impact of quick, transparent, and decisive action in restoring confidence. By acting swiftly to address the situation and cooperate with authorities, SriLankan Airlines demonstrated a commitment to continuous safety improvement. While the independent investigation by the CAASL is ongoing, SriLankan Airlines actions have reassured the public and the aviation community of its dedication to the highest safety standards. As aviation safety remains a priority for passengers worldwide, airlines must be prepared to face scrutiny and address any concerns with prompt, transparent, and effective responsesjust as SriLankan Airlines did in this case. In a competitive industry where safety can be the deciding factor for travelers, maintaining an unblemished safety record is crucial. For now, SriLankan Airlines rapid and transparent response has helped regain its reputation, solidifying the airlines standing in the eyes of both the public and regulators. The incident may have been a setback, but it is one the airline appears determined to learn from, reinforcing its long-term commitment to safety and excellence.

        "date": "October 24, 2024 12:34 pm",
        "content": "Canada will sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, marking a notable shift in policy for the government as it tries to remain in power. Canada will bring in 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027, down from 485,000 in 2024, according to a government source. The number of temporary residents, meanwhile, will decrease by about 30,000 to around 300,000 in 2025, the source said. The new targets were first reported by The National Post. Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, but in recent years, the national debate around immigrants has shifted in part due to rising housing prices. Many Canadians have been priced out of the housing market since interest rates started rising two years ago. At the same time, a huge influx of immigrants has pushed Canadas population to record levels, further boosting housing demand and prices. The issue has become one of the most contentious in Canadian politics, with a federal election due no later than October 2025. Polls show a growing share of the population thinks Canada has too many immigrants. There has been a backlash against newcomers and more reported hate crimes against visible minorities, advocates and community members say. Migrant advocates slammed the change. We are witnessing one of the most egregious rollbacks of migrant rights in Canadian history, Syed Hussan, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network Secretariat, said in a statement. Cutting permanent resident numbers is a direct assault on migrants who will be forced to remain temporary or become undocumented, pushed further into exploitative jobs. The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was not immediately available to comment. The new immigration targets also mark a shift from the pandemic era when the government loosened rules on temporary residents to help fill labor shortages. Last year, Canada had planned to bring in 500,000 new permanent residents in 2025 and the same amount in 2026. As of the second quarter of 2024, there were 2.8 million temporary residents, including workers and students, in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. In an August interview, Immigration Minister Marc Miller told Reuters Canadians want an immigration system that is not out of control. Canadas Liberal government, trailing in the polls as some legislators seek to oust their leader, has been trying to regulate immigration. Under Trudeau, Canadian immigration officials have approved fewer visas this year and border officials turned growing numbers of visa-holders away, data obtained by Reuters showed. The government promises to reduce temporary residents share of the population to 5 over three years; it was 6.8 in April. It also capped the number of international students Canada will bring in and tightened the rules on temporary foreign workers under a program that brings non-Canadians to the country to work on a temporary basis. The program has come under fire for suppressing wages and leaving workers vulnerable to abuse. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 24, 2024 01:39 pm",
        "content": "A protest outside the Bangladeshi presidents home demanding his resignation ended when demonstrators clashed with riot police while trying to storm the compound, with 30 injured in the melee. President Mohammed Shahabuddins powers are largely ceremonial but he played a pivotal role at the height of an August student revolution that ousted autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina. Shahabuddin announced his one-time ally had quit on the day she fled the country for neighbouring India, paving the way for the caretaker administration now running the South Asian country. But last week he said in a local media interview he had not actually seen a written letter from Hasina to that effect -raising the prospect that her resignation was unlawful. Protesters began gathering outside Shahabuddins compound in the capital Dhaka on Tuesday demanding he step down and accusing him of residual loyalty to Hasina and her Awami League party. Since the student-led protest toppled the fascist regime, there shouldnt be a president from that regime, Faruk Hossain, a student leader at the protest, told AFP. He must be replaced by a peoples president. Several hundred protesters attempted to break through a security cordon and storm the compound shortly before midnight on Wednesday. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Talebur Rahman said at least 25 police officers were injured by protesters. Nine are still undergoing treatment. The protesters threw stones and attacked them indiscriminately, he told AFP. The situation is now calm, and there is adequate security in place. Another five people were treated at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, police official Md Faruq told AFP. Local media reports said that number included three protesters and two journalists. The protest dispersed after leaders of Students against Discrimination, the protest group credited with sparking the uprising against Hasina, visited the site and pledged to find a replacement for Chuppu. We will talk to political parties in front of the military chief by Thursday and then choose someone who will hold office, student leader Hasnat Abdullah was quoted as saying the Daily Star newspaper. His colleague Sarjis Alam reportedly told the crowd to remain calm. If emotion takes over strategy, the country will suffer, he added, according to the Daily Star report. Several top officials seen as Hasina loyalists were purged from their positions after Hasinas ouster, including Supreme Court justices and the countrys central bank chief. Their departures usually followed student-led protests outside their homes or offices. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "A Florida mother has sued artificial intelligence chatbot startup Character.AI accusing it of causing her 14-year-old sons suicide in February, saying he became addicted to the companys service and deeply attached to a chatbot it created. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Orlando, Florida federal court, Megan Garcia said Character.AI targeted her son, Sewell Setzer, with anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences. She said the company programmed its chatbot to misrepresent itself as a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewells desire to no longer live outside of the world created by the service. The lawsuit also said he expressed thoughts of suicide to the chatbot, which the chatbot repeatedly brought up again. We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family, Character.AI said in a statement. It said it had introduced new safety features including pop-ups directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if they express thoughts of self-harm, and would make changes to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content for users under 18. The lawsuit also targets Alphabets Google, where Character. AIs founders worked before launching their product. Google re-hired the founders in August as part of a deal granting it a non-exclusive license to Character.AIs technology. Garcia said that Google had contributed to the development of Character. AIs technology so extensively it could be considered a co-creator. A Google spokesperson said the company was not involved in developing Character. AIs products. Character.AI allows users to create characters on its platform that respond to online chats in a way meant to imitate real people. It relies on so-called large language model technology, also used by services like ChatGPT, which trains chatbots on large volumes of text. The company said last month that it had about 20 million users. According to Garcias lawsuit, Sewell began using Character.AI in April 2023 and quickly became noticeably withdrawn, spent more and more time alone in his bedroom, and began suffering from low self-esteem. He quit his basketball team at school. Sewell became attached to Daenerys, a chatbot character based on a character in Game of Thrones. It told Sewell that she loved him and engaged in sexual conversations with him, according to the lawsuit. In February, Garcia took Sewells phone away after he got in trouble at school, according to the complaint. When Sewell found the phone, he sent Daenerys a message: What if I told you I could come home right now? The chatbot responded, ...please do, my sweet king. Sewell shot himself with his stepfathers pistol seconds later, the lawsuit said. Garcia is bringing claims including wrongful death, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. Social media companies including Instagram and Facebook owner Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance face lawsuits accusing them of contributing to teen mental health problems, though none offers AI-driven chatbots similar to Character.AIs. The companies have denied the allegations while touting newly enhanced safety features for minors. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Indian authorities have shut schools, evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and canceled trains in parts of the country as rescue teams braced on Thursday for a tropical storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Tropical Storm Dana is expected to intensify, bringing winds of 100-110 kph (62-68 mph) and gusts up to 120 kph (74 mph), as it pushes toward the countrys eastern coastline, where it is set to make landfall late Thursday and early Friday, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. Climate scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in South Asia. Global warming driven by planet-heating gases has caused them to become more extreme and unpredictable. The storm is expected to affect most parts of the eastern state of Odisha, which saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning. Authorities have closed schools, canceled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea. Downpours also began lashing areas of neighboring West Bengal state, where some districts are also likely to be hit, prompting officials there to be on high alert. Odishas Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi told the Press Trust of India news agency that around 300,000 people have been evacuated from vulnerable areas, adding that three districts were likely to be severely affected. Authorities plan to evacuate over 1 million people from 14 districts. Several teams of aid and rescue workers have also been deployed to the state, which is prone to severe cyclones and storms. The government is fully prepared to tackle the situation. You are in safe hands, Majhi said. Indias eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the countrys coast. Last year was Indias deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated 2.5 billion in damage. Source: AP --Agencies",

Cyclone Dana made landfall in Odisha state around midnight with wind speeds of 100-110 kmph (62-68 mph), gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph), and is expected to weaken into a cyclonic storm by forenoon, the weather department said. Odisha had closed schools, suspended flights to and from its capital city of Bhubaneswar until Friday morning, and evacuated more than half a million people in anticipation of the storm. We dont have any reports of damage to life or property, only damage to trees. Power in the affected area will be restored by late afternoon, said Dilip Routrai, administrative chief of the region where the cyclone made landfall. Heavy rainfall also lashed parts of the neighbouring state of West Bengal and, accompanied by a surge in the sea water, left low lying areas inundated, damaging the standing paddy crop that was almost ready for harvest in some fields. Winter vegetables also perished in large agricultural tracts because of heavy rains and storm surge of the sea water that entered many areas in the Sunderbans belt, said Bankim Hazra, minister for Sunderban Affairs. Flight operations resumed on Friday morning at the airports in Bhubaneswar and the West Bengal capital Kolkata, where too they were suspended since Thursday evening. Severe storms pummel the coasts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh during the cyclone season from April to December each year, damaging both life and property. Odisha saw its worst cyclone in recent years in 1999, which raged for 30 hours and killed 10,000 people. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

A32-673 was fitted with an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance pod before delivery to the Sri Lankan Air Force. In 2023, fourteen years after handing its four Beechcraft 350 Super King Air aircraft to Air Force, the Australian Army once again decided it needs a fixed-wing support capability. Defence released an Expressions of Interest (EOI) FCOMDEOI371711(Army Aviation General Fixed Wing Support) to industry with the aim of leasing up to two single-engine aircraft, with the capability intended to become available earlier this year. Under the EOI, Army Aviation sought aircraft with the ability to carry small loads (less than 10 people or 1,000 kg of cargo) with good short take off and landing (STOL) capabilities to allow operations from unprepared and austere airfields across northern Australia.

        "content": "Sri Lanka has made significant progress in implementing economic reforms, positioning itself to advance quickly toward the third review of the Sri Lanka EFF program, which is coming up soon, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Thursday. Krishna Srinivasan, director of the International Monetary Funds Asia and Pacific Department, noted that when the new government took office recently, he led a high level team to Colombo to discuss and to engage with the authorities. He stated that they some very productive discussions with the new government and its team and that the discussions are continuing this week during the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings. Now, there was broad consensus, I would say unanimous consensus, that Sri Lanka, which was tearing at the abyss in 2022, has come a long way in terms of undertaking reforms which have led to some hard won gains, as you can know. Youll note that growth has been positive the last four quarters. Inflation is coming down. So there is consensus that the new government, you know from the new government that it would like to safeguard and build on the hard won gains under the program, Srinivasan said. He stated that under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program they have elements which address some of the priorities of the new government, including in terms of social protection and so on. But the details on the program are continuing and theyll be happening this week in Washington, he added. And we are encouraged by what we have heard so far and hoping that, you know, we can move fast towards the third review which will come up soon, he told a press briefing during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. In response to a question on Sri Lankas debt restructuring, Srinivasan noted that the government has reached agreements with the official creditors, an agreement in principle with the private creditors and that the next step would be to reach a formal agreement with all creditors. And thats a big step forward. And of course thats not the end. Theres a lot more work to be done in terms of continuing with the reforms because a long way to go before youre on the path of strong and sustainable recovery, he emphasized. Asked about macro linked bonds, he stated this is something which is a negotiation between the countrys creditors, the countrys advisors and the creditors. We dont get involved in the kind of instruments that they negotiate on and so on and so forth. What we are concerned about is whether these instruments and the restructuring they reach are one consistent with our program targets on debt and so on, and that theres comparability of treatment across creditors. However, he acknowledged that macro linked bonds have become popular and that it all depends, country to country, how the creditors and advisors go about it. So its not for me to say that this is going to be the future of all debt restructuring. It varies from country to country. Weve seen plain vanilla bonds being exchanged and you have these kind of bonds in other countries, Srinivasan said.",

        "content": "Four astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a nearly eight-month space station stay extended by Boeings capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton. A SpaceX capsule carrying the crew parachuted before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the International Space Station mid-week. The three Americans and one Russian should have been back two months ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeings new Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high wind and rough seas. SpaceX launched the four NASAs Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russias Alexander Grebenkin in March. Barratt, the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support teams back home that had to replan, retool and kind of redo everything right along with us  and helped us to roll with all those punches. Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four will remain up there until February. The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven four Americans and three Russians after months of overflow. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 25, 2024 06:04 pm",
        "content": "Argentinas police raided the Buenos Aires hotel where ex-One Direction singer Liam Payne stayed before dying last week after falling from a third-floor balcony, a government official said Thursday. A police special investigations unit went to the Casa Sur hotel Wednesday night on orders from the public prosecutors office. Officers seized items including computer hard drives and footage from hotel cameras, a government official told The Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to speak publicly. The singer died Oct. 16 after falling from the third-floor balcony in the up-market, touristy Palermo district. According to the autopsy, Payne died from multiple injuries as well as both internal and external bleeding caused by the fall. His body was found in the hotels internal courtyard. Initial investigations suggest that the musician was alone and experiencing a breakdown due to consumption of substances that have not yet been determined. Following Paynes death, police found substances in his hotel room, as well as several destroyed objects and furniture, according to the public prosecutors office. The British boyband star had cocaine in his system, according to a preliminary toxicology report published by local press Monday and confirmed to the AP by a source familiar. Definitive results arent expected to be made public for several weeks. The Casa Sur hotel has become a place for Paynes fans to pay their respects. They have left flowers, candles and photos of the singer in a makeshift shrine around a tree at the hotels entrance. The singers father, Geoff Payne, is in Buenos Aires arranging the repatriation of his sons body, which is expected to be released around Oct. 28. Paynes family which includes his mother Karen Payne and his two sisters Ruth and Nicola have expressed their devastation over the loss, as have his former bandmates. Artists and celebrities from various countries continue to share their grief. One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson pursued a solo career. The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horans concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.

        "title": "Israeli strikes kill 38 people in Gazas Khan Younis and 3 journalists in southern Lebanon",
        "date": "October 25, 2024 07:09 pm",
        "content": "Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday as growing worries about supply shortages in Gaza and international pressure for a cease-fire mounted. The deaths reported by Gaza health officials were the latest in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where people have in recent days lined up for bread outside the citys only bakery in operation. They come a day after United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of effectively dismantling Hamas and implored both sides to revive negotiations. Also on Friday, an Israeli airstrike on guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon killed three media staffers working for news outlets that are seen as aligned with Lebanons Hezbollah group and its patron, Iran. Outside of now-collapsed buildings rented by various media outlets, cars marked PRESS lay covered in dust and rubble after the strike, Associated Press photos showed. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike. Representatives of the news networks and Lebanese politicians accused Israel of war crimes and intentionally targeting journalists. These were just journalists that were sleeping in bed after long days of covering the conflict, said Imran Khan, a senior correspondent for Al Jazeera English who was among the journalists in the compound. In a social media post, he said he and his team were unhurt. The Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida were among the journalists killed early Friday. Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike on the Hasbaya region. Al-Mayadeens director Ghassan bin Jiddo alleged that the Israeli strike on a compound housing journalists was intentional and directed at those covering elements of its military offensive. He vowed that the Beirut-based station, a pan-Arab broadcaster seen as aligned with Hezbollah, would continue its work. The strike occurred hours after the Israeli militarys Arabic language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, directly challenged Al-Mayadeen war correspondent Ali Mortada in online posts and referred to him as my enemy in English. The X post ended with the English phrase Take care. Mortada was not involved in the strike. Lebanons Information Minister Ziad Makary said the journalists were killed while broadcasting what he called Israels crimes, and noted they were among a large group of members of the media. This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions, he wrote in a post on X. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manars well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israels crimes, Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. The Hasbaya region has been spared much of the violence along the border and many of the journalists now staying there have moved from the nearby town of Marjayoun that has been subjected to sporadic strikes in recent weeks. Earlier in the week, a strike hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beiruts southern suburbs, according to Lebanons Health Ministry. Lebanons Health Minister said Friday that 11 journalists have been killed and eight wounded since exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border in early October 2023. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from Frances international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatars Al-Jazeera TV. The killing of journalists has prompted international outcry from press advocacy groups and United Nations experts, although Israel has said it does not deliberately target them. On Thursday, the Committee to Protect Journalists said it had preliminarily counted 128 journalists killed in Gaza since the war began. Israel has accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region. The Committee to Protect Journalists has dismissed them as well, and said that Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israels retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The Israeli campaign has since expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion Oct. 1, after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. Lebanese health officials reported another day of intense airstrikes and shelling Thursday, which they said killed 19 people over 24 hours and raised the overall Lebanese death toll to 2,593 since October 2023.

        "title": "Israel launches strikes on Iran, risking escalation in Mideast wars",
        "date": "October 26, 2024 07:25 am",
        "content": "Israel pounded Iran with a series of airstrikes early Saturday, saying it was targeting military targets in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though there was no immediate information on damage or casualties. The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran  including Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon are already at war with Israel. The Israeli military said Saturday it had launched precise strikes on military targets and, according to two Israeli officials, it was not targeting nuclear or oil facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the ongoing operation with the media. The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since Oct. 7 ... including direct attacks from Iranian soil, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a prerecorded video statement. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Initially, nuclear facilities and oil installations all had been seen as possible targets for Israels response to Irans Oct. 1 attack, but in mid-October the Biden administration believed it had won assurances from Israel that it would not hit such targets. Irans state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television offered no other details and even began showing what it described as live footage of men loading trucks at a vegetable market in Tehran in an attempt to downplay the assault. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. People in Tehran could see what appeared to be tracer fire light up the sky as the blasts could be heard. Other footage showed what appeared to be surface-to-air missiles launching up to the sky and other detonations. Iran closed the countrys airspace early Saturday, and flight-tracking data analyzed by the Associated Press showed commercial airlines had broadly left the skies over Iran, and across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed and would continue to receive updates. In Syria, the state news agency SANA, citing an unnamed military official, reported barrages of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories targeted some military sites in the southern and central regions early Saturday. It said that Syrias air defenses had shot some of the missiles down. There was no immediate information on casualties. Iran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel in recent months amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That initial attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage back to the seaside enclave. In the time since, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials who dont delineate between civilians and combatants. The U.N. has said hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped with little food or supplies as Israeli forces close in on the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya, while food and other aid remains scarce in the enclave. Israeli military operations in the West Bank in the time since have killed hundreds more. Israel also has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon and a series of punishing airstrikes that have rattled that country. The strike Saturday happened just as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was arriving back in the U.S. after a tour of the Middle East where he and other U.S. officials had warned Israel to tender a response that would not further escalate the conflict in the region and exclude nuclear sites in Iran. White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement that we understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran and referred reporters to the Israeli government for more details on their operation. Two U.S. officials said the U.S. was notified by Israel in advance of the strikes. They said there was no U.S. involvement in the operation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. Israel had vowed to hit Iran hard following a massive Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1. Iran said its barrage was in response to deadly Israeli attacks against its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and it has promised to respond to any retaliatory strikes. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders calls for Israels destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the countrys nuclear program. Israel and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemens Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. But since Hamas Oct. 7 attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel last April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel under pressure from Western countries to show restraint responded with a limited strike. But after Irans early October missile strike, Israel promised a tougher response. Meanwhile Friday, Israeli strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. In northern Gaza, health officials reported that Israeli forces had raided Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the few medical facilities still functioning in the area. Israel has renewed its offensive against Hamas in the north in recent weeks, and aid groups are sounding the alarm over dire humanitarian conditions. In Lebanon, Israeli strikes on the countrys southeast killed three journalists working for news outlets that are considered to be aligned with Hezbollah. Source: AP Agencies",

        "title": "Iran raises the death toll from Israels attack to 4, all from its military air defense",
        "date": "October 26, 2024 10:29 pm",
        "content": "Iran has raised the death toll from Israels attack to four and said all served in the countrys military air defense. The state-run IRNA news agency announced the deaths Saturday night. It offered no details on where the four men were stationed in the country. Israel attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. The strikes marked the first time Israels military has openly attacked Iran. Following the airstrikes, Irans Foreign Ministry said it had a right to self-defense, and considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression. There was no official statement by the Revolutionary Guards commanders. Israels military said it targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or nuclear sites were hit, which would have marked a much more serious escalation. Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise. The Islamic Republic said the attacks caused limited damage. Irans military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating. Irans army said two soldiers were killed, Irans Al-Alam television reported. The strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran  including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon  are already at war with Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like they didnt hit anything but military targets. He said he had just finished a call with intelligence officials. I hope this is the end, he said. Israels first open attack on Iran Iran hadnt faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran made a big mistake. Israel is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. He added: If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. Images released by Israels military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes. Israels attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Avivs Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israels National Security Council. It also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Irans capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited. Israel has again shown its military precision and capabilities are superior to Irans, said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. By targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now, Vakil said. This is a sign that the diplomacy and back-channel efforts to moderate the strike were successful. Bidens administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations. After the strikes, the streets in Irans capital were calm and children went to school and shops opened. There were long lines at the gas stations  a regular occurrence in Tehran when military violence flares as people stock up on fuel. But some Tehran residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter. Mixed reactions at home and abroad Israels opposition leader, Yair Lapid, criticized the decision to avoid strategic and economic targets, saying on X that we could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran. The United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. All acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop, the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said. Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Irans sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms. Both Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israels attack, with Hezbollah saying it would not affect Tehrans support for Lebanese and Palestinians fighting Israel. Regional tensions have been soaring in recent weeks. In Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollahs longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Enemies for decades Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders calls for Israels destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the countrys nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East, which later grew into the attacks by Yemens Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all hostages are freed. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who dont differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children.

        "title": "At least 124 killed after Sudans RSF attack village, activists say",
        "date": "October 26, 2024 10:39 pm",
        "content": "Sudans paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) killed at least 124 people in a village in El Gezira State on Friday, activists said, in one of the deadliest incidents of an 18-month war and largest in a spate of attacks in the state. Following the surrender of high-ranking RSF officer Abuagla Keikal to the army last Sunday, pro-democracy activists said the RSF has carried out revenge attacks in the farming state where he comes from, killing and detaining civilians and displacing thousands. Gezira has already faced a months-long rampage in which residents told Reuters the RSF looted homes, killed scores of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands. Al-Sireha village, in the north of the state, experienced the worst of the recent violence when at least 124 were killed and 100 injured in the RSF raid, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, a pro-democracy group, said on Saturday. In a statement on Friday, the RSF accused the army of arming civilians in Gezira and of using forces under Keikals command, prompting its attacks. The army and the RSF did not respond to requests for comment. The RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan in a conflict with the army that the United Nations says has caused one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises. The war has displaced more than 11 million people, driven parts of the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers that have given both sides material support. It began in April 2023 when tensions between the RSF and the army, who had previously shared power, erupted into open conflict at a time when Sudan should have been transitioning to civilian rule after a 2021 coup. The RSF militia is raiding east, west, and central Gezira, and committing extensive massacres in one village after another, the committee said. Images on social media shared by the committee and others purported to show dozens of bodies wrapped for burial and mass graves being dug. The people of Gezira are facing genocide by the Rapid Support Forces and it is impossible to treat the injured or even evacuate them for treatment. Those who have left on foot have died or are faced with death, said the Sudanese Doctors Union, calling for safe passages. A video circulated on social media purported to show an RSF soldier who said he was in Sireha and who filmed troops lining up men of all ages at gunpoint, using racial epithets, and forcing them to bleat like goats. Another video, shared by the resistance committee, showed an RSF soldier pulling an elderly man to his feet by his beard. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the videos. Sudans Combating Violence Against Women Unit, a government body, said in a statement it had received reports of RSF soldiers raping women in Gezira villages as a tactic to humiliate the men and drive people out of the area. Keikals defection occurred as the army renewed a push to regain territory across the country. Sudanese army general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan posted on X late on Friday that as more civilian blood was spilled, the Sudanese peoples determination to resist the RSF grew stronger. But his comments were met with a wave of criticism that the army had not protected civilians in Gezira or elsewhere in the country. The RSF is accused by the United States and others of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing, particularly in West Darfur. The army is also accused of war crimes after carrying out extensive airstrike campaigns that have frequently lead to high civilian death tolls but done little to push the RSF back. We are monitoring the latest, shocking RSF attacks on civilians in Gezira. The killings and sexual violence are reprehensible, the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello said on X, adding both the RSF and army were failing to protect civilians.
