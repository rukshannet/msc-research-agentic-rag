        "title": "Senegal election: Opposition supporters march in Dakar calling for swift vote",
        "date": "February 17, 2024 08:59 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Senegals capital, Dakar, demanding swift presidential elections. It comes after the countrys top court blocked President Macky Salls attempt to postpone the election, originally scheduled for this month. Mr Salls last minute decree, backed by parliament, had triggered a political crisis in Senegal, once regarded as a bastion of democracy in West Africa. On Saturday, opposition supporters held signs demanding a Free Senegal. It is the first rally allowed by authorities since Mr Salls announcement two weeks ago. Todays watchword is mobilisation, said presidential candidate Malick Gakou on the march. He told the AFP news agency there was no room for error any longer and elections must be organised in March in order for the handover of power between President Sall and his successor on 2 April - when the presidents second term in office is set to expire. Protesters in Dakar wore T-shirts emblazoned with the words Protect our election - named after the collective organisation of religious and civil groups opposed to Mr Salls controversial decree. On 3 February, Mr Sall announced he was pushing back the election date - originally scheduled for 25 February - because of concerns over the eligibility of opposition candidates. His proposal was supported by 105 out of the 165 MPs after a fiery debate which saw police remove some opposition MPs from the chamber. A six-month postponement was originally proposed, but a last-minute amendment extended it to 10 months, meaning a new election date of 15 December. That was until the Constitutional Council stepped in on Thursday, annulling Mr Salls decree and voiding the contentious parliamentary bill. A new date for the elections has not yet been given, but in its ruling the Constitutional Council said the president could not stay in power beyond the end of his term on 2 April. The West African body, Ecowas, France and the European Union all urged Mr Sall to comply with the decision. Mr Sall has promised to consult and come up with a revised election date. But the disputes which led to the postponement in the first place remain unresolved, including allegations of corruption in the Constitutional Council and objections from opposition figures who had been excluded from the candidate list. Holding the election using the disputed candidate list could spark renewed unrest and violence by those barred from standing. Most candidates have not been campaigning since Mr Salls 3 February decree. Widespread protests gripped the country in recent days, with many ending in violence and a large number of arrests. Three people have been killed in the demonstrations. However, tensions have eased since the court intervened and the authorities approved Saturdays march. There was a strong, visible security force presence, but they did not wear riot gear as they had at previous demonstrations. Senegal is considered one of West Africas more stable democracies and is the only country in the region never to have had a military coup. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "February 17, 2024 09:46 pm",
        "content": "Amid a rejuvenated focus on revitalizing Sri Lankas tourism industry, President Ranil Wickremesinghe embarked on an observation tour in the Tangalle and Galle areas today (17 Feb.), underscoring the governments commitment to enhancing tourist facilities. During the tour, President Wickremesinghe visited several tourist hotels, engaging with owners to understand their challenges first hand. Swift action was taken as the President addressed the concerns raised by the business community, liaising with relevant officials over the phone to devise solutions and gather input on industry development strategies, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The tourism sector in Sri Lanka faced a rapid downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic challenges. However, with the governments new initiatives, there has been a significant surge in tourist arrivals. In 2023 alone, 1,489,000 tourists visited Sri Lanka, marking a twofold increase from the previous year. Building on this momentum, the government aims to surpass the peak of 2.5 million tourists in 2017, with plans underway to achieve this milestone by 2024. In a bid to attract high-end tourists, who spend 500 a day, the government has rolled out infrastructure development projects and innovative tourism promotion programs. President Wickremesinghe exchanged ideas with the business community regarding these initiatives, receiving positive feedback on the transformative impact of the governments programs on their operations. The Presidents itinerary included visits to tourist hotspots such as Seenimodara, Dikwella, Nilwella, Hiriketiya, Weligama, and Habaraduwa, as well as the Weligama Surf School along the south coast, where he assessed their activities firsthand. At the Unawatuna Tourism Zone, President Wickremesinghe engaged in brief conversations with foreign tourists, soliciting their perspectives on measures to further promote the tourism industry. Additionally, he interacted with local tourists at Tangalle and Galle beaches during the weekend holidays, attentively listening to their feedback and addressing their concerns. Accompanying the President on this pivotal visit was Mr. Jeffry Dobbs, a foreigner dedicated to enhancing tourist experiences in the region for both local and international tourists. President Ranil Wickremesinghes tour underscores the governments proactive approach to revitalizing Sri Lankas tourism sector, fostering collaboration with stakeholders and ensuring sustainable growth in the industry.",

        "content": "Thailands convicted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was released on parole on Sunday, six months after his return to the country from self-exile. Xinhua reporters observed that a car carrying Thaksin left a police hospital in Bangkok at 6:06 a.m. local time on Sunday, where he received medical treatment and served six months of his one-year prison sentence. Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin previously said that the release on parole of Thaksin was in line with the law, Xinhua news agency reported. According to the countrys Justice Ministry, the 74-year-old former Prime Minister is among the 930 inmates approved for parole this month. He is eligible for parole as he is over 70-years-old and suffers from a serious illness. Thaksin ended his exile of more than 15 years and returned to Thailand in August last year, but was soon detained and faced an eight-year prison sentence on several charges. However, shortly after his return, he was transferred from a Bangkok prison to a hospital due to health concerns. Last September, Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn reduced Thaksins eight-year prison sentence to one year following his request for a royal pardon. Thaksin served as the Southeast Asian countrys Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006 and had been in self-exile abroad since 2008. (IANS) --Agencies",

        "date": "February 18, 2024 11:28 am",
        "content": "The United Nations Security Council is likely to vote on Tuesday on an Algerian push for the 15-member body to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, said diplomats, a move the United States signaled it would veto. Algeria put forward an initial draft resolution more than two weeks ago. But U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield quickly said the text could jeopardize sensitive negotiations aimed at brokering a pause in the war. Algeria requested on Saturday that the council vote on Tuesday, diplomats said. To be adopted, U.N. Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia. The United States does not support action on this draft resolution. Should it come up for a vote as drafted, it will not be adopted, Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement on Saturday. Washington traditionally shields its ally Israel from U.N. action and has already twice vetoed council action since Oct. 7. But it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions that aimed to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in fighting. Talks between the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar are on to seek a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas. It is critical that other parties give this process the best odds of succeeding, rather than push measures that put it - and the opportunity for an enduring resolution of hostilities - in jeopardy, Thomas-Greenfield said. The Gaza war began when fighters from the Hamas militant group that runs Gaza attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. In retaliation, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that health authorities say has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians with thousands more bodies feared lost amid the ruins. The likely council vote comes as Israel also plans to storm Rafah in southern Gaza, where more than 1 million Palestinians have sought shelter, prompting international concern that such a move would sharply worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The situation in Gaza is an appalling indictment of the deadlock in global relations, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Munich Security Conference on Friday. When asked to explain, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres was pointing the finger at the lack of unity in the Security Council and how that lack of unity has hampered our ability ... to improve situations around the world.

The female suspect, identified as a friend of Piyum Hasthikas wife, was arrested upon her arrival in the country from Dubai, police reported, adding that the CID had subsequently recorded a statement from her for nearly four hours. According to police, Piyuma had revealed a series of important facts about the crimes he committed, adding that he and the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu have been childhood friends. Piyuma was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai on 15 February, after which the CID secured a 72-hour detention order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) from the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. According to the Public Security Ministry, the criminal suspect was brought back to the island by a special team of the CID. As per police records, Piyuma was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months. He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that Piyuma had fled to Dubai to evade arrest. In June 2022, Piyuma was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of Kudu Salindu for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa. On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend and repatriate Piyuma to Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "February 18, 2024 08:27 pm",
        "content": "Atom-bomb epic Oppenheimer could smash a 53-year-old record at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday if it makes good on its field-leading 13 nominations. Christopher Nolan s biopic of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer is up for trophies including best film, best director and best actor for star Cillian Murphy. A good night could see it surpass the record nine awards won by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1971. It faces stiff competition from Gothic fantasia Poor Things, which has 11 nominations including best film, director for Yorgos Lanthimos and actress for Emma Stone. Historical epic Killers of the Flower Moon and Holocaust drama  The Zone of Interest have nine nominations each for the prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards.  Barbie, one half of 2023s Barbenheimer box office juggernaut and the years top-grossing film, has five nominations but missed out on nods for best picture and best director. Many see the omission of Barbie director Greta Gerwig  for both the BAFTAs and the Oscars  as a major snub. The ceremony, hosted by Doctor Who star David Tennant, will be a glitzy, British-accented appetizer for Hollywoods Academy Awards, closely watched for hints about who might win at the Oscars on March 10. Nominees including Bradley Cooper, Carey Mulligan, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Rosamund Pike, Ryan Gosling and Ayo Edebiri are expected on the red carpet at Londons Royal Festival Hall, along with presenters that include Andrew Scott, Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris Elba. Guest of honor will be Prince William, in his role as president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Hell be without his wife, Kate, who is recovering after abdominal surgery last month. Other leading contenders include French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, boarding school coming-of-age drama The Holdovers and Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro  each with seven nominations  and grief-flecked love story All of Us Strangers with six. Barbed class-war comedy Saltburn  has five nominations. The best film race pits Oppenheimer against Poor Things, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall and The Holdovers. Poor Things is also on the 10-strong list for the separate category of best British film, an eclectic slate that includes class-war dramedy Saltburn, imperial epic Napoleon, south London romcom Rye Lane and chocolatier origin story Wonka, among others. Britains film academy introduced changes to increase the awards diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. But there is only one woman among the six best-director nominees: Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall. Gerwig, Emerald Fennell for Saltburn and Celine Song for star-crossed romance Past Lives all failed to make the list. A woman of color could take the best actress BAFTA for the first time, with Fantasia Barrino for The Color Purple and Vivian Oparah for Rye Lane nominated alongside Sandra Hüller for Anatomy of a Fall, Mulligan for Maestro, Margot Robbie for Barbie and Stone for Poor Things. No British performers are nominated in the best-actor category, but Ireland is represented by Murphy for Oppenheimer and Barry Keoghan for Saltburn. Theyre up against Cooper for Maestro, Colman Domingo for civil rights biopic Rustin, Paul Giamatti for The Holdovers and Teo Yoo for Past Lives. Harrowing Ukraine war documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, produced by The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, is nominated for best documentary and best film not in the English language. The ceremony is set to include musical performances by Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, the latter singing her 2001 hit Murder on the Dancefloor, which shot back up the charts after featuring in Saltburn. Samantha Morton will receive the academys highest honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, and film curator June Givanni, founder of the June Givanni PanAfrican Cinema Archive, will be honored for outstanding British contribution to cinema. Sundays ceremony will be broadcast on BBC One in the U.K. from 1900GMT, and on streaming service BritBox in the U.S., Canada, Australia and South Africa. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "title": "Diego Garcia asylum seekers feel unsafe on remote British island territory",
        "date": "February 18, 2024 10:00 pm",
        "content": "A group of asylum seekers including Sri Lankan nationals on an isolated British island territory have told UN investigators they feel unsafe and forgotten, as they reported sexual assaults and harassment of children, as well as self-harm and suicide attempts. Inspectors from the UNs refugee agency visited Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to check on their welfare. A draft report says that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention. The Foreign Office said the island was not suitable for migrants to live on. Other than the migrant camp, the island is used as a UK-US military base. Thousands of troops are stationed there, usually on a one-year deployment, along with a smaller number of military contractors. For all allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers. Civilian visitors are not allowed - and the island has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK relocated all the people living there so it could develop the base. The 61 people currently in the island camp are mostly Sri Lankan Tamils and the first of them landed on Diego Garcia in October 2021 after their boat ran into trouble while trying to sail to Canada, according to migrants and officials. Their subsequent asylum claims were the first ever to be launched on British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) - an area described as being constitutionally distinct and separate from the UK, and where the UK government argues that the refugee convention does not apply. In its response to the UN report on the asylum seekers, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: BIOT is not a suitable location for migrants, which is why we have been working tirelessly to process the migrants claims for protection and to find a suitable third country for those whose claims are upheld. At all times, the welfare and safety of migrants on BIOT has been our top priority. UNHCR - the UN Refugee Agency - says the visit by its inspectors in late November marked the first time an external party had gained access to the island to monitor conditions there since the asylum seekers arrival. The draft report it produced following its visit was released to the BBC by the supreme court of BIOT. Sexual violence likely under-reported During its visit, UNHCR representatives heard several allegations of sexual assault and harassment, with alleged victims including young children. In all instances, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers, the report says. It adds that there was likely to be an under-reporting of sexual violence because of shame and stigma, and a view among asylum seekers that there would not be an effective response. It was clear from speaking to asylum seekers, both the general population and those who had made allegations, that they did not see anything to be gained by reporting, both in terms of justice and safety, including due to the fact that alleged perpetrators of sexual assault remain living in the camp alongside alleged victims, the report says. A decision made last July to designate family tents and single male tents was a positive step but unlikely to be sufficient as a prevention mechanism, it notes, adding that there was little evidence of other preventive measures. In the UN report, the asylum seekers on the island, which is hundreds of miles away from any other population, describe being bitten by rats in a fenced-off camp and say that they are only permitted to leave it under security escort, even if they just want to walk to the beach. That has led to feelings of despair and incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts, the UNs draft report - one of the first detailed insights into conditions on the island - says. The group of asylum seekers, which includes 16 children, said they felt bored, depressed, and hopeless. Some said they felt forgotten, while one woman said: Many of us think about ending our lives. Some of the children told the inspectors they had witnessed violence and self-harm, and made multiple references to suicide during the UN visit, the draft report says. Some of them recalled a time when a security dog came to visit the camp and they watched it through the security fence. The children said that it made them sad that the dog was able to be outside the fence and they were not, the report says. The asylum seekers do not have access to the internet and have never met their lawyers in person. Until now, details of the conditions they are being held in have been scarce - recounted mainly in court hearings in the UK. A process has been established to determine if the group should be sent back to Sri Lanka or to a safe third country. The BBC last year established contact with multiple asylum seekers on the island, who described conditions there as hellish. UNHCR says it considers that the 61 Tamils on Diego Garcia are subject to deprivation of liberty. They reside in a closed place with no possibility to leave at will, which amounts to detention under international law, it explains. In its report, the UN agency says the conditions on the island fail to provide the necessary standards of privacy, safety and dignity. The draft report says asylum seekers are held in a fenced area of approximately 100m by 140m, and are barred from leaving unless with a security escort. Most of the children have never left the camp other than infrequent visits to the beach under security escort, the report says. The children showed UN representatives pictures they had drawn depicting the wired fence surrounding the camp and said their lives generally consisted of eating meals with their families, walking to the education tent for classes and then returning to their own tent. Living here is like living in hell, a mother is quoted as saying. Children go to bed late and in the night do not sleep because they do not feel at peace. And that is because the children feel that we as parents are not at peace. The asylum seekers are given three meals a day, and do not have the option to cook their own food. UNHCR observers found the meals to be varied and nutritional, but asylum seekers complained that the meals were sometimes not culturally appropriate, and that they had no say in what they ate. We think it may be better to die The UN report describes a deterioration in mental health in the camp, and observers saw signs of clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The draft report says that while children in the camp appeared playful and responsive there were worrying signs that living in an enclosed environment, in close proximity to adults who were suffering from poor mental health was having an impact on their emotional health. Children have witnessed violence and self-harm. They are aware that many of the adults, including in some cases their own parents, have tried to end their lives. During the UNs visit, one teenage girl asked a UNHCR representative: Do you think that if I kill myself, my brother and parents could go to another country where they would have a better life? Asylum seekers, including children, told the UN they often feel their suffering is without end, and frequently consider the idea of purposely inflicting bodily harm or ending their life. Medical services on the island reported 21 incidents of self-harm between May and October 2023. I feel I am alive on the outside but dead from inside. My body hurts me, and if the pains will further increase, I may have to hurt myself to end this all, one man said. Several people have been transferred to Rwanda - a 3,000-mile flight away - for medical care following self-harm and suicide attempts. Those who have had their claims for international protection approved are still waiting for a third country - where they can have a new life - to be identified. Not a safe place UNHCR frequently heard concerns that asylum seekers felt they had been forgotten on the island and had no way to speak up about their current conditions or perceived injustices. The UN report acknowledges that the sudden arrival of asylum seekers on Diego Garcia presented enormous challenges and says important efforts were pursued to ensure that those who wished to make international protection claims were able to do so and that services such as medical care were made available. But, it says, the existing situation is not tenable. Its draft report calls for the asylum seekers to be urgently relocated, for final decisions on international protection to be expedited, and solutions secured for those whose claims are approved. It also calls for the UK government to conduct contingency planning for possible future arrivals on the island, and for an independent mechanism to be established to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers. One of the groups lawyers, Tessa Gregory, from London firm Leigh Day, said she was extremely concerned about their wellbeing, describing conditions on the island as appalling. Lawyers had been denied access to visit their clients on the island, she added. The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains the islands are its own and the UNs highest court has ruled that the UKs administration of the territory is unlawful and must end. UNHCR says its visit to the island does not constitute recognition of BIOT. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "February 19, 2024 12:07 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations top court on Monday opens a week of hearings on the legal consequences of Israels occupation of Palestinian territories, with more than 50 states due to address the judges. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki will speak first in the legal proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly asked the court for an advisory, or non-binding, opinion on the occupation. While Israel has ignored such opinions in the past, it could pile on political pressure over its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed about 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, since Oct.7. Among countries scheduled to participate in the hearings are the United States - Israels strongest supporter, China, Russia, South Africa and Egypt. Israel will not, although it has sent written observations. The hearings are part of a Palestinian push to get international legal institutions to examine Israels conduct, which has become more urgent since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel, which killed 1,200 people, and Israels military response. They also come amid mounting concerns about an Israeli ground offensive against the Gaza city of Rafah, a last refuge for more than a million Palestinians after they fled to the south of the enclave to avoid Israeli assaults. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 war. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but, along with neighbouring Egypt, still controls its borders. It is the second time the U.N. General Assembly has asked the ICJ, also known as the World Court, for an advisory opinion related to the occupied Palestinian territory. In July 2004, the court found that Israels separation wall in the West Bank violated international law and should be dismantled, though it still stands to this day. Judges have now been asked to review Israels occupation, settlement and annexation...including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures. Since 1967, Israel has greatly expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank - an action Palestinians say compromises the creation of a viable Palestinian state. It has also annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised by most countries. The General Assembly also asked the ICJs 15-judge panel to advise on how those policies and practices affect the legal status of the occupation and what legal consequences arise for all countries and the United Nations from this status. The advisory opinion proceedings are separate from the genocide case that South Africa filed at the World Court against Israel for its alleged violations in Gaza of the 1948 Genocide Convention. In late January the ICJ in that case ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. The outcome of the advisory opinion would not be legally binding but would carry great legal weight and moral authority, according to the ICJ. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasised the need to uphold the social and economic rights of the Indian-origin Tamil community. The President made these remarks at the inauguration ceremony of the fourth phase of the Indian housing project Bharat-Lanka, held at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday (19 Jan.). Commenting in this regard, the Head of State noted that the government is actively initiating this process, with negotiations currently underway with estate companies to acquire land for the construction of these houses. Consequently, we anticipate commencing related housing programs in the near future. The Tamil community of Indian Origin, who have made significant contributions to the countrys economy, have unfortunately suffered great losses due to the lack of land and housing ownership. Today, they have been deprived of their political rights, but it is imperative that their economic and social rights are upheld, President Wickremesinghe said. He further revealed that discussions are also underway to find solutions for the issues faced by those in the North East, and the Tamil and Muslim communities residing in the Upcountry region, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Speaking on the recent economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged that while acute hardships were faced for a certain period of time, Sri Lanka has now overcome bankruptcy and resumed economic activities, with significant financial aid from India. It is crucial to acknowledge that our progress from the recent economic crisis was significantly aided by the financial support provided by India. Without this assistance, our path forward would indeed be challenging, he said in this regard. Attached below is the full speech made by President Wickremesinghe: On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the arrival of the Upcountry Tamil Community to Sri Lanka, the Indian government has generously provided support for this housing project. I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of India for this gesture. The Tamil community of Indian Origin, who have made significant contributions to the countrys economy, have unfortunately suffered great losses due to the lack of land and housing ownership. Today, they have been deprived of their political rights, but it is imperative that their economic and social rights are upheld. The government is actively initiating this process, starting with negotiations with estate companies to acquire land for the construction of these houses. Consequently, we anticipate commencing related housing programs in the near future. Furthermore, the government has prioritized the advancement of education in the estate sector. Education levels within estates lag behind those in other regions, necessitating the establishment of equitable educational standards across all schools. Moreover, its essential to recognize that not all upcountry residents engage in plantation work. Thus, efforts must extend to providing opportunities for youth, including access to education and vocational training, particularly geared towards international employment opportunities. Currently under deliberation is the decision between continued plantation labour or the provision of land plots as per the plantation agreement, aiming to elevate individuals to the status of small tea plantation owners. This initiative seeks to foster economic empowerment and equality among upcountry communities. Our aim is to convene all political representatives and present unified proposals devoid of party divisions within the next month. The government is diligently addressing challenges one by one. Currently, discussions are underway to find solutions for the issues facing the people of the North East. Simultaneously, we must prepare to advance the nations economy by addressing the concerns of the Tamils and Muslim communities residing in the Upcountry region. While we faced hardships for a period, we have now overcome bankruptcy and resumed economic activities. Upon assuming office, the nation grappled with shortages of food and fuel. Today, however, we have successfully overcome these shortages. As we implement economic programs, challenges such as tax burdens arise. Nevertheless, this burden is not permanent and in a matter of months, relief will be provided to the people. It is crucial to acknowledge that our progress from the recent economic crisis was significantly aided by the financial support provided by India. Without this assistance, our path forward would indeed be challenging. Furthermore, we are actively engaged in enhancing our economic ties with India, particularly during this period of Indias rapid economic development. During our discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we extensively deliberated on bolstering the relationship between our two nations. In conclusion, I express my heartfelt gratitude once again to the Government of India for their invaluable support in initiating this program.",

        "date": "February 19, 2024 09:13 pm",
        "content": "US Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Elizabeth Allen has raised concerns that several aspects of the freedom of expression are currently under threat globally, including certain concerns in Sri Lanka. Speaking at an event hosted by the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) Press Club themed The Global Media Space and its Impact on Democracy, Under Secretary Allen stated that several essential freedoms are under threat globally, including in Sri Lanka. Globally, were witnessing serious and escalating challenges to media freedom. The United States stands firmly for the freedom of expression, advocating for press freedom both online and offline, and ensuring the safety of journalists and media workers worldwide. Unfortunately, these essential freedoms are under threat globally, including concerns raised here in Sri Lanka, she said. Speaking on the recent passage of the Online Safety Bill in Sri Lanka, the US Under Secretary recalled that the US government voiced concerns over its potential effects on freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy. When governments intensify efforts to withhold information from the public by restricting internet access and censoring content, we must speak up, she noted. While highlighting that although there are several concerns against unfettered freedom of expression, Under Secretary Allen emphasised that Its essential to remember that a free press isnt an adversary to Sri Lanka; its one of its greatest allies, paving the way for a resilient and flourishing society. Its common to hear arguments against unfettered freedom of expression. Critics claim the media is biased, aiming to embarrass governments and undermine public trust. Others worry that without checks, freedom of expression may fuel the spread of misinformation. Some argue that an unchecked press can incite tension and compromise security. And theres concern that continuous reports on corruption, violence, and political strife can tarnish a nations image, deterring investment and hampering development, she said in this regard. Attached below is the US Under Secretarys full speech: Thank you, Kumar, for that warm introduction. Its fantastic to be here with everyone today, truly. And Ambassador Chung, thank you for your leadership in representing the American people in Sri Lanka. Im thrilled to be here today, thanks to the Sri Lanka Press Institute. Your dedication to journalisms craft is nothing short of inspiring. Know this: the U.S. Embassy is all in on supporting your incredible work. Sure, we might bump heads over a story now and then, but above all, were your biggest fans. Were all in on programs that hone your skills because we believe in your right to pursue journalism freely and fearlessly. As I find myself in front of a room of journalists, I want to thank you for protecting the rights and freedoms of journalists here in Sri Lanka and around the world, ensuring all citizens enjoy the right to express their ideas and opinions openly and freely. Even in difficult times, you continue to press forward and ask difficult questions. Your commitment to seeking out the truth and shouting it from the rooftops remains a democratic staple, and I truly appreciate what you do. Its only fitting that I begin my remarks this afternoon by telling a story that I think is relevant in light of todays topic about the medias role in a democracy. Over a century ago, American media coined the term muckraker for journalists who delved into societal issues, exposing corruption. Although the term carried a somewhat negative connotation, labeling these journalists as mere gossip mongers, today, we honor them as the pioneers of investigative journalism. These muckrakers played a pivotal role in ushering in the Progressive Era, a time of significant social and political reform in American history. Even President Theodore Roosevelt referred to them as muckrakers, criticizing their focus on societys flaws through figures like Lincoln Steffens, whose work shed light on corruption and spurred a nationwide call for accountability and reform. Steffens book The Shame of the Cities, published in 1904, made him renowned for uncovering corruption within American cities, highlighting the nefarious links between political leaders, businesses, and organized crime. His fearless journalism raised critical awareness about the urgent need for governmental and corporate accountability. Steffens wasnt acting as a public relations officer for the government; his role was to uncover the truth; however unpleasant it might be. Faced with the stark realities Steffens presented, American officials and the public were compelled to confront a pivotal question: Is this the kind of country we aspire to be? The resounding answer was no. Steffens work didnt just expose wrongdoing; it sparked a nationwide demand for reform and played a crucial role in fostering a dialogue about the essential role of investigative journalism in ensuring power remains accountable. This story showcases how freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not just fundamental human rights, they are also vital contributors to a countrys development and growth. This brings me to my main point: how the global media space supports democracy and fosters peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. In my mind, the correlation is obvious: When a government constricts the rights and freedoms of its citizens, the future and the development of the country will naturally suffer. Globally, were witnessing serious and escalating challenges to media freedom. The United States stands firmly for the freedom of expression, advocating for press freedom both online and offline, and ensuring the safety of journalists and media workers worldwide. Unfortunately, these essential freedoms are under threat globally, including concerns raised here in Sri Lanka. When governments intensify efforts to withhold information from the public by restricting internet access and censoring content, we must speak up. Notably, when Sri Lankas Parliament passed the Online Safety Bill in January, the United States voiced concerns over its potential effects on freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy. Its common to hear arguments against unfettered freedom of expression. Critics claim the media is biased, aiming to embarrass governments and undermine public trust. Others worry that without checks, freedom of expression may fuel the spread of misinformation. Some argue that an unchecked press can incite tension and compromise security. And theres concern that continuous reports on corruption, violence, and political strife can tarnish a nations image, deterring investment and hampering development. However, the medias bias should lean towards the publics interest, acting as a guardian to ensure that leaders fulfill their duties. This principle holds in Sri Lanka, the United States, and globally. The challenge of negative press, often labeled as fake news or biased journalism, is not new. For generations, governments and the media have navigated a complex, sometimes adversarial relationship. This dynamic isnt unique to any one nation; in the United States, for instance, presidents from both major political parties have experienced their share of friction with the press. This tension, a hallmark of democratic societies, plays a crucial role in fostering transparency and encouraging effective governance. Its a familiar scene: politicians and journalists engage in heated exchanges, especially when leaders feel their actions are misrepresented, leading to accusations of inaccuracies and biased reporting. The presss duty is to deliver facts as they stand, shedding light on the governments achievements as well as spotlighting areas where policies or programs fall short. This transparency not only informs the public but also strengthens the nation as it encourages constructive action and improvement. And suppressing voices only complicates matters further. Attempting to conceal issues rather than addressing them is akin to hiding a broken tool rather than fixing it. True progress comes from collaborative dialogue, even if it means embracing the messiness of public discourse. This was evident during my recent visit to IdeaHell here in Colombo, a hub for creative minds dubbed where good ideas go to die. My interaction with the young, innovative minds there underscored the critical need to protect the freedom for creators, journalists, and entrepreneurs to explore and innovate without fear. Yes, some good ideas die, but creators should be free to think and attempt and even fail. That is how we achieve progress. Overly broad and ambiguous limitations on expression can choke creativity, robbing society of potential advancements that fuel innovation and economic growth. A climate of censorship not only stifles innovation but also dampens the communitys spirit to solve pressing issues with novel solutions. I urge you to reflect on the initial spark that drew you to journalism. Its doubtful it was the allure of wealth or fame; more likely, it was a drive to enact change and contribute to Sri Lankas betterment. Should these be the forces that drive you, I implore you to persevere. Your dedication, your rights, and your freedom are pivotal to the nations ongoing growth and prosperity. Consider this: among you, who will emerge as the modern-day Lincoln Steffens? Who will pen the narratives that propel Sri Lankas economic and social advancement? That individual could very well be among us now, ready to champion free speech, press freedom, and the unbridled exchange of ideas. Its essential to remember that a free press isnt an adversary to Sri Lanka; its one of its greatest allies, paving the way for a resilient and flourishing society. Thank you.",

        "content": "The European Union will investigate whether ByteDances TikTok breached online content rules aimed at protecting children and ensuring transparent advertising, an official said on Monday, putting the social media platform at risk of a hefty fine. EU industry chief Thierry Breton said he took the decision after analysing the short video apps risk assessment report and its replies to requests for information, confirming a Reuters story. Today we open an investigation into TikTok over suspected breach of transparency  obligations to protect minors: addictive design  screen time limits, rabbit hole effect, age verification, default privacy settings, Breton said on X. The European Unions Digital Services Act (DSA), which applies to all online platforms since Feb. 17, requires in particular very large online platforms and search engines to do more to tackle illegal online content and risks to public security. TikToks owner, China-based ByteDance, could face fines of up to 6 of its global turnover if TikTok is found guilty of breaching DSA rules. TikTok said it would continue to work with experts and the industry to keep young people on its platform safe and that it looked forward to explaining this work in detail to the European Commission. TikTok has pioneered features and settings to protect teens and keep under 13s off the platform, issues the whole industry is grappling with, a TikTok spokesperson said. The European Commission said the investigation will focus on the design of TikToks system, including algorithmic systems which may stimulate behavioural addictions andor create so-called rabbit hole effects. It will also probe whether TikTok has put in place appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors. As well as the issue of protecting minors, the Commission is looking at whether TikTok provides a reliable database on advertisements on its platform so that researchers can scrutinise potential online risks. This marks the second DSA investigation after Elon Musks social media platform X found itself in the EUs crosshairs in December last year. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "February 20, 2024 07:14 am",
        "content": "Israels economy shrank by far more than expected in the wake of conflict with Hamas in Gaza, according to official figures. Gross domestic product (GDP) - a key measure of a countrys economic health - fell by 19 on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter of 2023. That is the equivalent of a fall of 5 between October and December. GDP was directly affected by the outbreak of the conflict on 7 October, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Israel and Hamas have been at war after gunmen from the Palestinian group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israels history. About 1,200 people were killed during the attack. Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the European Union and the UK, also took more than 250 men, women and children hostage. An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Experts said the data released on Monday by Israels Central Bureau of Statistics was much worse than had been expected. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts was for an annualised decline of 10.5. The Central Bureau of Statistics said the war had sharply curtailed spending, travel and investment at the end of last year. It said private spending dropped by 26.3, exports fell by 18.3 and there had been a 67.8 slide in investment in fixed assets, especially in residential buildings. The construction sector suffered from a lack of labour, due to military call-ups and a reduction in Palestinian workers. Meanwhile, government spending, mainly on war expenses and compensating businesses and households, jumped by 88.1. Despite the sharp drop in GDP between October and December, Israels economy grew by 2 for the full year. However, before the 7 October attacks, it had been expected to expand by 3.5. Liam Peach, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the contraction of Israels economy was much worse than had been expected and highlights the extent of the hit from the Hamas attacks and the war in Gaza. He said the countrys growth outlook for 2024 now looks likely to post one of its weakest rates on record. Elsewhere, the conflict has affected trade. Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been targeting cargo ships on the Red Sea that are heading to the Suez Canal. Egypts President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Monday that the attacks had cut Suez Canal revenue by between 40 and 50 this year. The Red Sea is one of the worlds most important routes for cargo - almost 15 of global seaborne trade usually passes through the area. The Houthis have been carrying out strikes from bases in Yemen on ships which they claim are Israeli-owned, flagged or operated, or are heading to Israeli ports. However, the owners and operators of many vessels claim they have no links with Israel at all. The US and the UK have carried out retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in turn. But even before this, some of the worlds largest shipping companies had stopped their vessels from passing through the strait. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 20, 2024 08:14 am",
        "content": "Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha has revealed that a pilot project for the digitization of education is set to be launched in March. Speaking at a briefing held at the Presidential Media Center (PMC) on Monday (19 Feb.), Premajayantha noted that Microsoft is slated to aid the initiative with regards to training teachers for the said purpose. The Minister also confirmed the dispatch of school textbooks for the year 2024 for distribution, elaborating that all school textbooks pertinent to the year 2024 have been dispatched to distribution stations, ensuring complete coverage. According to the Presidents Media Division (PMD), plans are in place to finalize their distribution at the school level by the first of March, with an expenditure totalling Rs. 12 billion allocated for this purpose. Furthermore, the Minister highlighted the collaboration with the Chinese government, which has facilitated the acquisition of 80 of the required cloth for school childrens uniforms, amounting to Rs. 05 billion. Distribution of these materials is currently underway, with the remaining 20 expected to arrive imminently. Additionally, efforts are underway to prepare school timetables and term notes for the current year. The Minister affirmed that arrangements are being made to conduct the G.C.E. (AL) level examination as scheduled by the end of the year. Schools will receive detailed instructions regarding these activities via a circular within the next two to three weeks, the Minister said. Various individuals have raised concerns about childrens absence from school, citing data from the Ministry of Health indicating a decrease in school enrolments due to a decline in the birth rate, amounting to 0.17. This trend highlights a significant factor contributing to the issue. Additionally, the Minister of Education addressed the shortage of teachers, attributing it to legal proceedings. One such case involves a restraining order halting teacher recruitment, resulting in a delay of up to 10 months in filling vacancies. Should the court reach a decision within the next two weeks, there is optimism for expedited resolution and swift filling of the 20,000 teacher vacancies, significantly impacting childrens education. Moreover, there are 13,500 provincial-level teacher vacancies due to educators leaving the service and relocating abroad. Legal proceedings, however, have impeded recruitment efforts, with a case filed in the Court of Appeal regarding these vacancies. Pending a court decision, authorities express readiness to swiftly address the issue and proceed with necessary recruitments. Furthermore, as per the teachers service constitution, examinations for science and technology level vacancies are scheduled for the first week of March, with recruitment expected to conclude by the end of the month. Additionally, a budget allocation of Rs. 16 billion has been earmarked for school lunches, complemented by agreements signed with USAID to provide meals to 200,000 children. Moreover, initiatives have commenced to engage parents through class meetings, beginning today, aimed at offering guidance. These consultations focus on raising awareness and ensuring protection, covering topics such as road safety, drug prevention, and safeguarding against various forms of abuse. Furthermore, plans have been put in place to launch career and technology guidance courses from 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. across 300 centers nationwide, coinciding with the release of Advanced Level examination results. Additionally, preparations are underway to commence a pilot project for the digitalization of education in March, with support from Microsoft for training teachers for the said purpose",

        "date": "February 20, 2024 10:02 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (20 Feb.) conveyed its decision on the much-disputed Anti-Terrorism Bill to Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. Accordingly, the Supreme Court determined that while several clauses of the proposed legislation require to be passed by a special majority, several other provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill need to be passed by both, a special majority and a referendum, unless amendments recommended by the Supreme Court are carried out. On 02 February, the Supreme Court concluded the hearing of petitions filed challenging the governments new Anti-Terrorism Bill following the lengthy proceedings that continued for six days in total. Thirty-one petitions had been put forward against the proposed legislation which seeks to replace the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Among the petitioners are His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ranjith Madduma Bandara, National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath, Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Socialist Youth Union (SYU), Duminda Nagamuwa of Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and the Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU). The Attorney General has been listed as the respondent of these petitions filed seeking a Supreme Court order mandating a parliamentary vote with a two-thirds majority and a referendum to pass the Bill, which was tabled in the parliament on January 10. They say the Bill, if passed in its current form, would grant unlimited powers to the Tri-Forces, the Police and the Coast Guard to make unwarranted arrests without reasonable suspicion, and this is a violation of the fundamental rights including the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Attached below is the press release issued by the Parliament today in this regard: Supreme Court Determination on the Bill titled Anti-Terrorism The Deputy Speaker of Parliament announced to Parliament that the Speaker has received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Anti-Terrorism which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution. Accordingly, the determination of the Supreme Court as to the Constitutionality of the Bill concludes as follows:   Clause 3, Clause 42, Clause 53, and Clause 70 of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and required a Special Majority to be passed by Parliament. However, the Supreme Court has stated that the said inconsistencies can be ceased if the said Clauses are amended as per the Determination of the Court.  Clause 4 has to be suitably amended as per the Supreme Court Determination.  Clause 72 (1) is unconstitutional and needs to be passed by a Special Majority and a Referendum. The unconstitutionality will cease if this Clause is amended as per the Determination of the Supreme Court.  Correspondingly, Clause 72(2) must be amended in accordance with the Determination.  Clause 75 (3) infringe the Article 4 (c) read with Article 3 of the Constitution and required 23rd Majority and a Referendum. The invalidity will cease 7 upon the amendments suggested in the Determination.  Clause 83 (7) requires a Special Majority to be passed into law. It has to be suitably amended as per the Supreme Court Determination. Further, the Supreme Court has determined that subject to the amendments that have adumbrated to the provisions of the Bill by the Supreme Court, the Bill could be enacted into law with a Simple Majority only if the amendments determined by the Supreme Court are introduced to the provisions.",

        "title": "Indian farmers reject government offer and say they will carry on marching to New Delhi",
        "date": "February 20, 2024 10:05 am",
        "content": "Indian farmers who have been protesting for a week to demand guaranteed crop prices have rejected a proposal from the government, and say they will continue their march to the capital New Delhi. The protesting farmers began their march last week, but their efforts to reach the city have been blocked by authorities, who have used tear gas and heavily barricaded entry points into the capital to avoid a repeat of 2021 farmer protests when they camped on the outskirts for over a year. Late Monday night, farm leaders said they refused the governments offer of a five-year contract for guaranteed prices for a set of crops, including pulses, maize and cotton. The governments proposal made Sunday was not in the interest of farmers, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, one of the leaders spearheading the protest, told the Press Trust of India news agency. He added that the farmers  tens of thousands of whom have been camping out some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the capital as they waited for the government offer  will resume their march to New Delhi on Wednesday. We appeal to the government to either resolve our issues or remove barricades and allow us to proceed to Delhi to protest peacefully, Dallewal said. The protests renewed a movement from over two years ago, in which tens of thousands of farmers hunkered down on the edges of New Delhi for over a year against agriculture laws which the government ended up repealing. This time, the farmers who rode on tractors from neighboring Haryana and Punjab states say the government has failed to make progress on other key demands from the previous protests. At the heart of the latest protests is a demand for legislation that would guarantee minimum support prices for all farm produce. Currently, the government protects agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices by setting a minimum purchase price for certain essential crops, a system that was introduced in the 1960s to help shore up food reserves and prevent shortages. The farmers say a guaranteed minimum support price for their crops would stabilize their incomes. They are also pressing the government to follow through on promises to double their income, waive their loans and withdraw legal cases brought against them during the earlier 2021 protests. Several meetings between farm leaders and the government have failed to end the deadlock. Piyush Goyal, one of the ministers negotiating with the farmers, told PTI that some of the demands of the farmers were deep and policy-driven, which made it more difficult to find a resolution. The protests come at a crucial time for India, where national elections are expected in the coming months and Prime Minister Narendra Modis party is widely expected to secure a third successive term. Farmers are particularly important to Modis base. Northern Haryana and a few other states with substantial farmer populations are ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "February 20, 2024 02:29 pm",
        "content": "The United States has proposed a rival draft United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and opposing a major ground offensive by its ally Israel in Rafah, according to the text seen by Reuters. The move comes after the U.S. signalled it would veto on Tuesday an Algerian-drafted resolution  demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire  over concerns it could jeopardize talks between the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Until now, Washington has been averse to the word ceasefire in any U.N. action on the Israel-Hamas war, but the U.S. text echoes language that President Joe Biden said he used last week in conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It would see the Security Council underscore its support for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable, based on the formula of all hostages being released, and calls for lifting all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale. The United States does not plan to rush to a vote and intends to allow time for negotiations, a senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday. To pass, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., France, Britain, Russia or China. The U.S. draft text determines that under current circumstances a major ground offensive into Rafah would result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement including potentially into neighboring countries. Israel plans to storm Rafah, where more than 1 million of the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza have sought shelter, prompting international concern that an assault would sharply worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The U.N. has warned it could lead to a slaughter. The draft U.S. resolution says such a move would have serious implications for regional peace and security, and therefore underscores that such a major ground offensive should not proceed under current circumstances. Washington traditionally shields Israel from U.N. action and has twice vetoed council resolutions since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants. But it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions that aimed to boost aid to Gaza and called for extended pauses in fighting. WARNING SHOT This is the second time since Oct. 7 that Washington has proposed a Security Council resolution on Gaza. Russia and China vetoed its first attempt in late October. While the U.S. was ready to protect Israel by vetoing the Algerian draft resolution on Tuesday, International Crisis Group U.N. Director Richard Gowan said Israel would be more concerned by the text Washington drafted. The simple fact that the U.S. is tabling this text at all is a warning shot for Netanyahu, he said. It is the strongest signal the U.S. has sent at the U.N. so far that Israel cannot rely on American diplomatic protection indefinitely. Israels mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. draft. A second senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. draft does not suggest anything about the dynamics of any particular relationship, whether thats with the Israelis or any other partner we have. The draft U.S. text would condemn calls by some Israeli government ministers for Jewish settlers to move to Gaza and would reject any attempt at demographic or territorial change in Gaza that would violate international law. The resolution would also reject any actions by any party that reduce the territory of Gaza, on a temporary or permanent basis, including through the establishment officially or unofficially of so-called buffer zones, as well as the widespread, systematic demolition of civilian infrastructure. Reuters reported in December that Israel told several Arab states that it wants to carve out a buffer zone inside Gazas borders to prevent attacks after the war ends. The war began when fighters from the Hamas militant group that runs Gaza attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. In retaliation, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that health authorities say has killed nearly 29,000 Palestinians with thousands more bodies feared lost amid the ruins. In December, more than three-quarters of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly voted to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

Progress is good, and the patient seems to have made a full recovery, with neural effects that we are aware of. Patient is able to move a mouse around the screen by just thinking, Musk said in a Spaces event on social media platform X. Musk said Neuralink was now trying to get as many mouse button clicks as possible from the patient. Neuralink did not immediately reply to Reuters request for further details. The firm successfully implanted a chip on its first human patient last month, after receiving approval for human trial recruitment in September. The study uses a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface implant in a region of the brain that controls the intention to move, Neuralink has said, adding that the initial goal is to enable people to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts. Musk has grand ambitions for Neuralink, saying it would facilitate speedy surgical insertions of its chip devices to treat conditions like obesity, autism, depression, and schizophrenia. Neuralink, which was valued at about 5 billion last year, has faced repeated calls for scrutiny regarding its safety protocols.

        "date": "February 20, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Atom bomb epic Oppenheimer won seven prizes, including best picture, director and actor, at the 77th British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, cementing its front-runner status for the Oscars next month. Gothic fantasia Poor Things took five prizes and Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest won three. British-born filmmaker Christopher Nolan won his first best director BAFTA for Oppenheimer, and Irish performer Cillian Murphy won the best actor prize for playing physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Murphy said he was grateful to play such a colossally knotty, complex character. Nolan noted that nuclear weapons are a nihilistic subject and the film inevitably reflects that, telling the movies backers: Thank you for taking on something dark. Emma Stone was named best actress for playing the wild and spirited Bella Baxter in Poor Things, a steampunk-style visual extravaganza that won prizes for visual effects, production design, makeup and hair and costume design. Oppenheimer had a field-leading 13 nominations, but missed out on the record of nine trophies, set in 1971 by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It won the best film race against Poor Things, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall and The Holdovers. Oppenheimer also scooped trophies for editing, cinematography and musical score, as well as the best supporting actor prize for Robert Downey Jr., who played Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss. DaVine Joy Randolph was named best supporting actress for playing a boarding school cook in The Holdovers and said she felt a responsibility I dont take lightly to tell the stories of underrepresented people like her character Mary. Oppenheimer faced stiff competition in whats widely considered a vintage year for cinema and an awards season energized by the end of actors and writers strikes that shut down Hollywood for months.  The Zone of Interest, a British-produced film shot in Poland with a largely German cast, was named both best British film and best film not in English  a first  and also took the prize for its sound, which has been described as the real star of the film. Jonathan Glazers unsettling drama takes place in a family home just outside the walls of the Auschwitz death camp, whose horrors are heard and hinted at, rather than seen. Walls arent new from before or since the Holocaust, and it seems stark right now that we should care about innocent people being killed in Gaza or Yemen or Mariupol or Israel, producer James Wilson said. Thank you for recognizing a film that asks us to think in those spaces. Ukraine war documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, produced by The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, won the prize for best documentary. This is not about us, said filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who captured the harrowing reality of life in the besieged city with an AP team. This is about Ukraine, about the people of Mariupol. Chernov said the story of the city and its fall into Russian occupation is a symbol of struggle and a symbol of faith. Thank you for empowering our voice and lets just keep fighting. The awards ceremony, hosted by Doctor Who star David Tennant  who entered wearing a kilt and sequined top while carrying a dog named Bark Ruffalo  was a glitzy, British-accented appetizer for Hollywoods Academy Awards, closely watched for hints about who might win at the Oscars on March 10. The prize for original screenplay went to French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall. The film about a woman on trial over the death of her husband was written by director Justine Triet and her partner, Arthur Harari. Its a fiction, and we are reasonably fine, Triet joked. Cord Jefferson won the adapted screenplay prize for the satirical American Fiction, about the struggles of an African American novelist Jefferson said he hoped the success of the movie maybe changes the minds of the people who are in charge of greenlighting films and TV shows, allows them to be less risk-averse. Historical epic Killers of the Flower Moon, Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro, grief-flecked love story All of Us Strangers and class-war dramedy Saltburn  all won nothing despite multiple nominations.  Barbie, one half of 2023s Barbenheimer box office juggernaut and the years top-grossing film, also came up empty from five nominations. Barbie director Greta Gerwig failed to get a directing nomination for either the BAFTAs or the Oscars, in what was seen by many as a major snub. Britains film academy introduced changes to increase the awards diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. However, Triet was the only woman among this years six best-director nominees. The Rising Star award, the only category decided by public vote, went to Mia McKenna-Bruce, star of How to Have Sex. Before the ceremony, nominees, including Bradley Cooper, Carey Mulligan, Emily Blunt, Rosamund Pike, Ryan Gosling and Ayo Edebiri all walked the red carpet at Londons Royal Festival Hall, along with presenters Andrew Scott, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba and David Beckham. Guest of honor was Prince William, in his role as president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. He arrived without his wife, Kate, who is recovering from abdominal surgery last month. The ceremony included musical performances by Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham, singing Time After Time, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, singing her 2001 hit Murder on the Dancefloor, which shot back up the charts after featuring in Saltburn. Film curator June Givanni, founder of the June Givanni PanAfrican Cinema Archive, was honored for outstanding British contribution to cinema, while actress Samantha Morton received the academys highest honor, the BAFTA Fellowship. Morton, who grew up in foster care and childrens homes, said that representation matters. The stories we tell, they have the power to change peoples lives, she said. Film changed my life, it transformed me, and it led me here today. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "title": "US again casts veto of UN action in Israel-Hamas war",
        "date": "February 20, 2024 10:08 pm",
        "content": "The United States on Tuesday again vetoed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, blocking a demand for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as it instead pushes the 15-member body to call for a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas. Thirteen council members voted in favor of the Algerian-drafted text, while Britain abstained. It was the third such U.S. veto since the start of the current fighting on Oct. 7. A vote in favor of this draft resolution is support to the Palestinians right to life. Conversely, voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted upon them, Algerias U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama told the council before the vote. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield signaled on Saturday that the U.S. would veto the draft resolution over concerns it could jeopardize talks between the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Any action this council takes right now should help, not hinder these sensitive, and ongoing negotiations. And we believe that the resolution on the table right now would, in fact, negatively impact those negotiations, Thomas-Greenfield told the council ahead of the vote. Demanding an immediate, unconditional ceasefire without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages will not bring about a durable peace. Instead, it could extend the fighting between Hamas and Israel, she said. The Algerian-drafted resolution vetoed by the U.S. did not link a ceasefire to the release of hostages. It separately demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE The U.S. has now proposed a rival draft resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and opposing a major ground offensive by its ally Israel in Rafah, according to the text seen by Reuters on Monday. It said it plans to allow time for negotiations and will not rush to a vote. Until now, Washington has been averse to the word ceasefire in any U.N. action on the Israel-Hamas war, but the U.S. text echoes language that President Joe Biden said he used last week in conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. draft resolution would see the Security Council underscore its support for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable, based on the formula of all hostages being released, and calls for lifting all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale. This is the second time since Oct. 7 that Washington has proposed a Security Council resolution on Gaza. Russia and China vetoed its first attempt in late October. Washington traditionally shields Israel from U.N. action. But it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions that aimed to boost aid to Gaza and called for extended pauses in fighting. The war began when fighters from the Hamas militant group that runs Gaza attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. In retaliation, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that health authorities say has killed nearly 29,000 Palestinians with thousands more bodies feared lost amid the ruins. In December, more than three-quarters of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly voted to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. General Assembly resolutions are not binding but carry political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Malaysias budget airline AirAsia has evinced interest to operate services from Karipur to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, while Sri Lankas low-cost airline FitsAir has come forward to fly between Colombo and Karipur. The budget airlines of Malaysia and Sri Lanka stepped in to tap the potentials of Karipur even as many other foreign airlines remained wary of the Calicut International Airports future in the wake of the inordinate delay in resuming services of wide-body flights from Karipur. The meeting, chaired by Airport Advisory Committee chairman Abdussamad Samadani, MP, also made assurances about increasing domestic flight services to Thiruvananthapuram and Delhi, and international services to Jeddah. AirAsia and FitsAir have expressed willingness to begin services from Karipur with the hope of ensuring connections to countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, China, Philippines and Japan. Mr. Samadani and other peoples representatives such as M.K. Raghavan, MP; Elamaram Kareem, MP; and T.V. Ibrahim, MLA, said that the arrival of AirAsia and FitsAir would be a good beginning for Karipur in its new phase of development. They said that the airlines of other countries too would come to Karipur in the coming years. The meeting raised several demands, including connectivity to Goa, Srinagar, Ahmedabad, Pune and Kolkata. The MPs pointed out that the service to Kolkata would help a large number of migrant workers from north-eastern States. Air India Express officials said that they would increase the services to Thiruvananthapuram from Karipur. While airlines such as IndiGo, Flynas, and SpiceJet promised more services from Karipur, Saudi Arabian Airlines said that it would have to wait until large flights are allowed to be operated from Karipur.

The agreement between Bhutto Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of three-time Premier Nawaz Sharif ends days of uncertainty and negotiations after the Feb. 8 elections produced a hung national assembly. Bhutto Zardari confirmed at a late night press conference in Islamabad that former premier Shehbaz Sharif, who was seated beside him, would be the coalitions candidate for prime minister. He added that his father Asif Ali Zardari will be the alliances candidate for the countrys president. Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Nawaz, said the two parties had the numbers to form government, and also had the support of other smaller parties. PML-N is the largest party with 79 seats and PPP is second with 54. They, along with four other smaller parties, have a comfortable majority in the legislature of 264 seats. The delay in forming a government in the nuclear-armed nation of 241 million has caused concern as Pakistan is grappling with an economic crisis amid slow growth and record inflation, rising militant violence, and needs a stable administration with the authority to take tough decisions. Bhutto Zardari said the parties would push to form government as soon as possible.

        "content": "Indian police fired tear gas on Wednesday to scatter protesting farmers as they resumed a march to the capital, equipped with cranes and excavators after talks with the government on guaranteed prices for their produce failed to break a deadlock. To escape the stinging gas and clouds of smoke, thousands of farmers, some wearing medical masks, ran into the fields surrounding their gathering-point on a highway about 200 km (125 miles) north of New Delhi. The police action came as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a fresh offer to resume talks on the farmers demands. Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda urged the farmers to resolve their grievances through the talks. After the fourth round, the government is ready to discuss all the issues such as guaranteed prices, he posted on social network X, as the march resumed. I again invite the farmer leaders for discussion. It is important for us to maintain peace. On Monday, the farmers groups had rejected the governments previous proposal for five-year contracts and guaranteed support prices for produce such as corn, cotton and pulses. The farmers, mostly from the northern state of Punjab, have been demanding higher prices backed by law for their crops. They form an influential bloc of voters Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot afford to anger ahead of general elections due by May. STICKS, STONES, GAS MASKS The farmers began marching at 0530 GMT from the spot where authorities had stopped them by erecting barricades on the border of Punjab state with Haryana, blocking a key highway. It is not right that such massive barricades have been placed to stop us, said one of the farmers leaders, Jagjit Singh Dallewal. We want to march to Delhi peacefully. If not, they should accede to our demands. Police in riot gear lined both sides of the highway as the farmers, gathering earlier amid morning fog, waved colourful flags emblazoned with the symbols of their unions, while loudspeakers urged them to fight for their rights. Television images showed some wearing gas masks. Late on Tuesday, Haryana polices chief ordered the immediate seizure of the heavy equipment brought by the farmers, to prevent its use by protesters in destroying barricades. Police also asked owners of such equipment not to lend or rent it to protesters, as its use to harm security forces would be a criminal offence. About 10,000 people had gathered on Wednesday, along with 1,200 tractors and wagons at Shambhu on the state border, police in Haryana posted on X, warning against the risk of stone-throwing as they were armed with sticks and stones. Sundays government proposal of minimum support prices to farmers who diversify their crops to grow cotton, pigeon peas, black matpe, red lentils and corn was rejected by the protesters, who wanted additional foodgrains covered. Similar protests two years ago, when farmers camped for two months at the border of New Delhi, forced Modis government to repeal a set of farm laws. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

The high base effect from the tax increases is expected to benefit inflation in early 2025 and possibly even bring it lower than 5. The South Asian country defaulted on its overseas debt in May 2022 after depleted foreign exchange reserves triggered worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. At the start of 2024, Sri Lanka raised its value added tax (VAT) to 18 from 15 to meet revenue targets under the IMF programme, sparking an uptick in its key inflation rate, which rose to 6.4 at the end of January from 4 the month before. The CBSL, which committed to maintaining inflation at 5 under a new act introduced last year, said price increases from the tax hike were unlikely to persist due to subdued demand and the economy operating below its full capacity.

        "date": "February 21, 2024 04:27 pm",
        "content": "Amidst the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines emerged as a beacon of hope, offering humanity a vital tool against the deadly virus. However, recent research has introduced a concerning twist to this narrative. Since the onset of the pandemic, approximately 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide, marking a significant milestone in the fight against the virus. Notably, around 71 of the global population has received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. Despite the widespread vaccination efforts, a recent peer-reviewed study has now sparked health concerns among this substantial portion of the global population. Its findings have linked COVID vaccines from prominent companies such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca to rare occurrences of heart, brain and blood disorders. Researchers from the Global Vaccine Data Network, a research arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO), conducted the largest COVID vaccine study to date. It analysed expected versus observed rates of 13 medical conditions considered adverse events of special interest in a study population of 99 million vaccinated individuals across eight countries. Here are some key associations the study found: Rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) identified in recipients of first, second and third doses of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas mRNA vaccines. Highest rate observed after second Moderna dose, with a 6.1-fold increase compared to expected rates. 6.9-fold increased risk of Pericarditis, another heart condition, in individuals who received a third dose of AstraZenecas viral vector vaccine. 1.7-fold and 2.6-fold increased risks in recipients of Modernas first and fourth doses, respectively. 2.5 times greater risk of rare autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome and 3.2 times greater risk of blood clots among recipients of AstraZenecas vaccine. 3.8 times greater risk of neurological disorder acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after the Moderna vaccine and 2.2-fold increased risk after AstraZenecas vaccine. Vaccination Still Better than Infection: Experts In spite of these findings, experts emphasise that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. For instance, the likelihood of experiencing neurological events or heart inflammation is significantly higher after contracting COVID-19 than after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of all of these adverse events is still much, much higher when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), so getting vaccinated is still by far the safer choice, CEO of biotechnology company Centivax Jacob Glanville, who is not involved in the study, told Forbes. In navigating the complex landscape of risks and benefits, the overarching message remains clear: vaccination remains an indispensable tool in the fight against COVID-19, offering a pathway toward overcoming the diseases pervasive grip on global health and well-being. The study was published in the journal Vaccine. Source: The Weather Channel",

The Aquaman star further said: As a native Hawaiian, I saw the impacts of climate change first had this year, the devastating lines of fires. We urgently need to revive the health of our lands, the coasts and oceans. After the tsunami, the island of Sri Lanka also had to build back. And they did it using the power of nature as a solution versus fighting against it. I want to celebrate Sri Lanka for its recognition as the UN World Restoration Flagship. In the country, citizens and partners are working together to naturally generate 10,000 hectares of mangrove forest by 2030. To fortify the coastline. Congratulations Sri Lanka. Mahalo for working together to create positive change. You are the example. Earlier this month, marking a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka was named a UN World Restoration Flagship for its vital efforts to restore the mangrove ecosystems. Through the World Restoration Flagship Award, the UN honours the planets most ambitious, successful, and inspiring examples of large-scale ecosystem restoration. The prestigious recognition signifies Sri Lankas effective use of the UNs Principles for Ecosystem Restoration and highlights globally significant best practices and methodologies that can potentially serve as a framework for future success across the world.

        "content": "Delivering a statement in Parliament today (21 Feb.), Tourism Minister Harin Fernando hit out at opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila over their criticism of his recent speech in India. Weerawansa and Gammanpila had yesterday (20 Feb.) accused Minister Fernando of attempting to sell the country to India, in reference to certain comments made by the Tourism Minister during a recent event held in Mumbai, India. Responding to the allegations against him, Fernando stated that he had only thanked India for extending their support at a time when Sri Lanka was facing its worst economic crisis, and that his statement was gravely misconstrued by the MPs in question. I humbly thanked India for saving Sri Lanka for the last 13  14 months, with giving us the maximum amount of tourists, he said. The Minister further stated that during his speech, he had elaborated on the similarities and connections shared between the two countries, in several aspects including history, language, cinema and food. I was explaining that we were both very similar, so Sri Lanka is a part of India, he said, emphasising that he was, in no way, attempting to sell Sri Lanka to India. Whenever we are at a bad point, India has always supported us, India always backed us, the Minister Fernando said, emphasising that India was deemed an ally to Sri Lanka during one of its most crucial times, but now that he is inviting India to invest in Sri Lanka, they are being portrayed as the enemy. But when I ask Indians to come and invest in Sri Lanka, thats bad. If you ask how countries such as Dubai, Singapore and Malaysia have developed thus far, it is through investments. The ITC hotel that is being built in front of Galle Face is the first Indian hotel that is being built out of India. Thats an investment. How would a country develop without investments?, the Tourism Minister questioned. Fernando further accused MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila of being responsible for creating a certain notion in Sri Lanka, which ultimately led to the country falling apart. They are responsible, and today, they are saying the same things when you appreciate India, the Minster charged, levelling accusations that the two MPs were once again attempting to create a ruckus based on the misconstrued truth. The Minister reiterated that Sri Lanka remains indebted to India for its aid, emphasising that inviting India to invest in Sri Lanka and selling the country are two different things. We were not selling the country. We would invite any country to invest in Sri Lanka at this moment, he said, charging that he is ready to defend himself in the event any party goes to court accusing him of violating the Constitution of Sri Lanka. We will continue to work with a country who helps us, who we only call as a brother when we need, but then when we want to do our politics, put them down, I am not that politician, I am grateful and I am proud of what we have reached so far, the Minister said.",

Furthermore, Minister Alles disclosed that the value of drugs seized thus far during the Yukthiya operation, which commenced on December 17, 2023, amounts to Rs. 7.8 billion. The Minister made these remarks during a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today (21 Feb.) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. The Minister further commented: Continuous efforts are underway to combat drug trafficking, organized crime, and violence against vulnerable groups such as women and children. Regardless of the challenges we face, we remain resolute in our commitment to these operations. There have been various allegations against our initiatives, and attempts have been made to disrupt our efforts by certain individuals and groups. We have received intelligence indicating that funds from drug networks are being used to finance these disruptive activities. Operation Yukthiya, which commenced on December 17, has resulted in the seizure of narcotics valued at Rs. 7.8 billion. Additionally, assets including vehicles and buildings confiscated by law enforcement amount to Rs. 725 million. . A total of 58,562 raids have been conducted, leading to the arrest of 58,234 individuals involved in illicit activities. Furthermore, we are in the process of introducing the E Passport service to alleviate the long queues at the Immigration and Emigration Department office. The queues have resurged recently, particularly due to the Korean Language Proficiency Test. To address this issue, we are exploring negotiations with the Korean government to implement a system and arrange to issue passports only to those who pass the exam. It is worth noting that all arrangements have been finalized to issue the new ID cards through the Department of Registration of Persons. Additionally, several joint programs between schools and Police, facilitated by the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, are already underway to combat drug abuse. Moreover, we express unanimous support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe as our candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election. The President has steered the country out of adversity and put an end to long-standing queues. We firmly believe that those who comprehend the prevailing circumstances should not contemplate electing another president. Meanwhile, responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the delay in police officer promotions, Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshbandu Tennakoon, who was also present at the event, explained that some promotion issues have arisen due to petitions filed before the Supreme Court by discontented officers. He mentioned that the National Police Commission, the Ministry of Public Security and the Police Headquarters have conducted several discussions with the Attorney Generals Department to address these concerns promptly. Mr. Tennakoon assured that these issues will be promptly resolved through this approach. Furthermore, he highlighted the past issuance of promotions for lower-ranking police officers and assured that similar promotions will continue in the future. Source - PMD",

        "content": "Sri Lanka said on Wednesday (21 Feb.) it had exported tea worth USD 20 million to Iran to partially repay its USD 251 million oil debts, with Colombo saying Tehrans visiting foreign minister had expressed satisfaction at the deal. So far USD20 million worth of tea has been exported to Iran under the barter trade agreement, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardenas office said in a statement after talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The tea-for-oil deal was agreed upon in December 2021, but exports were delayed by Colombos economic crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down in July 2022. The barter deal allows sanctions-hit Iran to avoid having to use up scarce hard currency to pay for imports of popular tea. It also allowed Sri Lanka to pay with tea, as the country was short of foreign currency. The island defaulted on its 46 billion foreign debt in April 2022 and secured a USD 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) early last year. Ceylon tea, known by the islands colonial-era name, made up nearly half of Irans consumption in 2016. However, the proportion has declined in recent years. Source  AFP - Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 07:52 am",
        "content": "The Marine Environment Protection Authority of Sri Lanka is touting its success at nabbing an unauthorized oil release as part of a sophisticated new satellite surveillance system it began testing with support from France. According to the statement released by the authority on social media, it was the first successful case although they have already had more than 100 detection reports from the system. The Global Crest, a 12,900 dwt crude oil tanker registered in Panama was in Sri Lankas anchorage on February 3. The vessel was repositioning to the anchorage near Colombo when on February 4 the initiative funded by the French government detected a large oil slick. The MEPA reports the stain was confirmed in satellite images nearly seven miles in length and spread over one square kilometer (0.3 sq. miles). An analysis of the images quickly showed the oil slick appeared to be coming from the Global Crest, which is listed as part of the fleet of Indias Global Tankers and managed by a company in the UAE. The vessel anchored about 11 miles from Colombo late on February 5 and the following day the MEPA obtained an order to inspect the vessel. An onboard inspection was conducted which revealed clear evidence of the illegal discharge, the MEPA reports. They moved to detain the ship and under its authority leveled a nearly 50,000 fine on the ship. They report on February 9 the vessels owner decided to pay the fine and the MEPA then moved to release the ship which departed for the UAE the following day. Sri Lanka reports it started testing the system in September 2023 citing the successful deployment of similar technology in other parts of the world. They use as an example the ClearSeaNet service operated by the European Maritime Safety Authority saying the technology clearly has a deterrent effect. They say it has halved the number of pollution incidents in European waters in 10 years. Since September 2023, the MEPA reports it has received more than 100 detection reports for investigation. The success of the test they said will pave the way toward developing a sovereign, fully operational local capability. They cite the strategic location of Sri Lanka on the international shipping route crossing the Indian Ocean which they say however also exposes the country to the risk of pollution both from accidental spills and illegal discharges.

But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment. Investigating officers have thus far arrested 6 suspects allegedly complicit in the murder. The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the assailants and the remote switch of the car used in the shooting were recovered from the possession of the fourth suspect. Meanwhile, a Police Sergeant was recently killed after being shot while attempting to apprehend a suspect implicated in the incident. As per reports, a scuffle had broken out amidst an attempt by a team of officers of the Malwathu Hiripitiya Police Station to apprehend a suspect in the Batepola area in the early hours of Feb.10 during which the suspect tried to grab the service firearm of the police officer in question. The firearm had then discharged, injuring the officer, while the suspect fled with the weapon. The injured Police Sergeant, a 51-year-old resident of Ihala Lunugama, had been admitted to the Gampola Hospital. He was later transferred to the Colombo National Hospital but succumbed to injuries two days later.",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 10:30 am",
        "content": "Eng. Noel Priyantha has tendered his resignation as the spokesperson of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, taking to his X handle (formerly Twitter), said this was communicated to him by the CEB management. The CEB spokesperson, who attended the Big Focus program on Ada Derana on Tuesday, made controversial remarks that received backlash for lacking empathy. When asked about the recent electricity tariff hikes and the burden it has placed on consumers, Priyantha said the tariffs should have been increased gradually over the years. However, he also went on to comment that the children do not need electricity to study, and that the light from kerosene oil lamps should suffice. Why do you need electricity to study? For about two years, I also studied using kerosene oil lamps. Why do you need to iron clothes? Wear linen clothing. He also made insensitive comments about the lifestyle of the people working in tea plantations. Come to the plantations with me. Ill show you how happily these people live. Everyone is drunk at 2 oclock. After finding himself in hot water, Priyantha issued a public apology on Wednesday, expressing deep regret if his comments were hurtful to any section of the population. The CEB spokespersons comments were slammed by Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman, who said it lacks empathy and is unacceptable. Minister Wijesekera, in his X post, said, I agree with the sentiments of JeevanThondaman and many more that had raised the lack of empathy and professionalism in the statement made by the CEB spokesperson. He emphasized that Priyanthas statement does not reflect the views of the government nor the CEB, while asserting that the management of the state-owned electricity supplier will take appropriate measures in this regard.",

        "date": "February 22, 2024 11:58 am",
        "content": "Switzerlands government said on Wednesday it wants to ban Hamas after the Palestinian militant groups attacks in Israel last year which killed nearly 1,200 people and sparked a war in Gaza. Bern said it was taking action after the attacks on October 7 which killed two Swiss nationals and resulted in nearly 250 people being taken hostage. In response, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that local health authorities say has killed nearly 29,000 Palestinians with thousands more feared lost amid the ruins. The Swiss government said under the new legislation Hamas and cover or successor organisations as well as organisations or groups that act on its behalf or in its name will be banned. The ban aims to punish Hamas for the October attacks as well as prevent the group using Switzerland as a safe haven or carrying out attacks in the country for example by making entry bans or expulsions easier to arrange. It will also help combat terrorist financing by allowing the Swiss anti-money laundering authorities to better exchange information with counterparts abroad, the government said. The law, which has entered a consultation phase, will be limited to five years, the government said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",
