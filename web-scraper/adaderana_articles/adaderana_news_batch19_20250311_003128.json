        "title": "Over 1,000 migrants reach Italian isle; 23 reported missing",
        "date": "April 25, 2023 11:45 am",
        "content": "With the return of calm seas, migrant smugglers launched dozens of boats from Tunisia during the weekend and some 1,200 people ended up on a tiny Italian island while several were reported missing at sea, the Italian Coast Guard said Monday. Coast guard officials said in a statement that they responded to 35 boats that had left Tunisia, three of which came to grief. In one shipwreck some 20 nautical miles off Lampedusa island coast guard and border police vessels said three migrants were missing. In a second, in Maltas search-and-rescue area, survivors said some 20 people were missing, while in the third, also in Maltas rescue area, Italian rescuers recovered a mans body, the Coast Guard said. Some 20 more boats crowded with migrants were in the sea Monday night, it said. The coast guard said air and naval assets of the Coast Guard, the Border Police, the European border protection agency Frontex as well as a humanitarian organization were involved in the assistance. Dozens of the migrants sat Monday morning near Lampedusas port, awaiting transfer to the islands overcrowded shelter or eventually to Sicily or the Italian mainland. Earlier Monday, a Tunisian fishing boat off Lampedusa aided a distressed migrant boat carrying 34 people and a body, and the survivors were later transferred to an Italian coast guard vessel, Italian news reports said. On Sunday, with seas calm after four days of rough conditions, a total of 640 migrants reached Lampedusa, and hundreds more on Monday. Last week, Italian authorities used commercial ferries and military vessels to transfer migrants from Lampedusa to Sicily or the mainland  bringing Lampedusas migrant center below its approximately 400-person capacity. But with the slew of boats arriving from Sunday, the number of migrants there quickly swelled, and authorities were scrambling anew to make arrangement for more transfers off the island. Separately, the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said its rescue vessel Geo Barents came to the aid of 75 migrants  including 40 minors  in a wooden boat foundering in international waters off Libya on Monday. The rescue vessel must now wait for Italian authorities to assign it a port to disembark the migrants. The right-wing government has been sending charity vessels to ports in northern Italy, far from the rescue area, to try to limit their time at sea. Government officials contend that the vessels encourage illegal migration by providing safety to the smugglers passengers. Although far-right Premier Giorgia Meloni has led a crackdown both on smugglers and on the charity vessels, migrants keep risking dangerous voyages in the Central Mediterranean  departing from Tunisia, Libya and Turkey  in hopes of finding work or relatives in Europe. According to Italian Interior Ministry figures, by Monday morning more than 36,600 migrants had arrived in Italy since the start of the year. Thats more than four times the number for the same period in each of the two previous years. Italy rejects most of their asylum bids because they are fleeing poverty, not war or persecution. But, since barely a handful of countries have repatriation accords with Italy, the migrants who lose asylum bids often stay on for years in a legal limbo, or try to make their way to northern European countries. Italys pleas to fellow European Union nations to take on some of the migrants have largely gone unheeded for years now. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 25, 2023 11:54 am",
        "content": "Top cryptocurrency bitcoin could reach 100,000 by the end of 2024, Standard Chartered said on Monday, saying that the so-called crypto winter is over. Bitcoin could gain from factors including recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilisation of risk assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve ends its rate-hiking cycle and improved profitability of crypto mining, Standard Chartereds head of digital assets research Geoff Kendrick said in a note. While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer, Kendrick wrote. Bitcoin has rallied so far this year, rising above 30,000 in April for the first time in ten months. It gains represent a partial recovery after trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto sector in 2022, as central banks hiked interest rates and a string of crypto firms imploded. Predictions of sky-high valuations have been commonplace during bitcoins past rallies. A Citi analyst said in November 2020 that bitcoin could climb as high as 318,000 by the end of 2022. It closed last year down about 65 at 16,500. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 25, 2023 02:05 pm",
        "content": "MP Dullas Alahapperuma has proposed that the G.C.E Ordinary Level examination not be held this year, in view of the inconvenience caused to students. Speaking during this mornings (25 April) Parliamentary session, the MP put forth a proposal that the OL exam not be held this year, and instead, that the respective students be awarded a certificate by the Department of Examinations deeming them eligible to commence the Advanced Level syllabus. I request that you consider this proposal at a time where nearly 600,000 students are unable to move beyond the OL stage. Why cant we not hold the OL exam this year, and issue them certificates from the Department of Examinations stating that they satisfy all the requirements to commence the AL syllabus? I dont think this will bring any injustice to the students, as you cannot even apply for jobs with OL results, the MP explained. Further emphasising his point, Alahapperuma noted that while not causing any injustice to the students, this would also allow for the AL and OL exams to be held in August and December, respectively, as they used to take place. In an attempt to support his argument, the MP brought up an incident in which, during the COVID pandemic in Sri Lanka, a similar decision was taken pertaining to the London OL examinations, which greatly benefitted the students. In response to the MPs proposal, however, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha highlighted the impracticality of it, explaining that the testing and evaluation process followed in the London syllabus is widely different to that followed in the local syllabus. They continuously evaluate students in the classroom, and these results are put towards the final mark given to students. We still follow an exam-centric syllabus, which is why we are trying to change this system and the testing and evaluation methods we use to those parallel to international standards. This is not as easy as we think, the Minister emphasised.",

        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka today urged the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) to postpone their trade union action until the paper markings of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination is completed. The HRCSL said it has initiated an inquiry into this issue by self-intervention in concern with some complaints received by the commission and the media reports pertaining to the issue. Accordingly, a discussion has been held today with the participation of the Commissioner General of Examinations and the Chairman of FUTA, Prof. D.M.H.S.K. Banneheka. Commenting during the discussion, the Commissioner of Examinations has pointed out that the quality and standard of this examination are maintained on the basis of receiving the contribution of the university lecturers from the preparation of the question papers until the evaluation of the answer sheets, adding that the university lecturers contribute to this purpose on an individual level. However, Prof. Banneheka, who accepted the Commissioner Generals opinion, also stressed that the university lecturers have decided to withdraw from the examination evaluation activities due to the failure to find a solution to the problem of excessive taxation that they have undergone. Furthermore, he expressed that the purpose of this decision is to maintain standardized and quality examinations in Sri Lanka in the future, and to provide Sri Lankan children with the opportunity to receive quality education within universities, and that its not a decision made based on personal wishes of the teachers today. Nevertheless, the Chairman of the HRCSL, Justice Rohini Marasinghe, who urged the FUTA to postpone their trade union action until the paper-markings of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination are completed, also expressed during the discussion that a high-level committee should be appointed and discuss regarding the demands of university teachers. She has further highlighted that the relevant parties should work to obtain the services of university lecturers for these examinations so as not to harm the international recognition of the quality and standard of the examinations in Sri Lanka.",

        "title": "US President Biden officially declares 2024 re-election bid",
        "date": "April 25, 2023 04:13 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he will seek a second White House term in 2024, a decision that will test whether Americans are ready to give the 80-year-old Democrat, already the oldest US president ever, another four years in office. Biden made his announcement in a slickly produced video released by his new campaign team, in which he declares it is his job to defend American democracy. It opens with imagery from the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. When I ran for president four years ago, I said were in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are, Biden said. This is not a time to be complacent. Thats why Im running for re-election. Lets finish this job. I know we can, he said. Biden described Republican platforms as threats to American freedom, vowing to fight efforts to limit womens healthcare, cut Social Security and ban books, while blasting MAGA extremists. MAGA is the acronym for the Make America Great Again political slogan of Trump, who may well be Bidens Republican opponent in the November 2024 election. In the two years since he took over from Trump, Biden won Congress approval for billions of dollars in federal funds to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and for new infrastructure, and oversaw the lowest levels of unemployment since 1969, although a 40-year high in inflation has marred his economic record. Bidens age makes his re-election bid a historic and risky gamble for the Democratic Party, which faces a tough election map to hold the Senate in 2024 and is the minority in the House of Representatives now. Bidens approval ratings were stuck at just 39 percent in a ReutersIpsos poll released on April 19 and there are steep concerns about his age among some Americans; he would be 86 by the end of a prospective second term, almost a decade higher than the average US males life expectancy. Doctors declared Biden, who does not drink alcohol and exercises five times a week, fit for duty after an examination in February. The White House says his record shows that he is mentally sharp enough for the rigors of the job. Biden will be joined in his 2024 quest by his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump matchup again? Bidens entry into the race follows Trumps announcement in November that he would seek a second term after losing the 2020 contest to Biden. Biden, running as an incumbent, is unlikely to face much competition from inside his party. No senior Democrats have shown signs of challenging him and he has compiled a board of rising-star Democrats to advise his campaign, including governors J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Potential and declared Republican presidential candidates have begun framing the 2024 election around cutting back government spending amid still-high inflation, restricting abortion, crime in Democratic-run cities and illegal immigration. The two leading Republican contenders, Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, want to limit the access of trans children to sports teams and gender-affirming medical care, and restrict how schools teach LGBTQ issues and Americas history of slavery and racial disparities. Not a 2020 recap Biden ran a mostly virtual campaign to defeat Trump in the 2020 election as COVID-19 raged, saying he sought to unify the country, rebuild the economy, and better control the virus. With pandemic restrictions mostly over in the United States, the 2024 race is likely to be a much different, more physical affair. After losing by 7 million votes to Biden in 2020, Trump refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming that there had been widespread electoral fraud. His supporters stormed the US Capitol building in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, in support of his claims but they failed to halt certification by Congress of Bidens win. Bidens campaign video suggests he plans to remind voters of these actions, while lauding his handling of the economic recovery from the pandemic slump, especially the strength of the labor market. Other Biden themes may include strong US support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and what the White House says are Republican plans to unravel federal healthcare and programs popular with older voters. This summer, Biden is challenging Republicans to find common ground on raising the US debt ceiling before the country goes into default in a matter of months. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats polled by ReutersIpsos in February said the phrase Joe Biden is too old to work in government describes the president. Source  ALARABIYA News - Agencies",

        "date": "April 25, 2023 04:29 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that any attempt to disturb the education system of the country, whether directly or indirectly, will not be permitted, and if required, new legislation will be introduced to address such conduct. The President stressed the pivotal role of education in shaping the future of the country, and announced his plans to establish a modern education system that aligns with the demands of the 21st century. He further pledged to enhance the international reputation of Sri Lanka through these efforts, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He said that during yesterdays cabinet meeting a new cabinet committee on education was appointed, consisting of himself, the education minister, and several other cabinet ministers. The President attended the Matara Rahula College centenary celebration ceremony this morning (25 April), where a three-day Educational Exhibition and Art Festival Vidyabhimani is being held at the College. A special commemorative stamp was also issued by the President to mark the occasion. Principal Major Sudath Samarawickrama presented a commemorative gift to the President at the event. The portrait of the President painted by a 11th grade student of the College Yonal Mewidu, was also presented to President Wickremesinghe. Addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of education for the future of the country and stated that the governments program to build a developed Sri Lanka by 2048 gives special attention to education. He revealed that the governments aspiration is to create a new education system in the country by 2035, and the government is ready to spend to modernize education in the future. Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for being invited to the Centenary Celebration of Rahula College in Matara. As we talk about Rahula College, we must not forget to acknowledge its former contributors, such as Mr. Gordon Pius, Notary N.D.T. Rajapakse, and C.A. Odiris Silva, who deserves a special mention. Like all the prominent families in Matara, my family also played a significant role in supporting the development of Rahula College. Its important to remember not just Mr. C.A. Odiris Silva but also his son from the Kanda Udaarachchi family including Mr. Ariyathilaka, Mr. Dharmapala, Mr. Harischandra, and many others. Speaking of Mr. Dharmapala, he assisted me immensely when I first entered politics. The first public speaking event I attended was a two-day meeting he organized. I have met him several times since then, and he always talked about Rahula College. In 1977, after Mr. J.R. Jayawardena became the President, he extended his help to this school. In 1980, upon his request, Mr. Jayawardena visited Rahula College. Even during my tenure as the Minister of Education, he talked to me about the school. He is our most senior politician and former senior leader of the United National Party, and thus we must fulfil his demands. Many other families have also contributed to the schools growth, including the Wanigasekara family and the Wijetunga family, who I remember fondly. Today, Matara Rahula College is a major educational institution in Sri Lanka, and many individuals who have served our country have graduated from here. As the President, I firmly believe that education is the greatest gift we can give to our youth. In the 19th and 20th centuries, many schools were established to provide education beyond those times, and Mr. C.W.W. Kannangaras free education policy made it possible for all to obtain a secondary education. However, we are now in the 21st century, and we must provide our children with an education that meets the demands of the time. During my visit to the College, I asked a young boy his age, and he responded, Ten. If he lives until he is 80, he will see the year 2090. Therefore, it is our duty to create an educational system that is well-equipped to face the challenges of the future. Today, I am proud to say that my government is working towards 2048 and beyond. As part of our plan, we have committed to creating a good education system in the country by 2030. In the next two or three years, we will be investing in a new economic program. After that, a large part of the funds we receive will be dedicated to education modernization programs. We believe it is crucial to create an education system that can face the future, as the youth of our country is our only national resource. They should be given a good education and build the future. I have looked at countries like Singapore, Israel, and Switzerland, which have managed to succeed through human resource development despite limited resources. I believe we can do the same. If I were to ask the teaching staff today whether it is possible to continue until 2050 according to our current education system, the answer would be impossible. Thats why we need to go for education modernization as soon as possible. I want to make it clear that no one will be allowed to disrupt or interfere with the education system of the country, and if necessary, we will bring laws to ensure no one interferes with the education system. Education determines the future of our country, and if we establish a formal education system, we can make our country a major hub in the Indian Ocean. Thats why the Minister of Education and I recently discussed and appointed a Cabinet Committee on Education. The Prime Minister, Education Minister and I, together with several others, will be part of this committee. Our focus is on creating a future-oriented education system, and we have received reports from the National Education Commission and several other departments, including parliamentary committees. We must use these reports to find out how to move towards our goal. By 2070, a bigger change will take place in society, and it will affect education. We are only seeing part of the technology now, including artificial intelligence and new arrivals like ChatGPT. We need to decide whether we want a school-centred education system or a student-centred system to prepare for the future. I strongly believe that the school education system in our country should be revised and improved. With 13 years of education, we need to strive towards a more successful education system like that of America, where regular and advanced level exams are not held, but rather, the SAT exam and school report are considered. To achieve this, we must introduce new subjects, such as climate change and history, while also emphasizing the importance of science, art, literature, and geography. Every student must study a science subject and an art subject. Also, English must be taught in every school within the next 10 years. We are currently working to connect all AL to the internet, and we plan to extend this to the OL schools as well. Furthermore, I commend the Vanigapatuna dance performance I witnessed today, and I encourage more programs like this to be developed. In addition, we aim to implement professional programs received from Finland. We also plan to merge the Vocational Training Authority and the National Apprenticeship Board, turning the current vocational training centres into vocational schools to triple the number of students. Additionally, we hope to provide loans on concessional terms without interest in the first two or three years to those who want to enrol in government and non-government universities for higher education. To increase the number of engineers and doctors in the country, we aim to establish new universities that will allow young people to engage in higher education while working. Currently, we only have 2,500 engineers passing out annually. Our target is to have 10,000 engineers and 5,000 doctors passing out annually in the first phase. To achieve all these goals, we plan to create a new system with support from institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. This system will enable us to build a strong education system that can face the future and help us become a developed country by the century of independence in 2048. We will introduce these activities through the cabinet committee, discuss them in parliament, and implement them further. Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, State Minister Shantha Bandara, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Southern Province Governor Willy Gamage, Postmaster General Ruwan Sarathkumara, Matara Rahula College Principal Major Sudath Samarawickrama, and other faculty members, former students, and many others participated in this event.",

        "date": "April 25, 2023 09:41 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court has ordered that the DNA samples of former cricket commentator Brian Thomas be obtained and compared with those obtained from the car in which the late businessman Dinesh Schaffter was found bound. The order was issued by Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya, when the case pertaining to the murder of Schaffter was taken up in court yesterday (24 April). Accordingly, the relevant order was issued upon consideration of a request made by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Previously, the DNA samples of four persons, including a police officer and the watchman present at the cemetery at the time the body was found in the vehicle, were taken and compared to those obtained from the vehicle in which he was found tied up. However, the CID informed the court that later reports did not uncover any matches between the DNA samples found in the late businessmans car, and those obtained externally. Meanwhile, Specialist Doctor Prof. Asela Mendis informed the court that in order for the final report to be completed, several more documents and reports from the Government Analyst are due to be handed over to the five-member expertscommittee tasked with uncovering the actual cause of death of the late Director of the Janashakthi Group. Thus, the court registrar was ordered to recheck all the relevant documents, and submit them to the five-member committee, while the case is due to be taken up again on 08 May. The former cricket commentator Thomas was prohibited from leaving the country pursuant to an order given by Colombo Additional Magistrate Harsahana Kekunawala on 16 December 2022, in support of the investigations into Schaffters death. Reputed businessman Dinesh Schaffter was found tied up in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December and died a day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hopsital in Colombo",

        "date": "April 25, 2023 09:51 pm",
        "content": "Harry Belafonte, the singer and actor who smashed racial barriers in the US, has died at home in Manhattan, aged 96. One of the most successful African-American pop stars in history, he scored hits with Island In The Sun, Marys Boy Child and the UK number one Day-O (The Banana Boat Song). But his greatest achievements were as a campaigner for black civil rights in the US. He died of congestive heart failure, said his spokesman Ken Sunshine. Actress Mia Farrow was among the first to pay tribute, remembering Belafonte as a beautiful singer, and a deeply moral and caring man. Miss you already, she tweeted. Multi-million seller Often dubbed the King Of Calypso, Belafonte was born in Harlem, New York, in 1927. A high school drop out, he joined the Navy during the Second World War, working as a munitions loader at a base in New Jersey. After the war, he pursued his dream of becoming an actor, studying drama at Erwin Piscators famed Dramatic Workshop alongside the likes of Marlon Brando, Walter Matthau and Tony Curtis. He paid for the classes by singing at New York clubs, where he was backed by groups that included Miles Davis and Charlie Parker. That led to a recording contract and, in a search for material, Belafonte began to study the folk song archives at the US Library of Congress, alighting on the Calypso music his parents had grown up with. It proved to be a wise move. The handsome young star sparked a fad for the genre with songs like Jamaica Farewell and Day-O (a song about Caribbean dock workers), both of which featured on his third album, Calypso. Released in 1956, it topped the Billboard charts and was said to be the first album by a solo artist to sell more than a million copies in the US. His success was such that he was the first black person allowed to perform in many upmarket US venues - including some that had been off-limits to artists like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. He made his Broadway debut in the musical John Murray Andersons Almanac in 1953, for which he won a Tony Award for supporting actor. He later appeared in films, scoring his first lead role in Island in the Sun, where he starred alongside James Mason, Joan Fontaine and Joan Collins, with whom he had an affair. Over his career, he recorded more than 30 albums, including collaborative records with Nana Mouskouri, Lena Horne, and Miriam Makeba. Bob Dylan made his first recorded appearance playing harmonica on Belafontes 1962 album, Midnight Special. A close friend of Martin Luther King, he was a visible supporter of the civil rights movement, who bankrolled several anti-segregation organisations and bailed Dr King and other activists out of jail. He also campaigned against poverty, apartheid and Aids in Africa; and became an ambassador for Unicef, the United Nations childrens fund. In 1985, he organised the charity single We Are the World, an all-star musical collaboration that raised money for famine relief in Ethiopia. After seeing a grim news report on the famine, he decided that American artists needed to raise money in the same way Bob Geldof and Midge Ure had done with the song Do They Know Its Christmas? a year earlier. Featuring superstars like Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles and Diana Ross, the song - written by Jackson and Lionel Richie - raised millions of dollars. A lot of people say to me, When as an artist did you decide to become an activist? Belafonte said in a National Public Radio interview in 2011. I say to them, I was long an activist before I became an artist. Even in his late 80s, Belafonte was still speaking out on race and income equality and urged President Barack Obama to do more to help the poor. Fiercely left-wing, he campaigned against nuclear armament, and caused controversy in 2006 when, in a meeting with Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, he described US president George W Bush as the greatest terrorist in the world. Belafonte also compared Bushs secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both of whom were black, to slaves who worked in their masters house rather than in the fields. Statements like those made the star a frequent target of criticism, but he continued to be honoured for his artistry and humanitarian work. Among his many awards, Belafonte was bestowed with a Kennedy Center Honor in 1989 and the National Medal of Arts in 1994. He was an EGOT - one of a rare group of people who have received all four of entertainments biggest awards, an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. Belafonte was married three times. He and his first wife Marguerite Byrd had two children, including actress-model Shari Belafonte. He also had two children with second wife Julia Robinson, a former dancer. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "title": "Taliban kill IS leader behind 2021 Kabul airport suicide bombing",
        "date": "April 26, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "A ground assault by the Taliban killed the Islamic State militant who spearheaded the August 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that left 13 U.S. troops and about 170 Afghans dead during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Initially, neither the U.S.  nor apparently the Taliban  were aware that the mastermind was dead. He was killed during a series of battles early this month in southern Afghanistan between the Taliban and the Islamic State groups affiliate, according to several officials. But in the past few days, U.S. intelligence confirmed with high confidence that the Islamic State leader had been killed, a senior administration official said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. Over the weekend, the U.S. military began to inform the parents of the 11 Marines, the sailor and the soldier who were killed in the blast at Abbey Gate, and they shared the information in a private group messaging chat. The father of one of the Marines said the death of his sons killer brings little comfort. Whatever happens, its not going to bring Taylor back and I understand that, Darin Hoover, the father of Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, said in a phone call with The Associated Press. About the only thing his mom and I can do now is be an advocate for him. All we want is the truth. And were not getting it. Thats the frustrating part. Hoover said he and his sons mother, Kelly Henson, have spent the past year and a half grieving his death and praying for accountability from the Biden administration for the handling of the withdrawal. He added that the Marines provided only limited information to him and did not identify the Islamic State leader or give the circumstances of his death. U.S. officials declined to provide many details because of sensitivities in the intelligence gathering. The administration official said it was their moral responsibility to let the victims families know that the mastermind and person most responsible for the airport attack had been taken off the battlefield. The official added that intelligence officials determined that the leader had remained a key plotter and overseer for the group. Several officials said the U.S. played no role in the killing and did not coordinate at all with the Taliban. The administration official called the Taliban action significant and said the U.S. only learned of the operation through its over the horizon intelligence capabilities. Hoover is among a group of 12 Gold Star families that have kept in touch since the bombing, supporting one another and sharing information through the messaging chat. The chat was created by Cheryl Rex, the mother of Marine Lance Cpl. Dylan Merola, who died in the blast. Rex, who has been a vocal critic of the Biden administrations handling of the withdrawal, told the AP it was through the chat group that they were informed late Monday about the killing as they awaited official confirmation from U.S. military officials. The fallen service members were among those screening the thousands of Afghans frantically trying on Aug. 26, 2021, to get onto one of the crowded flights out of the country after the brutal Taliban takeover. The scene of desperation quickly turned into one of horror when a suicide bomber attacked. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. The blast at Abbey Gate came hours after Western officials warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport. But that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the U.S. officially ended its 20-year presence. The Afghanistan-based offshoot of the Islamic State  called Islamic State-Khorasan  has up to 4,000 members and is the Talibans most bitter enemy and top military threat. The group has continued to carry out attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, especially against the countrys minority groups. After the Trump administration reached a 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and the Biden administration followed through on that agreement in 2021, there had been hope in Washington that the Talibans desire for international recognition and assistance for the countrys impoverished population might moderate their behavior. But relations between the U.S. and the Taliban have deteriorated further since they imposed draconian new measures banning girls from school and excluding women from working for international aid and health agencies. However, a line of communication still exists between the two sides, led by the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Tom West. Wests contacts are primarily with Taliban officials in Kabul and not with the groups more ideological wing based in Kandahar. The U.S. decision to withdraw all troops fueled the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military, which the U.S. had supported for nearly two decades, and the return to power of the Taliban. In the aftermath, President Joe Biden directed that a broad review examine every aspect of this from top to bottom and it was released earlier this month. The Biden administration in the publicly released version of the review largely laid blame on President Donald Trump for the deadly and chaotic 2021 withdrawal, which was punctuated by the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate. News of the killing came on the same day that Biden formally announced he will seek a second term as president, offering a reminder of one of the most difficult chapters of his presidency. The disastrous drawdown was, at the time, the biggest crisis that the relatively new administration had faced. It left sharp questions about Biden and his teams competence and experience  the twin pillars central to his campaign for the White House. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday the U.S. has made clear to the Taliban that it is their responsibility to ensure that they give no safe haven to terrorists, whether from al-Qaida or the Islamic State. We have made good on the Presidents pledge to establish an over-the-horizon capacity to monitor potential terrorist threats, not only from in Afghanistan but elsewhere around the world where that threat has metastasized as we have done in Somalia and Syria, Kirby said in a statement. Yet Rex said the administration has not done enough to take responsibility for what happened at Abbey Gate. I feel like this is the administration trying to get the pressure off of them for accountability by saying that were holding ISIS accountable for our kids death, Rex said.

        "date": "April 26, 2023 10:24 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered a special statement in the parliament this morning (April 26). The President arrived at the parliament to join the ongoing session which commenced at 9.30 a.m. today under the chairmanship of the Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. The IMF-supported Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Sri Lanka is taken up for debate in the parliament. Delivering his statement, President Wickremesinghe emphasized that the shortcomings of this IMF program can be discussed since the IMF team will visit the country every 06 months. Some trade unions have raised their issues with regard to taxation. All those things can be discussed and resolved, the president noted. We, the whole parliament, should be turned into a government in order to complete this purpose. Lets get together for this despite the difference in opinions. The Head of State further expressed that now the country should be built up for the year 2048. If we dont do this, we will ruin the future of the youth, he added. Last week the political party leaders scheduled a three-day parliamentary debate for the Resolution for the Implementation of the Arrangement under the EFF of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the IMF-supported EFF is taken up for debate in the parliament from April 26-28, according to the Communications Department of the Parliament. The proposal submits that the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies should provide all necessary approvals for the implementation of the said set-up, however, a vote is to be followed post the three-day debate if necessary, the Communications Department said further. Following is the full statement made by President Wickremesinghe; I would like to address the concerns that have been raised in the media and elsewhere about the economic and financial issues that our country has faced. In July 2022, Sri Lanka was hit with riots, arson, and state bankruptcy, causing a complete loss of trust in our country. However, after eight months, we have managed to turn things around and its now being called the Sri Lanka comeback story. We have entered the path of renaissance and are reborn, and I am counting on the support of the whole country to take it forward. Let me give you a brief overview of the situation we faced. Our tax cuts in late 2019 cost us 4 of gross domestic product, and things only got worse with the Covid epidemic. In February 2022, the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated by 40 against the US Dollar within three months, and it continued to depreciate. Economic growth contracted by 7.8 throughout 2022, and inflation in September 2022 exceeded 70, with food inflation rising as high as 95. In this challenging backdrop, I decided to assume the presidency in July 2022 because I believed that our country could recover. If I had not taken responsibility during a time of agitations and protests, our country would have been completely destroyed. I didnt hesitate even when the paintings in my home library were burnt down and destroyed. At that time, Sri Lankas total debt was 83.6 billion US dollars, with foreign debt at 41.5 billion US dollars and domestic debt at 42 billion US dollars. By now, our overall debt ratio as a percentage of GDP has become 128. Due to non-repayment of bilateral and private loans, the amount of outstanding debt from April to December 2022 was estimated at 2.7 billion US dollars. By the middle of 2022, Sri Lanka was unable to import goods and services from abroad due to the worsening foreign exchange deficit. In May 2022, interest related to foreign loans failed to be paid. This was the first time in the history of Sri Lanka that we had to face such a situation. As soon as I took over the government, I began negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, in September, we reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund regarding extended credit facilities. The comprehensive credit facility consists of six major reforms, which are as follows: (a) Revenue Based Fiscal Consolidation  This reform includes institutional changes related to the public finance sector, strengthening the social security network, and introducing business reforms in the public sector. (b) Restructuring of Public Debt (c) Implementation of multiple strategies to ensure the restoration of financial stability, including the formation of foreign reserves under a flexible foreign exchange rate regime. (d) Implementation of relevant policies and reforms to ensure the stability of the financial sector. (e) Implementation of structural reforms necessary to control corruption  In this regard, the Minister will present the relevant draft. (f) Taking necessary measures to enhance economic growth Today, we received the financing assurance from foreign creditors, with the Paris Club and India working together to grant it. India was the first to publish it, and we are grateful for that. China is expected to deal with it separately, so we will discuss with the Paris Club and India on one hand and negotiate with China on the other. After these discussions, we will have talks with private creditors. This agreement will enable us to receive approximately 3 billion from the International Monetary Fund over the next four years, with the potential to obtain about 7 billion from other institutions. This money is crucial for us. Additionally, we have regained the trust of foreign banks and financial institutions, with economic stability already being established in the country. Social Security is receiving more funding, and investors are showing a keen interest in Sri Lanka. We have entered into agreements with the International Monetary Fund 16 times in the past, but we have not fully implemented them. On the 17th occasion, when we achieve stability, we must address our long-term weaknesses and move forward with a new program. One of the points to address is debt restructuring talks with our bilateral countries and private creditors. We want to restructure these loans, as failure to do so will result in a loss of liquidity. In order for the government to move forward, the restructuring must be done in rupees or dollars. The government wants to obtain funds for this service. Therefore, we must first negotiate with foreign creditors. We hope to initiate these discussions soon, with domestic debt restructuring also being considered. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is important to discuss this issue. Negotiations cannot be held with terms and conditions already in place. It is easier for us to join negotiations without conditions. Every aspect must be given special attention to ensure that no one is harmed in the process. Some banks may express their inability to cope with the program, but it is important for them to accept it in order to move the economy forward. There are concerns that the stock market may collapse, and some may not be able to offer different conditions. However, decisions will be made in parliament, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that no harm is done to anyone, such as the members of the Employees Provident Fund. We have initiated necessary programs to support the poor, and the World Bank has provided funding for this. We are currently implementing a program to give aid to those who truly deserve it and remove those who do not. Our aim is to create financial stability and protect the low-income people. To achieve these objectives, we are holding joint discussions with the Paris Club and India on one platform, while separate negotiations with China are also underway. We have nothing to hide, and several steps need to be taken in this regard. We have taken 09 prior actions (PAs) which we agreed to so we are qualified. Under that these are; Fiscal Consolidation  Cabinet approval of revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2023 in line with program parameters.  Parliament approval of a revised 2022 Budget that is in line with program parameters .  Submission to Parliament of the 2023 Appropriation Bill that is in line with program parameters. Fiscal Structural Reforms   Cabinet approval to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustment as prescribed by the 2018 fuel pricing formula to achieve cost recovery.  Cabinet Approval to automate semi-annual cost-recovery based electricity price adjustment. Multiple pillars   Cabinet approval of the new Central Bank Act with amendments from the bill submitted to Parliament in November 2019 in consultation with IMF- Staff. That has been done and we have to pass the bill here. Financial Stability   Cabinet approval of Banking (Special Provisions) Act to strengthen key elements of the CBSLs Crisis management powers.  Hiring by the CBSL of an independent firm to conduct banking sector diagnostic exercise based on Terms of Reference and time line established in consultation with IMF staff. Price Stability   Increase policy interest rates by 100 basis points to ensure forward  looking real policy rates on firmly upward path The next item is I want to inform the House of the Proposed Quantitative Performance Criteria (PC) and Indicative Targets (IT). Central Government primary balance 2022 -895 Bn by end December we want to make it -209 Bn. The net official international reserves US -3 Bn 540,000. By end December we want it to be -1 billion 592,000. Net credit to the government of the CBSL Rs. 2 Trillion 834 billion. By end December it should be 2 Trillion 740 Billion. The Stock of expenditure arrears of the Central government 2022 60 Billion it will be 30 billion. Central government tax revenue flow 2022 it was 1 Trillion 751,000 end March it was 650 billion but I must say we have fallen short in some areas such as Customs because the imports have been reduced, but on other had we have increased direct Taxation. The tax revenue finally the target for the end of the year is 2.9 billion. Social spending by the central government 142 billion by 2022, 187 Bn by end of 2023. The Treasury guarantees ceilings was 1.159 Trillion last year and it will go up to 1 Trillion700 Bn. I would like to tell you the Structural Benchmarks required for macroeconomic adjustment.  Parliamentary approval of the new Central Bank Act which will be tabled in parliament next month   Completion of the asset quality review component of bank diagnostic exercise for the two largest state-owned banks and the three largest private sector banks  Parliamentary approval of the welfare benefit payment scheme and the application of the new eligibility criteria to identify low-income families for receiving welfare benefit payments  End of May  Cabinet approval of a comprehensive strategy to restructure the balance sheets of the CEB, CPC, Sri Lankan Airlines, and the Road Development Authority  End-JUNE  Cabinet approval of a full revision of the Banking Act  End-JUNE  Enact new anti-competition legislation to harmonize it with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, pending comprehensive asset recovery provisions. it is a new anti-corruption legislation  End-JUNE  Cabinet approval of revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2024  End-JULY  Development by the CBSL of a roadmap for addressing banking system capital and Foreign exchange liquidity shortfalls and intervening in banks assessed to be non-viable  End-JULY Completion of the rollout of the ITMIS, expanding its coverage to all 220 heads  End-SEP Publication of the report of an IMF-led governance diagnostic technical assistance mission to assess Sri Lankas anti-corruption framework  End-SEP Submission to Parliament for the first reading of the 2024 Appropriation Bill  End-OCT Determination by the MOF of the size, timing, instruments, and terms and conditions for potential government recapitalization of viable banks which are unable to close capital shortfalls from private sources  End-OCT. 2023 Parliamentary approval of the 2024 Appropriation Act and the spending allocations in line with program parameters  End-DEC. 2023 Submission to Parliament of a new PFM law that will authorize the budget formulation process, roles and responsibilities of relevant agencies, and information and accountability requirements  End-DEC. 2023 Improve the Bulk Supply Transaction Account (BSTA) to accurately measure the electricity subsidy, and start using it to determine the cost recovery based electricity tariff and government transfer requirement  End-DEC. 2024 Parliament approval of a full revision of the Banking Act  End-DEC. 2023 Set retail fuel prices to their cost-recovery levels with monthly formula based adjustments, and compensate the CPC for providing any fuel subsidies with on budget transfers  Continuous Adjust the end-user electricity tariff schedule to its cost-recovery with semi-annual formula-based adjustments on a forward-looking basis in January and July each year  Continuous The last one is Achieving Debt Sustainability  Debt stock: Public debt should decline below 95 per cent of GDP by 2032  Post-programme gross financing needs: average annual gross financing needs of the central government during 2027- 32 should remain below 13 per cent of GDP compared to 34.6 in 2022  Post-programme foreign exchange debt service: annual foreign exchange debt service of the central government should remain below 4.5 per cent of GDP in each year over 2027-32 compared to 9.4 in 2022  Programme financing gaps: debt service reduction during 2023-27 should be sufficient to close external financing gaps. Under staff baseline scenario, US17 billion in debt service reduction is required, including the arrears accumulated in 2022 So we are trying to get a 17 billion debt reduction on that side. Do you want it or not. Are we going in for debt restricting? We cant manage without debt restructuring. That is what I want to make it clear to all the members. However stability alone is not enough for us. In actuality, the nominal GDP for 2019 was just 89 billion during this period. The gross domestic product will be the same in 2028 as it was in 2019. If we stay with the growth rate of 3, we can lose the national income of nine years. If we maintain the current growth rate of 3, we may lose nine years of national revenue. Furthermore, it has been predicted that the Sri Lankan GDP will decrease by around 3 in 2023. Economic positivity will likely be confirmed in the fourth quarter of 2023. If the economy grew at least 3 or 7 each year starting in 2019, our GDP would be worth 110 billion dollars. But if we go to 5, it will be 130 billion dollars. In fact we believe we will be able to reach 3 or 4 in the first two to three years. Following that, we must aim for a growth rate of at least 6 to 7 over this time period. That should be agreed upon by everyone in this House. However, this may be done at 7 or 8. We have opportunities for that. That is why we are restructuring the entire legal system. Some regulations have to be removed. Some people wonder why corporations are being sold. They can be better run by the private sector. We leave them to the private sector. In addition, various restrictions have been imposed for 25 to 30 years, depending on the preferences of each ministry. Let us now look at the economy and decide which limits will be retained and which will be lifted. A highly competitive social fair market system is required. We require a green economy. The economy must be digitalized. There are several activities available for this. Agriculture is being modernized, and new industries are being introduced. That is something I will address separately. We have no other option but the IMF agreement. There have not been alternative suggestions. If there is no other alternative, lets approve this. I also urge the opposition to work together. Lets get both parties together and pass this. Representatives of the International Monetary Fund visit our country every six months. Therefore if there are any shortcomings, we may address them and find a solution. Trade unions have highlighted concerns about taxation. All of these people will discuss and come up with a solution, and then we will all join together and develop a single national policy framework. What is the countrys national policy framework till 2048? There are policies and initiatives in place for the first five years. Lets discuss them. There is a national assembly. In particular, there are other committees. Lets make the entire parliament a government to implement this program. Lets get together for this. There may be differing viewpoints. However, everyone must back this initiative. Now we have to build the country for 2048. If we do not accomplish this, we would be betraying the countrys youth. Their future has been destroyed. Think about the youth of the country. Dont just think about grabbing power only. If this program is not done, none of us will be able to survive in another two or three years. So I urge everyone to come together to approve this. After that we will come together and prepare the set of policies required until 2048. I also, urge you to provide support to implement the program during the next five years.",

        "date": "April 26, 2023 10:39 am",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry says that the first group of Sri Lankans living in the Republic of Sudan, where violence erupted earlier this month, was successfully evacuated this morning (April 26). Accordingly, a total of 13 out of the 41 Sri Lankans in Sudan have been received by Sri Lankas Acting Consul General in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, upon their arrival. Meanwhile, 12 other Sri Lankans are in Port Sudan awaiting evacuation, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a media release. Sri Lanka continues to monitor the evolving security situation in Sudan and is closely working with its international partners, including the Government of India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to evacuate the stranded Sri Lankans. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Cairo and Sri Lankas Honorary Consul in Khartoum are in regular contact with the relevant parties in Khartoum, including the Sudanese authorities and the Indian Embassy in Khartoum, to secure safe evacuation. The Sri Lankan government is making every effort to evacuate the remaining Sri Lankans in Khartoum, taking into account the need for safe passage in a volatile security situation, the Foreign Affairs Ministry assured. For any inquiries, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Cairo can be reached via e-mail (slcairoconsulargmail.com) and telephone 201272813000. The Secretary of Honorary Consulate of Sri Lanka in Khartoum, Sayed Abdel can be contacted via telephone 249912394035 for any immediate assistance. The Foreign Affairs Ministry reiterated that ensuring the safety and security of Sri Lankans stranded in Sudan remains a primary concern of the Government of Sri Lanka. Violence broke out in Khartoum, Sudan on April 16, following weeks of tensions between the countrys army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both groups, which seized power in 2021 in a coup, were once allies, however, tensions were rife over the proposed integration of the RSF into the military. As a result of the disagreement, signing an internationally backed agreement with political parties on a transition to democracy was delayed. A coalition of civilian groups that signed a draft of the said agreement in December has called for an immediate halt to hostilities in order to prevent Sudan from sliding into a total collapse. The rising power struggle for control of Sudan led to fighting in the capital, Khartoum and it spread to other parts of the country sooner than later, killing more than 460 and injuring at least 4,000. Sudan, located in north-east Africa, is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. It is also one the poorest countries in the world, with its 46 million people living on an average annual income of 750 (606) per head. The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the countrys official languages are Arabic and English. -with inputs from agencies",

        "title": "Debt restructuring talks with India, Paris Club on one platform and China separately  President",
        "date": "April 26, 2023 11:39 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is scheduled to hold debt restructuring talks with the Paris Club, India and China before the discussion with private creditors, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said. Speaking in Parliament this morning (26 April), the Head of State announced that debt restructuring talks will be held with both the Paris Club and India in one platform, while discussions with China in this regard will be held separately prior to any discussions with private creditors. Meanwhile, speaking on Sri Lankas economic and political crises, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the island nations recovery thus far, stating that nearly eight months after the unrest in July 2022, Sri Lanka has now made a comeback. Thus, he urged the whole country to join in the efforts to resurrect the country. Following is the full statement made by President Wickremesinghe; I would like to address the concerns that have been raised in the media and elsewhere about the economic and financial issues that our country has faced. In July 2022, Sri Lanka was hit with riots, arson, and state bankruptcy, causing a complete loss of trust in our country. However, after eight months, we have managed to turn things around and its now being called the Sri Lanka comeback story. We have entered the path of renaissance and are reborn, and I am counting on the support of the whole country to take it forward. Let me give you a brief overview of the situation we faced. Our tax cuts in late 2019 cost us 4 of gross domestic product, and things only got worse with the Covid epidemic. In February 2022, the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated by 40 against the US Dollar within three months, and it continued to depreciate. Economic growth contracted by 7.8 throughout 2022, and inflation in September 2022 exceeded 70, with food inflation rising as high as 95. In this challenging backdrop, I decided to assume the presidency in July 2022 because I believed that our country could recover. If I had not taken responsibility during a time of agitations and protests, our country would have been completely destroyed. I didnt hesitate even when the paintings in my home library were burnt down and destroyed. At that time, Sri Lankas total debt was 83.6 billion US dollars, with foreign debt at 41.5 billion US dollars and domestic debt at 42 billion US dollars. By now, our overall debt ratio as a percentage of GDP has become 128. Due to non-repayment of bilateral and private loans, the amount of outstanding debt from April to December 2022 was estimated at 2.7 billion US dollars. By the middle of 2022, Sri Lanka was unable to import goods and services from abroad due to the worsening foreign exchange deficit. In May 2022, interest related to foreign loans failed to be paid. This was the first time in the history of Sri Lanka that we had to face such a situation. As soon as I took over the government, I began negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, in September, we reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund regarding extended credit facilities. The comprehensive credit facility consists of six major reforms, which are as follows: (a) Revenue Based Fiscal Consolidation  This reform includes institutional changes related to the public finance sector, strengthening the social security network, and introducing business reforms in the public sector. (b) Restructuring of Public Debt (c) Implementation of multiple strategies to ensure the restoration of financial stability, including the formation of foreign reserves under a flexible foreign exchange rate regime. (d) Implementation of relevant policies and reforms to ensure the stability of the financial sector. (e) Implementation of structural reforms necessary to control corruption  In this regard, the Minister will present the relevant draft. (f) Taking necessary measures to enhance economic growth Today, we received the financing assurance from foreign creditors, with the Paris Club and India working together to grant it. India was the first to publish it, and we are grateful for that. China is expected to deal with it separately, so we will discuss with the Paris Club and India on one hand and negotiate with China on the other. After these discussions, we will have talks with private creditors. This agreement will enable us to receive approximately 3 billion from the International Monetary Fund over the next four years, with the potential to obtain about 7 billion from other institutions. This money is crucial for us. Additionally, we have regained the trust of foreign banks and financial institutions, with economic stability already being established in the country. Social Security is receiving more funding, and investors are showing a keen interest in Sri Lanka. We have entered into agreements with the International Monetary Fund 16 times in the past, but we have not fully implemented them. On the 17th occasion, when we achieve stability, we must address our long-term weaknesses and move forward with a new program. One of the points to address is debt restructuring talks with our bilateral countries and private creditors. We want to restructure these loans, as failure to do so will result in a loss of liquidity. In order for the government to move forward, the restructuring must be done in rupees or dollars. The government wants to obtain funds for this service. Therefore, we must first negotiate with foreign creditors. We hope to initiate these discussions soon, with domestic debt restructuring also being considered. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is important to discuss this issue. Negotiations cannot be held with terms and conditions already in place. It is easier for us to join negotiations without conditions. Every aspect must be given special attention to ensure that no one is harmed in the process. Some banks may express their inability to cope with the program, but it is important for them to accept it in order to move the economy forward. There are concerns that the stock market may collapse, and some may not be able to offer different conditions. However, decisions will be made in parliament, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that no harm is done to anyone, such as the members of the Employees Provident Fund. We have initiated necessary programs to support the poor, and the World Bank has provided funding for this. We are currently implementing a program to give aid to those who truly deserve it and remove those who do not. Our aim is to create financial stability and protect the low-income people. To achieve these objectives, we are holding joint discussions with the Paris Club and India on one platform, while separate negotiations with China are also underway. We have nothing to hide, and several steps need to be taken in this regard. We have taken 09 prior actions (PAs) which we agreed to so we are qualified. Under that these are; Fiscal Consolidation  Cabinet approval of revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2023 in line with program parameters.  Parliament approval of a revised 2022 Budget that is in line with program parameters .  Submission to Parliament of the 2023 Appropriation Bill that is in line with program parameters. Fiscal Structural Reforms   Cabinet approval to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustment as prescribed by the 2018 fuel pricing formula to achieve cost recovery.  Cabinet Approval to automate semi-annual cost-recovery based electricity price adjustment. Multiple pillars   Cabinet approval of the new Central Bank Act with amendments from the bill submitted to Parliament in November 2019 in consultation with IMF- Staff. That has been done and we have to pass the bill here. Financial Stability   Cabinet approval of Banking (Special Provisions) Act to strengthen key elements of the CBSLs Crisis management powers.  Hiring by the CBSL of an independent firm to conduct banking sector diagnostic exercise based on Terms of Reference and time line established in consultation with IMF staff. Price Stability   Increase policy interest rates by 100 basis points to ensure forward  looking real policy rates on firmly upward path The next item is I want to inform the House of the Proposed Quantitative Performance Criteria (PC) and Indicative Targets (IT). Central Government primary balance 2022 -895 Bn by end December we want to make it -209 Bn. The net official international reserves US -3 Bn 540,000. By end December we want it to be -1 billion 592,000. Net credit to the government of the CBSL Rs. 2 Trillion 834 billion. By end December it should be 2 Trillion 740 Billion. The Stock of expenditure arrears of the Central government 2022 60 Billion it will be 30 billion. Central government tax revenue flow 2022 it was 1 Trillion 751,000 end March it was 650 billion but I must say we have fallen short in some areas such as Customs because the imports have been reduced, but on other had we have increased direct Taxation. The tax revenue finally the target for the end of the year is 2.9 billion. Social spending by the central government 142 billion by 2022, 187 Bn by end of 2023. The Treasury guarantees ceilings was 1.159 Trillion last year and it will go up to 1 Trillion700 Bn. I would like to tell you the Structural Benchmarks required for macroeconomic adjustment.

        "date": "April 26, 2023 11:53 am",
        "content": "WhatsApp is finally rolling out multi-device login support for more than one phone. Mark Zuckerberg announced the features rollout on Facebook and Instagram. Starting today, you can log into the same WhatsApp account on up to four phones, he said. WhatsApp said that this feature is rolling out to all users within the coming weeks. Until now, users could only use one WhatsApp account on one phone and multiple companion desktop devices. With the new rollout, users messages will be synced across devices including other phones. So even if one device is switched off, they can access the app on other devices. WhatsApp is one of the biggest messaging services around with more than 2 billion users. But it lacked multiphone support until now because of full end-to-end encryption support for chats and calls. The company started testing multi-device compatibility back in 2021 with select beta users. At that time, Meta (known as Facebook at that time) said that it had developed new tech to sync messages across devices while maintaining end-to-end encryption protection. Other competitors like Telegram and Messenger offered multidevice sync for messages, but they didnt have support for end-to-end encryption. In 2022, WhatsApp started making multidevice features available to everyone. But it didnt support multiple phones. WhatsApp is also rolling out a new way to link devices using a one-time code. You can now get a one-time-use code by entering your mobile number on WhatsApp Web, which you can use to link devices instead of scanning the QR code on your mobile phone. Well make this feature available for more linked devices in the future, the company said in a blog post. Source: TechCrunch",

There, the Bribery Commission handed over the revised indictments against the defendants before the open court. Later, the attorneys representing the defendants mentioned that the Bribery Commission has not provided all the documents that should be handed over to them. Accordingly, the judge granted additional time for the defence attorneys to check and report back on the matter and also ordered the case to be called for the pre-trial conference on June 16. The other two defendants in the case are the former Chairman of the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) Upali Liyanage and its former Managing Director Neil Ravindra Munasinghe. They are accused of causing losses to the government by persuading the Director Board of the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation to lease the Modara Fisheries Harbour to a private company for a meagre amount between the period from August 01 and November 01, 2014.",

        "content": "Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Southern Province Ajith Rohana has stated that he would not abide by the recent transfer order made by the Ministry of Public Security, as he is not bound to do so. In a letter addressed to the Ministrys Secretary, SDIG Ajith Rohana highlighted that the relevant order was neither issued by the National Police Commission, nor with their approval, thereby making it both illegal and unconstitutional. He further quoted Section 56 of the Police Ordinance and the verdict delivered in the States case against Wijesuriya in 1974, supporting his argument, and accused Public Security Minister Tiran Alles of having an ulterior motive behind such a malicious, arbitrary and unreasonable decision. The minister does all these malicious acts to harass us and to protect one SDIG, the SDIG Ajith Rohana alleged. Thus, the senior Police official noted that he is not bound to implement the order issued by the Ministry. Meanwhile, SDIG Priyantha Weerasooriya also wrote to the Chairman of the National Police Commission, Chandra Fernando, requesting action against the malicious, unreasonable and unjustifiable transfer. In his letter, the SDIG explained that he had been transferred with no proper reasoning and claimed that such ad-hoc transfers had occurred on several prior occasions, thereby creating frustration amongst the victimised officers. This practice will badly affect the image of Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police, and solemnity of office of this rank, and also undervalued among the subordinate as well, SDIG Weerasooriya said. Thus, he called on the Police Commission to look into the matter and take the required action to disapprove of such transfer orders issued by the Ministry. Seven SDIGs including Lalith Pathinayake, Ajith Rohana, S.C. Medawatte and W. K. Jayalath were transferred with immediate effect yesterday (25 April), due to service requirements.

It landed in the mountains at 1,000 meters altitude, and 10 kilometers from the closest settlement, Philip Ohlsson, head of communications at SSC, told Reuters on Tuesday. There are routines in place when things go wrong and we inform both Swedish and Norwegian governments, and other actors, he said. Work on retrieving the payload is underway and an investigation is being launched to determine the technical details behind the unplanned flight path, the agency said. The Norwegian authorities take any unauthorised activity on the Norwegian side of the border very seriously, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said by e-mail. In the event of any border violation, those responsible should immediately inform the relevant Norwegian authorities, which included the foreign ministry, through the right channels, the spokesperson said. The ministry had not received a formal notification of the incident from the Swedish authorities, she added. Work on Norwegian territory to salvage any wreckage also required prior consent, the spokesperson said. The Norwegian foreign ministry said it was not aware of whether there was any damage to the surroundings, while a SSC spokesperson said the rocket came down far from any settlement. Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority was not immediately available for a comment. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

Advanced Level examination answer sheet evaluation, as the government failed to respond favourably to their concerns regarding the PAYE tax hike. Even though FUTAs legitimate demands to address the unjust and arbitrary new tax regulations have not been met, FUTA has decided to immediately suspend its boycott of the GCE AL evaluation process as a humanitarian gesture to alleviate the problems faced by students, their parents, and the national education system in general, which have been exacerbated by the delay in marking GCE AL answer scripts, the letter addressed to the President read further. The FUTA stresses that its board of representatives is of the opinion that a formal constructive dialogue with the Head of State is required prior to suspending the trade union action.

        "content": "The death of a seven-year-old girl was reported in the Gampola area recently, due to a Paracetamol overdose at a hospital in the area. Shyamali Tharushi, identified as a resident of Udahentenna, Uduwalle in Gampola, had run a temperature on 20 April, after which she was taken to the Kurunduwatte Divisional Hospital and prescribed a dosage of Paracetamol. The child was, however, taken to the Gampola Base Hospital afterwards, as her condition had only worsened. Upon examination of the medication previously prescribed for the child at the Kurunduwatte Divisional Hospital, doctors of the Gampola Hospital confirmed that the child had been given a dosage usually prescribed for adults, resulting in the overdose. The girl was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where she was anaesthetised due to having suffered from unbearable pain, following which she died later that evening. An investigation into the matter is currently underway, Provincial Director of Health Services of the Central Province Dr. Nihal Weerasooriya said, after it was revealed that medication is being prescribed in a rather unruly manner by the pharmacist at the Kurunduwatte Divisional Hospital. It was revealed that owing to a shortage of prescription envelopes, medicines are dispensed in old electricity bills or paper chits. Further, due to an influx of patients, certain generic medications such as Paracetamol have already been wrapped and kept, with the recommended dose written on the inside of the paper. Thus, the Paracetamol issued for the child had also been given from one such pre-prepared stock, in which the dosage usually prescribed for adults was written on the inside. Despite the recommended dosage for the seven-year-old having been written on the outside of the relevant packaging, the parents of the child had failed to see this, as it was unorthodox and unanticipated, they said. Thus, they had administered the drug at a dosage much higher than that usually prescribed for children, resulting in the childs death.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka pushed back the release of its debt restructuring plan to investors to the middle of May from this month. The government will present a comprehensive plan for treating foreign as well as local debt, PKG Harischandra, director of economic research at the central bank, said late on Tuesday (April 25), without explaining the delay. Foreign creditors want to include local debt in the restructuring, which some Sri Lankan banks oppose, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told lawmakers on Wednesday during a debate on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. The government seeks to avoid talks that include pre-conditions, he said. The setback underscores the difficulty Sri Lanka faces in balancing the demands of its bondholders, raising the risks surrounding the IMFs US3 billion loan programme. Overseas investors are demanding that domestic bond holders share billions of US dollars of losses, but the governments proposal for a voluntary restructuring of its rupee-denominated bonds is finding few takers from banks worried about a hit to their capital. The delay is not entirely unexpected as discussions have just started with the external creditors on debt restructuring, said Saurav Anand, economist at Standard Chartered in Mumbai. Our base case is that the restructuring negotiations prolong and extend till December against the government target of completing the same by September. Sri Lanka will hold debt restructuring talks with Paris Club members together with India, while discussing with China separately, Wickremesinghe said. The government is also reviewing banks asset quality to determine their capacity to absorb any losses from the debt restructuring. Source - Bloomberg -Agencies",

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia decided to facilitate the Sri Lankan citizens stranded in the violence-hit Sudan taking into account a request made by the Sri Lankan government. Thereby, all Sri Lankans in Sudan have been informed to visit the Al Rabwa Hotel in Port Sudan or to contact via telephone to get the evacuation process arranged. Saudi embassy official Aamer Al Shihry can be contacted via 0024999910757, however, given the current situation in Sudan, communicating over the phone is proving extremely difficult. Sabry says the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will issue emergency entry visas at the points of entry for those who are evacuated from Sudan  regardless of government officials or normal citizens  to enable the diplomatic mission to make necessary arrangements to return the evacuees to their respective countries without any hindrances. On Wednesday (April 26), the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced that 13 Sri Lankans stranded in Sudan were safely evacuated, while 12 others are awaiting evacuation in Port Sudan. The ministry assured that the Sri Lankan government continues to monitor the evolving security situation in Sudan and is closely working with its international partners, including the Government of India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to evacuate the stranded Sri Lankans. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Cairo and Sri Lankas Honorary Consul in Khartoum are in regular contact with the relevant parties in Khartoum, including the Sudanese authorities and the Indian Embassy in Khartoum, to secure safe evacuation. For any inquiries, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Cairo can be reached via e-mail (slcairoconsulargmail.com) and telephone number 201272813000. The Secretary of Honorary Consulate of Sri Lanka in Khartoum, Sayed Abdel can be contacted via telephone 249912394035 for any immediate assistance. Saudi Arabia has evacuated more than 2,300 people from Sudan thus far. Over 100 Saudi citizens and at least 2,200 people from 67 other countries are among the evacuees. Violence broke out in Khartoum, Sudan on April 16, following weeks of tensions between the countrys army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both groups, which seized power in 2021 in a coup, were once allies, however, tensions were rife over the proposed integration of the RSF into the military. The rising power struggle for control of Sudan led to fighting in the capital, Khartoum and it spread to other parts of the country sooner than later, killing more than 460 and injuring at least 4,000. Sudan, located in north-east Africa, is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million square kilometres.

        "content": "The State Trade Corporation (STC) says the imported eggs can be sold to the general public if the Department of Animal Production  Health green-lights the move. Speaking on the matter, STC chairman Asiri Walisundara said a formal request has already been made from the department. The Sri Lankan government decided to import eggs from India in a bid to curb the soaring prices in the local market. However, imported eggs are provided only to the bakeries and restaurants based in the Western Province. Meanwhile, another stock of eggs from India reached the island last night (April 26). The STC chairman said the samples obtained from the latest egg consignment would be sent to the Animal Production  Health Department within the course of the day. However, a consignment of 2 million imported eggs is yet to be cleared from the port as the Animal Production  Health Department has delayed the issuance of reports on samples. Responding to queries made by Ada Derana on the matter, the departments director general Dr. Hemali Kothalawala said the relevant report is expected to be issued this evening.",

        "date": "April 27, 2023 12:01 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has denounced the United States move to blacklist the Governor of North Western Province in Sri Lanka, Wasantha Karannagoda. Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry has expressed grave concerns associated with the decision to US Ambassador Julie Chung today (April 27). The Sri Lankan government says such unilateral move by the United States without following the due process is counter-productive to the holistic approach that the island nation has taken on addressing national unity and reconciliation. It is also unfortunate that the announcement emanates against the backdrop of tangible progress made by the Government in strengthening the countrys democratic governance and reconciliation structures. The Sri Lankan government notes that, despite these challenges, it will continue its ongoing efforts to achieve reconciliation, economic recovery and socio-economic development. The United States, on Thursday (April 27), banned Karannagoda and his family from entering the country over alleged gross violation of human rights. Karannagoda was designated pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the US Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act 2023, due to his involvement in a gross violation of human rights during his tenure as Naval Commander. As a result of the move, Karannagoda and his wife, Srimathi Ashoka Karannagoda, are ineligible for entry into the United States, the statement read further. According to the US State Department, the allegation that Karannagoda committed a gross violation of human rights, documented by NGOs and independent investigations, is serious and credible. It says the move to designate Karannagoda reaffirms the United States commitment to upholding human rights, ending impunity for human rights violators, acknowledging the suffering of victims and survivors and promoting accountability for perpetrators in Sri Lanka. The bilateral relationship between the United States and the Government of Sri Lanka is based on 75 years of shared history, values, and a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. As we continue to build our bilateral relationship, we are committed to working with the Sri Lankan government on advancing justice, accountability, and reconciliation, including promoting security reform that maintains human rights at the forefront while ensuring Sri Lanka has the resources and training to properly address emerging security concerns, the statement concluded. Meanwhile, State Secretary Antony Blinken tweeted that the United States continues to seek truth and justice for the victims of the Sri Lankan civil war.",

        "date": "April 27, 2023 02:04 pm",
        "content": "The USAIDs Sri Lanka Energy Project and the Asia Development Bank (ADB) have collaborated to launch the Sri Lanka National Chapter WePOWER to promote the advancement of women working in the countrys local energy sector. The national chapter is affiliated with the regional South Asia WePOWER Network. In addition to promoting women in energy, this World Bank initiative also increases womens participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, the US Embassy in Colombo said in a statement. The launch featured a panel discussion and engaged power sector stakeholders including utilities, academia, and professional networks to raise awareness about the national chapter WePOWER and to encourage high-level officials support to ensure its sustainability and success. Recent World Bank statistics show women represent only about 13 percent of Sri Lankas power sector employment, the embassy said further. The power sector in Sri Lanka will greatly benefit from workplace diversity and increased participation by women, including in leadership positions, said Christopher Powers, Director of the USAIDs (US Agency for International Development) Economic Growth Office. Women will be needed to meet the growing talent demand in this sector. Their participation in technical and professional roles can greatly enhance the sectors effectiveness. The launch of the WePOWER national chapter in Sri Lanka is a timely and exciting development for the country, as well as for its energy sector, said ADB Country Director Chen Chen. As we witness a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy, Sri Lanka may capitalize on the trend in its economic recovery course. With more women joining the energy sector, we will create a more diverse and better equipped workforce to address the global and local challenges. It is important to think outside the box and challenge ways of doing things in the power and energy sector. But to do so, we should cultivate a culture that celebrates and promotes innovation, critical thinking, and diversity in the energy sector in general, said Mapa Pathirana, the Secretary Ministry of Power and Energy. Among its first efforts, Sri Lanka WePOWER plans to conduct training in gender equality and social inclusion and a workshop in May to develop an action plan to create and monitor gender activities with targets and goals under its five pillars: STEM education, recruitment, development, retention, and policy and institutional change. USAIDs Sri Lanka Energy Program is helping Sri Lanka transform its power sector into a market-based, secure, reliable, and sustainable system by mobilizing investment to deploy advanced technologies, increase flexibility, and enhance competitiveness. The U.S. commitment to help build a power sector for tomorrow is one of many elements of Americas long, strong, and enduring partnership in Sri Lanka, a partnership that has been the foundation of 75 years of close relations and effective work together.",

        "content": "A discussion regarding the import of maize to be used for the production of poultry feed was held at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of the Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera and the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake. During the meeting yesterday (26), special emphasis was placed on regulating the poultry and egg industry to ensure an uninterrupted supply of poultry and eggs to consumers at a reasonable rate, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The Ministry of Agriculture officials were instructed by Sagala Ratnayake to determine the quantity of locally produced maize used for animal feed, estimate the future production, and create a report on the amount of maize that would require importation, according to the PMD. He also said that the report will be submitted to President Ranil Wickremesinghe as soon as possible. The production of maize used as animal feed and its pricing was extensively reviewed, and Sagala Ratnayake assured that the licenses necessary to import the yearly maize requirement would be issued immediately, it added. It was also pointed out that by importing maize when the price of maize in the world market is low, the domestic maize supply could be met without a crisis. Additionally, as the current local rice production surpassed the immediate need for rice, discussions were held regarding the possibility of using some of the surplus rice as animal feed, which prompted consideration of relaxing the government-imposed restrictions on the use of rice for this purpose, the PMD added. In light of this, Sagala Ratnayake instructed officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Trade to conduct a thorough analysis of the nations rice consumption needs and current rice production, determine the surplus rice reserves, and promptly deliver a report. Sagala Ratnayake emphasized that utilizing excess rice reserves for animal feed could stabilize rice prices for farmers and lessen the requirement for maize imports, resulting in savings on foreign exchange expenditures. Dr. Suren Batagoda, Presidents Adviser on Food Security, Trade Ministry Secretary A.M.P.M.B. Atapattu Senior officials of line Institutions of the Ministries, Ministry of Agriculture, Finance and the representatives of Poultry and Egg Producers Associations participated in the discussion, according to the PMD.",

        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe not to table the Anti-Terrorism Bill (ATB) in parliament, in its current format. In a letter addressed to the Head of State, the organization said the Bill, in its current format, should not be presented to the parliament until a national dialogue  one with broad spectrum participation  is concluded and its recommendations are published along with a clear action plan. The rights group is of the firm view that establishing a national dialogue that equally addresses the peace and reconciliation process will better define the contextual necessity for a Bill comparable to the proposed ATB. More importantly it will show the governments commitment to ensuring and building further peace and harmony amongst the nations citizenry. The HRCSL believes that a heightened level of patriotism and productivity amongst all Sri Lankans will be a direct result of this. The HRCSL, in its letter, says it recently conducted a round table discussion with the leadership of several civil society groups, during which the concerns about the proposed ATB was highlighted. Following the discussion, the HRCSL arrived at the decision that it is prudent to better understand the purpose of the proposed ATB against the context of Sri Lanka today. The rights group urged the President to take the lead on, and in partnership with your office, a National Dialogue that would better assess and raise awareness of the necessity for the country to have such a Bill. To address the ATB, the HRCSL says it is imperative to further explore the much-delayed peace and reconciliation process, which would not only be for the communities in the North and East, but also for the communities affected by the uprisings in the South in the 70s and 80s.",

        "date": "April 27, 2023 05:29 pm",
        "content": "NATO countries have delivered more than 98 of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, the military alliances chief said Thursday, giving Kyiv a bigger punch as it appears poised to launch a counteroffensive. Along with more than 1,550 armored vehicles, 230 tanks and other equipment, member nations have sent Ukraine vast amounts of ammunition and also trained and equipped more than nine new Ukrainian brigades, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. More than 30,000 troops are estimated to make up the new brigades. This will put Ukraine in a strong position to continue to retake occupied territory, Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels. His comments came a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping had a long and meaningful phone call in their first known contact since Russias full-scale invasion more than a year ago. Though Zelenskyy wsaid he was encouraged by Wednesdays call and Western officials welcomed Xis move, the development didnt appear to bring about any immediate shift in peace prospects. Russia and Ukraine are far apart in their terms for peace, and Beijing  while looking to position itself as a global diplomatic power  has refused to criticize Moscows invasion. The Chinese government sees Russia as a diplomatic ally in opposing U.S. influence in global affairs, and Xi visited Moscow last month. Stoltenberg said the 31 NATO allies were committed to shoring up Ukraines military, adding that taking back land occupied by the Kremlins forces would give Kyiv a stronger negotiating position if peace talks occur. The Kremlin gave a lukewarm response to the call between Xi and Zelenskyy. Asked if the call could help end the fighting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: We are ready to welcome anything that could lead to the termination of the conflict in Ukraine and the achievement of all the goals set by Russia. Peskov said the conversation between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders was the sovereign business of those countries and the issue of their bilateral dialogue. With battlefield positions in Ukraine largely static as a war of attrition took hold in recent months, Russian forces have kept up their bombardment of Ukrainian areas, often hitting apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 were injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraines presidential office said Thursday. They included one person killed and 23 wounded, including a child, when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv, official said. The governor of Mykolaiv province, Vitalii Kim, said 22 multi-story buildings, 12 private houses and other residential buildings were damaged in the attack. Kalibr missiles are launched from ships or submarines, The ones that hit Mykolaiv were fired from somewhere in the Black Sea, according to Ukraines Operational Command South.

        "date": "April 27, 2023 07:40 pm",
        "content": "Thai police say they have arrested a woman suspected of killing 12 of her friends and acquaintances by poisoning them with cyanide. Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn was arrested in Bangkok on Tuesday following recent inquiries into a friends death. The victims family had raised suspicions after she died on a trip with Sararat earlier this month. Following inquiries, police this week said they believed Sararat had killed 11 others, including an ex-boyfriend. Police allege she killed for financial reasons. Sararat has denied all the charges. Thai authorities have denied her bail. Two weeks ago, she had travelled with her friend to Ratchaburi province, west of Bangkok, where they had taken part in a Buddhist protection ritual at a river, police said. Shortly after, her friend Siriporn Khanwong collapsed and died on the riverbank. Traces of cyanide were found in her body during the autopsy, police said. Her phone, money and bags were also missing when she was found. Authorities said the other alleged victims had died in a similar way, but did not disclose further information. The murders began in 2020, they said. They also didnt identify all of the victims, but named Sararats former partner, as well as two female police officers, among the dead. Thai police have also questioned Sararats partner- a senior police officer in Ratchaburi province, where her friend died. The pair have recently split, Thai media reported. Police said Sararat knew all of the victims and she may have been motivated by financial reasons. One friend, who police believe was targeted, had loaned her 250,000 baht (5,900; 7,300) police said. The woman had vomited and fainted after having lunch with Sararat but survived. Relatives of victims had also reported missing jewellery and cash, police said. But the families had not suspected foul play at the time, officers said, indicating that evidence gathering could be a challenge. Some bodies had also been cremated, police said. Cyanide can be detected in corpses several months after death, if a lethal amount was used. The poison starves the bodys cells of oxygen, which can induce heart attacks. Early symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, and vomiting. Its use in Thailand is heavily regulated and those found to have unauthorised access face up two years in jail.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during a recent meeting at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, directed the Plantation Reform Committee (PRC) officials to take immediate action to resolve the prevailing issues in the plantation sector. During the meeting, Wickremesinghe noted that the government is committed to carrying out its agricultural modernization plan. However, he also highlighted certain issues that need to be addressed in the sector. One of the main challenges mentioned by the President was related to the Mahaweli Authority and its lands, which are now being resolved. Another issue that was discussed extensively was the regional plantation companies. The President pointed out that the main challenge faced by regional plantations is the leases that are due to expire in the next 10 or 15 years. He stressed that if the government is going ahead with agricultural modernization, it will have to give new leases. However, the President instructed the members of the PRC to find a basis for granting new leases, as not all companies have performed well. He also instructed them to update the survey conducted in 2018 to assess the performance of the companies and determine the basis for granting new leases. During the meeting, the President suggested that companies should not be allowed to sell their shareholdings without the consent of the government once they have been given land. Additionally, he also said that the issue of gemming should also be addressed. He said modernizing agriculture is turning it into agribusinesses. The PRC was asked for their views on this matter. Other issues discussed during the meeting included housing in the plantation sector, challenges facing the three main crops (tea, rubber, and coconut) that come under the plantation sector, and problems pertaining to tea plantation line-rooms and housing, according to the PMD. The meeting also focused on a pilot project where land is being subcontracted to workers, issues related to Land Reform Commission (LRC) and the sale of tea to Iran.",

        "date": "April 28, 2023 02:04 am",
        "content": "Welisara Magistrate Thusitha Dhammika Uduwawidana has deemed the deaths of the 11 inmates at the Mahara Prison, who were shot dead during a riot that erupted in 2020, a crime. The magistrate mentioned this on Thursday, delivering the verdict of the magisterial inquest on the incident. He, thereby, ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to immediately arrest the prison officers who were involved in the shooting and to produce them before the court without delay. On 29 November 2020, a total of 11 inmates died while 106 others and 02 prison officials sustained injuries during a tense situation at the Mahara Prison when a group of inmates had attempted to break out from prison following a conflict with prison officials. The tense situation broke out during a protest launched by the inmates, demanding hospital treatment for prisoners who were infected with Covid-19. It was later reported that the prison authorities had opened fire to control the situation and a team of Police Special Task Force (STF) personnel was deployed to assist prison authorities. Subsequently, a massive fire had broken out at the prison when several inmates set fire to the health office, a storage area, and several other places within the prison. The prison officials later claimed that the rioting inmates had broken into the prisons medical section and consumed the stored pharmaceuticals including the ones used to treat mental illnesses, resulting in more violent conduct among the prisoners. Later, a five-member experts committee was appointed to conduct post-mortem examinations on the 11 inmates who died in the Mahara Prison riot. The panel comprised Dr Sandun Wijewardena, Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama; Dr S.D.C Perera, JMO, Infectious Diseases Hospital in Mulleriyawa; Dr P.P. Dassanayake  Chief JMO, Colombo South Teaching Hospital in Kalubowila; Jean Perera, Professor, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Colombo; P.G. Madawala, Firearms Specialist  Deputy Government Analyst. Delivering the verdict of the magisterial inquest, Welisara Magistrate Uduwawidana said, pursuant to the observations made by the experts committee, the deceased inmates had not been shot below despite the prison officers claiming otherwise. He also raised doubts as to whether this shooting was indeed an attempt to disperse the rioting inmates. As per the said report, none of the deceased inmates had consumed pharmaceuticals that could have intoxicated them, the magistrate noted further. Thereby, he called for the immediate arrest of the prison officials who ordered the shooting and those who carried out the shooting.",

        "date": "April 28, 2023 09:19 am",
        "content": "Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Levan Dzhagaryan says the sanctions imposed by the United States on Sri Lankas former navy commander Wasantha Karannagoda are totally unacceptable. Dzhagaryans objections came after the US State Department announced that Karannagoda, the current Governor of North Western Province, and his family are banned from entering the United States over the alleged gross violation of human rights. However, the Sri Lankan government hit back at the move, expressing grave concerns about the decision. A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry said such unilateral move by the United States without following due process is counter-productive to the holistic approach that the island nation has taken on addressing national unity and reconciliation. Speaking to the media on Thursday, the Russian envoy in Colombo stressed that neither the United States nor the other Western countries have any right to interfere in the domestic affairs of any sovereign state. He alleged that the main aim of the United States is the destabilization of the situation in the world. Raising concerns about the alleged human rights violations committed by Western counties, the Russian envoy said they should focus on their domestic issues first. Such interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries including Sri Lanka is totally unacceptable, Dzhagaryan continued. Nobody has the right to lecture you what to do or not to do. This is your domestic issue. And I think the government of Sri Lanka, your political parties  both the opposition and the ruling party  and the people, you are wise enough to settle your problems yourself.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has instructed Sri Lanka Police to dispose of the expired tear gas at all police stations across all of Sri Lanka. Senior police officers who attended the meeting told the COPA that the process to discard the expired tear gas is already underway, assuring that these items would never be put to use again. Chaired by the committees chairman State Minister of Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna, the COPA convened a meeting on Wednesday (April 26) with senior officers of Sri Lanka Police in attendance. The meeting was organized to examine the Auditor Generals report and current performance for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The COPA chairman also called for a report on the measures taken to control public riots including the use of tear gas. Further, the committee instructed the senior officers that the next proposed program of the police department be submitted to the COPA within a month. It was questioned as to why the recommendation given in this regard when the police department was called before COPA in 2016 is yet to be implemented. Inspector-General of Police (IGP) C.D. Wickramaratne stated that since it is difficult to set up a single information technology system for the Sri Lanka Police, steps will be taken to introduce information technology systems in segments. Accordingly, the police chief revealed that a new pilot project is currently being implemented in Hatton and Nuwara-Eliya police stations where details can be obtained from the filing of a complaint to the status of its court proceedings. The COPA chairperson emphasized that it is essential to establish an information technology system in the police department where relevant information can be obtained immediately by integrating the motor transport department and other institutions. Accordingly, he instructed to give a report on the current program and the proposed plan to the Committee within a month. Issues such as the lack of female police officers in the Sri Lanka Police were also addressed. It was disclosed that there are 2419 female police constable vacancies and it was proposed to complete the said vacancies in the year 2023. However, it could not be done due to the current economic situation. The IGP said that the conventional context within the police force has been changed and the necessary reform program has been initiated to provide opportunities for women to higher positions including the post of Inspector General of Police in the future. He said that as a result, an opportunity will be provided for the emergence of a future female Inspector General of Police. The Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, IGP and many senior police officials were invited to this event.",

A Polish-US mission discovered the statue dating back to the Roman era while digging at the ancient temple in Berenice, an antiquities ministry statement said on Wednesday. The find has important indications over the presence of trade ties between Egypt and India during the Roman era, the head of Egypts supreme antiquities council Mostafa al-Waziri said. The statue, with part of its right side and its right leg missing, measures 71 centimetres (28 inches) in height and portrays Buddha with a halo around his head and a lotus flower by his side. Waziri said Berenice was one of the largest seaports in Roman-era Egypt, and was often the destination for ships from India laden with spices, semi-precious stones, textiles and ivory. Egypt has unveiled many major archaeological discoveries in recent years, amid attempts to revive its vital tourism industry after years of political unrest and the Covid pandemic. However, critics say the flurry of excavations has prioritised finds that grab media attention over hard academic research. The crown jewel in the governments plans is the long-delayed inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum at the foot of the pyramids in Giza.

The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and MP Patali Champika Ranawaka abstained from voting as they refused to back the resolution. Meanwhile, the National Peoples Power (NPP), Wimal Weerawansa-led Uththara Lanka Sabhagaya and MP Dullas Alahapperuma-led Freedom Peoples Congress voted against it. It is noteworthy that opposition MP A.H.M. Fowzie representing the SJB, dissident MPs Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, John Seneviratne and Sudarshini Fernandopulle have endorsed the resolution along with the MPs of the ruling party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) President Wickremesinghe had previously noted that the key points of the IMF agreement would be enacted into law, once the resolution on the implementation of the EFF program is passed in the parliament. On March 20, 2023, the Executive Board of the IMF green-lighted a 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. The EFF program opens doors for Sri Lanka to access financing up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organizations. The program is expected to provide much-needed policy space to drive the economy out of the unprecedented challenges and instill confidence amongst all the stakeholders. Soon after receiving the IMFs board approval, Sri Lanka received an initial disbursement of USD 333 million (amounting to SDR 254 million) from the EFF arrangement, which is expected to catalyze new external financing including from the ADB and the World Bank. Sri Lanka reached a Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF on a four-year program supported by the Extended Fund Facility on September 01, 2022. The government is currently negotiating debt restructuring with bondholders and creditors before the IMF reviews the agreement in September. Earlier this month, Japan, India and France launched a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. The three creditor countries have been working closely for a coordinated debt restructuring process for the island nation. China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral creditor, did not join the initiative at the outset, however, on several occasions, reiterated support for Sri Lankas debt restructuring process. The Asian economic giant says it has been in close communication with the island nation and supports Chinese financial institutions in actively discussing debt treatment arrangements with Sri Lanka.",

This was disclosed when the COPA met in Parliament on 25 April in order to review the matters included in the reports of the Auditor General for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the current performance of the Department of Samurdhi Development. Accordingly, it was revealed that while 33 of those who receive the Samurdhi allowance are those unentitled to it, a similar percentage of those who should be entitled to the allowance are not. The relevant information was gathered in a survey conducted covering the entire island from 2015 to 2017, in which it was found out that that a total of 449,979 families should be removed from the Samurdhi subsidy. Officials of the National Audit Office also claimed that an informality had been observed in the selection of Samurdhi beneficiaries. It was further disclosed that some of the Samurdhi beneficiaries who received the monthly benefits remitted to the Prajamula Banks, kept them in their bank accounts for a long period of time and according to the surveys, the amount kept in the savings accounts of 2433 beneficiaries in 41 domains of 10 Prajamula Banks amounted to Rs. 59,951,537.",

        "date": "April 29, 2023 12:13 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Country Engagement Plan was launched on Friday (April 28) as a joint initiative of the Inland Revenue Department, the Fiscal Policy Department, the Finance Ministry and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Sri Lanka. The engagement plan aims to better align taxation policies with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the country. The SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. But it requires fundamental changes to the way the economy and fiscal policies are organized. In order to offset challenging market conditions faced by developing countries and accelerate progress towards the SDGs, the recently launched SDG Stimulus Plan of the UN Secretary-General had called for a fit-for-purpose sustainable financing approach. Therefore, stable and reliable state revenues are crucial for financing the SDGs. Hence, the Inland Revenue Department, the Fiscal Policy Department, the Finance Ministry and the UNDP in Sri Lanka came together to better align taxation policies with the achievement of the SDGs in the country. Joining 25 countries globally  notably the Maldives and Bhutan in the Asia Pacific region  the Sri Lanka Country Engagement Plan will provide the roadmap for the demand-driven activities envisaged for the country. Funded by the governments of Finland and Norway, this initiative will be implemented for two years and anchored at the Inland Revenue Department and the Fiscal Policy Department. Gracing the occasion, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe stated, The Government of Sri Lanka recognizes that revenue generation stands at the core of financing public development and is integral to achieving the SDGs. Tax systems play a major role in mobilizing domestic resources which form the bedrock of both development and climate finance. This initiative does not implement new taxes to achieve the SDGs, but rather propose how existing public finance policies and principles can be better aligned and efficiently managed to make progress towards the SDGs. Commenting on the importance of aligning fiscal policies towards the achievement of SDGs, R.M.P. Rathnayake, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury stated, the Government of Sri Lanka - through this initiative - hopes to enhance domestic resource mobilization and foster a stronger connection between development financing and revenue generation by designing a sustainable progressive tax system for the realization of the SDGs. Notably, this initiative will explore better alignment of fiscal policies and frameworks with the SDGs, develop capacities to improve tax administration, and help incorporate Sri Lankas perspective and needs in global and regional discussions on reforms. Forging wide-ranging partnerships, the Initiative will roll out an SDG Taxation Framework, raise awareness on alignment of public finance to achieve the SDGs and implement an OECD-UNDP Tax Inspectors without Borders Programme (TIWB) which will provide hands-on learning by doing assistance. Further, the Initiative aims to explore digitalization solutions to improve tax filing, processing and collection efficiency, support Sri Lankas climate and gender considerations in fiscal policies, and support treaty negotiations in partnership with the South Centre, Switzerland. Articulating the need to address the gap between public finance and the SDGs, UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Azusa Kubota stated, At the time of polycrisis characterized by the COVID pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the energy shortage and the rising cost of living, the global community is confronted with a fast-growing fiscal gap. At the same time, we are seeing regression in the SDGs  none of the countries in the region are likely to reach SDGs by 2030. This situation calls for a more efficient generation of income and targeted and responsible use of resources for investments in areas that directly contribute to the SDG attainment. UNDP is committed to working with the Government of Sri Lanka and a wide range of stakeholders in the roll out of this Initiative to help the country mobilize its resources at scale and achieve the SDGs.",

        "date": "April 29, 2023 12:59 pm",
        "content": "A Dutch man suspected of fathering more than 550 children worldwide through sperm donations has been ordered to stop. The man named Jonathan, aged 41, could be fined more than 100,000 (88,000) if he tries to donate again. He was banned from donating to fertility clinics in the Netherlands in 2017 after it emerged he had fathered more than 100 children. But instead of stopping he carried on donating sperm abroad and online. A court in The Hague has told him to provide a list of all the clinics he had used and to order them to destroy his sperm. The man was said to have misled hundreds of women. Dutch clinical guidelines state that a donor should not father more than 25 children in 12 families. But judges said the man had helped produce between 550 and 600 children since he began donating sperm in 2007. He was taken to court by a foundation protecting donor childrens rights, and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. The point is that this kinship network with hundreds of half-brothers and half-sisters is much too large, a spokesman for the court, Gert-Mark Smelt, said. Over 100 of the children fathered by the man were born in Dutch clinics and others privately, but he also donated to a Danish clinic which dispatched his semen to addresses in various countries. Judge Thera Hesselink said the court prohibits the defendant from donating his semen to new prospective parents after the issuing of this judgment. The man is also not permitted to contact any prospective parents with the wish that he was willing to donate semen advertise his services to prospective parents or join any organisation that establishes contact between prospective parents, the judge said. The donor deliberately misinformed prospective parents about the number of children he had already fathered in the past, the district court in The Hague said. All these parents are now confronted with the fact that the children in their family are part of a huge kinship network, with hundreds of half-siblings, which they did not choose, it said. The court said it was sufficiently plausible that this has or could have negative psychosocial consequences for the children. Sperm donors are told to limit the number of times they offer their services, to reduce the chance that siblings might unknowingly form a couple and have children together. The Netherlands has been hit by fertility scandals in the past. In 2019, a Dutch fertility doctor accused of using his own sperm to inseminate patients without their consent was confirmed as the father of 49 children. Source: BBC -Agencies",
