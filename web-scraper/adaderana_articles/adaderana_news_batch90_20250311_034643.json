        "title": "Israeli PM orders military plan to evacuate Rafah and defeat Hamas",
        "date": "February 9, 2024 11:48 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israels military on Friday to draw up a dual plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians from the crowded southern Gazan city of Rafah and to defeat the last Hamas fighters there. His office announced the move as pressure mounted on Israel over its threat to launch a ground assault on Rafah, the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are trapped in the city after fleeing fighting elsewhere. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Israels response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants was over the top and Washington said it would not support any military operation mounted in Rafah without due consideration for civilians. Aid groups said there would be a high Palestinian death toll if Israeli forces stormed Rafah, and warned of the growing humanitarian crisis in the city, on the coastal enclaves border with Egypt. Netanyahus office said four Hamas battalions were in Rafah and Israel could not achieve its goal of eliminating the Islamist militants while they remained there. Civilians should be evacuated from the combat zone, it said. Therefore, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and the security establishment to submit to the Cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions. The statement, issued two days after Netanyahu rejected a Hamas ceasefire proposal that also envisaged the release of hostages held by the Palestinian militant group, gave no further details. Rafah has become the focus of Israels military campaign in Gaza as its forces shift their offensive southwards in response to the Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel by Hamas gunmen who rule the coastal strip. More than half Gazas 2.3 million people are now sheltering in Rafah, many of them penned up against the border fence with Egypt and living in makeshift tents. There is a sense of growing anxiety, growing panic in Rafah because basically people have no idea where to go, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Doctors and aid workers in Rafah are struggling to supply even basic aid and stop the spread of disease. No war can be allowed in a gigantic refugee camp, said Jan Egeland, Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warning of a bloodbath if Israeli operations expand there. The Palestinian Presidency said what it described as Netanyahus plans for a military escalation in Rafah aimed to displace the Palestinian people from their land. Taking this step threatens security and peace in the region and the world. It crosses all red lines, said the office of Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority that exerts partial self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank. An Israeli official who declined to be named said that Israel would try to organise for people in Rafah, most of whom fled there from the north, to be moved back northwards within Gaza ahead of any military operation there. GAZAN CHILDREN ACUTELY MALNOURISHED Gazas health ministry said at least 27,947 Palestinians had been confirmed killed in the conflict, 107 of them in the previous 24 hours, and 67,459 injured. It has said many more could be buried under rubble from Israeli attacks since Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages in the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies. In a further sign of the wars impact, almost one in 10 of Gazans under five are now acutely malnourished, according to initial U.N. data from arm measurements that show physical wasting. The charity ActionAid said some Gazans were eating grass. Every single person in Gaza is now hungry, and people have just 1.5 to 2 litres of unsafe water per day to meet all their needs, it said. Hours before Netanyahus statement, Israeli warplanes carried out new sorties in which Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people had been killed, eight of them in the Rafah area. We were sleeping inside and, when the strike hit, were thrown outside. After that, another rocket hit, said Mohammed al-Nahal, an elderly Palestinian standing beside the rubble of a building that had been hit. It destroyed the entire home. My daughter was killed. My daughter, her husband, her son, all were martyred. Israels military said its forces had been in action in the area of Khan Younis and in northern and central Gaza to eliminate militant cells and destroy militant infrastructure. It says it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties and accuses Hamas militants of hiding among civilians, including at schools, shelters and hospitals. Hamas has denied doing so. BIDEN SAYS ISRAEL GOING OVER THE TOP The U.S., Israels main ally, has this week stepped up efforts to secure a ceasefire in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and also publicly criticised Netanyahus government. Im of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top, Biden told reporters at the White House on Thursday. Biden said he had been pushing for a deal to pause fighting to allow the release of hostages, increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Palestinian civilians, and normalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Hamas this week proposed a ceasefire of 4-12 months, during which remaining hostages would go free, Israel would withdraw its troops and an agreement would be reached on an end to the war. Netanyahu said Hamas terms, offered in response to a proposal drawn up by U.S. and Israeli spy chiefs with Qatar and Egypt, were delusional and vowed to fight on. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Pakistan election: Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif each claim advantage",
        "date": "February 10, 2024 08:03 am",
        "content": "The jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has claimed victory in Thursdays general election and called on his supporters to celebrate. Independent candidates linked to him have won most seats so far, with the majority of seats declared. But another ex-PM, Nawaz Sharif, says his party has emerged the largest and urges others to join him in coalition. No group or party appears on course to win an overall majority. The final results are yet to be announced. In a staunch video message posted on X created using AI, Mr Khan claimed his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had won a landslide victory despite what he has called a crackdown on his party. He is currently in jail having been convicted in cases he says are politically motivated. The success of the PTI-linked candidates was unexpected, with most experts agreeing that Mr Sharif - believed to be backed by the countrys powerful military - was the clear favourite. But the PTI is not a recognised party after being barred from running in the election, so technically Mr Sharifs PML-N is the largest official political group. So now the political horse-trading begins in earnest, which means it could still be a while before anyone is able to claim outright victory. In a speech on Friday, Mr Sharif acknowledged that he did not have the numbers to form a government alone. But addressing supporters outside his partys headquarters in the city of Lahore, he urged other candidates to join him in a coalition and said he could remove the country from difficult times. Speaking to the BBCs Newsnight programme on Friday, Mr Khans former special assistant Zulifkar Bukhari said: Knowing Imran Khan and knowing the ethos of our political party PTI, I dont think well be making any coalition, forming a government with any of the main parties. However, we will be forming a coalition... to be in parliament - not as an independent but under one banner, one party. And asked about whether Mr Khan could potentially be released, Mr Bukhari said: I think the minute we go to the high court and the supreme court we are extremely confident that he will be released, and a lot of the charges - if not all - will be thrown out on legal merit and procedural merit. The third biggest party appears to be the Pakistan Peoples Party led by Bilawal Bhutto, the son of PM Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated in 2007. As results trickled in, the UK and US voiced concerns over restrictions on electoral freedoms during the vote. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK urged authorities in Pakistan to uphold fundamental human rights including free access to information, and the rule of law. In a statement, he went on to express regret that not all parties were formally permitted to contest the elections. Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller criticised what he described as undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly during Pakistans electoral process. He also cited attacks on media workers and restrictions on access to the internet and telecommunication services as reasons to worry about allegations of interference in the process. Many analysts have said this is among Pakistans least credible elections. Voters in Lahore told the BBC that the internet blackout on polling day meant it was not possible to book taxis to go and vote, while others said they could not co-ordinate when to head to polling stations with their family members. An interior ministry spokesman said the blackouts were necessary for security reasons. Support from the military in Pakistan is seen as important to succeed politically, and analysts believe Mr Sharif and his party currently have their backing, despite their differences in the past. Maya Tudor, associate professor at the University of Oxfords Blavatnik School of Government, said the lead taken by Imran Khans PTI was shocking in the context of the countrys past. A win would be remarkable - in every single other election in Pakistans recent history, the militarys preferred candidate has won, Dr Tudor explained. As many as 128 million people were registered to cast their votes, almost half of whom were under the age of 35. More than 5,000 candidates - of whom just 313 are women - contested 266 directly-elected seats in the 336-member National Assembly. Pakistans former ambassador to the United States, Maleeha Lodhi, said Pakistan desperately needs political stability to address what she described as the worst economic crisis in its history. But, in a hopeful note, Ms Lodhi said Pakistans voter numbers show a belief in the democratic process. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 10, 2024 09:11 am",
        "content": "Another suspect has been apprehended in connection with the murder of a Buddhist monk at a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area last month. The WesternNorth Crimes Division officers have also recovered a hand grenade and a pistol from the possession of the arrestee. A group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha in the early hours of January 23. The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital. But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment. Earlier this week, the investigating officers managed to arrest four other suspects who were allegedly complicit in the murder. The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the perpetrators had been recovered from the possession of the fourth suspect, in addition to a live grenade, pistol, 3 magazines, 15 grams of heroin, 19 rounds of live ammunition, a motorcycle with a fake registration plate, remote switch of the car used in the shooting and a mobile phone. Preliminary investigations had revealed that the 30-year-old was directly involved in multiple criminal activities and drug syndicates run by two members of organized criminal gangs, currently living abroad.",

        "title": "Moodys downgrades Israels credit rating on war risks; outlook negative",
        "date": "February 10, 2024 09:51 am",
        "content": "Moodys downgraded Israels credit rating on Friday, citing material political and fiscal risks for the country from its war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The impact of the conflict raises political risk and weakens Israels executive and legislative institutions, and its fiscal strength for the foreseeable future, said Moodys, which had begun the review for a downgrade on Oct. 19. The countrys rating was cut to A2, which is five notches above investment grade, while its credit outlook was kept at negative by Moodys, meaning a further downgrade is possible. The war between Israel and Hamas, which has raged since Oct. 7, is the latest in a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled on for seven decades and destabilized the Middle East. While fighting in Gaza may diminish in intensity or pause, there is currently no agreement to end the hostilities durably and no agreement on a longer-term plan that would fully restore and eventually strengthen security for Israel, Moodys said in a statement on Friday. The agency expects Israels debt burden to be materially higher than projected before the conflict and defense spending to be nearly double the level of 2022 by the end of this year in its baseline scenario. Israel has carried out an air and land offensive on the Gaza coastal strip after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages. Gazas health ministry says at least 27,585 Palestinians have been confirmed killed, with thousands more feared buried under rubble. There has been one truce to date, lasting a week at the end of November. While there are currently negotiations underway to secure the release of the hostages against a temporary ceasefire and more humanitarian aid into Gaza, there is no clarity on the likelihood, time frame and durability of such an agreement, Moodys said. Israeli forces geared up on Friday for a ground assault on Hamas in the southern Gaza city of Rafah after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier rejected Hamas latest offer for a ceasefire and return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip. More than a million people driven southwards by Israeli bombing of Gaza are packed into Rafah and surrounding areas. U.S. President Joe Biden has called Israels response to the Hamas attacks over the top, and the United Nations has said Palestinian civilians in Rafah needed to be protected.

        "date": "February 10, 2024 11:50 am",
        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has written to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing concern about the rising number of attacks on fishermen from the state by unidentified persons. Stalin sought the Prime Minister to intervene and secure the release of fishermen arrested by Sri Lanka for allegedly trespassing in its waters. In a letter, Stalin said 88 Indian fishermen were arrested, and 12 boats were seized by Sri Lankan authorities in the past 28 days. I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the alarming increase in incidents of apprehension of Tamil fishermen and their boats by the Sri Lankan authorities. This issue severely impacts the right to livelihood of these fishermen as the communities have utilised these fishing waters for generations, he said. He said there has been a significant rise in the number of arrests of fishermen from Tamil Nadu by Sri Lankan authorities in the past few years, except for the period when the Covid-19 pandemic occurred. During 2023, the Sri Lankan navy arrested 243 fishermen and seized 37 boats. However, in the past 28 days, 88 fishermen and 12 boats were apprehended in six incidents. Furthermore, I want to draw your attention to the increasing instances of attacks on Tamil fishermen and damages inflicted on their boats and equipment in the seas by unidentified persons, as this has added a new layer of concern to an already precarious situation, Stalin said. The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister stated he had previously raised with PM Modi the issue of the amendment made to the Fisheries Act by Sri Lanka in 2018, which enabled the island nations government to nationalise foreign fishing vessels. Due to this action of Sri Lanka, the seized fishing boats of our fishermen that are in good condition cannot be salvaged and brought back to Tamil Nadu. Many fishermen have invested their life savings in acquiring and maintaining their boats, which are vital for their trade, Stalin wrote in the letter. The nationalisation of these boats without proper compensation or alternative arrangements pushes the fishermen and their families into financial distress, he said. Stalin, in his letter to PM Modi, urged the Sri Lankan government to withdraw the nationalisation of apprehended Indian fishing boats and to release them immediately. I request your urgent attention to address this issue to seek a diplomatic resolution to ensure the safety and well-being of Tamil fishermen, he said. Calling for a joint working group to resolve the issue, Stalin urged PM Modi to ensure the release of 77 fishermen and their 151 boats from Sri Lanka. Against this backdrop, fishermen of Ramanathapuram and Thangachimadom areas of Tamil Nadu will hold a protest by blocking roads against the regular attacks and arrests of Tamil Nadu fishers by Sri Lankan Navy, the Indian media reported. KM Antony, the leader of fishermen in Rameswaram told IANS news agency that the fishermen bring huge revenue to the country but their safety has always been in danger. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "February 10, 2024 01:21 pm",
        "content": "Adani Group is negotiating with Sri Lankan authorities to manage three airports in the island nation, including its premier international gateway, Bandarnaike International Airport in Colombo. Sri Lankas minister for tourism, land, sports, and youth affairs, Harin Fernando, said on Friday that modalities are being discussed between the two sides and could involve management contracts as well. Other airports being offered are Ratmalana Airport in Colombo and Mattala Airport, the latter earning the tag of the worlds emptiest international airport seven years ago. There are plans to work with Adani Group for the management of airports, Fernando told businessline on the sidelines of the OTM travel show in Mumbai. The plan to rope in a private partner to manage airports comes amid a resurgence in tourism. Foreign tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka doubled to 1.48 million in 2023 on a year-on-year basis. This, however, has put a strain on the countrys airport infrastructure. It is hoped that a private partner would help in expanding the facilities and improving the passenger experience. The Adani Group did not respond to an email query on the topic. First foray If the deal goes through, it could be Adani Groups first overseas aviation foray. In Sri Lanka, it is already present in ports and the renewable energy sector. Last November, the group secured 553 million funding from the US International Development Finance Corporation for its west container terminal project in Colombo. The US backing was widely viewed as a move to curb Chinese influence in the region. The Adani Group currently has a portfolio of eight airports (including the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport) in the country, serving 23 per cent of Indias passenger base. We are happy with tourism growth. In January, we received 208,000 tourists, and in the first seven days of February, we had 60,000 tourists. Our numbers are trending well, and forward bookings are looking great, Fernando said. India is the largest source market for the country, accounting for 37 per cent of all arrivals in CY 2023. The Sri Lankan government is also targeting wealthy Indians to park their yachts at their marinas as a part of its marine tourism policy. We are targeting 2.3 million tourists in 2024, and we are quite hopeful we will reach the target. By 2030, we hope to attract four million visitors. Thats why we have to go for massive development projects, he remarked. New investments Fernando said new investments are being made in the hospitality sector, and the government is also framing a homestay policy. While ITC is launching its maiden international hotel in Colombo, international brands such as IHG and Ritz Carlton are also developing properties in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan economy has bounced back. Our treasury was zero when we came to power. Now we have reserves of 4.4 billion. We are a beautiful country with so much potential. If we have five proper years of financial discipline, Sri Lanka will grow. Our government believes in public-private partnerships, and that is the way forward. Indians have done it very well, he added. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "date": "February 10, 2024 04:41 pm",
        "content": "Imprisoned former prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan was granted bail on Saturday by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in relation to 12 cases involving the attacks on military installations on May 9. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party founder Khan was granted bail by ATC Judge Malik Ejaz Asif after he paid a surety bond of Rs 0.1 million in all 12 cases, including the attack on the Army Museum and General Headquarters (Pakistan Army), according to The Express Tribune Pakistan. The court ruled that since all of the accused in the cases from May 9 were free on bond, there was no reason to keep Khan, 71, under arrest. Khan will stay behind bars since he is found guilty in numerous other cases. The courts order came a day after independents backed by Khans party won nearly 100 seats in the National Assembly. Former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also granted bail in 13 cases in the same case. Khan and PTI stalwart Qureshi were indicted in the cases on February 6. The two were produced before the court, where the former Prime Minister informed the judge that he was illegally arrested on May 9 from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises. Imran Khan was booked in multiple cases related to the May 9 violence that erupted following his arrest in an alleged corruption case. The cases registered in Rawalpindi included the attack on the gate of General Headquarters (GHQ), rioting in the office of a sensitive institution and others. Khan had denied the allegations mentioned in the cases first information reports (FIRs). Earlier, after his release from Adiala jail, Qureshi was whisked away by Punjab police from prison in connection with a case about the attack on the GHQ. Source: Firstpost -Agencies",

        "title": "Critical Atlantic Ocean current system showing early signs of collapse - report",
        "date": "February 10, 2024 05:10 pm",
        "content": "A crucial system of ocean currents may already be on course to collapse, according to a new report, with alarming implications for sea level rise and global weather  leading temperatures to plunge dramatically in some regions and rise in others. Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC)  of which the Gulf Stream is part  works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward. The currents carry heat and nutrients to different areas of the globe and play a vital role in keeping the climate of large parts of the Northern Hemisphere relatively mild. For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm on the circulations stability as climate change warms the ocean and melts ice, disrupting the balance of heat and salt that determines the currents strength. While many scientists believe the AMOC will slow under climate change, and could even grind to a halt, there remains huge uncertainty over when and how fast this could happen. The AMOC has only been monitored continuously since 2004. Scientists do know  from building a picture of the past using things like ice cores and ocean sediments  the AMOC shut down more than 12,000 years ago following rapid glacier melt. Now they are scrambling to work out if it could happen again. This new study provides an important breakthrough, said René van Westen, a marine and atmospheric researcher at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and study co-author. The scientists used a supercomputer to run complex climate models over a period of three months, simulating a gradual increase of freshwater to the AMOC  representing ice melt as well as rainfall and river runoff, which can dilute the oceans salinity and weaken the currents. As they slowly increased the freshwater in the model, they saw the AMOC gradually weaken until it abruptly collapsed. Its the first time a collapse has been detectable using these complex models, representing bad news for the climate system and humanity, the report says. What the study doesnt do, however, is give timeframes for a potential collapse. More research is needed, van Westen told CNN, including models which also mimic climate change impacts, such as increasing levels of planet-heating pollution, which this study did not. But we can at least say that we are heading in the direction of the tipping point under climate change, van Westen said. The impacts of the AMOCs collapse could be catastrophic. Some parts of Europe might see temperatures plunge by up to 30 degrees Celsius over a century, the study finds, leading to a completely different climate over the course of just a decade or two. No realistic adaptation measures can deal with such rapid temperature changes, the study authors write. Countries in the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, could see increased warming, while the Amazons wet and dry seasons could flip, causing serious disruption to the ecosystem. The AMOCs collapse could also cause sea levels to surge by around 1 meter (3.3 feet), van Westen said. Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer at Potsdam University in Germany, who was not involved with the study, said it was a major advance in AMOC stability science. It confirms that the AMOC has a tipping point beyond which it breaks down if the Northern Atlantic Ocean is diluted with freshwater, he told CNN. Previous studies finding the AMOCs tipping point used much simpler models, he said, giving hope to some scientists that it might not be found under more complex models. This study crushes those hopes, Rahmstorf said. Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said the study was the first to use complex climate models to show the AMOC can flip from on to off in response to relatively small amounts of freshwater entering the ocean. But there are reasons to be cautious, he added. Even though the study used a complex model, it still has a low resolution, he said, meaning there could be limitations in representing some parts of the currents. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the AMOC may be approaching a tipping point  and that it could even be close. A 2021 study found that the AMOC was weaker than any other time in the past 1,000 years. And a particularly alarming  and somewhat controversial  report published in July last year, concluded that the AMOC could be on course to collapse potentially as early as 2025. Yet huge uncertainties remain. Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, said he suspected the theory of a potentially imminent shutdown of the AMOC will remain somewhat controversial until, one year, we know that it is happening. He likened its potential collapse to the wild gyrations of a stock market that precede a major crash  its nearly impossible to unpick which changes are reversible, and which are a precursor to a disaster. Modern data shows the AMOCs strength fluctuates, but there is no observed evidence yet of a decline, Hirschi said. Whether abrupt changes in the AMOC similar to those seen in the past will occur as our climate continues to warm is an important open question. This study is a piece of that puzzle, Rahmstorf said. (It) adds significantly to the rising concern about an AMOC collapse in the not too distant future, he said. We will ignore this risk at our peril. Source - CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka will not allow anything harmful to Indias security - President Ranil",
        "date": "February 10, 2024 06:08 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing concerns about Chinas increased presence in the Indian Ocean region, said the island nation would not allow anything that would jeopardize Indias security. During an exclusive interview with Indian news channel WION, the Sri Lankan leader said, Weve kept Indian security in mind and we will not allow anything to happen that will be harmful to Indian security, and these are all hydrographical vessels. When asked about the Sri Lankan governments decision to not allow the visits of Chinese vessels, Wickremesinghe, who is in Australia for the 7th Indian Ocean Conference, explained that the administration decided to say no to ships from any country hydrographic matters as it is focusing on building its own hydrographical capacity. But if they are Navy ships that are coming in for visits, yes we will allow it, the President told WIONs diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal in Perth. Responding to a question on Chinas purported attempts to create a wedge between India and Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe allayed the doubts, saying, Chinese ships have been coming to Sri Lanka for over a period of time. China has never tried to create a rift between India and Sri Lanka they always say that we have to get along with India. There has never been an issue as far as we are concerned. He added that Sri Lanka is also encouraging the arrival of ships from other countries as well. Japan, India, Pakistan US, their ships have been coming. But weve asked many of the other European countries to come to Sri Lanka. With regard to debt restructuring, Wickremesinghe expressed hopes about concluding the negotiations by June 2024. He said after reaching formal agreements with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC), Sri Lanka will have to come to formal agreements with all other creditor nations as well as other financial organizations. Speaking on the economic support given by India amid Sri Lankas economic crisis, Wickremesinghe said he is thankful to India. Without that (Indias support) we could not have survived and this is why we are also looking at closer relations between the two countries. India provided support of almost USD 4 billion to the island nation during the economic crisis. The full transcript of the interview is attached below: WION: Sir my first question to you is how do you see India Sri Lanka relationship what is your vision about this relationship? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Actually the Indo-Lanka relationships are improving and today we are looking at close economic ties and improving connectivity between the two countries. I think thats the way to go. WION: But essentially, India was one country that came forward during the economic crisis with a bill of almost 4 billion. How do you see Indias support for your country? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Youre thankful to India without that we could not have survived and this is why we are also looking at closer relations between the two countries, especially trade and economic success the way we have to go. WION: Whats the current situation in your country, the economic situation, how have things improved in the past year? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, weve gone ahead with the debt restructuring we have completed it, its now the official part. We have to have an agreement with the OCC. In principle, theyve agreed to what we have done the formal part is now taking place and after the formal agreement with the official creditors committee will have to then come to formal agreements with all the countries creditor countries plus the other financial organizations, which have also been ignored in Sri Lanka debt negotiations. WION: And when will it be possible, sir? Ranil Wickremesinghe: I think by about June or should be over hopefully. WION: Sir, coming to regional security, India has to worry over the visits of the Chinese vessels and I believe some decisions have been taken by the Sri Lankan government to not allow the visit of Chinese vessels if you can just talk about the visits and if any decision has been made like this. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Now what what we have told India always is that weve kept Indian security in mind and we will not allow anything to happen that will be harmful to Indian security, and these are all hydrographical vessels. So weve allowed them to come there. Have other vessels from other countries to have been allowed? We decided that this year, we will look at capacity building for Sri Lanka and therefore now we are focusing on Sri Lanka building its own hydrological capacity by cooperating with the others. As a result, we have said no ships from any country on hydrological matters can come to Sri Lanka but if they are Navy ships that are coming in for visits, yes we will allow it. WION: You will know about the visits of Chinese navy ships. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Anyway, theyve been coming to Sri Lanka. Indian ships come Chinese ships come Japanese ships come. All ships come to Sri Lanka American ships come. WION: But do think that China is trying to create a wedge between India and Sri Lanka somehow because India is worried about the visits and India is worried about the increased Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region? And that is something that many countries share as well. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Chinese ships have been coming to Sri Lanka over a period of time. And China has never tried to create a rift between India and Sri Lanka they always say that we have to get along with India. There has never been an issue as far as we are concerned. The number of ships that have been coming has not increased, nor have they decreased. But we are also encouraging ships from other countries to come in, which are not been there earlier. Japan, India, Pakistan us Yes, their ships have been coming. But weve asked many of the other European countries to come to Sri Lanka. WION: And the role played by the Chinese when its come to the debt restructuring have been dragging their feet. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well there was a greed to the debt restructuring. They are not in the official creditors committee do it and I think they attend the meetings but theyve also agreed their structure for this is different from the other countries. We have to deal with the China Development Bank of China, mainly and also with the import export ban. Those are the two that we have to deal with. most of the countries weve been dealing with the government agencies. WION: Coming back to the India-Sri Lanka relationship you started by pointing out to connectivity there are several aspects to connectivity. One is that land connectivity, one of the decisions that was taken was to connect the two countries through a land bridge What is the vision behind it has any step been taken by the Sri Lankan government? Ranil Wickremesinghe: There are two connectivities we are looking at firstly is the power connectivity. And thats going on because there be I think, Indian companies investing in Sri Lanka, already Adani is out there. We are discussing the power connectivity and we come to agreement that it should be an undersea cable. And now we will start working out the details. Similarly, as far as land connectivity is concerned, weve got to get a feasibility study for us. So we were appointed officials on both sides for coordination and they like to arraign the feasibility study first and the environment to study. WION: Connectivity has another aspect that is financial connectivity. UPI is something that has been talked about.... Ranil Wickremesinghe: That has been going ahead. WION: Anyway plans when it will be implemented. Ranil Wickremesinghe: It should be soon, but wed be discussing it in Colombia in the next two weeks. WION: And part of financial connectivity is the usage of Indian rupee. This is part of the conversation. Will we see the usage of Indian rupee... Ranil Wickremesinghe: We want to see the usage of Indian rupees in Sri Lanka. Have no issue at all on WION: Has the trading started? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Not yet. It will help tourism especially WION: How have the Indian tourists helped Sri Lankan economy? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Tourism helps our economy a lot and Indian tourists coming in have been good. WION: Part of the India-Sri Lanka relationship is the trade, trade in local currency as you talked about the part of that is the free trade agreement. Have there been conversations regarding FTA? Ranil Wickremesinghe: The FTA is operational. Now we are discussing how to advance the FTA certainly to a comprehensive economic and technology partnership WION: And what do we expect from India in terms of your development goals? Anything specific? Ranil Wickremesinghe: India has helped us financially but wed like to see especially wed like to see Indian investments in Sri Lanka and a new phase has been the decision that IIT Madras will establish a campus in Sri Lanka most probably in Kandy. WION: And when this establishment come up? Ranil Wickremesinghe: A ministerial delegation visited India, and now we are in the process of identifying the locations. But wed like to take some existing buildings and start that off so next year. WION: Thats a significant educational connect, but there are other issues as well. Some irritants I will leave in the relationship as a fisherman issue. India has been raising it in the past any sort of reaching out between the two sides so that this there is a resolution on this issue? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well its we who are today. It because the Tamil Nadu fisherman are coming into our area, it is a big issue with our fishermen and with discussing it. We want to conclude it sometime this year because we cant have them coming in all the time. WION: Moving forward when it comes to the region. Going to Maldives, where you were present when those taking ceremony took place. How do you see the current government in Maldives which has been not very pro India in many senses they have been running the anti India movement as well. Whats your view about the current dispensation in Maldives Ranil Wickremesinghe: It is a new government thats settling down and not any of the establishment politicians from outside. So we have to give them some time to come to grips and especially at the moment there is a struggle between the President and the parliament also. So we are watching what happens there. WION: So we are here in birth with the Indian Ocean conference is taking place Sri Lanka is an important country in the Indian Ocean you have a vast exclusive economic zone as well. How can Sri Lanka an important role in the stability of the wider region? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, weve always been pushing freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, that this should be free of big power, rivalry, and close cooperation between the countries now that Sri Lanka is Chairman thats what weve been asking for. WION: And whats your view about the situation in the Red Sea because it impacts the economic security of many countries including Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe: Red Sea is vital to us Suez Canal is vital to us. Colombo port will develop only Suez Canal is available in the 1967 War. Some other ships sunk in the Suez Canal it took us 10 years and the Colombo port are not operative. So we are as far as Gaza is concerned. We want the wall to come to an end cost radius to be released. We are in fact asking for Palestine stating five years but also guarantees for the security of Israel that is separate from whats happening in the Red Sea. We call the Red Sea The attacks are by Houthis. And we recognize the Government of Yemen so this should not take place and therefore we are cooperating with the other countries we ensure is kept safe. WION: So coming back to the tourism aspect which plays an important role. This plan of a Ramayana circuit that connects India and Sri Lanka. Whats the progress like on that? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, its basically the tourist companies and others who are doing it, but we told them that will also help we are planning out Morelia. So we develop it we are also looking at Hindu trail Lord Shiva because there are a lot of Shiva temples there. There are the four Eswarra temples and Dikshina Kailash Trincomalee. So we feel there can be a second one also. WION: we saw the inauguration of the Ram temple in India of whats your view and any plans of a high level delegation visiting Ayodhya Ram temple, including from your government. Ranil Wickremesinghe: I think some of our people went across for the function when we expected the Ram temple to be built once the Supreme Court case was over. It was a matter of when it was going to be done. And Prime Minister Modi and the government has done it. Yes. WION: So another aspect is Canada. We have seen the India Tamanna Rao weve also seen comments by the Canadian government one situation in Sri Lanka, whats your view about this Canadian government making these remarks? Ranil Wickremesinghe: We have said we dont want work getting politics in the way and we are not interested in dealing with it. So our contracts with Canada at the moment are minimal. WION: So when you made the speech here in Bertha, you mentioned about the US role and your comments were very sharp. You pointed out that the ill advised decisions by the Americans in the region. So the role What do you think is being played by the US in the region? If you can characterize it? Ranil Wickremesinghe: No, I call it ill advise because backing the Gaza war in the bombing. No, I mean, everyone would expect us to stand with Israel when Israel is attacked. I dont think theres an issue on this. But this is such that remember, we have a major Islamic art in the Indian Ocean, many of them friendly with the US government other than Iran, but this is going to put pressure on them. The public opinion for some time will not I mean basically if the pressure is on for three, four years that will make a vast difference. Russia has come in now Russia is a key player in the western Indian Ocean. So its a setback for US. WION: And how do you see Russian role in the region? In Russia? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Yeah, improving its economic role and its making political contact with all countries. And even militarily, theyre having naval exercises. So in a way, they have not the Western or broken Russia, they want to push them on to the western Indian Ocean. WION: So moving to a multilateral dimension UNSC reforms is something that is much talked about, whats your view, and whats your take on India being at the high table? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Now we feel that there has to be reforms must be done. India also should be in the Security Council. But we want overall discussion where we, the smaller countries also have a say. But I cant see that discussion taking place at the moment. WION: And do you think that its going to take some time because there are elements who are trying to stop or delay the process? Ranil Wickremesinghe: It will take time. WION: G 20- we saw India hosting the summit last year, and the African Union became a permanent member of the G 20 under Indian presidency, how do you see India engaging with Africa and your perspective as to how do you plan to engage with Africa as well? Ranil Wickremesinghe: India has been engaging with Africa for a long time even before I mean, basically, many Indian trading families are there in Africa, you got a natural East Africa, in Mauritius so I even in South Africa when Mr. Mahatma Gandhi was there. So thats something as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. Now we are reaching out to East Africa, South Africa. We are reaching out first to the countries on the Indian Ocean coast but we are also looking at West Africa. We have to develop those relations. WION: Your view about the Indo Pacific This is a vision which is backed by several countries in the region. Ranil Wickremesinghe: We are more focused on the Indian Ocean so the ASEAN outlook is what we like because we we are basically Indian Ocean country and links with the Pacific has been more with the Asian nations, which has been also ties going through land up to China. Weve had ties in the old days now its extended to Japan and Korea. We dont go beyond that. WION: About the QUAD. Whats your view about the QUAD the QUAD countries coming together and working on several aspects including of course humanitarian situation in the region. Ranil Wickremesinghe: When the QUAD is 111 agency there, but how they are going to work it to cooperate is any is for them. The question is that when the Indo Pacific was made, no one knew where the boundaries were. Some wanted is on the western Indian Ocean and when went further, finally, I think Mr. Modi said it should go Prime Minister said he should go from Africa to the shores of the American continent and then you Indonesia the ASEAN came without look, but within each avoid, so, we are looking at the Indian Ocean and India. We feel Indian Ocean countries that either through the IORA or something else has to get together because our outlooks are quite different from that to the Pacific. WION: And moving forward to the domestic aspects of your country. Elections happening this year. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Yes, both presidential and parliamentary. WION: And, how optimistic you are that hopefully you will back Ranil Wickremesinghe: For me to be back I must contest WION: And you do you plan to sir? Ranil Wickremesinghe: I mean, whats your plan like my I have come here to put the economy toward my first duty is to focus on that we get out of bankruptcy. WION: And do you think youve done a good job? I mean, whats your view about the economy in terms of your tenure because you ultimately were the face of of the crisis in terms of emergence of Sri Lanka back to normalcy? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, Im quite satisfied I feel we will be able to do this. WION: You will be able to do this. Another thing is the implementation of the 13th Amendment something that comes India has also been talking about the whats the way forward Ranil Wickremesinghe: hold the provincial council election next year. As I announced in the my speech, when I opened parliament, we want to give each province its own economy. So like in India, that economies will compete with each other which is to benefit or to be very, very competitive economies. And those provinces should handle their economic and social development within the national policy framework. In this respect, we said we are prepared to give the concurrent powers most of it or what whatever is required whatever they want to the provincial councils, so that we are moving on. There has been a request by some of the groups for minority groups our Senate. So as far as Im concerned, we have far as we are concerned, we will not oppose it, but its a matter for all parties to agree to not not merely the government and there are so many parties in Parliament at the moment. WION: So in the regional aspect there are several groupings. One is the BIMSTEC grouping. In fact, the summit is planned this year. Whats your vision when it comes to this specific grouping? Ranil Wickremesinghe: We have to fast track the integration. Thats my view. We are a bit slow on it. But weve been talking prime ministers and Prime Minister Modi I spoke with the Prime Minister ties and also on the day of being God as to the crews soon but we have to basically fast track it as I said earlier, WION: And do you think the SARK of the grouping is dead? Ranil Wickremesinghe: Shark at the moment? No. We have not buried it or anything. Neither are they in they... we havent put it into the funeral parlor but certainly the political side is not active. But I must say some of the other areas like culture and all are going on maybe we should focus on the non political issues there. WION: So time is running out and you have a flight to catch as well. My last question for you is Sri Lanka as a country, but the future in terms of domestically and regionally the role it can play in terms of providing stability to this region, which has several challenges and the big power they will be as well. Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, we want to keep the big power rivalry out to the Indian Ocean doesnt mean that they should stay out there while the US is in deogarh Shia, Japan, China will have both to operate, but there should not be a rivalry which will fail in any way beer have an adverse impact on the Indian Ocean. WION: How do you see the BRICS grouping? Ranil Wickremesinghe: BRICS group is expanding . Especially with Saudi, Iran, you have the African countries and one more from Latin America and thats s good thing. I know large group has applied but its better to expand slowly. It shows the global South also is trying to get some monetary Union together. WION: And, SCO? The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation? Ranil Wickremesinghe: The Shanghai Cooperation come along because basically, you can see central Asia opening up and Shanghai Cooperation Council is going to be important. You all will be having Mumbai, Iran, Moscow line, it should be good to get into that part of Europe, instead of using the Canal route. WION: Thank you...",

        "date": "February 10, 2024 10:33 pm",
        "content": "Israeli air strikes killed 17 people in Gazas Rafah overnight, medics said on Saturday, as over a million Palestinians cramming into the border city await a full-blown offensive with the rest of their enclave in ruins and nowhere left to run. Four months into the war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said it has ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate the population of Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there. Unlike in previous Israeli assaults on cities during the war, when the military ordered civilians to flee south, no other relatively unscathed area remains in tiny Gaza and aid agencies have warned that large numbers of civilians could die. Any Israeli incursion in Rafah means massacres, means destruction. People are filling every inch of the city and we have nowhere to go, said Rezik Salah, 35, who fled his Gaza City home with his wife and two children for Rafah early in the war. The conflict in Gaza began on Oct. 7 when Hamas gunmen stormed border defences to attack Israeli towns, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragging around 250 hostages back to Gaza according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with a massive bombardment and ground offensive in which about 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza. The conflict has threatened to spread across the Middle East, with Israel and Lebanons Hezbollah regularly trading fire, and flare-ups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. On Saturday, an Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted a Palestinian figure close to Hamas, security sources said. The target survived but three others were killed. Much of Gaza has meanwhile been reduced to rubble, with Israeli forces destroying swathes of towns with air strikes, artillery fire and controlled detonations, leaving more than 85 of Gazas 2.3 million inhabitants homeless. Most of the displaced have sought shelter in Rafah, in the far south on the border with Egypt, but after ceasefire talks failed, Netanyahu this week said Israeli forces would fight on until total victory, including in Rafah. On Friday night an air strike on one Rafah house killed 11 people and wounded dozens more, while a second strike killed six people in another house, medical officials said. In the other main southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where many displaced people initially fled before an Israeli offensive there last month, the Palestinian Health Ministry voiced alarm at Israeli operations around the main Nasser Hospital. The ministry said Israeli forces had surrounded the hospital and were shooting in the vicinity, and it was concerned about the fate of 300 medical staff, 450 patients and 10,000 people sheltering there. Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed tanks at the hospital gates. Israels military said in an update on fighting on Saturday that its forces were continuing intensive activities in Khan Younis as well as northern and central Gaza, killing militants, seizing weapons and striking infrastructure. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the situation at Nasser hospital. FEARS OF MASS DISPLACEMENT In Gaza City, the first major population centre that Israels operation targeted after ground forces invaded in late October, residents reported fierce fighting on Saturday. An Israeli official who declined to be named said that Israel would try to organise for people in Rafah to be moved back northwards ahead of any assault. Egypt has said it will not allow any mass displacement of Palestinians into its territory. Palestinians fear that Israel means to drive them from their homeland then forbid their return. There is limited space and great risk in putting Rafah under further military escalation due to the growing number of Palestinians there, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Saturday, warning that an escalation would have dire consequences. The continued warfare in Gaza City, long after Israel said it was redeploying some troops to other areas, shows the limitations of any proposal to evacuate displaced people from Rafah to other parts of the enclave. Palestinian rescue workers in Gaza City said they had found the bodies of a 6-year-old girl and her family members, along with the ambulance team sent to rescue them, days after an audio clip of her call to dispatchers begging for help was released. Meanwhile doctors and aid workers are struggling to supply even basic aid to Palestinians sheltering around Rafah. Many are trapped against a border fence with Egypt and living in makeshift tents. The United Nations said Palestinian civilians in Rafah, opens new tab require protection, but there should be no forced mass displacement, which is barred by international law. Netanyahus office said Israel cannot achieve its goal of eliminating Hamas while it retains units in Rafah. The Palestinian Presidency said Netanyahus plans aimed to displace the Palestinian people from their land. Taking this step threatens security and peace in the region and the world. It crosses all red lines, said the office of Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority that exerts partial self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "Hungarian President resigns over child sexual abuse pardon",
        "date": "February 11, 2024 08:42 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Hungarian President Katalin Novak resigned on Saturday after coming under mounting pressure for pardoning a man convicted of helping to cover up sexual abuse in a childrens home. Novak, a close ally of conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, resigned a week after her presidential pardon was first reported by local news site 444.hu. The revelation caused a public uproar and demands from the opposition for her and former Justice Minister Judit Varga to quit. Varga, who has been a rising star in Orbans ruling Fidesz party, resigned as a lawmaker on Saturday. The scandal was a rare setback for Orban, who has been in power since 2010, and who faces European parliament elections just as the country emerges from an inflation crisis. Orban has for years campaigned to protect children from what he has described as LGBTQ activists roaming the nations schools. This has been one of several issues over which Orban has clashed with the European Commission. I made a mistake ... Today is the last day that I address you as a president, Novak, whose role as president is largely ceremonial, said as she announced her resignation on state television. She cut short an official visit to Qatar and returned to Budapest unexpectedly on Saturday. I made a decision to grant a pardon last April believing that the convict did not abuse the vulnerability of children whom he had overseen. I made a mistake as the pardon and the lack of reasoning was suitable to trigger doubts over the zero tolerance that applies to paedophilia, she said. This week, Hungarian opposition parties had demanded Novaks resignation over the case and on Friday a thousand demonstrators rallied at Novaks office calling for her to quit. In a bid to contain the political damage, Orban personally submitted a constitutional amendment to parliament late on Thursday depriving the president of the right to pardon crimes committed against children. Some political analysts had interpreted that move as a clear message to Novak. On Saturday, Judit Varga - who was expected to lead Fideszs list for the elections, and who also signed off on the pardon - said on Facebook she would step down as a Fidesz MP, taking responsibility for her decision. I resign from public life, I resign my mandate as a lawmaker and also the top position on the European party list, Varga said. The head of Fideszs parliamentary group, Mate Kocsis, said Novak and Varga made responsible decisions which the party would respect. Fidesz leads opinion polls ahead of the June elections but about a third of voters are undecided. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 11, 2024 11:05 am",
        "content": "A child genius who attended university aged just 12 years old has now the youngest person in Britain to hold a PhD. Yasha Asley received his doctorate in applied mathematics at the University of Leicester earlier this month, aged 21. It is believed he is now the youngest person in Britain to hold a PhD, surpassing a 22-year-old astrophysicist. Yasha, from Leicester, started attending his local university before he was even a teenager - accompanied by dad Moussa Asley, 61, who quit his job as an accountant to support his son. Yasha - once dubbed the human calculator is keeping an open mind about what the future holds, saying: Im looking to maybe work in AI field or data mining, but I really dont know yet. On receiving the PhD he said: It feels amazing to have achieved this feat. I am very happy and would like to thank all my lecturers for their help. It was not my intention to go to uni so early but now that I have reached this stage I am elated that it worked out well for me. Moussa says he is not surprised by his sons latest feat but said: To be frank  I was expecting him to finish two or three years ago! Were it not for Covid I think he would have finished much earlier but I am over the moon. Yasha took both his GCSEs and A-Levels aged nine, and is fluent in French and Persian. It was then decided it was time for university - but it wasnt all plain sailing. Moussa, who came to Britain from Iran in 1979, said: I approached the uni and asked them to waive student fees, as I couldnt afford to just pay the fees upfront, I even approached my local MP. In the end, after months of back and forth, Moussa said Student Finance gave in and offered Yasha the student loan without the national insurance number. Yasha went on to achieve a first-class honours degree - aged just 15. And at the age of 13 he was offered a paid job by the university to run tutorials - beating adult applicants.The weekly sessions involved helping adult students who had trouble solving problems from lectures. Dad Moussa said: From his earliest days he was exceptional  everybody noticed he was exceptional His primary school teacher realised early on that he couldnt meet his educational needs  so he was getting university standard lectures twice a week while attending school three days a week. Moussa added: I am grateful for what this country has done for me. I always did OK academically but was nowhere near as good as my son. It was a lot to get him through university as a single parent, big sacrifices had to be made but it has all been worth it. Yasha says he is very thankful for his dad helping him along the way. I feel honoured and privileged - I am blessed with a caring dad who sacrificed his time in order to support and be with me for so many years and I will always be grateful for the opportunities he created for me. Prof Jeremy Levesley, who taught Yasha at Leicester University, said: It has been a great pleasure to work with him. He has proved to be one of the best students we have ever had here. He is a great bloke and will go on to do really interesting things. It isnt all academics for Yasha though - he is also an avid gardener and Leicester City fan. It is thought he is the current youngest PhD holder in Britain - but not the youngest to achieve the feat. Fahma Mohamed was awarded a doctorate for her campaigning work on female genital mutilation in 2016 aged 19. Imran Nasim completed a PhD in astrophysics last year, aged 22.

        "title": "Presidents Fund to support liver transplant and cochlear implant surgeries for children",
        "date": "February 11, 2024 04:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed financial assistance from the Presidents Fund for liver transplant surgeries for young children at the Ragama Teaching Hospital and cochlear implant surgeries at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital. According to the Presidents Media Division (PMD), this decision aims to alleviate the financial burden on impoverished parents and support the welfare of children, recognizing their importance for the nations future. Acknowledging the substantial costs associated with pre and post-tests and treatments for liver transplant surgeries in children under 16 years old at the North Colombo General Hospital (Ragama Teaching Hospital), President Wickremesinghe has approved Rs. 1 million from the Presidents Fund for each liver transplant surgery meeting common conditions. This financial support will be effective from January 1, 2024, aiming to ease the financial strain on families undergoing these critical medical procedures, the PMD stated. President Wickremesinghes directive underscores the governments commitment to providing essential medical care for children in need, particularly those facing life-threatening conditions requiring specialized surgeries. By utilizing the Presidents Fund to support these surgeries, the government aims to ensure that financial constraints do not hinder access to vital healthcare services for young patients, thereby safeguarding their health and future well-being. Medical tests have revealed that over 200 children in Sri Lanka require cochlear implant surgery, a procedure crucial for their auditory development. While in developed countries, such surgeries are promptly performed at birth upon identification of the need, in Sri Lanka, not all eligible children undergo this procedure. Its emphasized by medical experts that such operations should ideally occur within two years from birth for optimal brain development, yet the cost is a significant barrier, estimated at over Rs 5 million. Currently, this surgery is limited to a few government hospitals, leading to waiting lists for affected children. The cochlear implant surgery is conducted at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital, with the implant device valued at approximately Rs. 3-4 million. Although the Ministry of Health provides the device to the hospital free of charge, patients are required to cover the surgery costs, which amount to Rs. 600,000. This financial burden underscores the need for additional support mechanisms to ensure access to essential healthcare services for children in need of cochlear implant surgery. To address this issue, the Ministry of Health has sourced the necessary cochlear implant devices, while the surgery costs, amounting to Rs. 600,000, will be covered by the Presidents Fund. Consequently, the government will fully shoulder the expenses associated with these surgeries, which are conducted at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital. The decision to forgo cochlear implant surgeries for these children not only impacts society negatively but also strains the healthcare system. Despite the considerable financial investment required for such procedures, it must be recognized that providing financial aid from the Presidents Fund for these surgeries on young children is an investment in the nations future. Consequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has authorized financial assistance from the Presidents Fund, effective January 1, 2024, with a maximum amount of Rs. 600,000 for cochlear transplant surgeries conducted on children at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital.",

        "title": "Pakistan election: Final results give Khan-backed candidates lead",
        "date": "February 11, 2024 09:41 pm",
        "content": "The final results in Pakistans general election have put independent candidates backed by jailed ex-PM Imran Khans PTI party in the lead. Independents won 101 of the National Assembly seats. BBC analysis shows 93 of them went to PTI-backed candidates. That puts them ahead of ex-PM Nawaz Sharifs PMLN who won 75 and it is unclear who will form a government. As wrangling continues, independent candidates who did not win have flooded courts with vote-rigging allegations. Both the PTI, which was blocked from taking part in the election, and Mr Sharifs PMLN say they want to form the next government. The result was a surprise as most observers had expected Mr Sharifs party - widely seen as having the powerful militarys backing - to win, given Mr Khan had been jailed on charges ranging from corruption to having married illegally and his party was barred from the ballot sheet. To govern, a candidate has to show they are at the head of a coalition with a simple majority of 169 seats in the National Assembly. Bilawal Bhutto from the PPP, which received the third largest number of votes, has said that they have not had any formal discussions with Imran Khans PTI or Nawaz Sharifs PMLN. But the PMLN have said that Mr Bhuttos father did meet for an informal meeting with Mr Sharifs brother in Lahore. The Karachi-based MQM party has also made a surprising return in the polls, winning 17 seats, and could play a role in any coalition. Of the National Assemblys 366 seats, 266 are decided by direct voting and 70 are reserved - 60 for women and 10 for non-Muslims - and these are allocated according to the strength of each party in the assembly. Under Pakistans rules, independent candidates are not eligible to be allocated reserved seats in parliament. The PTI, among several other parties, has called for protests against the results, alleging they have been rigged. On Sunday, police blocked streets near the electoral commission building in the city of Rawalpindi with barbed wire and large trucks, preventing any protestors from accessing it. For about 90 minutes, a crowd of a few hundred protestors chanted on the street. Then the atmosphere turned. Police used several rounds of teargas to disperse the crowd, which then left the area. The Punjab police told the BBC that there was a section 144 in place - a colonial-era law that stopped a gathering of more than four people. This restriction had been put in place before the election until 12 February, but it detailed that civilians were not allowed to carry firearms, not that they were prevented from gathering. Police in Islamabad said action would be taken against demonstrators. The PTIs chairman had called for peaceful protests outside electoral commission offices where they were concerned about forged results. Pakistani media reported that the PTI party claimed that the results of at least 18 National Assembly seats were falsely changed by election officers. On Saturday, Mr Sharif - who is thought to be favoured by the military - called for other parties to help him form a unity government. As negotiations got under way between Mr Khans political rivals, experts have warned Pakistan could be facing a prolonged period of political instability. Dr Farzana Shaikh from the Chatham House think tank told the BBC that the Khan-linked independents were unlikely to be allowed to form a government and many people feared a weak and unstable coalition would result from any tie-up between Mr Sharif and the PPP. Meanwhile, at least six PTI-backed candidates who did not win their seats have lodged legal challenges in the courts to try to get the outcome overturned. Among them is Yasmin Rashid, who stood against Mr Sharif in Lahore. The petitioners allege collusion in the alteration of election results on specific forms. Pakistani officials have denied any irregularities. The PMLN has also reportedly formed a legal team to address rigging allegations. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "February 12, 2024 07:49 am",
        "content": "The third offshore campus of the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is likely to be set up in Sri Lanka, according to sources. The proposal for an IIT in Sri Lanka was announced last November in the 2024 Budget unveiled by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the finance minister. According to sources, the Sri Lankan government is in touch with IIT Madras for the ambitious project. A high-level delegation had recently visited the Chennai campus to discuss the future roadmap. The talks are on and the campus is likely to come up in Kandy, a source said. The delegation also visited the Research Park at the campus and interacted with officials about possible areas of engagement, the source added. The Indian government had announced that opportunities for admission to the IITs in India will be provided to meritorious Sri Lankan students from the 2017-18 academic sessions onwards. Talks with Sri Lankan authorities are in preliminary stages for IIT Madras to set up a campus in that country. A delegation from Sri Lanka visited our campus and soon a delegation from IIT Madras will visit Sri Lanka for a feasibility study, a spokesperson of IIT Madras said. If the plan for the Sri Lanka campus comes through, it will be IIT Madras second international campus. The institute had last year announced the setting up of an offshore campus in Tanzanias Zanzibar with Preeti Aghalyam being appointed the director-in-charge, who also became the first woman IIT Director. An MoU, signed last July between India and Tanzania, was the final procedural step that paved the way for the opening of the campus. The institute began functioning in November last year from a temporary campus and is offering two full-time academic programmes -- a four-year Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and a two-year Master of Technology in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. IIT Delhi followed the league and signed a formal agreement with the UAE government to set up a campus in Abu Dhabi. The initial Masters course at the IIT Delhi-Abu Dhabi campus will focus on energy transition and sustainability, reflecting a shared vision between India and the UAE to leverage knowledge for mutual prosperity and global well-being. The UK is also keen on welcoming an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) to set up an offshore campus in the country and some UK universities are already in talks with IITs to explore the possibility. Several IITs have been receiving requests from the Middle East and South Asian countries to set up their campuses. The central government had created a 17-member committee to facilitate the process of opening IIT campuses in foreign locations where students from different nations can study technical education. The committee headed by IIT Council standing committee chairperson Dr K Radhakrishnan had submitted its recommendations in 2022. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "February 12, 2024 11:31 am",
        "content": "President Joe Biden is hosting Jordans King Abdullah II in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over a possible Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah. It is the first meeting between the allies since three American troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are working to broker another pause in Israels war against Hamas in order to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over the administrations continued support for Israel in the face of growing casualties in Gaza. It appeared a deal for another pause in the fighting was getting close. A senior U.S. administration official said Sunday that after weeks of shuttle diplomacy and phone conversations, a framework was essentially in place for a deal that could see the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for a halt to fighting. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, acknowledged that gaps remained but declined to specify what they are. The official said Israeli military pressure on Hamas in Khan Younis over the last several weeks has helped bring the militant group closer to accepting an agreement. The potential for an agreement took up the majority of Bidens call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The official said the two leaders also had a significant back and forth about the potential expansion of Israeli military operations into Rafah and that Biden reiterated U.S. opposition to the idea under the current conditions while more than 1.3 million people are sheltering there. It was the most forceful language yet from the president on the possible operation. Biden, who last week called Israels military response in Gaza over the top, also sought urgent and specific steps to strengthen humanitarian aid. Israels Channel 13 television said the conversation lasted 45 minutes. The official said the Israelis made clear they would not contemplate an operation in Rafah without safeguarding the civilian population. The official said the U.S. is not sure there is a feasible or implementable plan to relocate civilians out of Rafah to allow military operations to take place. Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israels actions and have eschewed public support for long-term planning over what happens next, arguing that the fighting must end before such discussions can begin. They have been demanding a cease-fire since mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket. Biden had planned to visit Jordan during his trip to Israel in October shortly after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, but the trip was scrapped. On his way home from Israel, Biden announced hed helped broker the first deal to pause fighting temporarily and to open the crossing in Rafah to humanitarian aid. In the months since, members of his administration have made repeated trips to the region to engage with leaders there. Source  AP News - Agencies",

        "content": "Businesses can easily obtain QR codes by contacting their respective financial institutions and reaching a trade agreement, while all banks and financial institutions registered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) are mandated to issue these codes, says CBSLs Director of Payments and Settlements. He stated this during press conference was held this afternoon (12) at the Presidents Media Center to announce a significant development aimed at making payments easier for Indian tourists in Sri Lanka. The conference followed the virtual launch introducing Indias UPI transactions, highlighting their groundbreaking impact in connecting Sri Lanka and India. Jointly implemented by NPCI International Payments Limited and Sri Lankas LankaPay, the program seeks to rapidly expand this payment system across 10,000 stores simultaneously. By March 2024, there are plans to further extend this facility to encompass a staggering 65,000 stores nationwide. During the conference, Mr. Wasantha Alwis, Director (Payments and Settlements) of the Central Bank, elucidated that businesses can easily obtain QR codes by contacting their respective financial institutions and reaching a trade agreement. He emphasized that all banks and financial institutions registered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka are mandated to issue these codes. The move is expected to open up avenues for small and medium businesses in Sri Lanka, as many Indian tourists are already familiar with QR code payments. Transactions made through this system will be credited to relevant accounts in Sri Lankan Rupees and recipients will receive immediate notification via text message. Furthermore, small and medium-sized businessmen stand to benefit as they will become eligible for bank loans after a period of six months, owing to the income generated through these transactions. Looking ahead, the initiative aims to expand the system further, enabling Sri Lankans to make payments through QR codes in India. LankaPay Chairman Dr. Kenneth De Silva, LankaPay CEO Channa De Silva, Nations Trust Bank Senior Vice Chairman (Digital Banking) and Representative of LANKAQR Implementation Committee Randil Botheju, and LOLC Chairman and Fintech representative Conrad Dias were also attend at the press briefing.

        "content": "(Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is now very confident the global economy will see a soft landing, its managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday, adding that interest rates would start coming down around mid year. We are very confident that the world economy is now poised for this soft landing we have been dreaming for, after some of the sharpest interest rate hikes in decades, Georgieva said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. On the prospect of interest rates being cut in leading economies like the United States, she added: I expect to see by mid year interest rates going in the direction inflation has been going on for the last year. She cautioned to expect the unexpected in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and said a prolonged war between Israel and Hamas would impact global economies. I fear most a longevity of the conflict because (if) it goes on and on the risk of spillovers go up, the IMF chief said. Right now we see a risk of spillover from the Suez Canal, she said referring to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea. But if there are other unintended consequences in terms of where the fighting goes, then it can become much more problematic for the world as a whole. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 13, 2024 09:58 am",
        "content": "Minister of Highways, Transport, and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena says if anyone has any alternative suggestions beyond the program initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, he is ready to explore such alternative avenues for Sri Lankas economic development. He emphasized the need for informed dialogue across various media platforms during a press conference convened at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Addressing concerns over misinformation regarding public financial management, the minister stressed the inadequacy of mere rhetoric in addressing Sri Lankas economic challenges. Highlighting fiscal figures, Gunawardena noted a state revenue of Rs. 3,201 billion in 2023, juxtaposed with expenditures of Rs. 4,394 billion on subsidies, salaries, and public debt. Minister Bandula Gunawardena further said; In his Throne speech, the President affirmed that Sri Lankas economic woes cannot be resolved through political means. The public is well aware of the economic crisis experienced in 2022. Presently, thanks to President Ranil Wickremesinghes initiatives, the countrys economy has made significant strides forward. Reviewing the previous year, total tax revenue amounted to Rs. 3201 billion, sourced from various departments including the Inland Income Tax Department, Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department, and Motor Vehicle Department. However, the Treasurys expenditure surpassed this, reaching Rs. 4,394 billion. Funds from subsidies, government loans, and salaries were amassed for this purpose, alongside Rs. 13,292 billion allocated for infrastructure development. The effectiveness of President Wickremesinghes economic program is evidenced by consistent fuel provision, eradication of gas queues, cessation of electricity shortages, and timely payment of government employees salaries. Irrespective of the origin or affiliation of those disseminating false narratives to gain power, it is imperative that these groups articulate their strategies for steering the country out of its economic turmoil. Will they target subsidy reductions, tackle public debt, or reevaluate government payroll allocations? Clarity on these fronts is essential for public transparency. Groups like the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna exhibit limited understanding of public financial management and economic stability. Their track record, notably in the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha, reflects managerial shortcomings, prompting a shift in power dynamics. In 2003, then-Prime Minister Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed legislation aimed at averting future economic crises in Sri Lanka. The bill proposed measures such as maintaining a budget deficit of 5 of the gross domestic product and capping public debt at 60. However, subsequent administrations failed to enforce these regulations, resulting in the 2022 economic crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe successfully navigated the country out of this crisis and initiated measures to propel it forward.",

        "date": "February 13, 2024 10:13 am",
        "content": "More than a fifth of the worlds migrating species are at risk of going extinct as a result of climate change and human encroachment, according to the United Nations first-ever report on migrating animals published on Monday. Billions of animals make journeys across deserts, plains or oceans every year to breed and feed, and unsustainable pressures put on migratory species could not only see their populations dwindle, but also disrupt food supplies and threaten livelihoods, the report said. Of the 1,189 species covered by a 1979 U.N. convention to protect migratory animals, 44 have seen numbers decline, and as many as 22 could vanish altogether, the report added. The numbers were based on assessments and data provided by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as well as the Living Planet Index, which collates population numbers for more than 5,000 species from 1970 onwards. The report, released on Monday, gives a very clear direction about what governments need to do to tackle the threats to migratory species, said Amy Fraenkel, executive secretary of the U.N. Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Its always about implementation, she said ahead of the conventions meeting, held this week in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Humans pose the biggest threat, with activities including hunting, fishing and other forms of overexploitation impacting 70 of the species on the U.N. list. Habitat loss affected up to 75 of the species  underlining the need for more connectivity between isolated ecosystems. The reports authors urged governments to avoid disrupting habitats and migration paths when installing infrastructure such as dams, pipelines or wind turbines. We need to look at the top levels of government decision making, said Fraenkel and what is being planned so that we can make sure that we can ... address human needs while not sacrificing the nature we all need to survive. The pressures are being compounded by temperature changes, which disrupt the timing of migrations, cause heat stress and drive increasingly destructive weather-related events such as drought or forest fires. The changes that had been already predicted some years ago are now happening, Fraenkel said. Parties to the Convention meet every three years to review new species to add to its watchlist. Among the animals being considered at this weeks Samarkand meeting will be the giant Amazon catfish. The agency will also launch a new program to provide technical assistance for countries to protect habitats more effectively, Fraenkel said. Conservationists urged governments to honour their 2022 pledge under the new global biodiversity agreement to set aside 30 of the worlds land and sea territories for nature by 2030. If governments do everything they have committed to do, then the next (U.N. report) will have some good news, said Susan Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, who is attending the Samarkand meeting.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the go-ahead to make several amendments to the Online Safety Act based on the proposals submitted by various industry professionals. As such, the Legal Draftsman will be directed to outline a draft Bill to amend the much-disputed legislation as per a proposal tabled by the Public Security Minister at the Cabinet meeting on Monday (Feb.12). The Online Safety Act, which seeks to regulate online content, was passed in Parliament with amendments on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who alleged the new law will muzzle free speech. It garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects. In response to the criticisms, the Sri Lankan government has said the new law aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters.",

        "date": "February 13, 2024 12:31 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters)  A group of South Korean octogenarian rappers have hit it big in their hometown and beyond, rapping about farm life and bringing energy to a quiet rural area threatened by a population slump. Suni and the Seven Princesses have become local celebrities since debuting in a community centre in August last year in Chilgok county, an area in North Gyeongsang province more than four hours drive from capital city Seoul. It feels like Im getting younger ... Even if Im old, Im excited, said Park Jeom-sun, 81, leader of the group and known as Suni, of a recent performance in a kindergarten. After initially gaining a modest fan club of 150 people, the groups fame spread beyond their own county. They have been asked to perform in local towns and appear on TV shows, and their videos have garnered more than 77,000 views on YouTube. Their success comes just as South Korea is expected to become a super-ageing society as early as next year, with a fifth of its population above the age of 65. Rural areas like Chilgok have the greatest risk of fading into irrelevance as young people move away to the cities and fewer of them have children. In the past, it felt like Im living in a really busy town, but now its not good. There are no people here anymore, Park said. Park said she and the other group members feel like they are reliving their youth when they perform in bucket hats, wearing metal jewellery and baggy pants. Their lyrics are often about rural life and include lines like: Picking chilli from a chilli farm ... Picking watermelon from a watermelon farm. So happy to be back home! Group members, who have known each other since they were young, missed out on an education in the harsh years after the Korean War, and in 2016, they all took an adult education class to learn how to read and write the Korean alphabet, Hangul. Last year, Park came across a rap performance on the internet, and the group decided to learn rap from their Hangul teacher and make a senior hip-hop group, writing lyrics about their rural life. Their debut came at a school play at the same community centre where they met for their Hangul classes. Inspired by the success of Suni and the Seven Princesses, four other rap groups made up of older South Koreans have sprung up in Chilgok, some formed with the idea of staving off dementia and loneliness. Parks proud 27-year-old granddaughter, Kang Hye-eun, believes her grandmother is the most famous resident of Chilgok. I thought only celebrities become popular on social media, but my grandmother is there now. -Agencies",

        "content": "Marking a landmark achievement, Sri Lanka has been declared a UN World Restoration Flagship, in recognition of the island nations vital efforts to rebuild and restore its mangrove ecosystems. Through the World Restoration Flagship Award, the UN is honouring the planets most ambitious, successful, and inspiring examples of large-scale ecosystem restoration. With only seven years left in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, seven new winners including Sri Lanka were announced for their large-scale and long-term ecosystem restoration, embodying the 10 Restoration Principles of the UN Decade. The prestigious recognition signifies Sri Lankas effective use of the UNs Principles for Ecosystem Restoration and highlights globally significant best practices and methodologies that can potentially serve as a framework for future success across the world. The aftermath of the 2004 tsunami and its destructive impacts on Sri Lankas coastline drew attention to the importance of mangroves as a coastal protector. Unfortunately, the continued destruction of mangroves, and the lack of a formal mechanism impeded effective conservation and restoration. Sri Lankas commitment to strengthen its coastal ecosystems dates back to 2015 and beyond, and was accomplished by the establishment of expert panels, task forces, policies, action plans and restoration guidelines that represent top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top coalitions for action and conservation. The nations revolutionary approach towards mangrove restoration is primarily underpinned by science-driven methodologies, with a focus on reviving ecosystem services. This two-pronged approach is designed to restore the balance of the entire ecosystem and its connectivity. The involvement of youth as researchers and future restoration leaders, and the mobilisation of multiple stakeholder groups spanning the Government, NGOs, the private sector, academia and the community have culminated in a new paradigm of restoration that is built for the future. The UN Flagship Restoration Award is a timely recognition of Sri Lankas viable, lasting solutions towards the restoration of these essential ecosystems which support countless lives and livelihoods across the island. Sri Lanka will receive the award at the United Nations Environmental Assembly which is scheduled to be in Nairobi on 27 February 2024.",

AGLs Loy Yang A power station, responsible for about a third of the states power, was forced to shut down on Tuesday afternoon after several towers along a major section of the states transmission network collapsed in bad weather. More than 500,000 homes or businesses had lost power, state energy minister Lily DAmbrosio said in a social media post. As the plant shut down, electricity prices spiked across the state to their maximum of A16,600 per megawatt hour, up from around A200, according to data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). In response, AEMO ordered electricity usage cut across the network, according to a statement on Tuesday afternoon. DAmbrosio said in her post that one of Loy Yangs four units had been brought back online and the mandatory power cuts had ended. AGL said in a statement it was working to bring three of Loy Yangs units back online through Tuesday evening. We continue to work with AEMO and stakeholders to investigate the cause of the issue. The failure comes amid repeated warnings from AEMO that urgent investment is required to ensure power supply remains reliable as the countrys fleet of aging coal-fired power plants are retired.

Panadura High Court Judge Saman Kumara, who issued this sentence over the charges of committing involuntary manslaughter, abducting and attempting to sexually abuse the 09-year-old girl, also ordered the convict to pay Rs.3 million in compensation to the mother of the deceased girl, Ada Derana reporter said. In the event the accused, Farook Mohommed Ganesanathan, fails to pay the aforementioned compensation, the High Court Judge ordered that his sentence be further extended by 78 months. The investigations had revealed that on 27 May 2022, the accused had abducted the 09-year-old girl who was returning from a grocery store located close to her home, with the intention of sexually abusing the child. However the accused, who panicked due to the childs screaming, had suffocated her in the mud. Investigation officers further uncovered that the child had not been sexually abused. The Attorney General had taken measures to prosecute the suspect before the Panadura High Court within a short period of around 06 months, based on the investigations carried out by the Bandaragama Police and Panadura Divisional Crimes Unit regarding the incident. The police had also uncovered that the accused was a close friend of the deceased girls father. Thus, the Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara, who appeared for the prosecution, pointed out before the court that the defendant had committed a cruel act by abducting a small child of a close friend, and that it indicates how violent the present society is. Accordingly, the Deputy Solicitor General had requested the court to impose the maximum possible penalty on the suspect, as to set an example for others not to commit such crimes.",

        "date": "February 13, 2024 04:50 pm",
        "content": "This years Super Bowl was watched by an average of 123.4 million people in the US, making it the most watched broadcast since the 1969 Moon landing. Preliminary US TV ratings put Sundays game just behind Apollo 11s historic landing, which was seen by an estimated 125 to 150 million people. Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime. Taylor Swifts highly anticipated attendance to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce may have boosted the figures. There was much speculation in the run-up to the event about whether Swift would make it back from Japan, where she had been performing on tour. According to Variety, there is some debate over how much she affected audience numbers, but consumer research firm Numerator concluded from a flash poll that 20 of Super Bowl viewers were rooting for the Chiefs because of the singers relationship with Kelce. The cameras were certainly enjoying the Swift factor, including shots of the star entering the arena, hanging out with actress Blake Lively and rapper Ice Spice, and kissing Kelce after the match as they celebrated the win. Of this years viewers, 112 million of the 123.4 million average watched the game on CBS, with the rest tuning into Paramount, Nickelodeon, Univision, CBS Sports and NFL digital channels. According to media analysts Nielsen, a record 202.4 million people watched at least part of the game. This years figures may have also been helped by the fact Nielsen has changed the way it counts people watching out of their own homes - for example with friends or family, or in bars. Last years Super Bowl game between the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles was watched by 115.1 million viewers. The fact the Chiefs were defending their championship title plus Usher performing the half-time show were also big draws this year. The pop stars guests included Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Will.i.am, Lil John, Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri. Usher continued the celebrations later by getting married to his long-term partner Jennifer Goicoechea in Las Vegas, where the Super Bowl was held. The couple got hitched at Vegas Weddings Terrace Gazebo, an outdoor wedding chapel that seats 30 guests, according to People. We can confirm that Usher and Jennifer Goicoechea took the next step in their relationship and did get married on Sunday night in Las Vegas surrounded by close friends and family, a representative for the singer told the publication. They both look forward to continuing to raise their children together surrounded by love and thank everyone for the well wishes. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "OpenAI CEO warns that societal misalignments could make artificial intelligence dangerous",
        "date": "February 13, 2024 05:46 pm",
        "content": "The CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said Tuesday that the dangers that keep him awake at night regarding artificial intelligence are the very subtle societal misalignments that could make the systems wreak havoc. Sam Altman, speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai via a video call, reiterated his call for a body like the International Atomic Energy Agency to be created to oversee AI thats likely advancing faster than the world expects. Theres some things in there that are easy to imagine where things really go wrong. And Im not that interested in the killer robots walking on the street direction of things going wrong, Altman said. Im much more interested in the very subtle societal misalignments where we just have these systems out in society and through no particular ill intention, things just go horribly wrong. However, Altman stressed that the AI industry, like OpenAI, shouldnt be in the drivers seat when it comes to making regulations governing the industry. Were still in the stage of a lot of discussion. So theres you know, everybody in the world is having a conference. Everyones got an idea, a policy paper, and thats OK, Altman said. I think were still at a time where debate is needed and healthy, but at some point in the next few years, I think we have to move towards an action plan with real buy-in around the world. OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, is one of the leaders in the field. Microsoft has invested some 1 billion in OpenAI. The Associated Press has signed a deal with OpenAI for it to access its news archive. Meanwhile, The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft over the use of its stories without permission to train OpenAIs chatbots. OpenAIs success has made Altman the public face for generative AIs rapid commercialization  and the fears over what may come from the new technology. The UAE, an autocratic federation of seven hereditarily ruled sheikhdoms, has signs of that risk. Speech remains tightly controlled. Those restrictions affect the flow of accurate information  the same details AI programs like ChatGPT rely on as machine-learning systems to provide their answers for users. The Emirates also has the Abu Dhabi firm G42, overseen by the countrys powerful national security adviser. G42 has what experts suggest is the worlds leading Arabic-language artificial intelligence model. The company has faced spying allegations for its ties to a mobile phone app identified as spyware. It has also faced claims it could have gathered genetic material secretly from Americans for the Chinese government. G42 has said it would cut ties to Chinese suppliers over American concerns. However, the discussion with Altman, moderated by the UAEs Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence Omar al-Olama, touched on none of the local concerns. For his part, Altman said he was heartened to see that schools, where teachers feared students would use AI to write papers, now embrace the technology as crucial for the future. But he added that AI remains in its infancy. I think the reason is the current technology that we have is like ... that very first cellphone with a black-and-white screen, Altman said. So give us some time. But I will say I think in a few more years itll be much better than it is now. And in a decade it should be pretty remarkable. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "US Senate passes 95 bln aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan",
        "date": "February 13, 2024 06:07 pm",
        "content": "The Democratic-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed a 95.34 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, amid growing doubts about the legislations fate in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The lawmakers approved the measure in a 70-29 vote that exceeded the chambers 60-vote threshold for passage and sent the legislation on to the House. Twenty-two Republicans joined most Democrats to support the bill. Its certainly been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate has passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. The Senate vote occurred before sunrise, after eight hardline Republican opponents of Ukraine aid held an overnight marathon of speeches that dominated the chamber floor for more than six hours. Democratic President Joe Biden has been urging Congress to hurry the new aid to Ukraine and U.S. partners in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, for months. After Hamas Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he also requested funds for the U.S. ally, along with humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. Ukrainian officials have also warned of weapons shortages at a time when Russia is pressing ahead with renewed attacks. Both houses of Congress must approve the legislation before Biden can sign it into law. Schumer said he believes the measure would receive the same strong bipartisan support if it came to a vote in the House. But the bill appears to face long odds of getting to the floor of the House, where Republican Speaker Mike Johnson faulted it for lacking conservative provisions to stem a record flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border. DEAD ON ARRIVAL? In the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters, Johnson said in a statement issued late on Monday. America deserves better than the Senates status quo, said Johnson, who has suggested in the past that the House could split the legislation into separate bills. Senator John Thune, the chambers No. 2 Republican, said it was not clear what Johnson would do. The House, I assume, is going to move on something. Obviously, theyre going to address Israel, Thune said. Hardline Republicans predicted that the Senate legislation would be dead on arrival in the House. The bill before us today ... will never pass in the House, will never become law, Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said in an early morning floor speech. The legislation includes 61 billion for Ukraine, 14 billion for Israel in its war against Hamas and 4.83 billion to support partners in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, and deter aggression by China. It would also provide 9.15 billion in humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, Ukraine and other conflict zones around the globe. Republicans have demanded for months that the foreign aid bill include border restrictions. But a bipartisan border deal, negotiated over the course of months, ran afoul of most Senate Republicans after it was rejected by Donald Trump, the partys leading White House candidate. Schumer stripped the border security language from the bill last week. Trump, who hopes to use the border issue to unseat Biden in the November election, has since turned his criticism on the foreign aid bill, saying on social media that aid to U.S. allies should instead take the form of loans. Aid to Ukraine faces powerful headwinds in the House, where Trumps interests hold greater sway with Republicans who control the chamber by a thin majority. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 13, 2024 07:10 pm",
        "content": "Tourists from India topped the list of countries visiting Sri Lanka in January 2023 and the island nation was positive about surge in religious tourism with consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Sri Lanka was also working on Ramayana trail as there is huge interest in places mentioned in the Ramayana to attract more tourists to the country, Sri Lankan Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said in Mumbai, India. Speaking to the Free Press Journal on the sidelines of the recently concluded travel and trade show  OTM 2024, Fernando said Lanka government was also working with Thai government in developing a Buddhist circuit with places of interest in India and Sri Lanka. He said that though India has 80 flights a week to various destinations in Sri Lanka, the island country was also keen on starting flights from Ahmedabad and were in talks with couple of Indian operators. He said that the government was also working with few ashrams in southern India and also in Ayodhya. The minister said they have signed an agreement with the local administration in this regard. He said that India and Sri Lanka are not two countries but one. History also shows us that both the countries were connected and that is reflected in our people, culture and food habits. Fernando also appreciated Indias support to Sri Lanka when the country was facing crisis and the continuous support to our various projects like green energy. He said the country aims to be totally green as far as hotel industry is concerned and will also promote green vehicles. IPL to Promote Tourism Fernando said that Sri Lanka has also proposed Sri Lanka will be hosting three IPL 2024 matches as part of Indian governments initiative to promote tourism in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan government has requested BCCI secretary Jay Shah in this regard and a final decision in this regard will be taken shortly, Sri Lanka Sports Minister Harin Fernando told Free Press Journal on the sidelines of travel and trade show  OTM 2024. Fernando said that holding IPL matches in Sri Lanka would give a big boost tourism in the island nation. The country has seen huge interest in tourists from India after pandemic and arrivals from India topped the visitors chart in January 2024. He said that the government was also in talks with Indian cricketers to engage them as a brand ambassador. The minister said during his stay in Mumbai he is scheduled to meet representatives to discuss their role. He said cricket is big in both Sri Lanka and India and an Indian cricketer promoting Sri Lanka as a tourist destination will appeal to a bigger audience segment. As part of their efforts to make the country more industry friendly, the Sri Lankan government has also reduced the number of permission required to shoot a film in Sri Lanka. Fernando said the government was keen on making Sri Lanka a lucrative destination for the film makers and the changes were in that direction. The minister said while south Indian films are regularly shot in Sri Lanka, fewer Hindi films have been shot. On Sri Lankan companies setting up their businesses in India, the minister said more companies will open their officesmanufacturing units and use India as export hub.

        "date": "February 13, 2024 09:23 pm",
        "content": "A new project was launched in Sri Lanka to bolster its anti-corruption ecosystem, in tandem with the Government of Japan and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The new project will work towards strengthening the anti-corruption ecosystem in Sri Lanka, through time-bound national policy reform, inter-stakeholder collaboration, and enhanced institutional capacity to deliver a necessary roadmap for the country to emerge from fragility towards a resilient economy and a trusted democracy. Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Hideaki Mizukoshi and Resident Representative of UNDP Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota marked the launch of the new project titled The Project for Promoting Economic Governance through Anti-corruption Policy Support, through an official signing that took place in Colombo today (Feb.13) with the participation of senior government officials. Sri Lankas ongoing socio-economic crisis has reversed development gains achieved, with deep rooted transparency and accountability gaps identified as a key contributor to the economic crisis of the country. The Project for Promoting Economic Governance through Anti-Corruption Policy Support is supported by the Government of Japan through the Japanese Supplementary Budget (JSB) of 137 million JPY (approximately 931,000 USD) will be implemented by the Government of Sri Lanka and UNDP in Sri Lanka. The proposed action seeks to (1) strengthen legal and policy frameworks; (2) improve coordination among key institutions combating financial and tax crimes; and (3) enhance strategic institutional and individual skills and capacities around combating anticorruption through strategic action under three main outcomes. Highlighting Japans commitment to support the people of Sri Lanka, Hideaki Mizukoshi, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka noted, Anti-corruption measures are conducive for more business friendly environment for foreign investors. Japan would like to support improvement in this sense and expect to see expansion of our business relationship. I would like to affirm once again that the Government of Japan remains dedicated to supporting to promote Sri Lankas fairer economic governance and anti-corruption initiatives and we eagerly anticipate witnessing the tangible impact of our collective efforts. Targeted, time-bound, capacity development within the anti-corruption ecosystem will assist Sri Lanka to ensure a comprehensive approach to combatting corruption through prevention, investigation, and prosecution. This will contribute towards efficient and predictable public service delivery, upholding the rule of law that serves as a bulwark against corruption and encourage foreign direct investment which is critical to Sri Lankas recovery from the socio-economic crisis. Commenting on the role of UNDP, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative for UNDP in Sri Lanka highlighted, Its become evident that for Sri Lanka to effectively implement required reforms and restore its economy, accountable and transparent systems and institutions are absolutely essential. This partnership with Japan complements our ongoing and planned activities in support of strengthening economic governance and will promote a holistic approach that empowers institutions to collaborate seamlessly. The JSB support will serve as a catalyst, enhancing not only their individual capacities but, most crucially, their collective ability to unite in the fight against corruption. We in UDNP are deeply grateful to the Government of Japan for this opportunity. The interventions envisaged under the project will contribute significantly to the achievement of Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG16), by promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.",

        "content": "President of Brazil, Lula da Silva has accepted the invitation extended by his Sri Lankan counterpart to visit Sri Lanka, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Brazil said in a press release. This was remarked by Secretary for Asia and Pacific of the Brazilian Foreign Affairs Ministry, Ambassador Eduardo Paes Saboia during the 76th anniversary of Independence Day reception held at the Sri Lankan embassy last week. Ambassador Saboia further stated that President Lula da Silva is enthusiastic to undertake his official visit to Sri Lanka in due course. He recalled the constructive interactions that the leaders of Sri Lanka and Brazil had in Dubai on the sidelines of COP28 in December 2023, adding that there will be more opportunities to further strengthen bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two nations in 2024. In his address, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Brazil Sumith Dassanayake highlighted the significant elevation of relations between Sri Lanka and Brazil since holding the first round of Political Consultations in November 2022. As a result, a high-level technical team from Brazil undertook an official visit to Sri Lanka in June 2023 with a view to providing Brazilian technical assistance for the development and capacity building of Sri Lankas Dairy and Sugarcane industries. The relevant Agreement is to be signed shortly between the Embassy and the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) in Brasilia implementing the above proposal. Ambassador Dassanayake also stated that the Embassy had a number of interactions to increase Sri Lankas relations with the other South American countries such as Chile, Colombia and Argentina which includes the visit of 12-member leading Ceylon Tea exporting companies to Chile in October 2023. At present Ceylon Tea is the market leader in Chile. He also noted that Sri Lanka managed the economic crisis that the country faced in 2022, very effectively. Political stability has also been restored and accordingly, Sri Lanka being one of the oldest functioning democracies in Asia, the major elections such as Presidential and General elections are scheduled to be held in due course.

        "date": "February 14, 2024 06:30 am",
        "content": "Former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be the nominee for Pakistans next premier to lead a new coalition alliance formed between different parties, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday after national elections last week returned a hung parliament. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Tuesday said it would support Sharifs party to form a minority government, ending a stalemate after inconclusive elections in the nuclear-armed nation lead to days of political uncertainty. A spokesman for Sharifs party, Marriyam Aurangzeb, said in a post on social media site X, formerly Twitter, that Nawaz Sharif, the elder brother of Shehbaz, had nominated him for the post. Shehbaz Sharif belongs to his brothers Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the largest recognised party with 80 seats and PPP is second with 54. Together, the two parties have enough for a simple majority in the 264-seat legislature. We have decided that we will form government together to take Pakistan out of crisis, the co-chairman of the PPP, former President Asif Ali Zardari, told a news conference, seated besides Shehbaz Sharif and leaders of other political parties. Earlier, Zardaris son and fellow PPP leader, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, had laid conditions on backing the Sharif-led coalition, saying they would support them in electing the prime minister but would not join the government. The conditions to join forces did not bode well for a stable or strong administration in the worlds second-largest Muslim country. However, the alliance has ended uncertainty over government formation for now, five days after the Feb. 8 vote gave a split verdict and sparked worries of fresh instability. Independent candidates backed by jailed former premier Imran Khan have won 92 seats, making them the largest group, but they cannot form a government on their own, having run as individuals and not a party, and have ruled out alliances with PML-N or PPP. Bhutto Zardari said Khans independents and PML-N had more numbers than his party but Khan had ruled out joining forces with the PPP. The PPP does not want a perpetual economic crisis or a fresh election leading to a political crisis in Pakistan, Bhutto Zardari said. Bhutto Zardari was keen that his father Asif Ali Zardari be president again. TV channel Geo News also cited PPP sources as saying the party wanted its appointees to take the governor post in all four provinces. ECONOMIC, POLITICAL CHALLENGES Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the support from the PPP and other parties and said all the parties had come together because they needed to tackle numerous challenges, particularly the economy. The country of 241 million people is grappling with an economic crisis amid slow growth and record inflation, along with rising militant violence. It narrowly averted a sovereign default last summer with a 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, but the lenders support ends in March, following which a new, extended programme will be needed. Negotiating a new programme, and at speed, will be critical for the new government. Analysts had hoped the election would bring a solution to the crises faced by Pakistan, but the split verdict, with a large number of independents at loggerheads with the influential military, could only mean more instability. The new political alliance has a nearly two third majority in the new parliament, Sharif said, adding that this would lead to more certainty in policy-making. Khan, a celebrity cricket star-turned-politician, is in jail on charges of corruption and revealing state secrets, and his party was barred from contesting the election, forcing members to run as independents. Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has alleged that the vote was rigged and vowed to legally challenge some results. The caretaker government and election commission have rejected those accusations. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, addressing the meeting, underscored the importance of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee as a standing national framework to effectively coordinate the governments response to an increasing volume of reporting obligations to the UN human rights mechanisms including to the Human Rights Council (HRC), the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), Special Procedures Mandate Holders (SPMHs) and Treaty Bodies. Secretary Wijewardane provided an overview of the structure of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee which operates as a two-tier process, consisting of 21 government line agencies. The United Nations and Human Rights Division provided an update on the status of reporting obligations under the international human rights conventions to which Sri Lanka is a party. The Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee (IMSC) on Human Rights, established pursuant to approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on 11 December 2023, is envisaged as a standing national framework to ensure efficient coordination and reporting on Sri Lankas voluntary international commitments regarding human rights and reconciliation. The IMSC operates as a two-tier process. The first tier is the high-level Committee chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs which is convened every four months as needed and makes policy decisions on matters of high priority and significance. The second tier is the senior official level Committee, chaired by Foreign Secretary which monitors progress and meets on a monthly basis as required. During the discussion that followed the presentation, the officials who attended the meeting appreciated this initiative of the Foreign Ministry and expressed their willingness to cooperate in this process.",
