        "title": "There is only one ladder out of this crisis  Presidents address to the nation",
        "date": "February 4, 2023 06:45 pm",
        "content": "President Rani Wickremesinghe addressed the nation this evening (04 Feb.), in view of Sri Lankas 75th Independence Anniversary. In his speech, the Head of State discussed Sri Lankas looming economic crisis, stating that the only way out of it was by making difficult and unpopular decisions. Sugarcoated stories by politicians will not resolve this crisis, Wickremesinghe said, adding that he will continue to move forward with reforms such as those implemented thus far, albeit being severely unpopular and criticized. Moreover, he noted that under his Government, the system change that was demanded by the youth of Sri Lanka over a prolonged period of time will be implemented, with changes being made in all areas of the countrys political system in a manner fitting for a modern era. Below is the full speech delivered by the President; Most Venerable Maha Sangha and the clergy, my fellow citizens, all Sri Lankans abroad, dear children, Today, I will not be delivering a traditional Independence Day statement. I am not going to dwell on the freedom we gained while honouring those who were dedicated and worked hard for the countrys freedom, including the late D. S. Senanayake. I will focus on regaining the freedom that we have lost today. Around 75 years ago, the esteemed London Times newspaper carried an editorial stating that it is our desire to see SL become a Switzerland in the East very soon. They had not expressed a similar vision for any other country in the East. However, what has happened to us today? Today we are facing an unprecedented economic crisis, hitherto never experienced. Why have we to face such a situation? Who is responsible for this? Lets be honest, all of us are more or less responsible for this situation. None of us can point fingers and blame each other. We made mistakes from the beginning, though efforts were made to rectify those mistakes, it was not possible to rectify them completely. The policy followed by the late D S. Senanayake in securing the countrys freedom was to unite all Sri Lankans. He believed that everyone, be it Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher, should forge ahead as Sri Lankans. However, after independence, we divided in terms of race, religion and region. We were divided to a point of developing suspicion and animosity against each other. Various groups exploited this division to gain power and created further rifts among the people. Instead of rejecting such people, we accorded the power to these very same groups. In politics, lies were spread instead of the truth, and politicians who spoke the truth were rejected by the people. Those who pointed out the real situation of the country and sought related remedies were hardly given a place, yet those who satisfied people with their lies gained greater acceptance. We got trapped in a political culture based on promises. We depended on resources that did not belong to us, those which were received on loan facilities, and we borrowed even more loans. We adapted to the notion that the Government is a spring of resources , after which many were of the view that the duty of the rulers was to distribute the various resource obtained from that spring, amongst the people of the country. Accordingly, job opportunities were provided, various goods and equipment were distributed, cash was also distributed. In most instances, we did not vote on behalf of the country, instead, we voted for a candidate in order to receive a job, gain admission to a school for our children, and have a tender passed, etc. We worked for political candidates expecting personal favours in return. Most of us contested not for the country, but for personal power, for greater benefits, and to earn a little more. We were trapped in promises and endured slogans which finally resulted in the gradual collapse of the countrys economy. We borrowed extensively to fulfill the election pledges and to prove that the slogans shouted at the protests were correct, we borrowed more for consumption than for investment. However, according to Buddhist philosophy, one should take loans for investment purposes and not for consumption. Although we preach about Buddhism, our actions are not in line with the Buddhas teachings. Lee Kuan Yew, who visited Sri Lanka after many years to study and formulate a strategy to rebuild Singapore, said that This situation has arisen in your country due to unnecessarily prioritizing politics. If Sri Lanka was taken as an example, Singapore too would have perished by now. In fact, we have now reached a point of destruction. There are those who want to keep prolonging this wound forever, however, I do not like that. Although it may be difficult and painful to do so, lets aim to heal this wound, because if we endure this pain and suffering for a short while, it is possible for us to heal this wound completely. There is no shortcut to getting out of this crisis, despite claims made by certain political parties. We have only way to get rid of this situation if we want to overcome this crisis and achieve real economic and social freedom, there is only one ladder to get out of this ditch. Keep in mind that if we place this ladder aside to satisfy political agendas, we have no country, and we have no tomorrow. On several previous occasions, I pointed out the seriousness and danger of the looming economic crisis we are currently facing, and I have already said that the first six months of this year will be extremely difficult. We have to face this difficult situation, even if we do not like it, for the sake of the country. Sugarcoated stories by politicians will not resolve this crisis. Although a large number of people in this country moved away from poverty with free education and expanded the middle class, today the country has turned into a land where it is impossible to fulfill their aspirations. I see the youth who should be working hard in different fields in this country creating long queues to obtain passports instead, we need to change this. To achieve this, we should modernize the economy and open it to the world. The corrupt political factionalism that deceives people, pushing them further into poverty and making them further dependent should also be changed. This is the system change that the youth of this country have been demanding for a long period of time. Thus, my government has embarked on a new path of reform to fulfill the needs of the youth. Even though those decisions that have to be taken for it are unpopular, it has to be done in order to overcome this crisis. We have to move away from narrow politics if we are to get rid of this crisis. We must face this challenge together as children of one mother, and make our fullest contribution to strengthening the path toward the successful development of this country. We must all move forwards as Sri Lankan nationals leaving aside all differences. Hence the first steps towards the development of a strong new economy have already been taken. We are in the final stages of securing certain difficult elements required for the IMF bailout, and we are expecting their approval in this regard soon. We cannot be satisfied just by strengthening the economy, the entire system needs to be changed. All areas of the political system, the legislature, Parliament, Executive, and State Institutions should be changed in a manner suitable to the modern era. Both the nation and us should benefit from this change. More space should be created in this new system for the representation and opinions of young people and women in particular. We are in the process of presenting several proposals to the Parliament in this regard. Furthermore, immediate action needs to be taken in relation to the specific issues faced by those in the North and East. A cabinet sub-committee has already been appointed for this purpose. All political parties are informed of the committees decisions and the dates these decisions are due to be implemented, after which these tasks are carried forwards based on their ideas. We have also prioritized certain tasks such as the release of lands and prisoners. Measures are also underway to create the maximum devolution of powers possible within the premise of a unitary state, however, we will never consent to the division of this nation. I am not attempting to treat a superficial illness with painkillers, but instead to treat the root cause of this illness  it is challenging, and it is difficult, but this is our only way forward. I know that many of the decisions I have been compelled to take since assuming the Presidency have been unpopular, however, because of these decisions, today, no citizen of this country is forced to die of dehydration or starve without gas. They do not have shout out curses due to the lack of fertilizer. Therefore, regardless of the obstacles the anarchist political forces try to create, I will continue these new reforms with the majority of those who love this country. We can become a developed country by 2048 if we work and move forward in a united and planned manner envisioning peace and reconciliation. We have the potential to become a developed country that need not beg from any other nation in the world, true freedom can be achieved. It is our collective responsibility to build a new country in which our children can compete with the rest of the world. Therefore, I urge all parties to come together to overcome this crisis. Lets unite! Lets join hands! With these joined hands, lets embark on the journey that we have planned for the next 25 years, together! Lets further nurture those plans in accordance with the views of all parties, lets make them stronger, more systematic and streamlined. Not only those of us who live in Sri Lanka should make a joint effort towards this, but those Sri Lankans living abroad, across the globe, must also shoulder this journey. Everyone should contribute to the achievement of these goals to their fullest capacity. Let us devote ourselves and unite as children of one mother, let us make our country one of the most developed in the world by 2048, when we will celebrate 100 years of independence! Thank you all",

        "title": "Blinken postpones trip to Beijing after Chinese spy balloon spotted over US",
        "date": "February 4, 2023 07:25 pm",
        "content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed his upcoming trip to China in response to the flying of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over the United States, in what marks a significant new phase in the tensions between Washington and Beijing. Blinken, who was due to depart Friday night for Beijing, said at a press conference Friday that the high-altitude surveillance balloon flying over the continental United States created the conditions that undermine the purpose of the trip. He informed Chinas top diplomat, Wang Yi, in a call Friday morning that he was postponing. In my call today with Director Wang Yi, I made clear that the presence of this surveillance balloon in US airspace is a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law, that its an irresponsible act, and that the (Peoples Republic of China) decision to take this action on the eve of my planned visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have, Blinken told reporters Friday. Blinken said that the US is confident the balloon over the US is a Chinese surveillance balloon, and the Pentagon said Friday evening that there is another Chinese spy balloon that is currently transiting Latin America. We are seeing reports of a balloon transiting Latin America. We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statement to CNN. It is unclear exactly where over Latin America the balloon is, but a US official told CNN that as of Friday evening, it did not appear that balloon was currently heading to the United States. The Chinese foreign ministry claimed Friday that the balloon spotted over the US was a civilian airship used mainly for weather research that deviated from its planned course. The statement from a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry was the first admission that the airship originated in China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure, the Chinese foreign ministry said. The Chinese side will continue communicating with the US side and properly handle this unexpected situation caused by force majeure, the statement added, using a legalistic term to mean circumstances beyond Chinas control. A senior State Department official said that the US has acknowledged Chinas statement of regret but that the presence of the balloon in US airspace was a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law, and it is unacceptable that this has occurred. In this current environment, I think it would have significantly narrowed the agenda that we would have been able to address, the official added. A US military official said the incident is serious because of the audacity of the Chinese government, rather than any intelligence gain. While existing satellites are able to gather similar amounts of information, the timing of the spy balloon  right before the planned Blinken trip  and the fact that it is flying right over the continental US contribute to the seriousness of this moment, this official said. The Pentagon assesses that the balloon will be remain over the US for a few days, a spokesman said Friday. The balloon was spotted in Missouri on Friday and is moving toward the East Coast. It could exit the East Coast as early as Saturday morning, based off of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather model. Two US defense officials also told CNN that the balloon is expected to reach the East Coast and then pass out to sea in the southeast, near the Carolinas. One of the officials said it could exit the East Coast on Saturday. Once we detected the balloon, the US government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information, Blinken said Friday. We communicated with the PRC government directly through multiple channels about this issue. Members of my team consulted with our partners in other agencies, and in Congress. We also engaged our close allies and partners to inform them of the presence of the surveillance balloon in our airspace. Blinken trip was set to follow Biden-Xi meeting The decision to postpone Blinkens trip was made after high-level conversations between Blinken, President Joe Biden and other top national security officials, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials had viewed US-China relations as improving in the weeks following Bidens meeting in November with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Blinkens trip was to be the culmination of more robust talks between Washington and Beijing in the two months since the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. In the lead-up to Blinkens trip, officials said it was possible that Biden and Xi could speak again at some point in the next several months. But Biden has been sensitive to criticism from Republicans and others that he is too soft on China. And while he agreed with Pentagon recommendations not to shoot down the balloon because it posed a threat to people on the ground, he did want to demonstrate some type of response. Officials also believed the timing of the balloon could throw off Blinkens agenda in Beijing and did not necessarily want his visit to become solely about the incident. Blinken still intends to travel to China at the earliest opportunity when conditions allow, the State Department official said, though the official did not elaborate on what conditions the US is watching for. Blinken said at his press conference Friday that he would visit Beijing when conditions allow. Earlier this week, the State Department summoned Chinas charge daffaires in Washington, Xu Xueyuan, to deliver a very clear and stark message regarding the discovery of the spy balloon, a second US official told CNN. That message was conveyed directly by Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, according to the senior State Department official, who said that same message was delivered at senior levels in Beijing. Biden advised not to shoot down The balloon was spotted over Montana where 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles are buried in missile silos at Malmstrom Air Force Base. Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said the US government has been tracking the balloon for several days as it made its way over the northern United States, adding it was traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday that Biden was advised by military leaders not to shoot down the balloon because of the risk to safety and security of the people on the ground. Officials told CNN that the US hasnt ruled out shooting down the balloon, once it is deemed safe to do so. However, no decisions have been made yet, the officials said. According to a defense official, US Northern Command is coordinating with NASA to determine the debris field if the balloon were to be shot down. While the balloons current flight path carries it over a number of sensitive sites, a senior US defense official said it does not present a significant intelligence gathering risk. The balloon is assessed to have limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective, the official added. Ryder said the suspected surveillance balloon is currently moving eastward and is over the central United States. He added that the US military will not get into hour-by-hour updates on the location, but said the public can look up and see it. The public certainly has the ability to look up into the sky and see where the balloon is, Ryder said. The balloon has a large payload underneath the surveillance component, he added, comparing it to a basket under a blimp. He also said that what makes this surveillance balloon different from other similar balloon activity in the past is the duration and the length of which it has been over US territory. The substructure beneath the balloon, believed by officials to be the steering and surveillance apparatus, is roughly 90 feet, according to a defense official  about the length of three city buses. The balloon carrying that substructure is significantly larger and taller, the official said. Biden was first briefed on the incident on Tuesday and has continued to receive updates, Jean-Pierre said. Staff for the congressional intelligence leaders were briefed Thursday afternoon, and Pentagon State Department officials briefed leadership staff and national security staff on Friday, the official added. The administration has also provided additional detail in writing. There are also efforts to brief lawmakers behind closed doors next week when Congress returns. Congress has been briefed on Chinas surveillance balloon activities in the past, the official said, including a briefing for key committees that took place last August, per the official. Powered by a solar array Ryder reaffirmed on Friday that the Defense Department knows the surveillance balloon floating over the northern US is Chinese and said that it has the ability to maneuver. The balloon is maneuverable, clearly its violated US air space, and again weve communicated that fact to the (Peoples Republic of China), Ryder said. He did not indicate any details on how it can be maneuvered. Sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN that the balloons movement relies primarily on the jet stream. Ryder added on Friday that the balloon has changed its course which, again, is why were monitoring it. China can control the surveillance balloon to an extent, for example, by turning on and off the surveillance gear inside of it, the sources said. Pentagon officials said they did not believe the balloon had surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities above and beyond Chinese spy satellites in low earth orbit, but unlike satellites that pass rapidly over a location every 90 minutes, a spy balloon can loiter over a spot and gather more of a pattern of life of a particular site, the official said. In the past, the US has simply allowed balloons like this to waft away, without taking any action or publicizing their presence over the US, the sources said. It is also not the first time a surveillance balloon has appeared over the United States. The US official said there were similar incidents with suspected Chinese surveillance balloons over Hawaii and Guam in recent years. On Thursday, a senior defense official said, Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "title": "You are not alone  Commonwealth Secretary General on Sri Lankas crisis",
        "date": "February 4, 2023 09:27 pm",
        "content": "Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland has reinstated the fact that Sri Lanka is not alone in the crisis it is currently facing. Speaking at the Inaugural Lecture for Geopolitical Cartographers yesterday (03 Feb.), Scotland said, I know that Sri Lanka continues to feel the weight of political and economic pressure. The pressure can be hard to bear. It can be destabilizing, isolating, and frightening, and I am here because I want every Sri Lankan to know that you are not alone. You are part of this special precious Commonwealth family. The Geopolitical Cartographers was held on the theme of The role of the Commonwealth in an Era of Polycrisis under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, yesterday at the Colombo City Centre. Speaking further, the Secretary-General emphasised that as a family, we have responsibility for one another. A duty to each other, a shared love and a shared journey and you are not alone like the challenges you face, assuring that Sri Lanka wasnt the only country amidst a crisis right now. She noted that currently, countries across the globe are facing the social, political and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. You may feel that you are living in a country under pressure, but the reality is that we are all living in a world under pressure. All of us are tightly bound by a tangled knot of crisis-spanning global systems. A world living with the social political and economic consequences of COVID-19, she said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also spoke at the session, explained that Scotland was the first to be invited to commemorate Sri Lankas 75th Independence Anniversary not only due to her fruitful ties with Sri Lanka and the Asian and African continents as whole but also because Sri Lanka was first admitted to the Commonwealth upon the gaining of their independence. You were there when we got independence and you all are here now. So it is to mark that occasion as she was invited here by the government to take part in the 75th Anniversary of our Independence, the Head of State said. Below is the Presidents full speech at the event; It gives me great pleasure to be present here today with Patricia Scotland, the Secretary General of the Commonwealth for the inaugural lecture of the geopolitical cartographer. The geopolitical cartography is the outcome of a discussion or firstly, increasing the number of think tanks and research institutes in the country. Secondly, to focus on international affairs, thirdly, not merely to cover the whole range of international affairs, but to focus on the area which was of concern to us where we are located in the Indian Ocean, its geopolitical aspects. Its geo-economic aspects, its environmental aspects fall into either geopolitical or geo-economics. And it was called the geopolitical cartographer because now the maps are drawn and boundaries are drawn not according to geography, but according to geopolitics. For a long time, we belonged to a region known as the Indian Ocean, and all of a sudden it became the Indo-Pacific. So that is geopolitical cartography. In the same way, Europe has a problem now with where to draw the boundaries between Russia and Ukraine. It keeps changing throughout the world. Various claims are made, but we have to learn now that cartography depends completely on geopolitics and nothing else. So we called the name geopolitical cartographer but was to discuss how geopolitics and geo-economics were changing the Indian Ocean, the most vital ocean in the world till about the 18th century. This was also the richest. In time to come, before the end of the century again, you will find first the development of South Asia of Indonesia and Southeast Asia of the Middle East. And finally, the big development explosion in Africa, thats why the focus is completely on this new emerging region. And the first person to come here and to be invited here is none other than the Secretary General of the Commonwealth. Shes been a good friend of Sri Lanka. Shes been a good friend of Asia and Africa and she represents our thinking. But theres also another reason for her to be here on behalf of the Commonwealth. When we gained independence, we were admitted to the Commonwealth. Our entry to the UN was blocked because the US had blocked some of the Soviet countries and in return, the Soviet Union blocked Sri Lanka. It was only in 1955 that we became a member of the United Nations. But from the beginning, we have been with the Commonwealth. It was only correct that the Secretary General of the Commonwealth should be here on our 75th Anniversary of Independence. You were there when we got independence and you all are here now. So it is to mark that occasion as she was invited here by the government to take part in the 75th Anniversary of our Independence. But today youre not here to listen to me speak. Youll be here to see and listen to what Patricia has to say. So I would like to invite her to address all of you and the numerous crises that she is going to now explain and layout.",

        "content": "Three persons belonging to an unidentified group of persons who had reportedly attacked those engaged in the Sathyagraha protest that took place near the Elphinstone Theatre in Mardana last night (03 Feb.) have been remanded. While water cannons and tear gas were fired by the Police in attempts to disperse those protesting, another group of persons is also believed to have carried out an attack on the protesters at around 10:00 p.m. last night. A heated situation then arose between the two parties, following which the Police intervened, further escalating the issue. Water cannons and tear gas were subsequently fired at the protesters, while the Riot Squad used batons to evict the protesters. Four protesters were also arrested at the time, and were later granted bail by the Maligakanda Magistrates Court. Speaking on the event, lawyer Nuwan Bopage, who was at the protest siet at the time of the incident stated that it is clear that the three persons who remanded today were, in fact, a group of persons who had recently been released on bail. It is clear that these individuals have engaged in such activities in the recent past, and were brought here in an organized manner, Bopage said, hinting that the attack was a pre-meditated plan.",

        "date": "February 4, 2023 10:26 pm",
        "content": "Chairman of the Lanka Coal Company, Shehan Sumanasekera, has raised concerns about the continuation of operations at the Norochcholai power plant if the required funds for coal purchase are not obtained. Speaking at a media briefing held this afternoon (04 Feb.), Sumanasekera stated that Rs. 15.3 billion is required immediately for the procurement of coal for the upcoming week, proposing that Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provide the required amount in dollars. Explaining the seriousness of the coal crisis, Sumanasekera said that while payments for such shipments are usually done in two installments  30 at the time of the shipment, and 70 when the coal is being unloaded  two of these payments have already been delayed wing to a lack of funds. We have to make these payments for three coal shipments from 30 January to 03 February. We have paid the first installment of 30 of Rs. 1.35 billion for one shipment, however the initial installments for the other two ships are yet to be paid, and these were due on Thursday and Friday of last week, the Chairman said. He further noted that a more complicated situation is likely to arise in the upcoming week, as the initial payments of 30 to two of the three shipments, and the remaining 70 due for all three ships will be added to the cost of Rs. 10.74 billion required for coal procurements scheduled for the period between today (04 Feb.) and 10 February. Thus, Sumanasekera urged that an immediate solution be found for this crisis, before the power plants run out of coal. Earlier today, Sumanasekera requested Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera for USD 12.32 million, amounting to Rs. 4.56 billion, to pay for the three shipments of coal for which payments are overdue.",

        "title": "Billionaire Draper pitches Sri Lanka on Bitcoin, gets rejected",
        "date": "February 5, 2023 07:31 am",
        "content": "A billionaire cryptocurrency evangelist may have gotten a tougher reception than he expected when proposing widespread adoption of Bitcoin to a bankrupt country. Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper was in Sri Lanka to shoot an episode of his Meet the Drapers TV show with local entrepreneurs, and met President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday to proselytize the adoption of cryptocurrency. He journeyed to the central bank the next day with the same pitch  but embattled Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, whos still working to calm financial mayhem, was having none of it. I come to the Central Bank with decentralized currency, proclaimed Draper, dressed in a Bitcoin tie for the meeting that took place in a teak-paneled room overlooking the sea. We dont accept, Weerasinghe said, taking another sip of fizzy ginger beer. During the meeting, Draper several times referred to what he described as Sri Lankas reputation for corruption and argued cryptocurrency was one solution. Colombo could avert graft by keeping perfect records after adopting Bitcoin, he argued. Have you seen Sri Lanka in the news? Its known as the corruption capital, Draper said. A country known for corruption will be able to keep perfect records with the adoption of Bitcoin. Sri Lankas topmost monetary official countered: Adoption of 100 Bitcoin wont be a Sri Lanka reality ever. Its a frostier response than Draper has gotten in some other locations. The tiny island country of Palau in the Pacific made him the founding resident of its digital-residency program, for instance. Fuel and food shortages in Sri Lanka stirred riots last year that forced the then-President to flee the country and later resign. The debt-stricken nation is in talks with international creditors about debt restructuring, aiming to get the International Monetary Fund to come up with a rescue plan. Inflation stands at 54.2 and last year the economy contracted 8, the governor said. To crypto enthusiasts, that might seem like the perfect place for Bitcoin adoption. One of the main use cases people see for crypto is as a steady store of value not subject to changes in central-bank or government policy. Draper even cited El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, in the meeting. But experiences like El Salvadors, which staved off default at the last minute just last month, might serve as a cautionary tale more than anything. Draper, 64, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early backer of companies like Tesla, Baidu Inc., Skype, Coinbase and Robinhood, made news in 2014 when he purchased seized Bitcoin at a US Marshals Service auction. Bitcoin is hovering in the low 20,000s  but he sees it reaching 250,000 this year. He kept trying with Weerasinghe. Does the administration have the guts to do it? he asked. Whats the advantage of having your own currency? Weerasinghe said other technologies could efficiently distribute financial services to foster inclusion and disburse electronic welfare payments, and noted that a country without its own currency couldnt have monetary-policy independence. We dont want to make the crisis worse by introducing Bitcoin, he said. The meeting lasted 30 minutes. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "title": "US fighter jet shoots down suspected Chinese spy balloon",
        "date": "February 5, 2023 08:55 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A U.S. military fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday, a week after it first entered U.S. airspace and triggered a dramatic -- and public -- spying saga that worsened Sino-U.S. relations. President Joe Biden said he had issued an order on Wednesday to take down the balloon, but the Pentagon had recommended waiting until it could be done over open water to safeguard civilians from debris crashing to Earth from thousands of feet (meters) above commercial air traffic. They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it, Biden said. Multiple fighter and refueling aircraft were involved in the mission, but only one -- an F-22 fighter jet from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia -- took the shot at 2:39 p.m. (1939 GMT), using a single AIM-9X supersonic, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile, a senior U.S. military official said. China strongly condemned the military strike on an airship that it says was used for meteorological and other scientific purposes, and which it said had strayed into U.S. airspace completely accidentally -- claims flatly dismissed by U.S. officials. China had clearly asked the U.S. to handle this properly in a calm, professional and restrained manner, Chinas foreign ministry said in a statement. The U.S. had insisted on using force, obviously overreacting. The balloon was shot down about six nautical miles off the U.S. coast of the Atlantic Ocean, over relatively shallow water, potentially aiding efforts to recover elements of the Chinese surveillance equipment over the coming days, U.S. officials said. One U.S. military official said the debris field was spread out over seven miles (11 km) of ocean, and multiple U.S. military vessels were on site. The downing of the balloon came shortly after the U.S. government ordered a halt to flights in and out of three airports in South Carolina -- Wilmington, Myrtle Beach and Charleston -- due to what it said at the time was an undisclosed national security effort. Flights resumed on Saturday afternoon. While Saturdays shootdown concludes the military dimension to the spying saga, Biden is likely to continue to face intense political scrutiny from Republican opponents in Congress who argue he failed to act quickly enough. A senior administration official said after shooting down the balloon, the U.S. government spoke directly with China about the action. The State Department also briefed allies and partners around the world, the official said. Questions remain about how much information China may have gathered during the balloons trek across the United States. The balloon entered U.S. airspace in Alaska on Jan. 28 before moving into Canadian airspace on Jan 30. It then re-entered U.S. airspace over northern Idaho on Jan. 31, a U.S. defense official said. Once it crossed over U.S. land, it did not return to open waters, making a shootdown difficult. U.S. officials did not publicly disclose the balloons presence over the United States until Thursday. Its clear the Biden administration had hoped to hide this national security failure from Congress and the American people, said U.S. Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican who leads the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. Bidens emphasis on Saturday that -- days ago -- he ordered the balloon shot down as soon as possible could be an effort to respond to such critics. Former President Donald Trump, Bidens potential rival in the 2024 election, called earlier this week for the balloon to be shot down, and has sought to portray himself as stronger than Biden on China. The U.S. relationship with China is likely to be a major theme of the 2024 presidential race. Washington had called the balloons appearance a clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and notified Beijing about the shootdown on Saturday, a U.S. official said. Still, officials on Saturday appeared to play down the balloons impact on U.S. national security. Our assessment -- and were going to learn more as we pick up the debris -- was that it was not likely to provide significant additive value over and above other (Chinese) intel capability, such as satellites in low-Earth orbit, the senior U.S. defense official said. A Reuters photographer who witnessed the shootdown said a stream came from a jet and hit the balloon, but there was no explosion. It then began to fall. The Pentagon assesses that the balloon was part of a fleet of Chinese spy balloons. On Friday, it said another Chinese balloon was flying over Latin America. Over the past several years, Chinese balloons have previously been spotted over countries across five continents, including in East Asia, South Asia and Europe, the U.S. official said. The suspected spy balloon prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone a visit to China this week that had been expected to start on Friday. The postponement of Blinkens trip, which had been agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, was a blow to those who saw it as an overdue opportunity to stabilize an increasingly fractious relationship between the two countries. China is keen for a stable U.S. relationship so it can focus on its economy, battered by the now-abandoned zero-COVID policy and neglected by foreign investors alarmed by what they see as a return of state intervention in the market.

He had survived numerous assassination attempts, and found himself on the front line of the struggle between militant Islamists and the West.

When he returned in 2013 to try to contest the election, he was arrested and barred from standing. He was charged with high treason and was sentenced to death in absentia only for the decision to be overturned less than a month later. He left Pakistan for Dubai in 2016 to seek medical treatment and had been living in exile in the country ever since. In the statement confirming the death, the military said it expressed its heartfelt condolences and added: May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family.

Issuing a statement in this regard, SLATCA noted that 19 air traffic controllers have resigned from their posts within a span of a year. If four or five more controllers leave, air traffic movements will come to a standstill even without a strike, SLATCA President, Thisara Amarananda said in this regard, emphasisng that such a standstill would a pose threat to the Sri Lankas road to recovery. The President of Sri Lanka Mr. Wickremesinghe outlined the importance of exports, foreign investments, and tourist arrivals in a bid to strengthen our economy, all of which requires the service of these Air Traffic Controllers, he said in this regard. Amarananda further accused subject Minister Nimal Siripala de Siva of not making any efforts towards the retention of air traffic controllers, adding that although a retention plan was drawn up for a period of three years by the Airport and Aviation Services of Sri Lanka (AASL), in consultation with SLATCA, it is yet to be implemented. The SLATCA President attributed this delay in implementation to the Ports Ministers refusal to approve the retention plan. He further noted that Siripala had also proposed that the standard of require educational qualifications for the role of an air traffic controller be brought down, to which he responded Lowering the education qualifications of candidates to one of the most responsible jobs in Sri Lanka may serve the self-centered appetite if politicians, but in no way remedies the ailing ATC community. Thus, SLATCA warned that although several upward trends are currently seen within the islands deteriorated economy, such as the increased number of tourists recently reported by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority), the inattentiveness displayed by the government remains a threat to this development.",

        "content": "Bangladesh is expected to get back the money borrowed by Sri Lanka by September this year as the countrys economic situation is improving, according to Dhakas foreign minister. Sri Lanka is gradually doing better. They are recovering slowly. We have given them time till September (to repay the loan), Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters at state guesthouse Padma on Sunday afternoon, hoping for repayment by Sri Lanka within the timeframe. The Bangladeshi foreign minister, who returned home Sunday from Sri Lanka, said the new government in Sri Lanka is running the country pretty well. The Sri Lankan government hopes that they will recover from the problem and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is coming up for support, Momen said. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has conveyed Sri Lankas gratitude to the Bangladesh government and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the timely assistance as the country battles to rebuild its economy. I must say they are very grateful to us, said Momen. Foreign Minister Momen visited Sri Lanka as a guest for the countrys 75th Independence Day celebrations, for which the guest list was filled up mostly by neighbouring countries at foreign minister-level. Sri Lanka and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently reached a staff-level agreement on a 48-month, 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility which will also help it secure short-term funds from other donors. Bangladesh Bank earlier granted Sri Lanka six more months to repay the 200 million loan after the Island nation requested to extend the repayment period due to its prolonged economic crisis. In a friendly gesture, Bangladesh had extended the loan to cash-strapped Sri Lanka under a currency swap arrangement in 2021. Source: The Business Standard --Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2023 11:59 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.9 struck central Turkey and northwest Syria on Monday, killing over 200 people as buildings collapsed across the snowy region, and triggering a search for survivors trapped in rubble. The quake, which hit in the early darkness of a winter morning, was also felt in Cyprus and Lebanon. I have never felt anything like it in the 40 years Ive lived, said Erdem, a resident of the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near the quakes epicentre, who declined to give his surname. We were shaken at least three times very strongly, like a baby in a crib. Turkeys disaster agency said 76 people had been killed, and 440 hurt, as authorities scrambled rescue teams and supply aircraft to the affected area, while declaring a level 4 alarm that calls for international assistance. President Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone with the governors of eight affected provinces to gather information on the situation and rescue efforts, his office said in a statement. Syrian state media said more than 100 people were killed and dozens injured there, most in the provinces of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia, where numerous buildings had been brought down. The situation is very tragic, tens of buildings have collapsed in the city of Salqin, a member of the White Helmets rescue organisation said in a video clip on Twitter, referring to a town about 5 km (3 miles) from the Turkish border. The rescuer on the clip, which showed a rubble-strewn street, said homes were totally destroyed. Many buildings in the region had already suffered damage in fighting during Syrias nearly 12-year-long civil war. People in Damascus, and in the Lebanese cities of Beirut and Tripoli, ran into the street and took to their cars to get away from their buildings in case they collapsed, witnesses said. In Turkeys Gaziantep, Erdem also said people had fled from their shaking homes and were too scared to return. Everybody is sitting in their cars or trying to drive to open spaces away from buildings, Erdem said by telephone. The United States was profoundly concerned about the quake in Turkey and Syria and was monitoring events closely, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Twitter. I have been in touch with Turkish officials to relay that we stand ready to provide any and all needed assistance, he said. The region straddles seismic fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. FOCUS ON SEARCH AND RESCUE The tremor lasted about a minute and shattered windows, according to a Reuters witness in Diyarbakir, 350 km (218 miles)to the east, where a security official said at least 17 buildings collapsed. Authorities said 16 structures collapsed in Sanliurfa and 34 in Osmaniye. Broadcasters TRT and Haberturk showed footage of people picking through building wreckage, moving stretchers and seeking survivors in the city of Kahramanmaras, where it was still dark. Our primary job is to carry out the search and rescue work and to do that all our teams are on alert, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters. The German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake struck at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), while the EMSC monitoring service said it was assessing the risk of a tsunami. The U.S. Geological Survey reported a series of further earthquakes following the initial tremor, which it put at a magnitude of 7.8. There was a quake measuring 6.7 in Gaziantep and another of 5.6 in the citys Nurdag area. Turkeys Disaster and Emergency Management Authority put the magnitude of the quake at 7.4 near Kahramanmaras and the larger city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border. Tremors were also felt in the Turkish capital of Ankara, 460 km (286 miles) northwest of the epicentre, and in Cyprus, where police reported no damage. The earthquake struck in a region that we feared. There is serious widespread damage, Kerem Kinik, the chief of the Turkish Red Crescent relief agency, told Haberturk, issuing an appeal for blood donations. Turkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. More than 17,000 people were killed in 1999 when a 7.6-magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Beyonce breaks all-time Grammy record, Harry Styles wins for best album",
        "date": "February 6, 2023 05:14 pm",
        "content": "Pop queen Beyonce on Sunday reigned supreme at the Grammys, breaking the all-time record for wins with her 32nd prize and fourth of the night -- but the Album of the Year prize thats long eluded her slipped from her fingers once again, going instead to Brit Harry Styles. All of the top contenders including Adele, Taylor Swift and Lizzo went home with an award -- but it was surprise after surprise in the top four categories. Beyonce entered the ceremony with the most chances at Grammy gold with nine, following the release of Renaissance, her rich, sprawling ode to club music. She clinched the all-time Grammy record by winning the prize for Best DanceElectronic Music Album for her smash Renaissance, thus surpassing the late classical conductor Georg Solti, who had 31 awards. Im trying not to be too emotional. And Im trying to just receive this night, Queen Bey said, wearing a shimmering, curve-hugging gown, her hair in mermaid waves as her peers witnessed the history-making moment. Beyonce thanked her family, and paid special tribute to the queer community, who she credited with inventing the genre she celebrated in her historically layered record that pays homage to pioneers of funk, soul, rap, house and disco. But while her album was considered a likely candidate for best album, it was Styles who snagged that prestigious award. On nights like tonight, its obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as bests in music, said Styles. His win over Queen Bey was sure to draw obvious comparisons to 2017, when Adele swept the top prizes at the glitzy music biz gala, shutting out Beyonces culture-shaking Lemonade. The Grammys winningest artist still remains on the outside looking in at the top prizes: Beyonce has never won Album or Record of the Year, which this time around went to Lizzo for About Damn Time. She only scored Song of the Year once, for 2008s Single Ladies. This year, folk, rock and blues singer Bonnie Raitt scooped up that honor. Beyonce was nevertheless the top winner on Sunday with her four gramophones. - Carlile, Lamar with three wins each - Both folk rocker Brandi Carlile and rapper Kendrick Lamar ended the night with three awards each. Adele, one of the nights heavyweights, took home just one award in the pop categories, while Taylor Swift was shut out once again from Song of the Year, a songwriting award. Swift did however win the Best Music Video prize for her short film based on the 10-minute version of her song All Too Well. Puerto Rican reggaeton megastar Bad Bunny kicked off the show by bringing the audience to its feet with the first performance, before taking home the prize for Best Musica Urbana Album. Bad Bunny, indisputably the worlds biggest commercial artist, nabbed the prize for his major drop Un Verano Sin Ti, which was also an Album of the Year contender. Thank you to all the Latinos across the entire world, he said in Spanish. We will keep elevating this genre to the next level. Actor Viola Davis became the latest showbiz heavyweight to earn a coveted EGOT -- winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony -- by taking the Grammy for best audio book, narration and storytelling for her memoir Finding Me. - Samara Joy wins for Best New Artist - The star-studded 65th annual gala, hosted once again by comedian Trevor Noah, also featured performances from Styles, Lizzo and Mary J. Blige, as well as an exuberant tribute to hip-hop music featuring a constellation of stars. After several Grammy years with clear Best New Artist favorites -- winners like Olivia Rodrigo, Megan Thee Stallion and Billie Eilish -- American jazz singer Samara Joy scooped up the prize over an eclectic field. The category has grown increasingly reflective of the internet ages impact on popular music, and many of the nominees -- including Brazils Anitta, Eurovision rockers Maneskin and rapper Latto -- have all found viral fame on TikTok. I cant even believe -- Ive been watching you all on TV for, like, so long, the Bronx-born artist told the audience, after earlier taking home the prize for Best Jazz Vocal Album. To be here by just being who I was born as, Im so thankful. Some of her competitors for Best New Artist still had a good night: Wet Leg swept the alternative music categories, Muni Long took home the award for Best RB Performance, and Molly Tuttle won for Best Bluegrass Album.

        "date": "February 6, 2023 05:30 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ambassador in Ankara says that all nine Sri Lankans believed to be in the earthquake-affected areas of Turkey are safe and that 08 of them have already been traced. The ninth person, who lives in a building that had collapsed in the quake, was not there when the incident occurred and has not been contacted as of yet, Ambassador Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake told Ada Derana. Our reports indicate that 09 Sri Lankans were in the areas where the earthquake occurred in Turkey. We attempted to reach all of them. We were able to contact some of the while some could not be reached directly. However, as of now we know that all nine of them are safe. We have received reports on eight of them while we were informed that the ninth person was living in one of the collapsed buildings. But later we came to know that that person was not in building at the time of its collapse, she said speaking to Ada Derana. The Ambassador stated that they are still unaware of the exact location of that person and that they are working on obtaining those details through the disaster management agency in that country. That is all the information we have for now, she said. On the current situation in that country, Dissanayake said that tremors are continuing to be felt in the aftermath of the major earthquake and that another 7.5 magnitude earthquake had occurred a short while ago, which was also slightly felt in the capital of Ankara. The Ambassador said that they are continuously working to gather more information regarding the Sri Lankan living in the surrounding areas as well. At least 1,400 people have been killed and thousands injured after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey and northern Syria early on Monday. The huge quake toppled buildings, triggering a frantic search for survivors. The epicentre was near the Turkish city of Gaziantep, a major Turkish provincial capital of more than two million people. A second earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hit central Turkey on Monday afternoon, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre and US Geological Survey. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "Second earthquake strikes Turkey as death toll nears 1,500",
        "date": "February 6, 2023 06:15 pm",
        "content": "A second powerful earthquake has rocked Turkey as the death toll from an earlier shock nears 1,500 across the transcontinental country and neighbouring Syria. The second quake hit central Turkey on Monday afternoon (9.24pm AEDT) at magnitude 7.5 and a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey. The centre of the tremor was about four kilometres out of Ekinözü to the north-east of the earlier earthquake. The damage and death toll from the latest tremor is unknown. Orhan Tatar, an official from the Turkish disaster agency, told reporters the two quakes were independent of each other. He said hundreds of aftershocks were expected after both. The second tremor was felt as far as the eastern Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus, where people took to social media to post footage of swaying curtains, while employees working in some high-rise buildings in the capital, Nicosia, quickly rushed outside. Earlier on Monday, a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria, toppling some 3000 buildings. Hundreds are still believed to be trapped under rubble, and the toll is expected to rise as rescue workers searched mounds of wreckage in cities and towns across the area. International emergency response underway Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said offers for help had been received from some 45 countries in the aftermath of the deadly earthquake, as the powerful aftershocks continued. In a televised address, Erdogan announced Turkeys death toll had reached 912, adding about 5400 people were injured, while about 2470 people were rescued from collapsed structures. Because the debris-removal efforts are continuing in many buildings in the earthquake zone, we do not know how high the number of dead and injured will rise, Erdogan said. Our hope is that we recover from this disaster with the least loss of life possible. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said members of the alliance were mobilising support to help Turkey deal with the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes. Stoltenberg expressed full solidarity with our ally Turkey in the aftermath of this terrible earthquake. In a tweet, Stoltenberg said he was in contact with Erdogan and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. Several NATO members have already said they are planning to send support to help victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. Russia says it is readying rescue teams to fly to Turkey and Syria. A minister of emergency situations, Aleksandr Kurenkov, said teams of 100 search and rescue personnel were on standby. Russian President Vladimir Putin also offered condolences in telegrams to the leaders of Syria and Turkey and expressed readiness to help. First deadly quake struck as people slept On both sides of the border, residents jolted out of sleep by the pre-dawn quake rushed outside on a cold, rainy and snowy winter night, as buildings were flattened and strong aftershocks continued. Rescue workers and residents in multiple cities searched for survivors, working through tangles of metal and giant piles of concrete. A hospital in Turkey collapsed and patients, including newborns, were evacuated from a handful of facilities in Syria. In the Turkish city of Adana, one resident said three buildings near his home collapsed. I dont have the strength anymore, one survivor could be heard calling out from beneath the rubble as rescue workers tried to reach him, said the resident, journalism student Muhammet Fatih Yavus. Farther east in Diyarbakir, cranes and rescue teams rushed people on stretchers out of a mountain of pancaked concrete floors that was once an apartment building. The quake, felt as far away as Cairo, was centered north of Gaziantep, a Turkish provincial capital. It struck a region that has been shaped on both sides of the border by more than a decade of civil war in Syria. On the Syrian side, the swath affected is divided between government-held territory and the countrys last opposition-held enclave, which is surrounded by Russian-backed government forces. Turkey, meanwhile, is home to millions of refugees from that conflict. The opposition-held regions in Syria are packed with some four million people displaced from other parts of the country by the fighting. Many of them live in buildings that are already wrecked from past bombardments. Hundreds of families remained trapped in rubble, the opposition emergency organisation, called the White Helmets, said in a statement. Strained health facilities and hospitals were quickly filled with wounded, rescue workers said. Others had to be emptied, including a maternity hospital, according to the SAMS medical organisation. We fear that the deaths are in the hundreds, Muheeb Qaddour, a doctor, said by phone from the town of Atmeh. Turkey sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. The US Geological Survey measured Mondays first quake at 7.8. At least 20 aftershocks followed, some hours later during daylight. Buildings were reported collapsed in a wide area extending from Syrias cities of Aleppo and Hama to Turkeys Diyarbakir, more than 330 kilometres to the northeast. Nearly 900 buildings were destroyed in Turkeys Gaziantep and Kahramanmaras provinces, said Vice President Fuat Oktay. A hospital collapsed in the Mediterranean coastal city of Iskanderoun, but casualties were not immediately known, he said. Unfortunately, at the same time, we are also struggling with extremely severe weather conditions, Oktay told reporters. Nearly 2,800 search and rescue teams have been deployed in the disaster-stricken areas, he said. We hope that we will get through this disaster together as soon as possible and with the least damage, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wrote on Twitter. Countries from Taiwan to Russia to Germany offered to send help, whether medical supplies, search teams or money. In Turkey, people trying to leave the quake-stricken regions caused traffic jams, hampering efforts of emergency teams trying to reach the affected areas. Authorities urged residents not to take to the roads. Mosques around the region were being opened up as a shelter for people unable to return to damaged homes amid temperatures that hovered around freezing. The quake heavily damaged Gazianteps most famed landmark, its historic castle perched atop a hill in the center of the city. Parts of the fortresses walls and watch towers were leveled and other parts heavily damaged, images from the city showed. In Diyarbakir, hundreds of rescue workers and civilians formed lines across a mountain of wreckage, passing down broken concrete pieces, household belongings and other debris as they searched for trapped survivors while excavators dug through the rubble below. In northwest Syria, the quake added new woes to the opposition-held enclave centered on the province of Idlib, which has been under siege for years, with frequent Russian and government airstrikes. The territory depends on a flow of aid from nearby Turkey for everything from food to medical supplies. The oppositions Syrian Civil Defense described the situation there as disastrous, adding that entire buildings have collapsed and people are trapped under the rubble. In the small Syrian rebel-held town of Azmarin in the mountains by the Turkish border, the bodies of several dead children, wrapped in blankets, were brought to a hospital. The USGS said the quake was centered about 33 kilometres from Gaziantep. It was 18 kilometres deep. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed to 326 people, with some 1,000 injured, according to the Health Ministry. In rebel-held areas, at least 150 people were killed, according to the White Helmets, though the SAMS medical organisation put the toll at 106; both said hundreds were hurt. In Damascus, buildings shook and many people went down to the streets in fear. The quake jolted residents in Lebanon from beds, shaking buildings for about 40 seconds. Many residents of Beirut left their homes and took to the streets or drove in their cars away from buildings, terrorised by memories of the 2020 port explosion that wrecked a large portion of the city. Huseyin Yayman, a legislator from Turkeys Hatay province, said several of his family members were trapped under the rubble of their collapsed homes. There are so many other people who are also trapped, he told HaberTurk television by telephone. There are so many buildings that have been damaged. People are on the streets. Its raining, its winter.

        "date": "February 6, 2023 09:59 pm",
        "content": "A powerful, 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked wide swaths of Turkey and neighbouring Syria on Monday, killing more than 2,300 people and injuring thousands more as it toppled hundreds of buildings and trapped residents under mounds of rubble or pancaked floors. Authorities feared the death toll would rise further as rescuers searched through tangles of metal and concrete for survivors in a region beset by more than a decade of Syrias civil war and a refugee crisis. Residents jolted out of sleep by the pre-dawn quake rushed outside in the rain and snow to escape falling debris, while those who were trapped cried for help. Major aftershocks, including one nearly as strong as the initial quake, continued to rattle the region. I dont have the strength any more, one survivor could be heard calling out from beneath the rubble in the Turkish city of Adana, as rescue workers tried to reach him, said a resident, journalism student Muhammet Fatih Yavuz. He said three buildings near his home were toppled. The quake, which was centred on Turkeys southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, sent residents of Damascus rushing into the street and was felt as far away as Cairo and Beirut. Because the debris removal efforts are continuing in many buildings in the earthquake zone, we do not know how high the number of dead and injured will rise, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. The quake piled more misery on a region that has seen tremendous suffering over the past decade. On the Syrian side, the area affected is divided between government-held territory and the countrys last opposition-held enclave, which is surrounded by Russian-backed government forces. Turkey, meanwhile, is home to millions of refugees from the civil war. In the rebel-held enclave, hundreds of families remained trapped in rubble, the opposition emergency organization, called the White Helmets, said in a statement.

Strained health facilities and hospitals quickly filled with injured, rescue workers said. Others had to be emptied, including a maternity hospital, according to the SAMS medical organization. The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. The U.S. Geological Survey measured Mondays pre-dawn quake at 7.8, with a depth of 18 kilometres (11 miles). Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude one struck more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) away. The second jolt in the afternoon caused a multistory apartment to topple face-forward onto the street in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa, smashing into rubble and raising a cloud of dust as bystanders screamed, according to video of the scene. Orhan Tatar, an official from Turkeys disaster management agency, said it was a new earthquake, but Yaareb Altaweel, a seismologist with the USGS, said it was considered an aftershock because it took place on the same fault line as the first. Thousands of buildings were reported collapsed in a wide area extending from Syrias cities of Aleppo and Hama to Turkeys Diyarbakir, more than 330 kilometres (200 miles) to the northeast. A hospital came down in the Mediterranean coastal city of Iskenderun, but casualties were not immediately known, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said. Such severe damage typically leads to a significant death toll, but bitterly cold temperatures could make matters even worse, reducing the timeframe that rescuers have to save trapped survivors, said Dr. Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University. He added that the difficulty of working in areas beset by civil war would only complicate rescue efforts. Televisions stations in Turkey aired screens split into four or five, showing live coverage from rescue efforts in the worst-hit provinces. In the city of Kahramanmaras, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble, and one could be seen lying on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Offers of help  from search-and-rescue teams to medical supplies and money  poured in from dozens of countries, as well as the European Union and NATO. The vast majority were for Turkey, with Russian and even an Israeli promise of help to the Syrian government, but it was not clear if any would go to the devastated rebel-held pocket in the northwest. In Turkey, people trying to leave the quake-stricken regions caused traffic jams, hampering efforts of emergency teams. Mosques around the region were opened to provide shelter for people unable to return to damaged homes amid temperatures that hovered around freezing. In Diyarbakir, hundreds of rescue workers and civilians formed lines across a mountain of wreckage, passing down broken concrete pieces, household belongings and other debris as they searched for trapped survivors while excavators dug through the rubble below. In northwest Syria, the quake added new woes to the opposition-held enclave centred on the province of Idlib, which has been under siege for years, with frequent Russian and government air strikes. The territory depends on a flow of aid from nearby Turkey for everything from food to medical supplies. The oppositions Syrian Civil Defense described the situation there as disastrous. At a hospital in Idlib, Osama Abdel Hamid said most of his neighbours died. He said their shared four-story building collapsed just as he, his wife and three children ran toward the exit. A wooden door fell on them and acted as a shield. God gave me a new lease on life, he said. In the small Syrian rebel-held town of Azmarin in the mountains by the Turkish border, the bodies of several dead children, wrapped in blankets, were brought to a hospital. The Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria said the earthquake has caused some damage to the Crusader-built Marqab, or Watchtower Castle, on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean. Part of a tower and parts of some walls collapsed. In Turkey, meanwhile, the quake damaged a historic castle perched atop a hill in the centre of the provincial capital of Gaziantep, about 33 kilometres (20 miles) from the epicentre. Parts of the fortresses walls and watch towers were levelled and other parts heavily damaged, images from the city showed. More than 1,500 people were killed in 10 Turkish provinces, with some 9,700 injured, according to Turkish authorities. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed to over 460 people, with some 1,300 injured, according to the Health Ministry. In the countrys rebel-held northwest, groups that operate there said the death toll was at least 380, with many hundreds injured. Huseyin Yayman, a legislator from Turkeys Hatay province, said several of his family members were stuck under the rubble of their collapsed homes. There are so many other people who are also trapped, he told HaberTurk television by telephone. There are so many buildings that have been damaged. People are on the streets. Its raining, its winter.

        "title": "Sri Lanka has initiated an action plan to ensure a Green Economy by 2050  President",
        "date": "February 6, 2023 10:54 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has the potential to establish the green economy, specially by way of renewable energy, said President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing a High-Level event on Strategies and Actions to Accelerate Sri Lankas Transition to a Green Growth Pathway. He said further that the Sri Lankan Government prepared a Natural Adaption Plan and National Environment Action Plan to ensure a green economy and a better world by 2050. The event, held at the Hilton Colombo this morning (06), was organized by the Ministry of Environment and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). A new Climate Change Act will be formulated while a new Environment Act will be drafted to replace the old one which will cover reforestation, forest cover and tree cover. He also added that Sri Lanka is to be the first one in the region to recognize some of its assets as living entities. The Knuckles Range, Horton Plains, Peak Wilderness, the Sinharaja Forest, the Mahaweli River and Adams Bridge will be hence identified as living entities. Former Secretary General of the UN and the President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) Ban Ki-moon addressing the gathering said that he learnt about those changes that took place during the last six and a half years since his last visit and added that he was confident that democracy and sustainable economic development in the country could be achieved under the wise leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Environment Minister Naseer Ahamed addressing the occasion explained in detail the steps that the government is planning to take in regard to a green economy and meeting the climate change targets for 2050. Secretary to the Ministry of Environment Dr Anil Jasinghe and Asia Regional Director and Head of Programs, GGGI Dr Achala Abeysinghe also addressed the event. The Panel Discussion included panelists Director (Climate Change) Ministry of Environment Ms. Kumudini Vidyalankara, Chief Executive Officer Dilmah Tea and chair of Biodiversity Sri Lanka Dilhan Fernando, Chief Executive Officer of the National Development Bank Dimantha Seneviratne, Senior Research Professional of the Center for Poverty Analysis Ms. Karin Fernando and Senior Professor of the University of Peradeniya Prof. Buddhi Marambe. Ambassador of Korea to Sri Lanka Santhush W. Jeong, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Rathnayake and, Senior Advisor to the President on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardena also participated in this event. The statement made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is as follows, The signing of the Host Country Agreement with the Global Green Growth Initiative tomorrow, will be the first steps that we will be taking to establish a green economy and meet climate change goals. I welcome the eighth Secretary General of the United Nations and the President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) Ban Ki-moon for the signing of the Host Country Agreement with the Global Green Growth Initiative. Hence, Ban Ki-Moon will be associated with two historic agreements signed in Sri Lanka in which the first paved the way for reconciliation. We are seriously concerned of the situation on climate change and the actions taken. What has happened so far is insufficient and the last conference of parties did not achieve the results that we desired. The low-income countries and the middle-income countries are striving for economic development while protecting living standards with insufficient funding. So, these countries are committed to a call for action by the developed countries to deliver their funding pledges by doubling their funding which is essential. I realize that some developed countries are experiencing a recession this year, but nevertheless the targets had not been met earlier. So there has to be a full commitment of how we are going to meet the targets and what assistance is required. The other issue is the need for compensation for the developing countries where the emissions so far were not the responsibility of our countries. The third issue is how to address the loss and damages. This is not the issue of asking the developed countries to spend a lot of money for further development of the developing countries. Let us work out a sort of list, combine the money that is needed and then see how we are going to raise it. There has to be a contribution by them, as well as a contribution by us. But lets agree on what we have to do. The fact is that the achievements of the last COP26 meeting had not been fulfilled so far, worries us. Glasgow was a good turning point. The initiative taken by former Prime Minister of the UK Boris Johnson was important, but it was not followed up. We must ensure that those targets are met. Therefore, the Government of Sri Lanka instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Environment to sound out other developing countries with whom they spoke last time on how a joint action plan could be made. Perhaps, a meeting of the heads of government, of the concerned countries could be convened in the UAE, prior to the next conference. That is the only way that we can achieve results and we must go hard on it as there is no halfway house. We have to insist that these are goals and these are our minimal demands. Its either the minimum demands or it is far better to call it a day if we are not going to achieve this result. Sri Lanka is in the process to decrease carbon emissions by 14.5 percent by 2030 and more thereafter. We are creating the Climate Change Office operating under the Presidential Secretariat to coordinate all actions in regard to climate change. Then we have prepared our natural adaption plan and their national environment Action Plan. All of this is being taken as the initiative by our government so that we ensure a green economy and a better world by 2050. We are developing the net zero 2050 plan that aims for carbon neutrality. We will not increase further energy capacity via coal power. We will phase out the fossil fuel subsidies. We are already doing that and we have come under attack from the Opposition for phasing it out. And we will aim for 70 per cent of renewable energy for power generation by 2030. There are many initiatives that we will be taking for this period. Firstly, a new Climate Change Act, which will incorporate the Climate Change Office, will be formulated. Then a new Environment Act will be formulated to replace the old one, which was enacted in the early 1980s, and one which will cover reforestation forest cover and tree cover. The last one is to recognize some of our assets as living entities. The Knuckles Range, Horton plains, peak wilderness, the Sinharaja Forest, the Mahaweli river and Adams Bridge will be identified as living entities and that will be the first in the region to do so. Final is the setting up of the International Climate Change University. We want to start it as a Postgraduate University and a university for training officials in all regions in the Indian Ocean, and in Africa to prepare the world for meeting the climate change goals and a new climate change and new green economy. Now we are grappling with the issue of a green economy. Thats where we want to go. We find that we have the potential, especially on renewable energy, with the help of the Asian Development Bank we are assessing what our capacity for renewable energy and green hydrogen would be. Some say we will have an excess capacity of about 30 Giga-watts, but, some say 40, some say 50. But we want to have the assessment made by the Asian Development Bank. So, we have already called for investment in this region. This is one area that we can prosper. With regard to our economic base, we are looking at the new technologies, which certainly will not be involved with fossil fuel and to have new manufacturing and service industries based on industry for technology to modernize agriculture. Accordingly, we will be moving towards the green economy. But we are going to face difficulties. One is the lack of capacity. And we also need great access to international financing. We will also be able to financially engineer the debt. By using the green financial instrument we could reduce the present debt load. Our domestic policy will be geared to our climate prosperity plan. So, this is the path that Sri Lanka wishes to follow, and I have no doubt that the GGGI will help us to achieve this. The agreement we will sign tomorrow will be the first in the steps that we will take. --PMD",

        "title": "Death toll in Turkey, Syria earthquake soars past 3,700 as survivors battle freezing temperatures",
        "date": "February 7, 2023 07:54 am",
        "content": "A huge earthquake killed more than 3,700 people across a swathe of Turkey and northwest Syria on Monday, with freezing winter weather adding to the plight of the thousands left injured or homeless and hampering efforts to find survivors. The magnitude 7.8 quake brought down whole apartment blocks in Turkish cities and piled more devastation on millions of Syrians displaced by years of war. It struck before sunrise in harsh weather and was followed in the early afternoon by another large quake. In Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey, a woman speaking next to the wreckage of the seven-story block where she lived said: We were shaken like a cradle. There were nine of us at home. Two sons of mine are still in the rubble, Im waiting for them. She was nursing a broken arm and had injuries to her face. It was like the apocalypse, said Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a Syrian in the northern town of Atareb. Its bitterly cold and theres heavy rain, and people need saving. The earthquake was the biggest recorded worldwide by the U.S. Geological Survey since a tremor in the remote South Atlantic in August 2021. In Turkey, the death toll stood at 2,316, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said, making it the countrys deadliest earthquake since a tremor of similar magnitude in 1999 devastated the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, killing more than 17,000. At least 1,444 people were killed in Syria in Mondays quake and about 3,500 injured, according to figures from the Damascus government and rescue workers in the northwestern region controlled by insurgents. Poor internet connections and damaged roads between some of the worst-hit cities in Turkeys south, homes to millions of people, hindered efforts to assess and address the impact. Temperatures in some areas were expected to fall to near freezing overnight, worsening conditions for people trapped under rubble or left homeless. Rain fell on Monday after snowstorms swept the country at the weekend. More than 13,000 people were injured in Turkey from the quake. In the Turkish city of Iskenderun, rescuers climbed an enormous pile of debris that was once part of a state hospitals intensive care unit in search of survivors. Health workers did what they could to tend to the new rush of injured patients. We have a patient who was taken into surgery but we dont know what happened, said Tulin, a woman in her 30s, standing outside the hospital, wiping away tears and praying. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, preparing for a tough election in May, called the quake a historic disaster and the worst earthquake to hit the country since 1939, but said authorities were doing all they could. Everyone is putting their heart and soul into efforts although the winter season, cold weather and the earthquake happening during the night makes things more difficult, he said. The second quake was big enough to bring down more buildings and, like the first, was felt across the region, endangering rescuers struggling to pull casualties from the rubble. In Syria, already wrecked by more than 11 years of civil war, the health ministry said 711 people had been killed. In the Syrian rebel-held northwest, emergency workers said 733 people had died. The United Nations says 4.1 million people, many of them displaced by the conflict and living in camps, depend already on cross-border humanitarian aid in northwest Syria and international support efforts are stretched and underfunded. Syrian communities are simultaneously hit with an ongoing cholera outbreak and harsh winter events including heavy rain and snow over the weekend, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. In the government-controlled city of Aleppo, footage on Twitter showed two neighboring buildings collapsing one after the other, filling streets with billowing dust. Two residents of the city, which has been heavily damaged in the war, said the buildings had fallen in the hours after the quake, which was felt as far away as Cyprus and Lebanon. In the Syrian government-held city of Hama, a Reuters journalist saw an apparently lifeless child carried from the ruins of a building. In the rebel-held town of Jandaris in Aleppo province, a mound of concrete, steel rods and bundles of clothes lay where a multi-story building once stood. There were 12 families under there. Not a single one came out. Not one, said a thin young man, his eyes wide open in shock and his hand bandaged. Raed al-Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets, a rescue service in rebel-held territory known for pulling people from the ruins of buildings destroyed by air strikes, said they were in a race against time to save the lives of those under the rubble. Syrian state television showed rescue teams searching for survivors in heavy rain and sleet. President Bashar al-Assad held an emergency Cabinet meeting to review the damage and discuss next steps, his office said. In the Turkish city of Diyarbakir, Reuters journalists saw dozens of rescue workers searching through a mound of debris, all that was left of a big building, and hauling off bits of wreckage as they looked for survivors. Occasionally they raised their hands and called for quiet, listening for sounds of life. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Monday about the earthquake, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. He made the call in the first instance to offer condolences and to make clear  that anything Turkey needed that we could provide, they should pick up the phone and let us know, Price said. Erdogan said 45 countries had offered to help the search and rescue efforts in Turkey. The earthquake also halted operations at Turkeys oil export hub in Ceyhan and stopped crude flows from Iraq and Azerbaijan. Turkeys lira hit a record low of 18.85 in early trade and the countrys stocks tumbled around 5, although both pared losses later with the currency ending the day flat and equity indexes closing 1.3-2.2 lower. In the Turkish city of Malatya, a rescue worker crawled into a collapsed building, trying to identify a survivor trapped under the wreckage, in footage released by the emergency agency. What color are you wearing? Are you wearing pink? Please take care of yourself for the moment, I cannot see anything else, the rescue worker could be heard saying. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 7, 2023 02:44 pm",
        "content": "The Presidential Secretariat has refuted what it termed false news circulated on social media regarding the expenses of the state ceremony organized for the 75th Independence Day. In a press release, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) dismissed the reports, stressing that the spread of misinformation is clearly another extension of the narrow political agenda that forced people to boycott the official state celebration of independence due to the economic crisis. The PMD states that the purpose of spreading such misinformation is to mislead the people and make them hate the government while creating unease to fulfil petty political interests. Further, attempts have been made to convince the people that even providing mobile toilet facilities during the Independence Day ceremony was a mistake, the PMDs statement continued. However, it should be emphasized that high-ranking foreign diplomats were invited to this celebration including the Japanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Takei Shunsuke, Bhutans Minister of Education and Skill Development Jai Bir Rai, Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdullah Shahid, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr A.K. Abdul Momen, Pakistans Minister of State for External Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, Foreign Minister of Nepal Dr Bimala Rai Paudyal and Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland. Further, around 3200 dignitaries including ambassadors, high commissioners of foreign countries, as well as 6670 armed forces personnel and the police attended the ceremony. Also, these mobile toilet facilities were provided for the personnel engaged in the pre-training for the Independence celebration. The PMD went on to note that in such a background, as a measure to provide proper health and safety measures for an event where thousands of people gather, it cannot be determined as an unnecessary expense for the provision of adequate mobile toilet facilities. Not paying adequate attention to such an essential aspect at an official state event where a large number of people gather is a disgrace to the country, the press release read further. Vehemently refusing the reports circulated in social media that Rs. 5.8 million had been freely spent for this event from the money allocated for education sector by the government, the PMD explained that allocating provisions for the official state ceremony of the National Independence Day celebration is also a common practice. It emphasized that the amount spent on the official state ceremony of the 75th National Independence Day celebration held this year was significantly lesser than the estimated sum. Accordingly, the government spent only Rs.11,130,011.29 on the 75th National Independence Day celebrations this year. The PMD also clarified that the government has spent significantly lesser on this years Independence Day celebration than on previous occasions. Holding such a state ceremony when the country is recovering from a severe economic crisis clearly shows that Sri Lanka is preparing to rise again, the PMD added, noting that it also sends a message to the rest of the world that the country has the courage to stand up again, and that it is ready to reclaim the pride of Sri Lanka that was shattered by the crisis. Therefore, the Presidents Office regretfully rejects the false propaganda that exploits a proud state event such as National Independence Day for narrow political purposes.",

        "content": "Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared seven days of national mourning, and Syria has appealed to the United Nations for help following devastating earthquakes that killed more than 5,000 people and toppled buildings across southeast Turkey and northern Syria. Authorities fear the death toll from Mondays predawn magnitude 7.8 temblor, followed by a magnitude 7.6 earthquake and several aftershocks will continue to climb as rescuers looked for survivors among tangles of metal and concrete spread across a region already suffering under Syrias 12-year civil war and a refugee crisis. Rescuers searched through the frigid night into Tuesday morning, hoping to dig more survivors out of the rubble as those trapped cried out for help from beneath mountains of debris. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Tuesday that the death toll from the earthquakes in Turkey had risen to 3,419. Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkeys Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), said earlier on Tuesday that 20,426 others were injured. Tatar said more than 5,700 buildings had also been destroyed. In Syria, at least 1,602 people were killed and about 3,500 others were injured, according to the Ministry of Health and the White Helmets rescue organisation. Freezing winter weather conditions and snowfall in the devastated region have added to the plight of many thousands of people left injured and homeless by the earthquake. Downed buildings and destroyed roads have hampered efforts to find survivors and get crucial aid into affected areas. Al Jazeeras Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said millions of people need help. And their need is even more acute because it is winter and they are facing cold temperatures, snow and rain. Ten cities in southern Turkey have been declared disaster areas, according to Al Jazeeras Natasha Ghoneim, reporting from Istanbul. Freezing temperatures and snow have hampered rescue efforts, and more bad weather is expected to hit the region. Electricity supplies and natural gas have been cut off in many areas and the government is working to restore both services. A full picture of the devastation is only starting to emerge  devastation that will likely become more evident as the sun rises on Tuesday, Ghoneim said. Seismic activity continued to rattle the region on Monday, including another jolt nearly as powerful as the initial earthquake. The US Geological Survey measured the initial earthquake at 7.8, with a depth of 18km (11 miles). Hours later, a 7.6 magnitude temblor also struck. The second jolt caused a multi-storey apartment building in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa to topple onto the street in a cloud of dust as bystanders screamed, according to video of the scene. Dramatic video footage aired on Turkish television showed buildings collapsing in real time. Visuals showed rescue workers pulling a child alive from a flattened building. The child was then reunited with distraught parents in snow-covered streets. More than 7,800 people have been rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkeys disaster management authority. Strained medical facilities have quickly filled with injured people, rescue workers said. The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria and southern Turkey, said in a statement that its facilities were overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways and called urgently for trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response to save lives and treat the injured. Governments and aid agencies have rushed to deploy personnel, funds and equipment to Turkey and Syria. Jordan is sending emergency aid to Syria and Turkey on the orders of King Abdullah II, while Egypt has pledged urgent humanitarian help to Turkey. Lebanons cash-strapped government is also sending Red Cross and Civil Defence first responders and firefighters to Turkey to help with its rescue efforts. The European Union has mobilised search and rescue teams, and the blocs Copernicus satellite system has been activated to provide emergency mapping services. At least 13 member countries have offered assistance. The United Kingdom and United States said they are also ready to send help to Syria, but Washington has ruled out dealing directly with the Syrian government. Germanys foreign ministry said it is coordinating its aid response with EU partners and readying deliveries of emergency generators, tents, blankets and water treatment equipment. The US is coordinating immediate assistance to NATO-member Turkey, including teams to support search and rescue efforts. In California, nearly 100 Los Angeles County firefighters and structural engineers, along with six specially trained dogs, were being sent to Turkey to help with rescue efforts. Russian rescue teams from the Emergencies Ministry are preparing to fly to Syria, where the Russian military deployed in that country already has sent 10 units comprising 300 people to help clear debris and search for survivors. The Russian military has set up points to distribute humanitarian assistance. Russia also has offered help to Turkey, which has been accepted. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

The case was taken up for the second day today before the three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe and Shiran Gunaratne. After the hearing of the facts presented before the court, the Supreme Court announced this decision. The HRCSL on January 30 had filed a case of Contempt of Court before the Supreme Court against the Secretary to the Ministry of Energy  Power, the Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The HRCSL said it has determined that the aforementioned parties have failed to abide by the settlement arrived at before the commission with regard to the continuous supply of power during the period pertaining to the Advanced Level Examination commencing from 23rd January to 17th February 2023. Issuing a statement, the commission stated that in the aforesaid circumstances in particular the Chairman of the Electricity Board is guilty of the offence of contempt under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. The Commission alleges that notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties to provide uninterrupted electricity for the AL students during the period of the examination, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) willfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts. However, the lawyers representing the Secretary of the Ministry of Energy, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) stated before the court that the Human Rights Commission has no legal authority to submit such a complaint.

The hearing was held before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, comprising of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Gamini Amarasekera and Arjuna Obeysekera. The relevant petitions were filed by the late Premachandras wife and daughter, Sumana and Hirunika Premachandra, respectively, and Ghazali Hussain, former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL). Appearing on behalf of former MP Hirunika, Presidents Counsel M. A. Sumanthiran revealed that then President Rajapaksa had not followed the proper legal procedures due when granting such a presidential pardon. Thus, Sumanthiran affirmed that the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to invalidate the pardon granted by the former President to Duminda Silva, on account of the fact the pardon granted was in violation of the Constitution. Subsequently, Attorney-at-Law Eraj Fernando, appearing on behalf of Sumana Premachandra, further provided evidence that although a report from the Attorney General is required for such a presidential pardon to be granted, the former Head of State had failed to obtain one. Accordingly, it was decided for the petitions to be heard again on 20, 23 and 28 March.",

        "content": "The Paris Club of creditor nations have provided the required financing assurances to support the International Monetary Funds (IMF) approval for the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The PMD reported that the Paris Club members expressed their commitment to negotiate debt restructuring with Sri Lanka in accordance with the comparability of treatment principle and with the goal of restoring debt sustainability. Saudi Arabia and India also expressed their support and commitment to providing financing assurances, it said. The Paris Club members urged other official bilateral creditors, including China, to do the same in line with the IMF program parameters, the PMD said. The assurances are crucial to finalise the 2.9 billion bailout from the IMF. Last week, Reuters, quoting unnamed sources, stated that the Paris Club of creditor nations is ready to provide financing assurances to Sri Lanka, a key step needed to unlock a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout. Sri Lanka entered into a staff level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last September, but needs financing assurances from key bilateral lenders before the funds executive board approves the programme. China and India, both not permanent Paris Club members, are top bilateral lenders to the crisis-hit country. India previously committed to help ease the debt burden of neighbour Sri Lanka as part of the IMF programme, while Chinas Eximbank offered a two-year moratorium in a letter sent to the island nation in January. While the IMF has not yet provided any guidance on where the lender stands regarding Chinas assurances to Sri Lanka, a U.S. official visiting Colombo said on Wednesday that Beijing has not done enough.

        "date": "February 8, 2023 07:43 am",
        "content": "Rescuers in Turkey and Syria battled bitter cold Tuesday in a race against time to find survivors under buildings flattened by an earthquake that killed more than 7,800 people. Tremors that inflicted more suffering on a border area, already plagued by conflict, left people on the streets burning debris to try to stay warm as international aid began to arrive. But some extraordinary survival tales have emerged, including a newborn baby pulled alive from rubble in Syria, still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother who died in Mondays quake. We heard a voice while we were digging, Khalil al-Suwadi, a relative, told AFP. We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord (intact) so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital. The infant is the sole survivor of her immediate family, the rest of whom were killed in the rebel-held town of Jindayris. The 7.8-magnitude quake struck Monday as people slept, flattening thousands of structures, trapping an unknown number of people and potentially impacting millions. Whole rows of buildings collapsed, leaving some of the heaviest devastation near the quakes epicentre between the Turkish cities of Gaziantep and Kahramanmaras. The destruction led to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declaring Tuesday a three-month state of emergency in 10 southeastern provinces. Children are freezing Dozens of nations including the United States, China and the Gulf States have pledged to help, and search teams as well as relief supplies have begun to arrive by air. Yet people in some of the hardest-hit areas said they felt they had been left to fend for themselves. I cant get my brother back from the ruins. I cant get my nephew back. Look around here. There is no state official here, for Gods sake, said Ali Sagiroglu in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras. For two days we havent seen the state around here... Children are freezing from the cold, he added. A winter storm has compounded the misery by rendering many roadssome of them damaged by the quakealmost impassable, resulting in traffic jams that stretch for kilometres in some regions. The cold rain and snow are a risk both for people forced from their homeswho took refuge in mosques, schools or even bus sheltersand survivors buried under debris. It is now a race against time, said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. We have activated the WHO network of emergency medical teams to provide essential health care for the injured and most vulnerable, he added. 23 million could be affected The latest toll showed 5,894 people killed in Turkey and at least 1,932 in Syria, for a combined total of 7,826 fatalities. There are fears that the toll will rise inexorably, with WHO officials estimating up to 20,000 may have died. WHO warned that up to 23 million people could be affected by the massive earthquake and urged nations to rush help to the disaster zone. The Syrian Red Crescent appealed to Western countries to lift sanctions and provide aid as President Bashar al-Assads government remains a pariah in the West, complicating international relief efforts. Washington and the European Commission said on Monday that humanitarian programmes supported by them were responding to the destruction in Syria. The UNs cultural agency UNESCO also said it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its World Heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage. In addition to the damage to Aleppos old city and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, UNESCO said at least three other World Heritage sites could be affected. Much of the quake-hit area of northern Syria has already been decimated by years of war and aerial bombardment by Syrian and Russian forces that destroyed homes, hospitals and clinics. Residents in the quake-devastated town of Jandairis in northern Syria used their bare hands and pickaxes to search for survivors. Hear their voices My whole family is under theremy sons, my daughter, my son-in-law... Theres no one else to get them out, said Ali Battal, his face streaked with blood and head swathed in a wool shawl against the bitter cold. I hear their voices. I know theyre alive but theres no one to rescue them, added the man in his 60s. The Syrian health ministry reported damage across the provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Tartus, where Russia is leasing a naval facility. Even before the tragedy, buildings in AleppoSyrias pre-war commercial huboften collapsed due to the dilapidated infrastructure. Following the earthquake, prisoners mutinied at a jail holding mostly Islamic State group members in northwestern Syria, with at least 20 escaping, a source at the facility told AFP. Turkey is in one of the worlds most active earthquake zones. The countrys last 7.8-magnitude tremor was in 1939, when 33,000 died in the eastern Erzincan province. The Turkish region of Duzce suffered a 7.4-magnitude earthquake in 1999, when more than 17,000 people died. Experts have long warned a large quake could devastate Istanbul, a megalopolis of 16 million people filled with rickety homes. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 09:39 am",
        "content": "A newborn girl has been saved by rescuers from beneath the rubble of a building in north-west Syria that was destroyed by an earthquake on Monday. Her mother went into labour soon after the disaster and gave birth before she died, a relative said. Her father, four siblings and an aunt were also killed. Dramatic footage showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris in Jindayris. A doctor at a hospital in nearby Afrin said she was now in a stable condition. The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border. The babys uncle, Khalil al-Suwadi, said relatives had rushed to the scene when they learned of the collapse. We heard a voice while we were digging, he told AFP news agency on Tuesday. We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord intact, so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital. Paediatrician Hani Maarouf said the baby had arrived at his hospital in a bad condition, with several bruises and lacerations over all her body. She also arrived with hypothermia because of the harsh cold. We had to warm her up and administer calcium, he added. She was photographed lying in an incubator and connected to a drip, as a joint funeral was held for her mother Afraa, father Abdullah and her four siblings. They are among 1,800 people known to have been killed by the earthquake in Syria, according to the Damascus-based government and the White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders operate in opposition-held areas. Another 4,500 people have been killed in Turkey, where the epicentre was. The White Helmets have so far reported 1,020 deaths, but they have warned that figure is expected to rise dramatically. Time is running out. Hundreds still trapped under the rubble. Every second could mean saving a life, they tweeted on Tuesday. We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and international bodies to provide material support and assistance to organisations responding to this disaster. The UN has vowed to use any and all means possible to get aid to people in the north-west, but it has said that deliveries have been halted temporarily due to damaged roads and other logistical issues. It has also urged governments not to politicise aid delivery when so many are in desperate need. A UN Security Council agreement authorises the use of just one border crossing for deliveries from Turkey into the north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of cross-line aid. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people in the north-west - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian aid to survive. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 10:10 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe began delivering the Government Policy Statement a short while ago (08 Feb.). Delivering the policy statement, Wickremesinghe stated that the children and youth are the future generation of our country. He noted, therefore, that it is the Governments responsibility to create a better future for the youth who wish to rebuild the nation, as opposed to seeking for better opportunities in foreign countries. Speaking on the recent tax revisions, the President said the following, Introducing new tax policies is a politically unpopular decision. Im not here to be popular. I want to rebuild this nation from the crisis it is facing. Im ready to make unpopular decisions for the sake of the nation. People will realize the importance of these decisions in two or three years. Moreover, Wickremesinghe also commented on the support extended by Sri Lankas migrant workers to the countrys recovery from the ongoing crisis. Migrant workers have been extremely supportive of the motherland at this critical juncture. By the end of 2022, their remittance reached USD 4 billion in foreign exchange, he said in this regard, adding that entrepreneurs and migrant workers made this commitment in the context of political parties and groups influencing them on diverse fronts. He further noted that the Government has envisioned bringing new laws regarding the implementation of powers of the Provincial Council in the fields of education and health, after it has been alleged that owing to certain practices of the Central Government, the powers of Provincial Councils have been reduced in these fields. The Head of State arrived in Parliament earlier this morning, for the inauguration of the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament, which took place at 10:00 a.m. Following the deliverance of the policy statement, the Parliament will be adjourned until 09:30 a.m. tomorrow (09 Feb.). Attached is the full speech delivered by the President; The moment the school children sang the National Anthem and Jayamangala Gatha during the last Independence Day Celebration, I was convinced of the need to secure their future. Are these children confident of their future? Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland who visited Sri Lanka for the Independence Day Celebration, had discussions with groups of youth in our country. They had pointed out that their confidence of the future has been eroded due to the developments over a long period of time. Do they have full confidence on their future? The day after Independence Day, a special supplementary was published in the Sunday Times newspaper, where some youth had expressed their opinions regarding the present situation in our country. Mathisha Udawatta says, While leaving the country is a constant resonating thought, there is still a smallest spark inside me thats holding me close to home. I intend not to let it die. I have not given up on my Sri Lanka yet. Clifford Fernando has the idea that, I wont migrate, but I sincerely hope there will be a change in the situation in Sri Lanka. All our attitudes need to change, better discipline is needed, people need to obey rules and show more empathy towards each other. Cilani Wijesinghe says, I dont want to leave my country  I wish to help it come out of the situation it is in, currently. I also dont want the people leaving at a time the country needs them the most, only to come back when things are better. While reading these comments, I was reminded of the twins who came to meet me recently in Anuradhapura. These girls met me at the end of the ceremony of awarding credentials to Atamasthanadhipathi, Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Thero. Namadi and Chenuti Perera are studying in Year 5, at Maliadeva Balaka Vidyalaya, Kurunegala. The rendition of their song I will not leave the country was presented to me in a CD. I request the television channels to broadcast that song after my speech today. These children and youth are the future generation of our country, who wish to rebuild the nation, without leaving. It is our responsibility to create a country where they can live freely. Therefore, this is your responsibility, the Honorable Members of the House. This is also the responsibility of every Sri Lankan. I believe everyone remembers the situation the country was in when I addressed the opening of the previous Session of the Parliament. You may recall the countrys situation when the last budget was presented and also seven to eight months ago. Schools closed. Examinations could not be held. Agriculture and plantation industries collapsed without fertilizer. Farmers were helpless. The tourism industry declined. Power cuts of ten to twelve hours imposed. Gas almost over. Residents of urban houses lost being unable to cook. People had to waste days in queues for kerosene, petrol and diesel. Lives were sacrificed by citizens who were exhausted staying in queues. Unable to bear this pressure, people took to the streets in protest. However, the situation is different at present. Due to the measures taken, we have been successful in reducing this burden gradually. Now there is stability in the economy. People are comfortable. We have been able to safely guide Mother Sri Lanka a long way across a challenging course. It was not an easy journey. However, it is not yet over. We committed to securing the financial system that was on the verge of collapse. Government expenditure was controlled. Measures were taken to increase tax revenue. We know that tax revenues decreased due to decisions taken in the past. As at 31st December 2019, 1.6 million businesses, companies and individuals paid taxes. However, by December 2021, the number of tax payers decreased to five hundred thousand. Government tax revenues fell to an all-time low. Realizing the destruction this caused to the economy of the country, many institutions and organizations requested to revert to the tax system which existed in 2019. In April 2022, the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SASA) presented short-term proposals for economic and social revival. Section 3.3 of said proposal states,  Re-introduction of PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) tax system  All officers of state enterprises should personally pay taxes from their salary and not through the relevant institutions and employers  Re-introduction of Withholding Tax  Suspension of all tax exemptions  Revision of the income slabs for taxation and the level of turnover subject to Value-Added Tax The SASA presented this proposal even before the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund were initiated. Presently these are the suggestions we have implemented. However, it is the same people who requested such tax policies, who are criticizing the present tax regime. Introducing new tax policies is a politically unpopular decision. Remember, Im not here to be popular. I want to rebuild this nation from the crisis situation it has fallen. Yes, Im ready to make unpopular decisions for the sake of the nation. People will realize the importance of those decisions in two to three years. Some people say that the primary taxable income should be raised from 100,000 to 200,000 rupees. Others say that the PAYE tax method should be abolished. We did not impose these taxes willingly. However, just doing what we like will not build the nation. Even reluctantly, the right policy should be implemented. If PAYE tax is abolished, the country will lose 100 billion rupees. If the tax limit is raised to two hundred thousand rupees, the economy will lose 63 billion rupees. The total amount that will be lost is 163 billion rupees. We are presently not in a position to lose this income. Due to the present economic crisis, the tax burden is more strongly felt. There is an important fact to be considered. At present, most of the taxes are paid by the general public. Since taxes from individuals and institutions directly liable for taxes are not being properly collected, all Sri Lankans pay huge sums of money as indirect taxes. A large number of people who are not liable to pay taxes, pays it by default. These taxes are called indirect taxes. In other countries, most of the taxes are collected from on a higher income bracket. In 2021, in India  50 direct tax, and indirect 50. Bangladesh  direct tax 32, and indirect 68. Nepal  direct 31 and indirect tax, 69. Indonesia  direct tax 40, and indirect 60. Vietnam  direct tax 31 with indirect being 69. Thailand, direct taxes 37, and indirect 63. Malaysia, direct tax 66 and indirect 34. However, the situation in our country is different. In 2021, our direct tax was 21 while indirect was 79. Therefore, we should take action to rectify this tax divergence. Then the tax burden on the general public will be reduced. Inflation rises during an economic crisis. The price of goods increase. Employment is at risk. Businesses collapse. Taxes increase. It is difficult for all sections of the society to survive. However, if we endure this hardship for another five to six months, we can reach a solution. If we continue in this manner, we will be able to give an additional allowance to public servants in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and give concessions to the private sector. The public would become prosperous, with income sources being increased. The interest rate can be reduced. In another three years, the present income can be increased by 75 per cent. Despite difficulties, we have taken measures to protect the vulnerable groups suffering due to the economic crisis. This has been fully supported by the World Bank. However, the welfare system in our country is distorted. Even those with higher incomes are subsidized. We are taking measures to change this situation. Those in absolute poverty are identified. A program is being prepared to finance them directly through a welfare bank account. However, some groups are trying to disrupt this process. They uphold the reduction of taxes, raise wages etc. if they come to power, and attempting to organize various activities to sabotage the present process. I never promise what cannot be delivered, and never lie in seeking power. I am currently implementing all the pledges in the budget speech and the last opening session of the Parliament. Through this, we have been able to create some stability in the economy. It is clear to many that the future cannot be built on falsehood. We are now moving from a negative economy towards a positive one. By the end of 2023, we can achieve economic growth. When I first addressed this Parliament as the President, the inflation of the country was 70 percent. Due to the measures we have implemented, it was reduced to 54 percent in January 2023. We will strive to make it a single digit by the end of 2023. By the end of 2022, we were able to increase the export income to USD 13 billion. Local entrepreneurs worked hard towards making this possible. Also, we were able to limit the cost of imports to a level of USD 18 billion. Migrant workers have been extremely supportive to the motherland at this critical juncture. By the end of 2022, their remittance reached USD 4 billion in foreign exchange. Our entrepreneurs and migrant workers made this commitment in the context of political parties and groups influencing them on diverse fronts. They have proven that they increase export revenues and remit money to Sri Lanka not according to the political party in power, but for the sake of the country. All of them deserve our respect. We have now been able to increase the foreign reserves which had fallen to zero up to USD 500 million. We were able to revive the tourism sector. Tourists visited Sri Lanka even in the midst of political street protests. Sri Lanka was designated among the top 10 tourist destinations in the world. The number of tourists who visited Sri Lanka in the month of January is over one hundred thousand, which is a record. We are making progress in all sectors, in this manner. Some time ago, Greece was in a serious economic crisis similar to that of Sri Lanka, and declared bankruptcy. To overcome this crisis, the salaries of public servants were reduced by 50 percent. It took them 13 years to emerge from bankruptcy and repay their debts. During that period, they received aid from the IMF three times. However, if we continue according to this plan, we can rise out of bankruptcy by 2026. As I have been continuously appealing, if all the parties in this Parliament join the process to build the country, we would be able to extricate from this crisis even earlier. We left the IMF in 2020. That short-sighted decision has also affected the current situation. Bangladesh was able to obtain IMF assistance early, as they had continued to be in that process. We had to initiate the process from the beginning. However, amidst all the difficulties, we started this journey. Now we are negotiating debt restructuring with our creditors. The only other way is to get support from the International Monetary Fund, which could be progressed based on negotiations. We have no other way but this process. I request the political parties criticizing our course of action, to please present their alternative solution to this House. We have now reached the final stage of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. We were able to reach a basic agreement last September and now there is the debt sustainability program. In this context, we also discussed with the Paris Club. We have continued negotiations with India and China, which are not members of the Paris Club. India has agreed to debt restructuring and has extended financial assurance. On the one hand, the Paris Club and India are continuing discussions. We are in direct discussions with China. We have received positive responses from all parties. We are now working towards unifying the approaches of other countries and that of China. I express our gratitude to all the countries that support us in this effort. The Paris Club announced yesterday that they will extend unstinted support for the Agreement with the IMF and debt restructuring. With that announcement, we receive the Paris Club endorsement. They took this decision after a round of discussions with their member countries, and in addition India as well as the World Bank and the IMF. This decision, for us is a great strength and courage, for which I am grateful. The international support demonstrates that we are on the right path. This is reconfirmed by the pressure on the public becoming less than before. The tourism sector is reviving. The collapsed agriculture and plantation sector is recovering. It is predicted that the harvest will increase in the Maha Season. Financial provisions have been allocated to purchase these crops. A plan has been implemented to process paddy to rice worth 20 billion rupees with its distribution free of charge to low-income families, with 10 kilos of rice being given twice a month. Power cuts have now reduced. School activities are returning to normal. Children have commenced undertaking educational trips. Exams are being conducted. Continue on this path and build the country, or destroy this path and ruin the country with sloganeering politics? The decision is before us. We know that the decision of the majority of people who love the country and do not have narrow political agendas, is to continue in this manner. Sri Lankas economy today is severely damaged. Its malaise needs to be immediately diagnosed and treated accordingly. However, people are pointing to the mistakes made by those in-charge and are urging them to be punished first. However, I try to cure the malady first, after which we can take further measures. We should prioritize curing the ailment, which is what I am doing. However, as soon as this critical condition is addressed, we will take another step to eliminate the recurrence of such a crisis. For this purpose, we are introducing an Anti-Corruption Bill. We are taking steps to include the Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative (StAR) into this Bill, together with the World Bank and the United Nations. By obtaining the agreement of the IMF, we will be able to stabilize the economy. However, we have more steps to take in moving forward. With the certification by the IMF, we would be able to receive loan assistance from other international financial institutions such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank etc. Accordingly, the confidence of investors will also be established. Therefore, there will be a tendency for foreign exchange to flow into the country. We should use such financial aid for the development of the country through efficient management. Together with this, we can get a significant growth in the tourism industry. A number of development projects that have been halted can also be resumed. Also, the economic reforms required for our country should be implemented. We neglected economic reforms for the sake of narrow political agendas. The burden of loss-making government institutions was borne by the people. Last year, the loss of state-owned enterprises was approximately 800 billion rupees. The people have been bearing all that loss for many years. However, they do not realize this situation. They bear the burden of these loss-making government institutions. Even the most destitute have to bear the cost of maintaining these institutions. Therefore, we should immediately carry out economic reforms. Countries like Thailand and Vietnam that have taken such steps are moving forward day by day. Otherwise it would retard our economic development. We need to accurately identify the role of the government in these reforms. The strategy of the government should be to guide the private sector in business activities, while being in the background. Government should intervene only in areas such as monitoring functions, public facilities and maintenance of law and order. The private sector should be used as the driving force of the economy. Also, private entrepreneurship should be utilized to strengthen foreign economic relations. There are many instances where state sector land and buildings are wasted without being used for any productive purpose. We expect to use them productively. There are a number of fertile lands owned by government institutions, which have become forest land. There are thousands of acres of abandoned paddy lands. We are working towards utilizing all that effectively for agriculture. Also, projects based on credit will be implemented in the future only based on an evaluation process. It is imperative to stop the practice of directing public investment for political reasons. In the past, the banking system has been weakened since these institutions have given grace periods for the recovery of loans. Now that the grace period is over, the banks are re-vitalizing. At the same time, our attention has been focused on businesses that have collapsed due to difficulties. With the growth of the economy, we are taking measures to provide them with the necessary facilities to rebuild. We expect to use technology to the maximum for increasing production, providing goods and services, industrial and agricultural modernization etc. Currently, the revenue of the country is 8.15 percent of the GDP. It is our expectation to increase this to 15 percent. An international organization with experience in solving financial crises made the following statement about our country, Sri Lanka has a reputation for kicking the can down the road  this leads to problems avoided rather than solved in the long term. We avoided problems and did not seek long-term solutions. We are all presently experiencing the result of that behaviour. Remember that currently, we are facing an economic crisis which is more decisive than the past conflict in the North and East. Though ethnic groups were divided during that conflict, all Sri Lankans have to cooperate in this current struggle. If we ignore the problems without a solution, we will lose overcoming this economic catastrophe, and therefore will be dependent economically. Therefore, it is our responsibility to bear the hardships and provide the necessary support to win this economic crisis. Surviving the economic extremity to create a developed economy in our country, would culminate in ensuring peace and harmony among the communities in our nation. Both Hon. R. Sambandan and I were elected to Parliament in 1977. We both have a common dream, which is to provide a sustainable solution to the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka while we are both in Parliament. Ever since, we have been discussing that dream and have been making efforts towards its achievement. All previous attempts have failed, but, we wish to succeed this time. We expect your support to this end. The conflict in the North and East affected the entire nation and many areas were severely damaged. The Northern Province entirely and several areas in the Eastern and North Central Provinces suffered immensely from the war. We are taking steps to put more weight on the development of these areas. A general plan is being implemented in this regard. We know that there are still unresolved issues related to land in the North. In the Jaffna district, there are 3300 acres of state land including security camps. The extent of 100 acres that had been taken over for the Palali Camp were recently released. A decision has to be made regarding more land to be released for which discussions are being held with the Army and other parties. Discussions have also been initiated regarding the lands around other security camps. Not only in the North and East, but also in the other provinces of the country, there is a serious problem regarding the availability of land. Forest lands were determined through a Gazette notification 12 years ago. A t that time it was based on GPS maps. Due to the conflict and other reasons, many village lands were gazetted as forests. Now the conflict is over. Due to the reason of lands owned by the people being gazetted as forests, there has been a great injustice to the community. People from Monaragala to Jaffna are facing this problem. We will take steps to correct this injustice through re-gazetting the forests and lands according to the 1985 map. We are streamlining and expediting the process of tracing missing persons. The mechanism of the Office on Missing Persons will be strengthened. Our attention has also been focused on the people who have been imprisoned for being involved in terrorist activities. They have been imprisoned for many years without trial. We are taking measures to systematically release these prisoners. Drafts are being prepared to establish a National Land Council and a National Land Policy. It is alleged that due to certain practices of the Central Government, the powers of the Provincial Councils have been reduced in the fields of education and health. Therefore, we envision bringing new laws regarding the implementation of powers of the Provincial Councils in these fields. Amendment will be introduced to the following Acts in order to regularize and streamline the delegation process. The Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act, No. 58 of 1992, the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989 and Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 28 of 1990. We expect to establish a modern system for the District Development Councils to streamline the coordination functions between the Provincial Councils and the Central Government. We will present all these Ordinances and Bills to the National Council of the Parliament. The responsibility of making the final decision is assigned to the National Council. DIG divisional boundaries are currently not based on provincial boundaries. Due to this, a number of practical difficulties have arisen. Therefore, we expect to determine the boundaries of DIG divisions according to the provinces. There is no change in police powers. The report of the Presidential Commission headed by Mr. A. H. M. D. Nawaz, Supreme Court Judge to investigate the violation of human rights, serious violations of international human rights laws, has now been received. Its recommendations are currently being studied. A separate plan is being implemented for the development of the North, which was the most damaged due to the conflict. Malwatu Oya development project will be commenced. Necessary measures will be taken for the river and water management in the Eastern Province, restoration of Vadamarachchi lake and lagoon, and accordingly, which will provide water for drinking and agricultural purposes. The electricity requirement in these areas is expected to be generated through renewable energy. Solar and green hydrogen power are also used for this purpose. More opportunities will be created in the tourism sector. Investment zones will be established. The required technology and facilities will be provided for the modernization of agriculture. The Kankasanthurai Port is being modernized and expanded. Trincomalee is being developed as a modern international city. A special development plan is also being launched for the Eastern and North-Central provinces that have suffered economic and social setbacks during the conflict. Special attention is being paid to the Upcountry Tamil community, who were first brought to Sri Lanka 200 years ago, to develop plantation industry in Sri Lanka. Mr. Soumyamurthy Thondaman, who rendered yeoman service towards the plantation sector and I were in the Cabinet of Ministers together. Both of us worked together for the welfare of the plantation community. We have already granted all their legal rights. However, many problems related to economic and social rights still remain. To solve these problems, we expect to discuss with the MPs representing the plantation sector and take necessary measures. The Plantation community, which has been struggling to feed the Sri Lankan economy for two centuries, should be integrated as a whole in the Sri Lankan community. When I was elected to the Parliament, my Cabinet Minister was Mr. A. C. S. Hamid who made me aware of the unique situations faced by Sri Lankan Muslims. We know that the Muslim community faces various problems from time to time and they have our full support. The Sinhalese community is also facing issues of their own which require open discussion. We expect to recognize the communities that are marginalized in society especially due to caste discrimination. Considering all the facts, we expect to devolve power within a Unitary State. However, I wish to reiterate a fact has been emphasized on many occasions. There will be no division of the country. I dont have a political group in this Parliament. The Party I represent has only one MP. However, as the President, I do not represent that Party. I represent the entire nation. Therefore, I do not engage in party politics. I will implement all these proposals through the National Assembly of the Parliament. In addition, we regulate the Jana Sabha Act for the function of representing public opinion. As I have emphasized many times before, the time has come to think anew and embark on a journey accordingly. The traditional politics that we have followed so far is no longer valid. Deceptions made with lies and illusions for political gains are not suitable for the future. Some political parties that discuss about system change propose to change others instead of themselves. This is also a part of traditional politics. If we come, we will change, thats what they say. We are staying out of line, and trying to change others. Those who make their lives at risk for Independent Commissions, say no to them in the face of power. Those who rejected the Executive Presidential System discuss the manner in which those powers would be used when they are elected. They change the policies for power. These are issues we have experienced from the past to date. I suggest that we should change this situation. Otherwise, none of us can make a change in the system. Change should begin from within ourselves. We all should change and that too should be for the betterment. As politicians we should change for the better. Political parties, the parliament, the executive, the judiciary and the public service should change for the better. For this change, we have already established the Parliamentary Oversight Committee System. However, youth representatives have not still been appointed to these Committees. I request this Parliament to implement this system at the earliest. It is your responsibility in this House to get the maximum benefit from the Parliamentary Oversight Committees. We will not stop there. Steps are being taken to make all the MPs active stakeholders in the governance. For this purpose,  A Parliamentary Budget Office will be established as a fully independent entity.  At present, the rules and regulations regarding the conduct of MPs are insufficient. A Conduct of MPs and Parliamentary Standards Act will be drafted, following the example of countries such as the United Kingdom.  We have practically recognized that the Preferential Voting system is corrupt. Therefore, the entire nation strongly feels the necessity for a new electoral system. We are working to appoint a Selective Committee on the Election system after discussing this with the Party Leaders. I believe that intellectuals, youth and women should be given adequate space in the envisaged new electoral system. We should pay close attention to the political parties currently operating in Sri Lanka. Rather than political parties, political alliances created to win elections are represented in the current Parliament. Most of these political parties have been sold for cash. The party and the logo are being sold, as on the pavement in Pettah. Some get sold. Cases have been filed before the court regarding the ownership of parties. I will act to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into the Political Parties of Sri Lanka and submit a report regarding the methodology which they should implement. This Commission is entrusted with the responsibility of looking into matters such as party registration, transparent functioning, membership rights, obtaining funds and income, expenditure on election campaigns, use of mass media, etc. In this regard, it is expected to be based on the Political Parties Act of Kenya, Germany and Norway, the European Public Accountability Methodology (EuroPAM), the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act of the United Kingdom. In order for a better future, new institutions, rules and programs are being introduced. We are establishing a new Institute of History, Institute of Economics and Trade, and an Institute for Women and Gender. Also, four new universities are being established, namely, the University of Government and Public Policy, University of Agro-Technology, University of Climate Change and the University of Sports. Steps are also being taken to introduce new rules and Ordinances.  National Commission on Womens Act  Gender Equality Act  Womens Empowerment Act  Child Safety Act  Youth Parliament Control Act  Narcotics Command Headquarters Act  Truth and the Reconciliation Commission  Prevention of Terrorism and National Security Act  The Public Performance Board Ordinance currently in force will be repealed. An Art Classification Act will be prepared based on the right of expression in the Constitution. Our country is located in the climate change zone. Therefore, we should pay special attention to climate change. If we act according to proper practice in that regard, we will also have the space to get green provisions. Taking all of them into consideration, we are taking steps to introduce these Ordinances.  Climate Change Act  Social Justice Commission Act  Reforestation and Tree Cover Act  Living Entity Act  Mahaweli Ganga, Sinharajaya, Sripada Adaviya and Peak wilderness, Horton Plains, Knuckles, Adams Bridge will be covered under this Act.  Law for Ocean Resources Exploration and Management  Muthurajawela Conservation Act New ordinances are being introduced for the economy. Zero Budgeting will be introduced for public expenditure management.  Revenue Authority Act  National Debt Management Act  Food Security Act  Public Property Management Act  Economic Stabilization Act  National Pension Contribution Act  New Excise Act  Amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act  Bankruptcy Act  Foreign Trade and Investment Act  Digital Technology Act  Department of Cinnamon Development Act  Divorce by Mutual Consent Act In order to succeed in such economic, social and political reforms, it is essential to make the community aware, based on accurate facts. The main role of making the society aware belongs to the media. Journalists should be given national and international level training in that regard. In 1993, as the Prime Minister, I appointed a Committee with Dr. Gamini Corea as the Chairperson, in order to obtain recommendations for the establishment of a Media Training Institute. Although the Cabinet approved the establishment of this institution, it was not implemented due to the 1994 General Election. Therefore, we urge to establish a system of institutions ranging from an institute of journalism to a university for journalists, in order to receive international-level training. But, looking closely at the past decades, the question arises whether the role of the media has been properly fulfilled. Therefore, our country needs media reforms. We have to consider both traditional media and social media. That is the reason for preparing a national policy on mass media. Im of the view that it is important for the government and the media industry to take care of a collective self-regulation system. In cyberspace, we are experiencing not only fake news, hate speech, misinformation, child and women harassment, fraud and corruption. We believe that a transparent regulatory system that includes social media network companies is required in this regard. An important point that we need to focus on is to reach an agreement on policies. A stable National Policy which will prevail irrespective if the change of government or Ministers is required. Every developed country in the world has progressed through a series of stable policies which are periodically updated. This is just the beginning of a system change. We need to make more changes. We expect to implement those changes according to the views of the Sri Lankan community, especially the youth. Therefore, I request all of you to submit proposals on the policies and practices that we should follow in the next 25 years. I am making that request not only from you in this House, but also from all Sri Lankans. Submit your ideas whether you are in Sri Lanka or abroad. Join this collective exercise of rebuilding the nation. Many people in this country do not understand the length  extent  depth of the crisis that the country is currently passing through. Since we have never faced such a dangerous and serious crisis in our lifetime, I re-emphasize that we all should come together to get rid of this crisis. Religious leaders, political parties, trade unions, academics, non-governmental organizations etc. should unite. This unity should commit to implementing one policy with one objective within a certain period of time. A social convention should be established. We all have to change our lifestyles for the sake of the nation. All the groups mentioned earlier are currently making commitments, bearing the weight. Therefore, after we uplift the economy, all the benefits should be distributed among the citizens, who should be part of economic development. We expect to establish the Social Justice Commission to implement this social consensus. The new policy framework for the next 25 years will be created based on this social consensus. Finally, I can recall one more aspect. Lets understand the difference between State and Government. We are all bound to protect the State of Sri Lanka. Any citizen has the opportunity to democratically change Governments through the elections. However, no one has the right to create anarchy in Sri Lanka. Not any political party. Not any group. We cannot allow our motherland to become an economic or social colony. Anarchy cannot be allowed. No one who truly loves the nation will allow such a situation. We all should stand on the side that supports the nation and not that which is bent to destroy the country. Earlier, we paid attention to some comments made by a few youths in the Sunday Times newspaper, last Sunday. Before concluding my speech, I would like to draw your attention to another observation made by Mr. Clifford Fernando. I hope the political leaders will get their act together  they have failed miserably. A leader should have the ability to lead by example if they expect people to follow. Sri Lankans are very resilient and will buckle up and do what it takes to come out of the present crisis. If the leaders could act wisely, use some common sense and put their words into action, we will be able to manoeuvre through these challenging times. It is the responsibility of this House to meet the expectations of these children and youth who have aspirations for the country and are determined not to leave. It is the duty of this House to make them inherit a free tomorrow and a free nation. Are you ready for this challenge? Lets not be prisoners of the past, but think about the future. Lets unite consensually and move forward democratically to support the recovery of the nation from the current crisis. If anyone wishes to have a political agenda, lets consider it after we rescue the nation. Lord Buddha said, Be a lamp unto yourself. Following that erudite advice, lets be lamps unto ourselves. Only then can the country be bright. Thank you",

        "title": "President confident Sri Lanka can emerge from bankruptcy by 2026",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 10:58 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering the governments policy statement in parliament today, said he is ready to make politically unpopular decisions, such as introducing new tax policies, to put the country back on track. I am not here to be popular. I am ready to make unpopular decisions for the sake of the country. People will realize the importance of these decisions in two to three years. The Head of State, who arrived in Parliament earlier this morning, inaugurated the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament at 10:00 a.m. After he delivered the governments policy statement, the parliament was adjourned until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow (Feb. 09). Mentioning that due to the excessive tax reliefs granted in late 2019, tax revenue dropped drastically, the President pointed out that those who issued a clarion call for tax policy revision are now taking issue with it. As at December 31, 2019, a total of 1.6 million businesses, companies, and individuals were paying taxes. But the number of tax payers dropped to 500,000 by December 2021 leading to a decline in the government tax revenue to an all-time low. Some people are urging the government to increase the income tax threshold from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 200,000, while some want the PAYE tax abolished, the President continued, explaining that the country will incur a loss of Rs. 100 billion if the PAYE tax is scrapped. If the income tax threshold is brought down to Rs. 200,000, the economy will lose Rs. 63 billion. The country cannot afford to lose income tax revenue to the tune of Rs. 163 billion, he added. In his policy statement, the President highlighted the importance of taking necessary action to rectify the tax divergence noting that in comparison to the other countries in the world, Sri Lankas direct taxes are low. All Sri Lankans pay huge sums of money as indirect taxes. In other countries, most of the taxes are collected from a higher income bracket ... The situation in our country is different. In 2021, our direct tax was 21 while indirect was 79. We should take action to rectify this tax divergence. President Wickremesinghe also appreciated the migrant workers for being extremely supportive of the motherland at this critical juncture. By the end of 2022, workers remittances reached USD 4 billion in foreign exchange. Entrepreneurs and migrant workers made this commitment in the context of political parties and groups influencing them on diverse fronts, proving that they increase export revenues and remit money to Sri Lanka not because of a political party in power but for the sake of the country, the President said further. All of them deserve our respect. He said the government envisions bringing new laws pertaining to the implementation of powers of Provincial Councils in the fields of education and health as it is alleged that due to certain practices of the Central Government, the powers of the Provincial Councils have been reduced in these two sectors. Despite being challenged with difficulties, the Head of State said the government has taken measures to protect the vulnerable groups suffering due to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, preparations are afoot to implement a program to finance them directly through a welfare bank account. The welfare system in our country is distorted. Even those with higher incomes are subsidized. We are taking measures to change this situation, President said further, pledging to identify those in absolute poverty and to finance them through a welfare bank account. President Wickremesinghe, who noted that he would never promise what cannot be delivered, said he is currently implementing all the pledges given in his budget speech, adding that Sri Lanka is now moving from a negative economy towards a positive one. It is clear to many that the future cannot be built on falsehood. He also expressed confidence that by the end of 2023, Sri Lanka can achieve economic growth, stating that the country is now moving from a negative economy towards a positive one. The Head of State, who is hopeful that Sri Lanka can rise out of bankruptcy by 2026, said the country would be able to extricate from this crisis even earlier if all the parties in the parliament join the rebuilding process. Speaking on the governments efforts to revive tourism sector hit hard by the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, Covid-19 pandemic outbreak and the economic crisis, President Wickremesinghe said tourist arrivals saw a record high in January this year even in the midst of street protests. He also mentioned that Sri Lanka managed to rank among the top 10 tourist destinations in the world despite the ongoing crisis situation. With regard to the IMF bailout plan of USD 2.9 billion for Sri Lanka, the President said the government has reached the final stage of negotiations with the global lender. Speaking on the financial assurances from Sri Lankas creditors, he mentioned the positive affirmations received from China, India and Paris Club to restructure the islands debt. President Wickremesinghe went on to assure that the government is taking steps to put more weight on developing the North and the East, adding that a general plan is being implemented in this regard. A separate plan is being implemented for the development of the North, which was the most damaged due to the conflict. Malwatu Oya development project will be commenced. Necessary measures will be taken for the river and water management in the Eastern Province, restoration of Vadamarachchi lake and lagoon, and accordingly, which will provide water for drinking and agricultural purposes. The electricity requirement in these areas is expected to be generated through renewable energy. Solar and green hydrogen power are also used for this purpose. He also stated that special attention is being paid to the Upcountry Tamil community, who were first brought to Sri Lanka 200 years ago, to develop plantation industry in Sri Lanka. While reiterating that there will be no division of the country, the President noted that the government expects to devolve power within a Unitary State. I dont have a political group in this Parliament. The Party I represent has only one MP. However, as the President, I do not represent that Party. I represent the entire nation. Therefore, I do not engage in party politics. He vowed to take steps to streamline and expedite the process of tracing missing persons, adding that the mechanism of the Office on Missing Persons would be strengthened. The attention of the government has also been focused on the people who have been imprisoned for being involved in terrorist activities, President said further in his policy statement. They have been imprisoned for many years without trial. We are taking measures to systematically release these prisoners. Recalling the peak of the crisis situation last year during which severe shortages of essential items, long queues for domestic gas and fuel and daily power cuts of more than 10 hours were experienced, the President said the pressure people felt back then is now eased as a result of the measures taken in the recent past. Noting that the countrys economic stability has been restored to a certain extent, he said, however, this journey, which is yet to come to an end, has not been easy. President Wickremesinghe reiterated that the government has been able to safely guide the country a long way across a challenging course. While urging everyone to keep working to steer the country towards a brighter future, President Wickremesinghe underscored that it is the responsibility of every citizen to build a country where the children can live freely.",

        "title": "In State of the Union speech, Biden challenges Republicans on debt and economy",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 12:00 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden challenged Republicans to lift the U.S. debt ceiling and support tax policies that were friendlier to middle class Americans on Tuesday in a State of the Union speech that served as a blueprint for his 2024 re-election campaign. Assailing oil companies for making high profits and corporate America for taking advantage of consumers, Biden used his prime time speech to outline key progressive priorities that are important to Democrats and anathema to many Republicans in Congress. Making his first address to a joint session of Congress since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in January, Biden urged bitterly divided lawmakers to overcome their differences. Some Republicans heckled him at times during a speech that lasted 73 minutes. Were often told that Democrats and Republicans cant work together. But over the past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong, said Biden, a Democrat. To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we cant work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. Biden tested that ability with a challenge to raise the 31.4 trillion debt ceiling, which must be lifted in the coming months to avoid a default. The White House has said Biden will not negotiate over that necessity; Republicans want spending cuts in exchange for their support. Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage - I get it - unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans ... want Medicare and Social Security to sunset, he said, drawing boos. He then urged lawmakers to stand up for senior citizens, which they did, prompting Biden to claim victory. I enjoy conversion, he quipped, suggesting the cuts to popular social safety net programs were now off the table. Biden said the economy was benefiting from 12 million new jobs, COVID-19 no longer controls American lives, and U.S. democracy remains intact despite the facing its biggest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken, he said. Since his inauguration in 2021, shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden has said he wants to unify the country. And he stuck to that theme, highlighting a massive infrastructure bill and gently ribbing Republican lawmakers who opposed it. I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law, he said. My Republican friends who voted against it ... I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but dont worry, I promised Id be a president for all Americans. POLL PROBLEMS Despite his efforts, Biden remains unpopular. His public approval rating edged one percentage point higher to 41 in a ReutersIpsos opinion poll that closed on Sunday. That is close to the lowest level of his presidency, with 65 of Americans saying they believe the country is on the wrong track, compared to 58 a year earlier. Similarly, in the autumn of 2020, when Donald Trump was president, 65 of registered voters believed the country was on the wrong track, according to ReutersIpsos polling. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who once served as press secretary for Trump, rejected Bidens upbeat vision of the country in her Republican response. In the radical lefts America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire. But you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race, Sanders said in excerpts released ahead of her televised remarks. Biden aides see the speech, which will draw millions of viewers and perhaps the presidents largest television audience of the year, as a milestone ahead of the second presidential campaign he is expected to launch in coming weeks. Biden turned 80 in November and, if re-elected, would be 82 at the start of a second term, a fact that concerns many Democratic voters, recent polls show. DIVIDED REPUBLICANS Biden faced a splintered gathering of Republican lawmakers, eager to put their conservative mark on U.S. policy following four years of Democratic control of the House. Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, sat behind Biden for the address for the first time. Mr. Speaker, I dont want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you, Biden said, drawing laughs. Before Bidens arrival, McCarthy and Vice President Kamala Harris smiled and chatted from the dais. McCarthy said earlier on Tuesday that he would not rip up Bidens speech, referencing the actions of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi after Trumps 2020 State of the Union address. I respect the other side, McCarthy said in a video. I can disagree on policy. But I want to make sure this country is stronger, economically sound, energy independent, secure and accountable. Some House Republican lawmakers have questioned Bidens victory in the 2020 presidential race against Trump, vowing to investigate his Cabinet and family. ECONOMIC PROGRESS Biden hailed the resilience and strength of the U.S. economy, with unemployment having dropped to a nearly 54-year low in January. In a foreshadowing of themes he may use in a presidential campaign, Biden hammered corporations for profiteering from the pandemic, and run through a wish list of economic proposals, although many are unlikely to be passed by Congress. They include a minimum tax for billionaires, and a quadrupling of the tax on corporate stock buybacks. Biden was especially critical of oil companies profits. I think its outrageous, he said. He said the United States would need oil for at least another decade, drawing laughter from some in the chamber. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Rahul Gandhi questions Adanis rise under Modi",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 01:40 pm",
        "content": "From displaying photographs of Narendra Modi and Gautam Adani together to claim their proximity to listing out business deals the Adani Group has got since 2014, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today led the Opposition attack over the Adani-Hindenburg issue accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government of pulling strings in his favour. While his 53-minute speech in Lok Sabha was largely uninterrupted except for some interjections by Treasury benches, it set off a political firestorm with the BJP later recounting the scandals that rocked the UPA government and linking some to the Gandhi family. Treasury benches repeatedly asked Gandhi to authenticate his claims, saying that such allegations cannot be levelled against the Prime Minister without documentary evidence to which Gandhi claimed he would do so. Accusing the Modi government of flouting rules to facilitate the meteoric rise of the businessman since 2014 riding on an alleged nexus between Adani and the political establishment, Gandhi wrapped up his speech with pointed questions for Modi. How many times did you (PM) travel together with Adani on foreign trips? How many times did Adani join you later on a visit? How many times did Adani travel to a country immediately after you did? How many of these countries after you visited Adani got a contractAlso, an important question is how much money has Adani given to the BJP in the last 20 years through electoral bonds, Gandhi said. Fresh from his 4000-km Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Jammu and Kashmir, Gandhi used the Parliament stage to ratchet up his suit boot ki sarkar and hum do, hamare do (Adani-Ambani) rhetoric to flag what he calls the BJP regimes crony capitalism. Today, his fusillades focus was Adani suggesting that the Congress plans to go all out against the Government on this in the run-up to the 2024 general elections. Incidentally, in the run-up to 2019, Gandhi had linked the PM to Anil Ambani in the Rafale fighter jet deal but his chowkidaar chor hai campaign against the Prime Minister failed to resonate with voters. This time, he began by invoking the yatra as the place he heard from the unseen and unheard. Recounting conversations with farmers, tribals and the youth around issues like unemployment, price rise, MSP and the Agniveer, Gandhi said these found no mention in the Presidents address. He claimed senior officers told him the Agniveer scheme was not conceived by the Army, it came from the Home Ministry, RSS they told me (National Security Advisor) Ajit Doval thrust this scheme on the Army. The Adani theme, too, he said, found an echo in the yatra. From Tamil Nadu to Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesheverywhere we heard one name, Adani.Everywhere Adani, Adani, AdaniPeople asked me how it is possible that Adani tastes success in whichever sector he enters, he never fails. And they asked how Adani is entering every sector, he used to be in one or two sectors now he is eight-ten sectors: airports, data centers, cement, solar energy, wind energy, aerospace and defence, consumer finance, renewables, media, ports, they asked how Adanis net worth rose from 8 billion dollars to 140 billion dollars from 2014 to 2022, he said. How to use government power to build individual businesses should be a case study in business schools, he addedand Modi should be given a gold medal in this. Adani, Gandhi said, was ranked 609 in the list of richest people in 2014. I dont know what magiche has reached No. 2 nowso people asked how has he become successful, how he has entered so many businesses and, most importantly, what is his relationship with Indias Prime Minister, he said and displayed photographs of Prime Minister sitting with Adani in an aircraft and boarding a plane with an Adani logo. The relationship began many years ago when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and when most of Indias business was asking questions of the Prime Minister, was against the Prime Ministerone man stood shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister. That is commendable, he was loyal to the Prime Minister and he helped Modi construct the idea of a resurgent Gujaratthe result of that was tremendous growth of his business in Gujarat, expansion of his businesses, he said. Gandhi said the real magic started after Modi moved to Delhi in 2014. There was a rule that anybody who does not have prior experience in airports cannot be involved in development of airports. The Government changed this ruleand Adani was given six airports. After that Indias most strategic airport, profitable airport Mumbai airport was taken away from GVKhijacked by using agencies. By pressurising the GVK using CBI and EDthe Government gave that airport to Adani, he alleged. He said 24 per cent of the air traffic and 31 per cent of the freight traffic is handled by airports operated by Adani group. The Indian government and the Prime Minister facilitated this, he charged. Similarly, in the defence sector, Gandhi said, the Adani group had no experience but makes drones in collaboration with an Israel firm. Adani has never done this before, HAL and other companies in India had been doing this but the Prime Minister visits Israel and immediately after that Adani gets the contract, Gandhi said. He alleged the Adani groups defence companies are involved in making small arms which include Tavor which is used by our special forces, Galil sniper rifle. He attributed this to the PMs visit to Israel after which 90 percent of the India-Israel weapons business goes to Adani after one visit. Referring to the controversy surrounding Adanis coal mining in Australia, Gandhi said: The Prime Minister goes to Australia and by magic SBI gives a 1 bn loan to Adani. The Prime Minister goes to Bangladesh, his first trip, decides to sell electricity to Bangladesh and after some days Bangladesh Power Development Board signs a 25-year contract with Adani. Gandhi also flagged the allegations regarding award of a project to Adani in Sri Lanka in June 2022. The Chairman of the Sri Lankas Electricity Board informed a Parliamentary committee in an open hearing that he was told by then President (Gotabaya) Rajapaksa that Prime Minister Modi pressured him to give the wind power project directly to Adani.So this is your foreign policythis is not Indias foreign policy.. This is a foreign policy to build Adanis businesses, Gandhi said. Referring to the exposure of LIC and public sector banks to the Adani group, Gandhi said the Hindenburg report had spoken about shell companies in Mauritius. He said that given Adanis sprawling network across strategic sectors, its opacity was an issue of national interest. Why (has) the government not (raised) questions on these shell companies? Who are these people, whose money is it? He said Adani had announced last year that he would invest  50 billion to build the worlds largest green hydrogen ecosystem. And in this budget, Nirmala Sitharaman announces huge incentives for green hydrogenRs 19,700 crore which means it will be given to Adani, he claimed. - The Indian Express - Agencies",

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will make his first visit to the United Kingdom on Wednesday since the Russian invasion of his country, Downing Street said. The surprise trip will see Zelensky meet Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, visit Ukrainian troops being trained by British forces, and address Parliament. Zelenskys visit to London is only his second outside his country since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago, following his visit to Washington DC in December. The trip comes as Zelensky has been desperately seeking military aid from Western allies as Ukrainian officials warn Moscow is gearing up for a spring offensive. Sunak on Wednesday announced that his country will expand training to Ukrainian fighter pilots and marines, while also promising a long-term investment in Ukraines military. The two leaders will discuss a two-pronged approach to UK support for Ukraine, Downing Street said. This will start with an immediate surge of military equipment to the country to help counter a possible Russian spring offensive, and reinforced by long-term support. Sunak said: President Zelenskys visit to the UK is a testament to his countrys courage, determination and fight, and a testament to the unbreakable friendship between our two countries. Since 2014, the UK has provided vital training to Ukrainian forces, allowing them to defend their country, protect their sovereignty and fight for their territory. I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future. - CNN - Agencies",

        "content": "New Zealand authorities have recovered 3.2 tonnes of cocaine, worth more than 300 million, found floating in the Pacific Ocean and believed to be bound for Australia. Police said the haul of 81 bales, which was drifting hundreds of kilometres northwest of New Zealand, was recovered in a joint operation with the New Zealand Customs Service and Defence Force acting on intelligence from the Five Eyes alliance, which also includes Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealands agencies by some margin, said Commissioner of New Zealand Police Andrew Coster. Officials believe the drugs were dropped at a floating transit point in the Pacific Ocean where they would have been picked up and taken to Australia. We believe it was destined for Australia, where it would have been enough to service the market for one year, Coster said. It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years. A police photo showed the massive haul was bound by netting and covered in yellow floats. Some of the bales had a Batman symbol on them, with the packages of cocaine inside labelled with what appeared to be a print of a four-leaf clover. Coster described the bust as a huge result for police in both New Zealand and Australia. There is no doubt this discovery lands a major financial blow right from the South American producers through to the distributors of this product, he added. Officials said it was too early to say where the drugs came from. - Al Jazeera - Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 03:41 pm",
        "content": "Canadian police confirmed Tuesday they are pursuing a criminal case against a former Dances With Wolves actor who was arrested last week and charged in Nevada with sexually abusing and trafficking Indigenous women and girls. Nathan Chasing Horse, who also goes by Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, was taken into custody Jan. 31 near the North Las Vegas home he shares with his five wives. He has been charged with eight felonies in Nevada, including sexual assault, sex trafficking and child abuse. Authorities have said the crimes date to the early 2000s and span multiple states, including South Dakota, Montana and Nevada, where Chasing Horse has lived for a decade. Prior to his arrest, the 46-year-old had been the focus of a monthslong probe by Las Vegas police prompted by a tip last October from Canadian law enforcement, who had identified Chasing Horse as a suspect in a 2018 rape in the British Columbia village of Keremeos, near the Washington state border. Sgt. Kris Clark of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed Tuesday in an email to The Associated Press that Chasing Horse has been charged with one count of sexual assault in connection with the 2018 crime. He said an arrest warrant for Chasing Horse in Canada was issued two days after his arrest in Nevada, but declined to release further details. California attorney Alexandra Kazarian, who has been retained by Chasing Horse to replace his public defender, did not immediately respond Tuesday to email and phone requests for comment regarding the new case in Canada. Chasing Horses previous public defender, Michael Wilfong, has not commented on any of the allegations. As the number of criminal cases against Chasing Horse grows, his estranged daughter spoke Tuesday in support of the victims. In a statement, Quannah Chasinghorse, a model who has appeared on the covers of Vogue Mexico and Vogue Japan, distanced herself from her father, saying shes had minimal contact with him and was raised by her mother and stepfather, who died in 2017. I stand with the victims of Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, she said. I honor the immense courage it takes for survivors to tell their stories, especially publicly. Chasing Horse played the role of Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costners 1990 Oscar-winning film. Since then, he has built a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as as a self-proclaimed medicine man. Las Vegas police said Chasing Horse abused that position, describing him in their search warrant as the leader of a cult known as The Circle who took underage wives over two decades. He also was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, in 2015 following similar allegations. Chasing Horse remains held without bail at a jail in downtown Las Vegas. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, when a judge is expected to address his custody status after hearing testimony from investigators, victims and Chasing Horses relatives.

        "title": "Death toll from Turkey-Syria earthquakes nearing 10,000",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 03:46 pm",
        "content": "Families in southern Turkey and Syria spent a second night in the freezing cold on Wednesday as overwhelmed rescuers raced to pull people from the rubble two days after a massive earthquake that killed more than 9,600 people. In Turkey, dozens of bodies, some covered in blankets and sheets and others in body bags, were lined up on the ground outside a hospital in Hatay province. Many in the disaster zone had slept in their cars or in the streets under blankets, fearful of going back into buildings shaken by the 7.8 magnitude tremor - already Turkeys deadliest since 1999 - that hit in the early hours of Monday. Rescuers there and in neighbouring Syria warned that the death toll would keep rising as some survivors said help had yet to arrive. Where are the tents, where are food trucks? said Melek, 64, in the southern Turkish city of Antakya, adding that she had not seen any rescue teams. We havent seen any food distribution here, unlike previous disasters in our country. We survived the earthquake, but we will die here due to hunger or cold here. With the scale of the disaster becoming ever more apparent, the death toll rose above 7,100 in Turkey. In Syria, already devastated by 11 years of war, the confirmed toll climbed to more than 2,500 overnight, according to the Syrian government and a rescue service operating in the rebel-held northwest. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. But residents in several damaged Turkish cities have voiced anger and despair at what they said was a slow and inadequate response by the authorities. Erdogan, facing a close-fought election in May, is expected to visit some of the affected areas on Wednesday. The initial quake, followed hours later by a second one almost as powerful, struck just after 4 a.m. on Monday, giving the sleeping population little chance to react. It toppled thousands of buildings including hospitals, schools and apartment blocks, injured tens of thousands, and left countless people homeless in Turkey and northern Syria. Turkish authorities say some 13.5 million people were affected in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east - broader than the distance between Boston and Philadelphia, or Amsterdam and Paris. In Syria, it killed people as far south as Hama, some 100km from the epicentre. Turkeys disaster management agency said the number of injured was above 38,000. UNDER THE RUBBLE In the town of Jandaris in northern Syria, rescue workers and residents said dozens of buildings had collapsed. Standing around the wreckage of what had been a 32-apartment building, relatives of people who had lived there said they had seen no one removed alive. A lack of heavy equipment to remove large concrete slabs was impeding rescue efforts. Rescue workers have struggled to reach some of the worst-hit areas, held back by destroyed roads, poor weather and a lack of resources and heavy equipment. Some areas are without fuel and electricity. Aid officials voiced particular concern about the situation in Syria, where humanitarian needs were already greater than at any point since the eruption of a conflict that has partitioned the nation and is complicating relief efforts. The head of the World Health Organization has said the rescue efforts face a race against time, with the chances of finding survivors alive slipping away with every minute and hour. In Syria, a rescue service operating in the insurgent-held northwest said the number of dead had climbed to more than 1,280 and more than 2,600 were injured. The number is expected to rise significantly due to the presence of hundreds of families under the rubble, more than 50 hours after the earthquake, the rescue service said on Twitter. Overnight, the Syrian health minister said the number of dead in government-held areas rose to 1,250, the state-run al-Ikhbariya news outlet reported on its Telegram feed. The number of wounded was 2,054, he said. Turkeys deadliest earthquake in a generation has handed Erdogan a huge rescue and reconstruction challenge, which will overshadow the run-up to the May elections already set to be the toughest of his two decades in power. The vote, too close to call according to polls before the quake, will determine how Turkey is governed, where its economy is headed and what role the regional power and NATO member may play to ease conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.

        "title": "Microsoft bakes ChatGPT-like tech into search engine Bing",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 03:48 pm",
        "content": "Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsofts second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool thats awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology. Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Think of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview. A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge. For now, everyone can try a limited number of queries, he said. The strengthening partnership with OpenAI has been years in the making, starting with a 1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the development of a powerful supercomputer specifically built to train the San Francisco startups AI models. While its not always factual or logical, ChatGPTs mastery of language and grammar comes from having ingested a huge trove of digitized books, Wikipedia entries, instruction manuals, newspapers and other online writings. Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday that new AI advances are going to reshape every software category we know, including search, much like earlier innovations in personal computers and cloud computing. He said it is important to develop AI with human preferences and societal norms and youre not going to do that in a lab. You have to do that out in the world. The shift to making search engines more conversational  able to confidently answer questions rather than offering links to other websites  could change the advertising-fueled search business, but also poses risks if the AI systems dont get their facts right. Their opaqueness also makes it hard to source back to the original human-made images and texts theyve effectively memorized, though the new Bing includes annotations that reference the source data. Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible, is a message that appears at the bottom of the preview version of Bings new homepage. Make sure to check the facts. As an example of how it works, Mehdi asked the new Bing to compare the most influential Mexican painters and it provided typical search results, but also, on the right side of the page, compiled a fact box summarizing details about Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Jose Clemente Orozco. In another example, he quizzed it on 1990s-era rap, showing its ability to distinguish between the song Jump by Kris Kross and Jump Around by House of Pain. And he used it to show how it could plan a vacation or help with shopping. Gartner analyst Jason Wong said new technological advancements will mitigate what led to Microsofts disastrous 2016 launch of the experimental chatbot Tay, which users trained to spout racist and sexist remarks. But Wong said reputational risks will still be at the forefront for Microsoft if Bing produces answers with low accuracy or so-called AI hallucinations that mix and conflate data. Google has been cautious about such moves. But in response to pressure over ChatGPTs popularity, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday announced a new conversational service named Bard that will be available exclusively to a group of trusted testers before being widely released later this year. Wong said Google was caught off-guard with the success of ChatGPT but still has the advantage over Microsoft in consumer-facing technology, while Microsoft has the edge in selling its products to businesses. Chinese tech giant Baidu also this week announced a similar search chatbot coming later this year, according to Chinese media. Other tech rivals such as Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have been researching similar technology, but Microsofts latest moves aim to position it at the center of the ChatGPT zeitgeist. Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products like email and spreadsheets. The most surprising might be the integration with Bing, which is the second-place search engine in many markets but has never come close to challenging Googles dominant position. Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsofts earlier search engines and was run for a time by Nadella, years before he took over as CEO. Its significance was boosted when Yahoo and Microsoft signed a deal for Bing to power Yahoos search engine, giving Microsoft access to Yahoos greater search share. Similar deals infused Bing into the search features for devices made by other companies, though users wouldnt necessarily know that Microsoft was powering their searches. By making it a destination for ChatGPT-like conversations, Microsoft could invite more users to give Bing a try, though the new version so far is limited to desktops and doesnt yet have an interface for smartphones  where most people now access the internet. On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. Appearing at Microsofts event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the the new Bing experience looks fantastic and is based in part on learnings from its GPT line of large language models. He said a key reason for his startups Microsoft partnership is to help get OpenAI technology into the hands of millions of people. OpenAI has long voiced an ambitious vision for safely guiding whats known as AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a not-yet-realized concept that harkens back to ideas from science fiction about human-like machines. OpenAIs website describes AGI as highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. OpenAI started out as a nonprofit research laboratory when it launched in December 2015 with backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. That changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT model for generating human-like paragraphs of readable text. OpenAIs other products include the image-generator DALL-E, first released in 2021, the computer programming assistant Codex and the speech recognition tool Whisper.

The order was issued by Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola. Accordingly, the decision on whether notices will be issued pertaining to the hearing of the relevant writ application, and whether an interim order will be issued preventing the imposition of power cuts during the period in which the exam will be held, as requested in the writ, will be announced on 10 February. Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, President Counsel (PC) Neil Unambuwa highlighted that the imposing of scheduled power cuts during the period in which the exam is held has a grave impact on those students facing the exam, causing them a great inconvenience, adding that the PUCSL acted cautiously, taking these factors into account. However, Romesh de Silva PC, appearing on behalf of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), countered this claim, stating that despite the fact that PUCSL had filed a petition against the imposing of power cuts during this years examination, they had approved power cuts lasting six hours during last years national exams. Meanwhile, Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC, appearing on behalf of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), who was also named as a respondent, stated that CPC is unable to comply with PUCSLs request owing to the ongoing economic crisis. He added that CPC is currently facing a severe financial crisis after decades of providing fuel to the public at non-competitive, subsidized prices.",

        "content": "Radella Shortcut Road has been reopened for vehicles weighing below 5 tons after it was closed for traffic following a deadly multiple-vehicle crash that claimed the lives of seven people and injured a further 53. According to Nanu Oya Police, permission was granted by Road Development Authoritys Executive Engineer in charge of Nuwara Eliya district. On January 20, seven people in total including two children died in a fatal motor accident caused by the careless driving of a bus driver transporting a group of students returning from a school trip to Nuwara Eliya. The accident took place as the bus in question fell down a 100-foot precipice along the Radella Shortcut Road after colliding with a van and a three-wheeler. All six individuals, including its driver, and the driver of the three-wheeler were reported to have died on the spot while 53 passengers in the bus which mostly comprised of students of Thurstan College in Colombo. In the aftermath of the fatal accident, heavy vehicles were temporarily barred from travelling on the Radella Shortcut Road, on the instructions of the Nuwara Eliya District Secretary. Accordingly, all heavy vehicles were required to use the Radella-Kirimetiya road instead. However, the Hatton-Nuwara Eliya luxury bus owners raised concerns about the loss they incur and the issues faced by public servants at offices in Nuwara Eliya and Hatton areas who are unable to report to work on time whenever this longer route is used instead of the shortcut road. Taking the request into consideration, the RDAs Executive Engineer in Nuwara Eliya permitted vehicles weighing below 5 tons to use the shortcut road from today. Meanwhile, police officers have been deployed to ensure that vehicles weighing above 5 tons continue to use the Radella-Kirimetiya road, as they are yet to be given permission to use the Radella Shortcut Road.",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 05:46 pm",
        "content": "With hope fading to find survivors, stretched rescue teams toiled through the night in Turkey and Syria, searching for signs of life in the rubble of thousands of buildings toppled by a catastrophic earthquake. The death toll rose Wednesday to more than 11,000 in the deadliest quake worldwide in more than a decade. Amid calls for the Turkish government to send more help to the disaster zone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan toured a tent city in Kahramanmaras where people forced from their homes are living. He conceded shortfalls early on in the response but vowed that no one would be left in the streets. Search teams from more than two dozen countries have joined tens of thousands of local emergency personnel, and aid pledges have poured in from around the world. But the scale of destruction from the 7.8 magnitude quake and its powerful aftershocks was so immense  and spread so wide, including in areas isolated by Syrias ongoing civil war  that many are still waiting for help. In the Turkish city of Malatya, bodies were placed side by side on the ground, covered in blankets, while rescuers waited for funeral vehicles to pick them up, according to former journalist Ozel Pikal who saw eight bodies pulled from the ruins of building. Pikal, who took part in the rescue efforts, said he believes at least some of the victims may have frozen to death as temperatures dipped to minus 6 degrees Celsius (21 Fahrenheit). Today isnt a pleasant day, because as of today there is no hope left in Malatya, Pikal told the AP by telephone. No one is coming out alive from the rubble. Pikal said a hotel building collapsed in the city, and more than a hundred people may be trapped. There was a shortage of rescuers in the area he was in, and the cold hampered rescue efforts by volunteers and government teams, he said. Road closures and damage in the region have also impeded mobility and access. Our hands cannot pick up anything because of the cold, said Pikal. Work machines are needed. The scale of suffering was staggering in a region already beset by more than a decade of civil war in Syria that has displaced millions within the country and sent more to seek refuge in Turkey. With thousands of buildings toppled, it was not clear how many people might still be trapped underneath the rubble. Turkeys disaster management agency said the countrys death toll passed 8,500. The Syrian Health Ministry said the death toll in government-held areas has climbed past 1,200, while at least 1,400 people have died in the rebel-held northwest, according to volunteer first responders known as the White Helmets. That brought the overall total to 11,000 since Mondays earthquake and multiple strong aftershocks. Tens of thousands more are injured. A 2011 earthquake near Japan that triggered a tsunami left nearly 20,000 people dead. Neither Turkey nor Syria provided figures for the number of people still missing as Pope Francis asked during his weekly general audience for prayers and demonstrations of solidarity following the devastating earthquake. Syrian officials said the bodies of more than 100 Syrians who died during the earthquake in Turkey were brought back home for burial through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. Mazen Alloush, an official on the Syrian side of the border, said 20 more bodies were on their way to the border, adding that all of them were Syrian refugees who fled war in their country. While concerns are rising for those still trapped, Polish rescuers working in Turkey said they had pulled nine people alive from the rubble so far, including parents with two children and a 13-year-old girl from the ruins in the city of Besni. They acknowledged that low temperatures were working against them, though two firefighters told Polish TVN24 that the fact that people were caught in bed under warm covers by the pre-dawn quake could help. The rescuers are currently trying to reach a woman who they know is in her bed. Nearly two days after the quake, rescuers pulled a 3-year-old boy, Arif Kaan, from beneath the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Kahramanmaras, which is not far from the epicenter. With the boys lower body trapped under slabs of concrete and twisted rebar, emergency crews lay a blanket over his torso to protect him from below-freezing temperatures as they carefully cut the debris away from him, mindful of the possibility of triggering another collapse. The boys father, Ertugrul Kisi, who himself had been rescued earlier, sobbed as his son was pulled free and loaded into an ambulance. For now, the name of hope in Kahramanmaras is Arif Kaan, a Turkish television reporter proclaimed as the dramatic rescue was broadcast to the country. A few hours later, rescuers pulled 10-year-old Betul Edis from the rubble of her home in the city of Adiyaman. Amid applause from onlookers, her grandfather kissed her and spoke softly to her as she was loaded on an ambulance. On Monday afternoon in a northwestern Syrian town, residents found a crying newborn still connected by the umbilical cord to her deceased mother. The baby was the only member of her family to survive a building collapse in the small town of Jinderis, relatives told The Associated Press. But such stories were few more than two days after Mondays pre-dawn earthquake, which hit a huge area and brought down thousands of buildings, with frigid temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicating rescue efforts. Many survivors in Turkey have had to sleep in cars, outside or in government shelters. We dont have a tent, we dont have a heating stove, we dont have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold, Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold. In Syria, aid efforts have been hampered by the ongoing war and the isolation of the rebel-held region along the border, which is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces. Syria itself is an international pariah under Western sanctions linked to the war. The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",
