        "date": "July 1, 2023 07:53 pm",
        "content": "The Resolution on Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) was passed in Parliament with amendments a short while ago (01 July). Accordingly, the DDO strategy was passed in Parliament with a majority of 60 votes, with 122 votes in favour and 62 votes against. Meanwhile, the Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera has informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, in writing, that the DDO strategy was passed in Parliament. A full-day special parliamentary session took place today, during which lawmakers debated the restructuring of local debt, initially proposed in a bid to achieve debt sustainability and economic recovery. On 28 June, the Cabinet of Ministers unanimously approved the proposed sovereign domestic debt restructuring strategy for restoring sovereign debt sustainability. Following two days of extensive discussions on the strategy and its impact, the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva on 30 June, gave its approval for the proposed plan, with amendments binding the Finance Ministry to the proposed plan, ensuring adherence to the approved concept paper and addressing concerns about potential deviations. The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Secretary to the Finance Ministry and its officials, creditors including banks, superannuation funds EPFETF and insurance funds were invited to the COPF sessions to discuss the matter at length and to hear their views. In response to questions on the DDOs impact on superannuation funds EPF, ETF and the guarantee given to ensure 9 interest rates, CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe assured that their calculations indicate no net present value loss to the EPF. However, COPF chairman has advocated for legislating a minimum return, as done in the 1958 EPF Act. Further, concerns were raised about the burden falling on the EPF, the largest superannuation fund in the country, without the consent of the depositors. The COPF chairman, Dr. Harsha de Silva said the committee members called for balanced burden sharing among all creditors, not entirely on the superannuation funds, in order to uphold equity in the DDO. Meanwhile, COPF members also raised concerns about the governments commitment to the proposed plan and adherence to the principles of the resolution. Finance Ministry officials acknowledging these concerns, pledged to strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act (FMRA) for compliance. Domestic debt restructuring is a key condition in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, through which a bailout package of USD 3 billion was approved for Sri Lanka in March 2023. The IMF program unlocks more help from international funding agencies. Accordingly, the World Bank, earlier this week, approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka. After defaulting on its foreign debt for the time in May 2022, Sri Lanka has been working to get the economy back on track and to meet the conditions set by the IMF. Sri Lanka aims to restructure its sovereign domestic debt before the second IMF review in September 2023 as the release of second tranche of the bailout package due in October would require notable progress on debt restructuring. The island nation received the first tranche to the tune of USD 330 million in March soon after the IMF Board approved the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF).",

This was allegedly discovered by the Homicide and Organized Crimes Division, which added that the suspects had reportedly videoed the assault of the warden, and sent it to ill-famed underworld gang member known as Handaya, who currently resides abroad. Two individuals including a Captain of the Sri Lanka Army were arrested in Nuwara Eliya, with a T-56 firearm, two Browning pistols and 167 rounds of ammunition. Upon being questioned, the suspects revealed that the attack was carried out on orders of underworld figure Handaya, adding that they had obtained the details of Marasinghes private residence from another prison guard. Accordingly, three more persons believed to be involved in the incident and the van used for the attack were taken into police custody on 30 June. On 12 May, Sankha Kusal Marasinghe, a prison guard of the Magazine New Remand Prison, was attacked by three unidentified persons at his private residence in Minuwangoda. Accordingly, three unknown persons had broken into the said prison guards private residence in Minuwangoda and had him kneel on the floor, after which they had beaten the guard up while threatening his life. As per a statement obtained from the guard, the police further stated that the suspects had attempted to bind the guards hands with zip-ties, however had later held a pistol to his head, threatening to kill him if he made any further attempts against the heroin trafficking rings within the prison. They had also threatened him to refrain from reporting the matter to the police, vowing to take care of the matter if he did so, the prison guard said, adding that one of the three had videoed the entire assault. The prison guard had then lodged a complaint at the Minuwangoda Police, after which he was admitted to the Minuwangoda Hospital. He was, however, transferred to the Gampaha Hospital this afternoon (13 May) for further treatment. Marasinghe was responsible for several successful raids within the prison, and received an award for the year 20182019 for seizing the most number of contraband items inside the Magazine New Remand Prison, police said, adding that they suspect this to be the motive behind the attack.",

        "content": "A Rome preliminary investigations judge (GIP) on Saturday ruled that a 17-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl of his same age in the north of the Italian capital this week should remain under arrest. The boy was taken to a juvenile prison after being questioned for four hours before the GIP. He is alleged to have killed Michelle Maria Causo in the apartment where he lived in Romes Primavalle neighbourhood before leaving her body inside a garbage bag in a shopping trolley next to a trash container. The suspect, of Sri Lankan origin but born in the Italian capital, allegedly stabbed the girl to death in the apartment where he lives before disposing of her body in a trash bag in the trolley. He was arrested on Thursday morning. The brutality of the attack, the way the body was treated and the age of the alleged killer and the victim have caused widespread shock and dismay in Italy. Causo presented at least six wounds inflicted by a kitchen knife to the neck, chest and back, according to preliminary autopsy findings released on Friday. She was not sexually assaulted, according to the preliminary findings. Investigators are focusing on establishing the motive for the homicide, sources said. Her father demanded justice on Saturday. The State must deliver justice, otherwise you have the justice of the street, the man said. There is no forgiveness for something like this. Some things never pass. I have stopped living. Investigators say the two were not going out and that the victim, who has been named as Michelle Maria Causo, from Rome, was not pregnant. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri said on Thursday he was deeply shocked by the brutal murder, describing it as yet another unacceptable femicide. Michelles friends and acquaintances say she was a cheerful girl who loved life and study, known to everyone in the neighbourhood, Gualtieri wrote on social media. At this time of sorrow, I want to express my deepest condolences to her family, friends and all the people who loved her. Our whole city stands in solidarity with the Primavalle community in the face of this terrible and unjust death that has deprived a young woman of her future, We strongly condemn gender violence in all its forms. We must all strengthen our commitment to fight it, prevent it and support the women who suffer it, concluded the mayor. Source - ANSA - Agencies",

Hasaranga was found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an International Match. In addition to this, one demerit point has been added to Hasarangas disciplinary record, for whom it was the second offence in a 24-month period, taking his number of demerit points to two. As per the ICC rule, when a player reaches four or more demerit points within a 24-month period, they are converted into suspension points and a player is banned. The incident occurred after Hasaranga was dismissed in the 33rd over by Bas de Leede. While walking back to the pavilion, he hit the boundary skirtings with his bat in an aggressive manner. Hasaranga admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Shaid Wadvalla of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees, so there was no need for a formal hearing, ICC states in its release.

        "date": "July 2, 2023 09:37 am",
        "content": "The ailing tusker Muthu Raja was airlifted to Thailand by a special flight which left the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this morning. The tusker is expected to receive treatment from Thai veterinary surgeons after reaching Chiang Mai. The 4,000-kilogram mammal flew out from Colombo airport on Sunday morning on a one-way commercial flight for a repatriation that Thai officials said had cost 700,000. The Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane carrying Muthu Raja took off around 7:40 am, the airport manager said. After touching down in Chiang Mai the elephant will be quarantined at a nearby nature reserve. Veterinarians had prepared to airlift the Asian elephant from Sri Lanka back to its home country of Thailand this weekend after it spent more than two decades at a Buddhist temple. The Thai royal family gave the elephant as a gift in 2001 to Sri Lankas government, which in turn gifted it to the temple where it was named Muthu Raja and given honored roles in religious processions. However, the activist group Rally for Animal Rights and Environment, or RARE, raised allegations it was being mistreated, including that it had a stiff leg from a long-neglected injury. It lobbied last year for the intervention of Thai officials, who asked Kande Viharaya temple officials to allow the animals return to Thailand for medical treatment. The temple agreed to transfer the elephant last November to Sri Lankas National Zoological Garden, where it has been receiving treatment and preparation for the airlift to Thailand planned for Sunday. According to reports, two big abscesses the elephant was suffering from when it arrived have mostly healed. However, the zoo has not been able to fully treat the animals leg because of a lack of facilities. Visit Arsaithamkul, a visiting Thai veterinarian, said the treatment in Thailand could include hydrotherapy, laser treatment and acupuncture. At the zoo, Muthu Rajas morning routine had included veterinarian check-ups, bathing in a small pond and practice getting into the container that will carry him on the nearly six-hour flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand. The container is cushioned and has windows for feeding  which will include bananas, pumpkin and sugar cane. Zoo officials have hoisted the 9-foot-tall, 4-ton creature in trial lifts to test the containers strength. Muthu Raja  also known back in its birthplace as Sak Surin  will be sedated if needed, and two vets will monitor him during the journey. Three Thai and one Sri Lanka elephant tenders also will be on the plane. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told Parliament earlier this month that he expressed his regret to the Thai prime minister over the treatment of the elephant during trip to Thailand in May. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "July 2, 2023 11:20 am",
        "content": "U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres visited Haiti on Saturday and again called on foreign governments with strong security forces to help the struggling country fight a surge in gang violence. The appeal was made after Guterres met with Prime Minister Ariel Henry, civil society leaders, U.N. staff and the heads of various political parties during his one-day trip. Now is not the time to forget Haiti or weaken our solidarity with its people, he said. Guterres met with reporters at Haitis international airport in Port-au-Prince, who pressed him on whether an international security force would be deployed as requested by the prime minister last October. Guterres said he spoke about the issue with Henry, as well as the need to hold credible elections. I am not here to tell Haitians what to do. I am here to listen to them and to encourage them to build consensus as broadly as possible to move the transition process forward, he said. Henry, who has been running the country since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, has been under pressure to hold elections. But experts have noted it is impossible to do so given the current level of violence in the country, with gangs controlling an estimated 80 of the capital. There are no democratically elected institutions left in Haiti, with the country failing to hold legislative elections since October 2019. Haiti must return to democratic order as soon as possible, Guterres said. He also said Haiti urgently needs more humanitarian aid as poverty deepens and starvation cases spike. Gangs are preventing the movement of goods and people and controlling access to water, food and health care as civilians attempt to fight back via a violent uprising. I felt all the exhaustion of a population that has been facing for too long a cascade of crises and unsustainable living conditions, Guterres said. One in two people in Haiti live in extreme poverty, face hunger and lack regular access to drinking water. Guterres visit came just days after the U.N.s human rights expert in Haiti visited the country and also called for an international security force and a weapons embargo. Guterres is scheduled to attend a summit Sunday in Trinidad and Tobago held by Caricom, a Caribbean trade bloc. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

He stated this while speaking to the media in the Ruwanwella area regarding the next steps to be taken, following the parliamentary approval being received for the DDO strategy last evening. Siyambalapitiya emphasized that initially the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will publish the decisions reached yesterday, through newspapers and other media. At the same time, the state minister mentioned that simultaneously an invitation will be extended to all the retirement funds involved in the programme. The State Minister said that following those discussions, an opportunity will be provided to take a decision after considering their alternative views, if any. Furthermore, Siyambalapitiya revealed that the Inland Revenue Act and the Appropriation Act require amendments in line with the DDO strategy. He mentioned that the President has been given powers to protect the peoples side on the matter and that the President will stand up for the protection of pensioners funds in particular. The Resolution on Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) was passed in Parliament with amendments yesterday (July 01), with a majority of 60 votes, with 122 votes in favour and 62 votes against. Accordingly, the Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera had informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, in writing, that the DDO strategy was passed in Parliament. A full-day special parliamentary session took place on Saturday, during which lawmakers debated the restructuring of local debt, initially proposed in a bid to achieve debt sustainability and economic recovery. On 28 June, the Cabinet of Ministers unanimously approved the proposed domestic debt restructuring strategy for restoring sovereign debt sustainability. Following two days of extensive discussions on the strategy and its impact, the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva on 30 June, gave its approval for the proposed plan, with amendments binding the Finance Ministry to the proposed plan, ensuring adherence to the approved concept paper and addressing concerns about potential deviations. Domestic debt restructuring is a key condition in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, through which a bailout package of USD 3 billion was approved for Sri Lanka in March 2023. The IMF program unlocks more help from international funding agencies. Accordingly, the World Bank, earlier this week, approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka.",

Sri Lanka move to eight points in the Super Six stage of the preliminary tournament and cannot finish outside of the top two teams, who both earn a place at finals which will be played from Oct. 5-Nov. 19. Zimbabwe have six points and remain in contention, but must beat Scotland (four points) in their final game on Tuesday to make sure. Sri Lanka chose to field first and restricted Zimbabwe to 165 all out in 32.2 overs as off-spinner Maheesh Theekshana claimed career-best figures of 4-25 and Dilshan Madushanka took 3-15. Sri Lanka never looked troubled in their reply and reached their target with 101 balls remaining as Nissanka bagged his second One-Day International century from 102 balls to guide his side to victory. We knew with the team we have got, we were going to qualify for the World Cup, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka said at the post-match presentation. Credit to the other teams, they played really well in the tournament. Some teams gave us a good fight but we were the better side. Its a big achievement (to qualify for the World Cup) and you know what we have done in the past in World Cups. It is a much-needed thing for Sri Lanka to play on that big stage. Sri Lanka have appeared at every World Cup and were victorious in 1996 as they beat Australia in the final. Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams says they will take the result on the chin and look forward to playing Scotland. I dont think we need to prepare any differently from what we have been doing in this tournament, he said. We have been playing some very good cricket. Sri Lanka were just much better than us today. Two-time winners West Indies have failed to qualify for the first time after they lost to Scotland in their qualifier in Harare on Saturday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

However, MP Namal Rajapaksa had not participated in the debate. Speaking in this regard, the SLPP parliamentarian said that the decisions taken to develop the country should be populist. We need to make necessary decisions to develop the economy of this country. It is the responsibility of the SLPP to transform those decisions into populist decisions, he mentioned. Rajapaksa also emphasized that the debt restructuring process should be fair for everyone. Debt restructuring is fine, but it should be fair for everyone. The government should provide reasons on why one part should be restructured and another should not. There is no point in telling that reason to us as representative of parliament. Tell those reasons to this country, he added. This is a period when we, as a country have to take decisive decisions. Commenting further, the MP alleged that opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and his party were previously in support of the DDO strategy, but objected at the last moment. We saw how Sajith Premadasas party was telling that they would support this, but they voted against it at the final moment. I dont know why. They always objected at the last minute.

        "content": "Oil prices slipped in early Asian trade on Monday as global macroeconomic headwinds and possible further interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserves offset forecasts of tighter supplies amid OPEC cuts. Brent crude futures dropped 20 cents, or 0.3, to 75.21 a barrel by 0044 GMT after settling up 0.8 on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at 70.41 a barrel, down 23 cents, or 0.3, after closing 1.1 higher in the previous session. Brent fell for the fourth straight quarter by the end of June while WTI notched a second quarterly drop as the worlds top two economies, the U.S. and China, lost speed in the second quarter. Fears of a further slowdown hurting fuel demand grew after data on Friday showed U.S. inflation still outpacing the central banks 2 target and stoked expectations it would hike interest rates again. Hawkish commentary on rates continues to raise concerns of the demand outlook weighing on prices, National Australia Bank analysts said in a note. Higher interest rates could strengthen the greenback, making commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, and also dampen oil demand. Later on Monday, Caixin will release its monthly private sector manufacturing PMI survey for China in June which is expected to drop slightly from May. Economists and analysts have lowered their Brent price forecasts to average at 83.03 a barrel in 2023, in the June Reuters oil poll. Still, some analysts expect supplies to tighten and push prices higher in the second half after top exporter Saudi Arabia pledged an extra 1 million barrels per day output cut in July, while the U.S. is gradually replenishing its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We continue to see upside from current levels as the market is expected to move into deficit in the 2H 2023, NAB analysts said. However, the latest Reuters survey showed OPEC oil output has fallen only slightly in June as increases in Iraq and Nigeria limited the impact of cutbacks by others. Investors are looking ahead to a conference later this week hosted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for supply cues. U.S. oil rigs fell by one to 545 last week, their lowest level since April 2022, while gas rigs fell six to 124, their lowest since February 2022, Baker Hughes data showed. U.S. crude output fell in April to 12.615 million barrels per day (bpd), its lowest since February, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Friday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Victor Hugo Sosa wed the caiman reptile called Alicia Adriana as he re-enacted an ancestral ritual. Local lore, or tradition, calls the creature the princess girl and the mayor said the pair loved each other. Onlookers clapped and danced in San Pedro Huamelula, a town of indigenous Chontal people in Oaxaca state, Southern Mexico, as they entered into holy matrimony. Mr Sosa said during the ritual: I accept responsibility because we love each other. That is what is important. You cant have a marriage without love... I yield to marriage with the princess girl. He was pictured kissing the animal on the head. Marriage between a man and a female caiman has taken place there for 230 years to commemorate the peace between the Chontal and Huave indigenous groups. The mayor, representing the Chontal king, marries the reptile, symbolising a Huave princess girl, in a union of the two communities. Caimans live in marshes and are endemic in Mexico and central America. Before the ceremony, the animal is carried from house to house so locals can hold her and dance. The reptile wears a green skirt, a colourful hand-embroidered tunic and a headdress of ribbons and sequins. Her snout is bound shut so there arent any pre-marital mishaps. She is later dressed in a white brides costume and taken to the local town hall for the wedding. After the event, the mayor danced with his bride to the sounds of traditional music. We are happy because we celebrate the union of two cultures. People are content, Mr Sosa told the AFP news agency.

        "title": "Twitter temporarily restricts tweets users can see, Elon Musk announces",
        "date": "July 3, 2023 12:25 pm",
        "content": "Twitter has applied a temporary limit to the number of tweets users can read in a day, owner Elon Musk has said. In a tweet of his own, Mr Musk said unverified accounts are now limited to reading 1,000 posts a day. For new unverified accounts, the number is 500. Meanwhile, accounts with verified status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day. The tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move. Mr Musk said the temporary limits were to address extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation. He did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context. We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users, Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content. The move was described as a temporary emergency measure. It is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AIs ChatGPT and Googles Bard. In simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitters huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies. But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data. In April, Reddits chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing. The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable, he said. But we dont need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free. Twitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies. There are other potential reasons for the move too. Mr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. Its possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts. Signalled by a blue tick, verified status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from 8 (6.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile. According to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday. In the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time. Initially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts. In another update Mr Musk said several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively. He later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis. A server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users. Adam Leon Smith from BCS, the UKs professional body for IT, said the move was very odd as limiting users scroll time would affect the companys advertising revenue. Mr Musk bought the company last year for 44bn (35bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitters previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber. Soon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500. In an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy. Engineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platforms stability. But while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 3, 2023 01:13 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), MP Dr. Harsha de Silva states that the domestic debt restructuring should be carried out in a way that affects not only the ordinary working people, but also the rich. The MP points out that the opposition had opposed the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) strategy since the government had failed to do so. This provident fund Employees Provident Fund is usually the only fund that working people have to spend the rest of their lives following their retirement. I have continuously shown what has happened to this fund so far... For example, if someone had needed to invite 100 people for his daughters wedding, hoping to spend money from the EPF, now he can only invite 50 people instead of 100 people. That is the truth, the MP claimed. So, the domestic debt restructuring burden has also been placed on the same fund. That is where the question of fairness arose, he said, adding that if this is shared among everyone as a whole, it can be justified in some way. He mentioned that the burden should not only be borne by the working people but also by the rich and the bank owners. We, the opposition, strongly opposed the DDO strategy because the entire burden of this was placed on the Provident Fund EPF and the ETF, de Silva expressed.",

        "date": "July 3, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "Heavy flooding has displaced thousands of people around China as the capital had a relative respite from sweltering heat. Beijing reported 9.8 straight days when the temperature exceeded 35 C (95 F), the National Climate Center said Monday. Such a streak was last recorded in 1961  decades before most Beijing residents had air conditioning or even fans. A lack of rainfall may be contributing to the heat, with the typically dry capital receiving even less than usual this year. While temperatures have since moderated  Mondays temperature at midday was 33 C (91 F)  they are expected to rise again this week to as high as 39.6 Celsius (103 Fahrenheit) in Beijing and other parts of the country, authorities said. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people were urgently moved to safety due to flooding in the central province of Hunan, the Xiangxi Emergency Management Bureau on Sunday. Around 70 houses collapsed, 2,283 were damaged and farm fields were flooded. Losses so far have been estimated at least 575 million yuan (79 million). To the north in Shaanxi provinces Zhenba county, authorities reported the worst flooding in 50 years had washed out roads and damaged homes. No deaths have been reported from the floods thus far. The heat this year has been unusual, although China has regular summer flooding. Eleven provinces  around half of Chinas land area  were expected to received heavy rains in coming days, mainly in the humid south. In 2021, more than 300 people died in the central province of Henan. Record rainfall inundated the provincial capital of Zhengzhou on July 20 that year, turning streets into rushing rivers and flooding at least part of a subway line. Chinas worst floods in recent history were in 1998, when 4,150 people died, most of them along the Yangtze River. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Baltimore mass shooting leaves 2 dead; half of 28 injured were children",
        "date": "July 3, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "A mass shooting early on Sunday at an outdoor neighborhood block party in Baltimore, Maryland, left two people dead and 28 others injured, about half of them children, as investigators sought the publics help in tracking down multiple suspects, police said. Authorities offered no motive for the gun violence, which erupted at about 12:35 a.m. local time in a courtyard of grass and pavement between a pair of two-story rowhouse structures in South Baltimores Brooklyn Homes community. The two people slain in the hail of gunfire were identified by police only as an 18-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man. As of Sunday afternoon, nine others wounded remained hospitalized, a few of them listed in critical condition, police told reporters. Among the 28 survivors who were injured were an estimated 14 who were under the age of 18, said Richard Worley, acting commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, noting that they were still trying to confirm victims ages. Baltimore television station WBAL-TV, an NBC affiliate, reported that ages of those who were injured ranged from 13 to 32. The shooting likely ranks as Baltimores largest single act of gun violence in terms of number of victims dating back to 2014, according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper, citing the earliest data kept by the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. The extent of the carnage was notable even for a city that has long grappled with high levels of homicide and other violent crimes. Worley said police were searching for multiple suspects, and he appealed to the community to come forward with any information or videos that might help investigators identify the perpetrators. We know for sure there are more than one. We dont know how many (suspects), Worley said. One resident of the neighborhood, Terry Brown, told the Baltimore Sun said he was standing outside his home when he heard the crackle of gunfire, followed by a stampede of people fleeing in panic for cover. It was chaos, Brown said. Parents were running around looking for their children, hollering and screaming, and dont know if their child has a bullet in them. Mayor Brandon Scott called the shooting a reckless, cowardly act, and vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice. We will not stop until we find you, and we will find you. The tragedy rattled the city of Baltimore, Marylands most populous city, 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Washington D.C., at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, at a time when Americans typically gather for parades, barbecues and fireworks. Local media reported that hundreds had attended the Brooklyn Day block party, which featured pony rides, dancing and refreshments. One witness interviewed by television station Fox 45 recounted hearing 20 to 30 gunshots. Television footage of the crime scene on Sunday showed police tape blocking off a grassy area littered with overturned tables, cups, plates, and other trash from the event.

        "title": "President urges opposition to prioritise national interest over politics",
        "date": "July 3, 2023 04:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of avoiding misleading arguments and instead urged the entire opposition, led by the opposition leader, to join the government in addressing the countrys challenges, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He pointed out that the oppositions allegations regarding the restructuring of local debt have been proven false. The President encouraged the opposition to participate in the next presidential election and contribute to rebuilding the country by fulfilling their responsibilities to the people. He also expressed his willingness to assign additional duties to the opposition in consultation with the Speaker, if necessary, the PMD said. These remarks were made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Amarawiru Abhiman 32 ceremony, which honoured Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Agriculture, for his 32-year political career. During the event, the President received a special commemorative edition of Amaraviru Abhiman 32 and presented commemorative gifts to farmers, agriculture supporters, and students who achieved academic success in the Hambantota district. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera presented a memento to President Ranil Wickremesinghe as a tribute to the people of Hambantota, and the President reciprocated by presenting a souvenir to Minister Amaraweera in appreciation of his dedicated service to the people of the district, according to the PMD. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented: Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has rendered outstanding service to the people of the country over his 32-year political career and 28-year parliamentary career. We should appreciate him for his wisdom and extensive experience as a politician. Throughout different eras, we have worked together as members of the party and the opposition, including serving under President Maithripala Sirisenas leadership. In continuation, as Prime Minister of President Gotabaya Rajapaksas government, I announced our intention to move forward with the participation of all members. In 2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited all Parliamentary party leaders to the Presidents Office. Unfortunately, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Janata Vimukthi Peramuna boycotted the meeting. During that time, I, along with Mr. R. Sampanthan and Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, discussed how to resolve this issue. Despite our efforts to bring everyone together after the incident on May 9, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya did not join us, even though they were offered the opportunity to participate without assuming the post of Prime Minister. Consequently, our government was formed, and we began our duties. I was appointed President, Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena became the Prime Minister, and Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera was entrusted with the responsibility of the Agriculture Minister. Despite the challenges faced by the agriculture sector, Mr. Amaraweeras leadership has allowed us to make significant progress. We initiated a program to ensure an ample harvest before the Sinhala New Year in 2023 and formed food security committees. While we invited members from both the ruling party and the opposition to participate, the opposition did not attend. When the harvest yielded an abundance of crops, the committee presidents started distributing rice to the people, which sparked outrage among opposition members who felt excluded. Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera and the dedicated officers who worked tirelessly on these efforts deserve our gratitude. We swiftly provided fertilizer to the farms, ensuring a seamless process from the shipment to the fields. This has contributed to food security and assistance to the less privileged. Now, our focus is on promoting agriculture in the country, particularly export-oriented agriculture. We have mainly concentrated on meeting our domestic food requirements thus far, but it is time to produce crops that the world demands. To achieve this, we have launched a large-scale agricultural modernization effort. Additionally, we have implemented a comprehensive plan for the development of livestock resources. We have received requests from Ambewela Company, the countrys leading livestock company, to provide them the Ridigama farm. We hope to fulfill this request to further develop the livestock sector in that area. Notably, Amul, a renowned Indian company, has collaborated with our Livestock Development Board, and we have received interest from several other firms. It is important to highlight that we do not import animals from other countries. Instead, we encourage businesses to adopt and invest in this sector, which will lead to the emergence of new industries, particularly in the dairy sector. Expanding our agricultural efforts, we aim to export eggs and chicken as well. However, we acknowledge that we cannot achieve this alone. Therefore, the government and the business sector must collaborate to drive these initiatives forward. All these measures are being undertaken to ensure the countrys success. We have implemented various initiatives to improve financial stability, including reaching a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund last September. Budget recommendations for 2023 have been submitted to Parliament for execution. Increasing taxes became necessary due to the circumstances we faced. I proposed that we all collectively undertake this task. However, the opposition at the time demanded to see a signed agreement and accused the government of corruption. Despite facing obstacles and protests, we proceeded with the initiatives in January and February. Finally, in April, the International Monetary Funds Executive Board approved the agreement. It was a requirement to reach a debt restructuring agreement with the Paris Club, India, and China. The opposition initially claimed that China would not agree, but eventually, China consented in March. We then aimed to present this agreement to Parliament for approval. However, the opposition did not support it. Subsequently, we had to negotiate with the creditors, which was entrusted to our officials. During the negotiations, we emphasized the need to reduce not only foreign debt but also domestic debt. Failure to decrease domestic debt would result in a lack of funds to pay foreign debt, as we must purchase dollars in local currency. Thus, we requested a reduction in domestic debt. The Governor of the Central Bank and my advisor suggested that this task could be accomplished without affecting bank deposits or the Employees Provident Fund. We initiated this proposition through the State Financial Committee, which summoned the necessary officials and conducted relevant inquiries. Eventually, they agreed to the suggestion. However, when the proposal reached Parliament, it did not receive the necessary backing, as 62 MPs voted against it. The opposition raised three main arguments. First, they claimed that the Employees Provident Fund should not be touched. However, we did not touch it, and we legally safeguarded it by establishing a minimum interest rate of 9. Second, the opposition argued that banks, with their interest rates at 24, should not be exempted from taxes. We explained that interest rates would decrease further in the future, and the Governor of the Central Bank projected inflation to be brought down to 9, which would result in interest rates between 12 and 13. If the opposition insisted on imposing taxes, we were open to considering the amount required. The third objection focused on not increasing income tax for banks, as they claimed it would lead to increased interest rates. We clarified that if taxes were increased, banks would charge customers higher interest rates to compensate. Therefore, we requested the opposition to provide a feasible solution for this issue. However, these three arguments were ultimately rejected by the speakers. To address concerns about the stability of bank deposits, we assured the public that their money would be safe and separate funds were in place. We rejected the oppositions claims that the government had lied on two occasions and emphasized the importance of their support in solving the countrys issues. We also expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with the Speaker to consider assigning additional responsibilities to opposition members and involving them in advisory panels and other projects, such as establishing the Parliamentary Budget Office. Cabinet Ministers, led by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Members of Parliament, political representatives, including Southern Province Governor Mr. Willie Gamage, government officials, and a large number of people from the Hambantota district also attended this event. Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera stated: During a challenging time when nobody took responsibility for the country, current President Ranil Wickremesinghe stepped up. Some doubted that this country, where people died in queues and farmers were deprived of the fertilizer they needed, could be revived. However, I accepted the position of Minister of Agriculture with the belief that we should all support the leader who took responsibility for the country to overcome these challenges. It is worth mentioning that the Presidents policies quickly brought farmers back to the fields. We have plans in place to provide fertilizer to the farming community as soon as possible. The necessary arrangements have been made to supply all three types of fertilizers required for the upcoming season, ensuring a good yield in all regions. Moreover, efforts to modernize agriculture are currently underway, promising a revolution in this sector in a relatively short period. The people of this country rejected all 225 Members of Parliament a year ago, and MPs were unable to take to the streets. Unfortunately, some seem to have forgotten this. Therefore, it is crucial that everyone supports the Presidents agenda to prevent a repetition of the crisis the country faced. It should be acknowledged that the people of this country have now realized that the current President, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, is the only leader capable of developing and propelling this country forward, as evidenced by the progress made within a year. Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Services, Nimal Siripala de Silva, remarked: Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera has accomplished exceptional work for the people of the Hambantota district. I express my gratitude for the opportunity to congratulate him on the completion of his 32-year political career. All of us supported the present President because we genuinely care about the country and its people. Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera was assigned the subject of agriculture, and in doing so, we contributed to restoring the country from chaos. We even sacrificed our party membership. Mahinda Amaraweera was a trailblazer, and it is essential to make the right decisions at the right time for the benefit of the country and its people. Cabinet Ministers, led by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Members of Parliament, political representatives, including Southern Province Governor Willie Gamage, government officials, and many people from the Hambantota district also participated in this event, the PMD added.",

        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appointed Takafumi Kadono as the new Country Director for Sri Lanka, who has assumed office in Colombo today. It is an honor and a privilege to be appointed the Country Director of ADBs Sri Lanka Resident Mission. ADB was a trusted partner of the people of Sri Lanka during the pandemic and the economic crisis. I intend to further enhance our collaboration as Sri Lanka embarks on a journey to recover from the crisis and come out stronger and more inclusive than ever before, Mr. Kadono said. ADB will support the governments efforts to undertake reforms through budgetary support anchored on the International Monetary Fund program, while providing assistance to ensure that the people of Sri Lanka are well-supported through the transition. Mr. Kadono succeeds Mr. Chen Chen who ended his term as Country Director on 30 June 2023. In a career spanning 23 years as a development professional, Mr. Kadono, a Japanese national, joined ADB in 2006 as a Young Professional in the East Asia Regional Department. He then held progressive positions in Central and West Asia Department and Southeast Asia Department as an Energy Specialist, including being stationed in Viet Nam from 2012 to 2015 where he led projects in the power sector value chain from generation and transmission to distribution. He also promoted the development of renewable energy in a fossil fuel dominated generation subsector.

        "content": "Sri Lanka hopes that China will assist the country in its bid to restructure the external debt in the ongoing negotiations, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on Monday. Sabry said negotiations have been progressing well with the Chinese as they are believed to hold over 50 per cent of Sri Lankas external debt. We have had several rounds of discussions with them, Sabry, who was in China last week, said. He said the Chinese were taking part as observers in the platform created by the Paris Club of Creditors along with India and Japan. We are very confident that China will assist us in debt restructuring, Sabry said. Sri Lanka hopes to restructure its external debt of USD 41 billion along with its slightly higher domestic debt of USD 42 billion. On Saturday, the government got its local debt restructuring plan approved in Parliament. Both the restructuring processes should be complete by September in time for the International Monetary Funds first review of its USD 2.9 billion bailout programme extended in mid-March. Sri Lanka approached the IMF for a bailout in April 2022 after declaring its first-ever debt default since independence in 1948. Domestic debt restructuring (DDR) is a key condition in the IMF programme, through which a bailout package was approved for Sri Lanka. The IMF programme unlocks more help from international funding agencies. Accordingly, the World Bank, earlier this week, approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka, which is facing its worst economic crisis.

One was arrested on Sunday (July 02) while the other two were taken into custody on Monday (July 03). The trio, a 35-year-old woman and two men aged 46 and 53, have been produced before the Walapane Magistrates Court. Accordingly, the two male suspects were remanded until July 06 while the female suspect was released on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000. A commotion broke out outside the Hanguranketha police station on June 21, following the death of a 23-year-old named Sandalu Santhush and his father who had been brutally assaulted by a group over a land dispute. The father-son duo was fighting for life at the Kandy National Hospital for over four days until they succumbed to injuries on June 26. The residents of the area, who were infuriated by the murder of the father-son duo and the failure to arrest the suspects who were at large, had staged a protest in front of the police station and tried to storm the premises. As the tense situation ensued, the police officers had fired nearly 38 warning shots into the air in an attempt to disperse the unruly protesters, who then proceeded to stage a demonstration on the Hanguranketha-Kandy main for nearly an hour.",

        "date": "July 4, 2023 10:18 am",
        "content": "A gunman wearing a bulletproof vest opened fire on the streets of Philadelphia on Monday night, killing four people and wounding two boys in the latest outbreak of gun violence in the United States, police said. The victims were apparently random, with no connection immediately known between them and the shooter. The shootings took place over several city blocks in the southwestern neighborhood of Kingsessing. Responding officers chased the suspect as he continued to fire, and he was arrested in an alley after surrendering, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said at a news conference. At this point all we know is that this person decided to leave their home and target individuals, Outlaw said. He had a bulletproof vest, an AR-type rifle, multiple magazines, a handgun and a police scanner, she said. Officers were flagged down at about 8:30 p.m., and multiple calls of shots fired came in from Kingsessing. Police found some gunshot victims, and as they were attending to them, they heard more gunfire, Outlaw said. The suspected shooter was identified as a 40-year-old man. A second person was also taken into custody who may have returned fire at the suspect, but police did not know whether there was a connection between the two people, Outlaw said. The chief described the scene as covering an area of two by four blocks and said dozens of shell casings were found. You can see there are several scenes out here, Outlaw said. Were canvassing the area to get as much as we can, to identify witnesses, to identify where cameras are located and to do everything to figure out the why, Outlaw said. Three of the dead ranged in age from 20 to 59, while the fourth, who had not yet been identified, was estimated to be between 16 and 21. All were male. The two hospitalized victims are boys, ages 2 and 13. They were in stable condition, Outlaw said. The shooting occurred a day after gunfire erupted at a holiday weekend block party in Baltimore, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the southwest, killing two people and wounding 28 others. The wounded in that shooting ranged in age from 13 to 32, with more than half of them minors, according to officials. The Philadelphia violence marks the countrys 29th mass killing in 2023, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. So far this year, the nation has witnessed the highest number on record of mass killings and deaths to this point in a single year. There have been more than 550 mass killings since 2006, according to the database, in which at least 2,900 people have died and at least 2,000 people have been injured.

        "date": "July 4, 2023 11:25 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan stocks extended gains as markets reopened post a three-day holiday, after a plan to revamp domestic debt eased concern over financial sector stability. The Colombo All-Share Index climbed as much as 5.3, its biggest gain in more than a year. The Sri Lankan rupee advanced 0.4 to 305.5 per dollar. A 2027 Sri Lanka rupee bond saw yield decline by over 10 to 14.5, dealers said. The island nation mostly spared local commercial banks in its blueprint unveiled last week to protect the economy while striking a balance between domestic creditors and foreign bondholders. The plan - aimed at helping restore debt sustainability in line with a 3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout - sent dollar bonds surging 12, marking their best week since November. The domestic debt optimization plan being limited to the central bank and superannuation funds is very positive for the economy, said Dimantha Mathew, chief research and strategy officer, at First Capital Holdings in Colombo. There may now be interest from foreign investors for rupee bonds. A re-rating in Sri Lankan stocks is also the most likely outcome after policymakers chose to only restructure Treasury bills held by the central bank and treasury bonds of pension funds, according to analysts at Colombo-based Asia Securities Research, who project a 34 gain in the benchmark index this year. Sri Lankas government started its domestic bond swap program on Tuesday, inviting investors to submit offers to exchange existing notes for new ones. Neighboring Pakistans key stock gauge surged the most in over 15 years on Monday after the nation clinched an IMF bailout. The local currency advanced in the black market as well. Financial support from multilateral lenders has boosted investor confidence  and returns  across troubled emerging and frontier markets in recent months. Funds getting approved or disbursed for countries including Kenya, Tanzania, and Pakistan are giving hope that the embattled economies are turning a corner and international capital will soon start flowing in. More Upside The equity market in Sri Lanka has more room to run, said Ruchir Desai, fund manager at Asia Frontier Capital, who is increasing his funds allocation to the nation. I am much more optimistic on the outlook compared to the past few years. The details of Sri Lankas debt restructuring with foreign bondholders and bilateral creditors still need to be hammered out. Thats why Mark Baker, head of fixed income at abrdn plc in Hong Kong, prefers to stay invested in T-bills, which are outside the scope of the restructuring and carry yields of about 17 to 22. While import restrictions are likely to be gradually removed, Baker expects the Sri Lankan rupee to be relatively stable, after clocking a 20 appreciation against the dollar so far this year, making it the worlds best performer.

An appeal was filed by the Attorney General, seeking the dismissal of an order issued by the Colombo High Court on 18 February 2022, acquitting the former IGP in the case against him over criminal negligence of duty by failing to prevent the 2019 attacks, despite receiving sufficient intelligence information beforehand. Accordingly, the relevant petition was heard before a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, chaired by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, this morning. Former IGP Jayasundara and former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando were arrested for allegedly failing to prevent the coordinated terror attacks orchestrated by the now-banned terror group National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) which claimed the lives of over 250 persons and injured approximately 500 more people on Easter Sunday in 2019. A total of 855 charges of criminal negligence had been laid against the duo, individually.

        "date": "July 4, 2023 12:09 pm",
        "content": "Facebook owner Meta is launching its new app to rival Twitter and says it will go live on Thursday. The app, which is called Threads and is available for pre-order on the Apple App Store, will be linked to Instagram. Screengrabs show a dashboard that looks similar to Twitter. Meta describes Threads as a text-based conversation app. The move is the latest in a rivalry between Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter owner Elon Musk. Last month, the pair agreed to a physical fight, though it is unclear how serious the two men were about actually holding a bout. Thank goodness theyre so sanely run, Mr Musk responded to a tweet about Threads, in an apparent fresh swipe at Mr Zuckerberg. Meanwhile, Twitter has said that the popular user dashboard, TweetDeck will go behind a paywall in 30 days time. The move is the latest push by Mr Musk as he tries to get users to sign up to Twitters subscription service, Twitter Blue. On Saturday, the multi-billionaire restricted the number of tweets users could see, citing extreme data scraping. It appears from Metas Threads app that it will be a free service - and there will be no restrictions on how many posts a user can see. Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to whatll be trending tomorrow the description on the App Store says. Pictures show screengrabs from the app, that look almost identical to Twitter. It being a Meta app, Threads will also hoover up data on your phone, including location data, purchases and browsing history. Several apps that bear a striking resemblance to Twitter have sprung up in recent years - such as Donald Trumps Truth Social and Mastodon. Another similar app, Bluesky claimed to have seen record traffic after Mr Musks move to restrict usage at the weekend. However, Threads could be the biggest threat faced by Twitter to date. Mark Zuckerberg has a history of borrowing other companys ideas - and making them work. Metas Reels is widely seen as a TikTok copy, while Stories looks similar to Snapchat. Meta has the resources to compete with Twitter. Threads will be part of the Instagram platform, so it will also be connected to hundreds of millions of accounts. Its not starting from zero, as other would-be rivals have had to do. Although Mr Musk has been praised in some quarters for his commitment to free speech, he has also alienated some users. Mr Zuckerberg will hope he can pull enough disenchanted users away from Twitter to create a genuine alternative. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 4, 2023 12:33 pm",
        "content": "Riots in France appear to be calming, after five days of violent protests in response to the shooting of teenager Nahel M during a police traffic stop. Sunday night saw violence subside and fewer arrests were made. However, President Emmanuel Macron has asked the interior ministry to keep a massive police presence on the streets. On Monday, mayors called for rallies to be held outside town halls to protest the violence and looting. In Nanterre, Nahels hometown, mayor Patrick Jarry said he was pleased the violence had subsided, but added that we shouldnt lose sight of the incident that sparked this situation and the continuing need for justice. Later in the afternoon, several hundred people attended a rally in LHaÿ-les-Roses in support of Vincent Jeanbrun, the mayor whose home was attacked by rioters who fired rockets at his fleeing wife and children, breaking her leg and injuring one of the children. The incident is being treated as attempted murder. A visibly emotional Mr Jeanbrun said: We saw the real faces of the rioters: they are murderers... They wanted to kill my wife and my two young children in their sleep by burning them alive. To applause, Mr Jeanbrun also said that over the last week democracy itself was attacked... We need the majority of people who has so far been silent to say: enough! The six days of riots have reportedly caused millions of euros worth of damage to public transport in the Paris region, the Ile-de-France transport network said. While Sunday night was far calmer, authorities were careful not to prematurely hail a return to normality on Monday. Buses and trams in the Paris region will again be halted early on Monday night, while President Macron has asked the ministry of the interior to maintain a massive police presence across France in order to guarantee a return to calm. About 45,000 officers have been deployed across the country for the past three nights and will be out on the streets again on Monday, interior minister Gérald Darmanin confirmed. More than 150 people were arrested on Sunday night, compared with more than 700 the night before. There were 297 cars set on fire compared with Thursdays 1,900, while 34 buildings were damaged or set ablaze compared with more than 500 on Thursday. At the weekend, the family of Nahel, the teenager who was killed by police, called for the violence to end. His grandmother accused rioters of using Nahels death as an excuse and urged them to stop destroying public goods. Another relative told the BBC that the family did not want his death to spark riots, but insisted the law around lethal force at traffic stops must change. She also said her heart is in pain about a GoFundMe page for the family of the police officer who shot Nahel, which as of Monday had raised more than 1.1m (956,200) and was growing steadily. The fundraiser, which was set up by a far-right media commentator, has been criticised by several politicians - but the platform told French newspaper Le Parisien that GoFundMes terms and conditions were not being broken because the funds are destined for the officers family and not meant for the legal defence of an alleged violent crime. A fundraiser for Nahels family was set up on a different platform and had raised 215,000 (184,862) on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, French regional authorities are starting to announce financial support measures for looted businesses and hospitality venues. Grants will be made available for business owners in Marseille and funding in the Paris region will help to restore the public buildings that were damaged and looted. But there are concerns that the spate of violence might have a long-term effect on the tourism sector just as the summer season begins. French media outlet Le Point quoted a tourism official as estimating that up to 25 of hotel bookings in Paris had already been cancelled. The regional transport network for Ile-de-France told AFP that 20m in damage was caused to public transport, including burned buses, a torched tramway, two damaged tramways and urban infrastructure which was smashed. François Rial said that the riots posed a real risk to the image of France: This is true even if the unrest subsides, as many tourists are allergic to risk. On Tuesday, President Macron will meet the mayors of 220 municipal areas that have been affected by the violence. Source - BBC - Agencies",

On June 28, the global financial institution approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka. This is the biggest funding trance for the island nation since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package in March. Through this funding, the World Bank said it aims to help Sri Lanka implement foundational reforms that restore macroeconomic stability and sustainability, mitigate the impact of current and future shocks on the poor and vulnerable, and support an inclusive and private sector-led recovery and growth path. Thereby, USD 500 million of the funds is allocated for the Sri Lanka Resilience, Stability  Economic Turnaround (RESET) Development Policy Operation which will support reforms that improve economic governance, enhance growth and competitiveness, and protect the poor and vulnerable. This operation will provide budgetary support in two equal tranches against agreed prior actions. Meanwhile, welfare support of USD 200 million is earmarked for the Social Protection Project which seeks to support Sri Lanka in providing better-targeted income and livelihood opportunities to the poor and vulnerable and improving the responsiveness of the social protection program. The funding was green-lighted when the World Bank Groups Board of Executive Directors met for a discussion on the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Sri Lanka on June 28.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas domestic debt plan a significant step for resolving bank uncertainty - Fitch",
        "date": "July 4, 2023 03:50 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments proposal for treatment of domestic debt marks a significant step towards resolving uncertainties around the impact of the sovereigns debt restructuring on the local banking sector, but complications may arise from a number of factors, says Fitch Ratings. The proposal excludes banks holdings of Sri Lankan rupee-denominated treasury securities, which will alleviate some of the pressure on their already stressed capital positions from weakening loan quality and the rupees depreciation. Fitchs base case did not expect treasury bills held by banks to be subject to restructuring, but assumed banks treasury-bond holdings would be. Bank holdings of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), which are foreign-currency denominated but governed by local law, will be affected, as we had anticipated, and we still expect an impact on international sovereign bonds (ISBs) as well. However, these together account for only about 5.5 of banks combined assets, a much smaller share than treasury securities (26.4 for Fitch-rated domestic banks). The proposal also includes a restructuring of foreign-currency bank loans to the government (less than 1 of combined assets for Fitch-rated banks), though without detailed plans. The government has outlined three treatment options for SLDBs. We expect banks will generally opt for the choice involving conversion of such debt into local currency-denominated instruments; banks have so far opted to convert maturing SLDBs to rupee-denominated treasury bonds since the announcement of suspension of foreign debt servicing in April 2022. Provisioning should help to moderate the hit to bank capital from the debt treatment. Fitch-rated Sri Lankan banks have already made provisions of 35 or higher for ISBs, with SLDBs being subject to lower provisioning due to the possibility of obtaining rupee-denominated treasuries. Nonetheless, worsening impaired loans (end-May 2023: 13.3 of system loans, from 1Q22: 8.4) in line with the economic stress associated with the sovereign default and the unwinding of forbearance provided during the Covid-19 pandemic are already exerting pressure on banks thin capital buffers. We do not believe a restructuring of the sovereigns local-currency obligations is likely to trigger a loss of depositor confidence in the banking system, based on the proposed plans. However, funding stress remains a negative sensitivity for bank ratings. Fitch-rated Sri Lankan banks national ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) to reflect the potential for the banks creditworthiness relative to other entities on the Sri Lankan national ratings scale to deteriorate. This reflects heightened near-term downside risks to credit profiles from capital and funding stress. A downgrade of the sovereigns CC Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating would not automatically drive a downgrade in Sri Lankan bank ratings. To resolve the RWN on these ratings, we will need to assess the impact to the banks capital once debt treatment terms are finalised, including the effects of any present value reductions from an exchange of bonds and those of any regulatory or accounting forbearance. We may resolve and affirm the banks ratings if we think risks from funding and capital stresses have abated, at both the individual bank and the sector level, to the extent that we believe the banks ability to service obligations in local and foreign currency is not hindered andor banks are able to continue as a going concern and avoid failure. Although the governments domestic debt treatment announcements go some way towards resolving uncertainties over Sri Lankan bank ratings, many risks remain. It is still unclear, for example, whether the governments proposals have received support from the sovereigns key external creditors. If not, the risk of further domestic debt restructuring could linger, resulting in further instability for the banking sector. --Fitch Ratings--",

        "date": "July 4, 2023 05:17 pm",
        "content": "Vietnam has banned Warner Bros highly-anticipated film Barbie from domestic distribution over a scene featuring a map that shows Chinas unilaterally claimed territory in the South China Sea, state media reported on Monday. The U-shaped nine-dash line is used on Chinese maps to illustrate its claims over vast areas of the South China Sea, including swathes of what Vietnam considers its continental shelf, where it has awarded oil concessions. Barbie is the latest movie to be banned in Vietnam for depicting Chinas controversial nine-dash line, which was repudiated in an international arbitration ruling by a court in The Hague in 2016. China refuses to recognise the ruling. In 2019 the Vietnamese government pulled DreamWorks animated film Abominable and last year it banned Sonys action movie Unchartered for the same reason. Netflix also removed an Australian spy drama Pine Gap in 2021. Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, was originally slated to open in Vietnam on July 21, the same date as in the United States, according to state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper. We do not grant license for the American movie Barbie to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line, the paper reported, citing Vi Kien Thanh, head of the Department of Cinema, a government body in charge of licensing and censoring foreign films. Warner Bros did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Vietnam and China have long had overlapping territorial claims to a potentially energy-rich stretch in the South China Sea. The Southeast Asian country has repeatedly accused Chinese vessels of violating its sovereignty. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "July 4, 2023 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera has assured that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is on a path towards achieving financial stability. Participating in a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre themed Collective path to a stable country, Wijesekera expressed confidence in the governments program, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to promote financial stability in both the Electricity Board and the Petroleum Corporation. Meanwhile, addressing accusations from various parties regarding the electricity price revision, the Minister highlighted that in Junes price revision, the government provided a significant 55 relief in electricity prices to 3.5 million out of the total 6 million consumers. Addressing the press conference the minister said; In the past year, our country faced challenges such as fuel queues and power cuts. However, under the decisions made by the new government, significant progress has been achieved in eliminating fuel queues and ensuring continuous electricity supply. The revision of electricity prices took place in January and June, benefiting around 6 million household consumers. A 55 per cent price reduction was implemented for approximately 3.5 million consumers using 30 to 60 units of electricity. Additionally, concessions were provided to the industrial sector during the price revision. There are approximately 40,000 registered religious shrines, and about 15,000 of them consume less than 30 units of electricity. The electricity board had been facing significant financial losses, with a total loss of Rs. 409 billion in the past. However, last years loss was reduced to Rs. 167.2 billion. The government has successfully completed all payments to suppliers and has created a favourable environment for initiating new renewable electricity projects. Additionally, steps have been taken to remove a Rs. 120 billion debt from the balance sheet of the Petroleum Corporation, resulting in the electricity boards improved financial position. With the strengthened financial position, the electricity board plans to resume maintenance work and provide new connections that were put on hold in the past three years. Out of the 36,000 new connection applications received, 20,000 connections have already been completed, and efforts are underway to fulfil the remaining connections within the next two months. Furthermore, the Petroleum Statutory Corporation has established contracts with two new agencies for a consistent supply of fuel since September last year. These agencies are scheduled to commence fuel supply by the end of this month, and the first fuel shipment is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka at the same time. Around 150 fuel stations have been registered by these agencies so far, ensuring reliable fuel availability. After the arrival of their ship in Sri Lanka, fuel distribution was initially carried out under the name of Ceypetco. However, future distribution will be conducted under their own company name. To address outstanding debts, including those owed to Indian and Iranian creditors as well as fuel suppliers, the Ministry of Finance has imposed a tax of Rs.50 per liter of fuel during distribution. The Petroleum Corporation has successfully repaid all loans owed to the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank, resulting in its strengthened financial position. Despite this, the restructuring process of the Petroleum Corporation will continue as planned. The revised draft for the restructuring of the Electricity Board has been forwarded to legislators, and once received, it will be submitted to the Attorney General and subsequently presented to the Cabinet for recommendations. There is a possibility of passing a new act in this regard. There is no pressure on the employees of the electricity board, and efforts are being made to verify the status of employees who have completed NVQ courses but are currently unemployed. Legal actions are being taken against fuel stations that failed to maintain oil stocks during the fuel price revision. One such station, the Rajagiriya petrol station, has already been taken over by the government. Complaints have been received regarding 120 fuel filling stations that did not comply with stock maintenance requirements during fuel price revisions, and future plans involve implementing appropriate legal measures. The decision has been made not to hire new employees, as the current number of employees in the Ministry and its associated institutions is deemed sufficient. The President, along with the Prime Minister and the government, has planned to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of government institutions based on collective decisions. Investors who previously submitted tenders for renewable energy have not yet responded. It has been discovered that some of the organizations that were awarded tenders have sold them to other entities. As a result, the tender call for 500 megawatts of renewable energy is expected to be cancelled in the upcoming cabinet meeting, and a fresh tender call will be issued. Additionally, the necessary permissions have been granted to the Adani company for the construction of a 500 MW renewable energy power plant. Their energy generation is projected to be integrated into the national grid by December of next year. While the majority of employees from these institutions have expressed their desire for the restructuring of the Petroleum Corporation and the Electricity Board, some protests have emerged due to concerns regarding potential loss of trade union privileges. However, granting salary increments and bonuses to loss-making organizations is not deemed acceptable. Such practices are not prevalent in any country worldwide. A 25 salary increase every three years for the 24,000 employees of the Electricity Board has been discontinued. Salary increments are allocated exclusively to employees who are actively working and demonstrate productivity. It is a common practice worldwide to provide salary increments selectively rather than uniformly across an organization. Similarly, bonuses distributed in April and December is contingent upon the companys profitability and is awarded solely to employees who contribute effectively. In collaboration with Indian loan assistance, plans are underway to equip government institutions and religious sites with solar panels. Each religious place will be provided with a five kilowatt solar panel, while government institutions will receive solar panels suitable for their roof sizes. The implementation of this project is scheduled to commence within the next two months. Attention has also been directed towards exploring nuclear energy options, with plans to incorporate it into the 2023-2042 generation plan. A comprehensive evaluation will determine the suitability and viability of nuclear energy for our country, and subsequent decisions will be made accordingly.",

In a preliminary test, the substance, a white powder, indicated positive for cocaine, according to an official familiar with the investigation and the recording of a dispatch from a D.C. fire crew that responded to the incident. A spokesman for the Secret Service, Anthony Guglielmi, said the substance is undergoing further testing to determine what it is, and authorities are looking into how it got into the White House. He said the D.C. fire department determined the substance did not present a threat. The discovery prompted an elevated security alert and a brief evacuation of the executive mansion, Guglielmi said. He said President Biden was not in the White House at the time. Guglielmi said there is an investigation into the cause and manner of how the substance entered the White House. Guglielmi declined to say specifically where in the White House the substance was found or how it was packaged. He said it was found by members of the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service conducting routine rounds through the building.

The convention, Indian travel trades premier annual event, is expected to invigorate Indian outbound travel to Sri Lanka following several years of setbacks, the national carrier said in a media release. The association plays a leading role in shaping Indias outbound tourism and represents all stakeholders in the Indian travel industry including airlines, tour operators, hotels and transport companies. This years convention is expected to draw approximately 450 agents and 50 international travel media personalities, some of whom are booked to fly to Sri Lanka on SriLankan Airlines. Renowned for generating widespread coverage and tourism footfall for the host country every year, the event will certainly help encourage Indian travellers to visit neighbouring Sri Lanka. A main theme of the 2023 TAAI convention is to strengthen regional tourism, which SriLankan Airlines said coincides with its regional hub strategy, with its prime location in the Indian Ocean extending connections to multiple countries to the north, east and west of India. Dimuthu Tennakoon, Head of Worldwide Sales  Distribution of SriLankan Airlines commented on the airline partnering with TAAI stating, India holds a special place in the history of SriLankan Airlines for many reasons, and this is reflected in the fact that nearly 40 per cent of our current operations are concentrated to India. We want to continue growing our presence in India with a strategic focus on leisure and MICE travellers and will introduce more flights and cities to our Indian service in the future. It is therefore exciting to collaborate with TAAI on their biggest calendar event, which serves as a strong starting point for a renewed future of travel between India and Sri Lanka. The convention is likely to boost the image of Sri Lanka as a safe, convenient and comfortingly familiar vacation spot among Indian travel industry players and travellers. An image, a reality, that SriLankan Airlines said it takes the initiative to promote through its communications in India. As Sri Lanka gets ready to welcome the guests of the TAAI convention, SriLankan Airlines vowed to continue in its role as the present-day maker of journeys between Sri Lanka and India, in a travel tradition dating back millennia.",

        "date": "July 5, 2023 09:00 am",
        "content": "The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) has published the 2023 Global Peace Index (GPI), compiling the annual ranking of the most peaceful countries in the world. This is the Sydney-based global think tanks 17th edition of the Global Peace Index which ranks 163 independent states and territories in total, according to their level of peacefulness. The GPI covers 163 countries comprising 99.7 of the worlds population, using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators and measures the state of peace across three domains:  Extent of ongoing domestic and international conflict  Level of societal safety and security  Degree of militarization This years results found that the world is a little less safe than last year, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The average level of country peacefulness deteriorated by 0.42 per cent in the 2023 Global Peace Index. This is the ninth consecutive year that global peacefulness has deteriorated. The average level of peacefulness has only improved twice year-on-year since 2008, the global think tank said. Sri Lankas rank dropped 18 places on the list to 107, as South Asia recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness over the past year and remains the second least peaceful region overall. The average level of peacefulness in South Asia increased by 0.13 per cent, owing to deteriorations in the Militarisation and Safety and Security domains. Four of the seven countries in the region experienced improvements in peacefulness, while three deteriorated. The IEP said there is a wide disparity between the least and most peaceful countries in South Asia, with Bhutan ranked 17th overall and Afghanistan being the least peaceful country in the world in the 2023 GPI. Meanwhile, Iceland has remained the most peaceful country in the world since the study was first released in 2008. It also ranks as the third happiest country in the world, after Finland and Denmark. More than 60 of the countrys population lives in the capital city of Reykjavik, according to National Geographic, In Iceland, school is free for all Icelanders through college, and every student is taught to speak Danish and English. Top 10 most peaceful countries in the world 1. Iceland 2. Denmark 3. Ireland 4. New Zealand 5. Austria 6. Singapore 7. Portugal 8. Slovenia 9. Japan 10. Switzerland The second country on the list is Denmark. Denmarks capital, Copenhagen, is home to institutions such as the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and serves as a hub connecting Northern Europe with the rest of the world, according to U.S. News and World Report. Although people living in Denmark pay some of the worlds highest taxes, up to half of their income, it is for a reason. Due to the high taxes, Denmark can offer its citizens most healthcare options with no fee, university students pay no tuition and receive a grant to help cover expenses while studying, childcare is subsidized, and the elderly receive pensions and are provided with care helpers who visit them at home, according to the countrys website. Ireland rounds out the top three. After Great Britain, Ireland is Europes second largest island. Ireland is known for its lush, green fields hence its nickname, Emerald Isle, according to National Geographic. Irelands population has increased by 10 percent in the last decade, according to a report released by the Central Statistics Office. According to the reports author, the countrys population growth is among the fastest in the European Union. - with inputs from agencies",

        "content": "It is out of question that Muthu Raja (Sak Surin) will have to return to Sri Lanka as he is now under the patronage of HM the King, said Thailands Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa on Wednesday. Muthu Raja, who arrived in Thailand on Sunday, quickly became familiar with his new environment, despite the fact that he had lived in Sri Lanka for 22 years. Commenting on a call from a senior monk in Sri Lanka for Bangkok to return the elephant once he fully recovers, Varawut said the matter is not even open for discussion. Sak Surin is now under the patronage of the King, so that is out question, Varawut said. Muthu Raja is currently in quarantine for 30 days, at the elephant conservation centre in Hang Chat district of Lampang province. The elephant seems to be in a good mood, shaking his head and enjoying his food. After the quarantine period, vets will conduct more thorough checks on him. Initial examinations show that Muthu Raja is suffering from a cataract in the right eye, its front left leg cannot bend, he has infected wounds on his hips and has problems with his nails and the soles of all four feet. Varawut also mentioned two other Thai elephants donated to Sri Lanka, Sri Narong and Pratupa, which remain there. He said it seems that Sri Lanka is capable of taking care of them and they are apparently in good health, although one of has suffered minor injuries. Some universities in Sri Lanka have contacted the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer to take care of the Thai elephants, claiming they have the capabilities to do so. -Agencies-",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to revive scrapped Japan-funded LRT project",
        "date": "July 5, 2023 12:18 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has decided to initiate diplomatic discussions with Japan on the revival of the Japan-funded Light Rail Transit (LRT) project. The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday (July 04) approved a proposal made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the matter. Accordingly, the government will prepare a timeframe to revive the previously scrapped LRT project and enter into an agreement following discussions with the Japanese diplomatic mission in Colombo. In March 2019, the Japanese government agreed to grant loan assistance of USD 1,800 million for the LRT system project which was to be implemented that year and completed by 2026, as a solution for the traffic congestion in the city of Colombo and its suburbs. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had agreed to provide financial facilities under concessionary credit conditions while the Oriental Consultants Global Company of Japan had agreed to provide consultancy services in collaboration with several other companies. On March 11, 2019, Japan and Sri Lanka signed the loan agreement and exchanged notes pertaining to the project, which had been designed to construct a 17km-long elevated rail track including 16 stations to cover important and major intersections from Malabe to Colombo Fort. Under the project, it had been proposed to deploy 25 trains for the service and each unit was supposed to comprise four air-conditioned passenger compartments to accommodate 800 passengers The total estimated cost of the project was Japanese Yen 246,641 million, and JICA was to provide JPY 200,415 million (approximately USD 1,800 million) as a concessionary loan. The company had provided the facility of paying the said loan over a period of 40 years including a grace period of 12 years and the annual interest rate thereon was 0.1 percent. However, in September 2020, the then-Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to terminate the project citing heavy operating costs, and environmental damage among other reasons. A report compiled by the National Audit Office in December 2022 revealed that Sri Lanka incurred a loss of Rs. 5,978 million after former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led government unilaterally terminated the LRT project. In May 2023, the current Cabinet of Ministers decided to green-light the revival of the project days before President Wickremesinghe departed for Japan for an official visit. The decision was taken in a bid to restore Sri Lankas credibility with the international community.",

        "date": "July 5, 2023 02:36 pm",
        "content": "The Taliban are banning womens beauty salons in Afghanistan, a government spokesman said Tuesday. Its the latest curb on the rights and freedoms of Afghan women and girls, following edicts barring them from education, public spaces and most forms of employment. A spokesman for the Taliban-run Virtue and Vice Ministry, Mohammad Sidik Akif Mahajar, didnt give details of the ban. He only confirmed the contents of a letter circulating on social media. The ministry-issued letter, dated June 24, says it conveys a verbal order from the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada. The ban targets the capital, Kabul, and all provinces, and gives salons throughout the country a months notice to wind down their businesses. After that period, they must close and submit a report about their closure. The letter doesnt give reasons for the ban. Its release comes days after Akhundzada claimed that his government has taken the necessary steps for the betterment of womens lives in Afghanistan. It drew criticism from human and womens rights defenders on social media. The United Nations on Tuesday also said it was engaged with the authorities in Afghanistan to get the ban on beauty salons reversed. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, took to Twitter, urging the Taliban to halt the edict. This new restriction on womens rights will impact negatively on the economycontradicts stated support for women entrepreneurship, it said. Earlier, one beauty salon owner said she was her familys only breadwinner after her husband died in a 2017 car bombing. She didnt want to be named or mention her salon for fear of reprisals. Between eight to 12 women visit her Kabul salon every day, she said. Day by day they (the Taliban) are imposing limitations on women, she told The Associated Press. Why are they only targeting women? Arent we human? Dont we have the right to work or live? Despite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous stint in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were pulling out. They have barred women from public spaces, like parks and gyms, and cracked down on media freedoms. The measures have triggered a fierce international uproar, increasing the countrys isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed  and have worsened a humanitarian crisis.

        "title": "Central Bank further reduces policy interest rates",
        "date": "July 6, 2023 07:55 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 200 basis points (bps) to 11.00 per cent and 12.00 per cent, respectively. The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on Wednesday (05 July), following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments, including the faster-than-envisaged disinflation process and benign inflation expectations in the domestic economy, with the aim of enabling the economy to reach its potential and stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term, while easing pressures in the financial markets, the CBSL said. The Board expects that, with this reduction of policy interest rates by 200 bps, and the reduction of policy interest rates by 250 bps in early June 2023, along with the significant reduction of risk premia on government securities witnessed recently, the market interest rates, particularly lending rates, will adjust downwards adequately and swiftly. Therefore, the banking and financial sector is urged to pass on the benefits of this significant easing of monetary policy by the Central Bank to individuals and businesses, thereby supporting economic activity to rebound in the period ahead, the statement said.",
