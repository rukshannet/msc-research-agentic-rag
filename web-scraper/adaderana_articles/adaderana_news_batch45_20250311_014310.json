        "date": "August 14, 2023 03:20 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Argentine voters punished the countrys two main political forces in a primary election on Sunday, pushing a rock-singing libertarian outsider candidate into first place in a huge shake-up in the race towards presidential elections in October. With some 90 of ballots counted, far-right libertarian economist Javier Milei had 30.5 of the vote, far higher than predicted, with the main conservative opposition bloc behind on 28 and the ruling Peronist coalition in third place on 27. The result is a stinging rebuke to the center-left Peronist coalition and the main Together for Change conservative opposition bloc with inflation at 116 and a cost-of-living crisis leaving four in 10 people in poverty. We are the true opposition, Milei said in a bullish speech after the results. A different Argentina is impossible with the same old things that have always failed. Voting in the primaries is obligatory for most adults and each person gets one vote, making it in effect a dress rehearsal for the Oct. 22 general election and giving a clear indication of who is the favorite to win the presidency. The October election will be key for policy affecting Argentinas huge farm sector, one of the worlds top exporters of soy, corn and beef, the peso currency and bonds, and ongoing talks over a 44 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund. The economic crisis has left many Argentines disillusioned with the main political parties and opened the door for Milei, who struck a chord especially with the young. Inflation is killing us and job uncertainty doesnt let you plan your life, said Adriana Alonso, a 42-year-old housewife. As polls closed in the early evening after voting system glitches caused long lines in capital Buenos Aires, all the talk in campaign hubs was about Milei, a brash outsider who has pledged to shutter the central bank and dollarize the economy. Mileis growth is a surprise. This speaks of peoples anger with politics, said former conservative President Mauricio Macri as he arrived at Together for Changes election bunker. CONSERVATIVE BULLRICH BEATS MODERATE LARRETA In the most important leadership race, within the Together for Change coalition, hard-line conservative Patricia Bullrich, a former security minister, beat out moderate Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Larreta, who pledged to get behind her campaign. Economy Minister Sergio Massa won the nomination for the ruling Peronist coalition, as expected, and could perform more strongly in October if he can win over more moderate voters. The unpredictable factor had been Milei, whose loud rock-style rallies are reminiscent of ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, but he far outperformed all forecasts. Most polls had given him just shy of one-fifth of the likely vote, though were also badly wrong four years ago in the 2019 primaries. Turnout was under 70, the lowest for a primary election since they started to be held in Argentina over a decade ago. Whoever wins in October, or more likely in a November runoff, will have big decisions to make on rebuilding depleted foreign reserves, boosting grains exports, reining in inflation and on how to unwind a thicket of currency controls. Jorge Boloco, 58, a merchant, said Argentina need a course into the future, but no party offered a clear way forward. Maria Fernanda Medina, a 47-year-old teacher, said she had also lost some optimism about politicians truly bringing change after many years of revolving economic crises. I dont have much hope because in every election I feel a little disappointed, she said as she cast her ballot in Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. But hey, we cant lose all hope, right?

Despite the removal of the security scanner in question, however, travellers will be subjected to the remaining two security checks prior to boarding their flight henceforth, AASL noted. They further stated that plain-clothed members of the airport security staff and Tri-Forces will also be stationed at the departure and arrival terminals at all times, while travellers will also be monitored throughout with 446 CCTV cameras.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Ousted President Bazoum to be charged with high treason, junta says",
        "date": "August 14, 2023 08:31 pm",
        "content": "Nigers military junta has announced plans to prosecute deposed President Mohamed Bazoum for high treason and undermining national security. This is the latest sign that the junta intends to resist international pressure to return power to Mr Bazoum. He has been held in the basement of his palace since the military staged a coup about three weeks ago. Mr Bazoum was in good spirits despite being held in difficult conditions, his doctor said after a visit. Saturdays visit was approved amid growing international demands for Mr Bazoums release. But in a sign that it is hardening its position, the junta said in a statement read out on state TV that it had gathered evidence to prosecute the deposed president and his local and foreign accomplices for high treason and undermining the internal and external security of Niger. It did not give further details. Mr Bazoum, 63, is being held captive with his wife and son and there were growing concerns about their health. Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, the head of the presidential guards unit, declared himself Nigers new ruler on 26 July after overthrowing him. The West African regional bloc Ecowas has threatened military action to reverse the coup, but it has so far failed to follow through on its threat. The coup leaders have warned they will defend themselves against any intervention. Ecowas has also imposed sanctions on the junta, including cutting electricity to Niger. This has caused blackouts in the capital Niamey, and other major cities. On Saturday, a high-powered delegation of Muslim clerics from neighbouring Nigeria met junta leaders in Niamey in a bid to mediate an end to the crisis. Junta-appointed Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine said he was optimistic that talks with Ecowas would take place in the coming days to discuss how the sanctions against us will be lifted. The coup in Niger mirrored similar takeovers in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali, amid an Islamist insurgency and a growing Russian influence in the wider Sahel region through its mercenary group Wagner. Despite his captivity, Mr Bazoum was able to publish an article in The Washington Post stating that he was a hostage and that the coup would have devastating consequences for our country, our region and the entire world. Mr Bazoum is reported to have lost a worrying amount of weight, while his 20-year-old son, who has a chronic medical condition, was also reportedly denied care. UN human rights chief Volker Turk described the conditions of the detention as inhumane, degrading and in violation of international human rights law. His daughter Zazia, 34, who was on holiday in France during the coup, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper last week that her father, mother and brother had no clean water or electricity and were living on rice and pasta. Fresh food was rotting in the fridge because there was no power, she said. Mr Bazoum has been seen once since he was overthrown, in a photo released after he met Chads leader Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno. Mr Déby met both the junta and Mr Bazoum soon after the coup in a failed bid to resolve the crisis. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "August 14, 2023 10:39 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Tourism and Lands Harin Fernando has highlighted the urgent need for a Policy for Tourism that does not change each time the countrys government or politicians change. Expressing his views at a news conference held at the Presidential Media Center today (14 Aug) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country, Fernando stated that measures in this regard have already begun, and that the relevant policy is due to be presented within the next two weeks. The minister mentioned that the policy, which was prepared after extensive study by the experts in the field, has now been forwarded to the cabinet, and the way of its operation will be presented to the country in the next two weeks. The minister who further commented said: With the correct economic program that President Ranil Wickramasinghe is taking to build this country, there is an awakening in the tourism sector today. Among the leaders who refused to take over the country, it must be said that it is a great pleasure to work with the president who fearlessly accepted the challenge. Development of the tourism sector can be pointed out as a major approach to solve the dollar crisis in the country. There is a modest happiness about the progress made today compared to the state of the tourism sector a year ago. President Ranil Wickramasinghe is making a great contribution to uplifting the countrys tourism industry. We should promote it more. Sri Lanka is a very beautiful country. But no one has yet understood the value of its beautiful. And this country is a treasure. We have not yet thought how to use it. The Presidents plan is to bring about the necessary change in attitude. Politicians who have ruled this country for the past 75 years are responsible for the situation this country suffers in present. But today a single person is implementing the necessary policies to move the country forward. We have already implemented the necessary program to make Sri Lanka a beautiful destination for tourists. Also, in order to further increase the number of tourists, many practical problems related to the tourism sector need to be solved. It is also expected to introduce a program in the future to reduce the existing traffic in places that have gained tourist attraction in the country. Also, a special program has been planned to ensure the safety of tourists together with the Ministry of Public Security. A mobile application for the convenience of tourists and a formal program to prevent various irregularities faced by foreign tourists are also going to be implemented. Also, we are on immediate working to prepare a policy for tourism. The tourism industry of the country needs a national policy that does not change when governments and politicians are changed. The countrys tourism policy cannot be changed just because the change of its minister. Therefore, after a long analysis, we have forwarded a new policy for tourism which was prepared by experts in the field to the cabinet. We will present the country how it will work, within the next two weeks. The challenge we had so far was to bring tourists to Sri Lanka. Also, the challenge to be faced in the future is how to maintain the quality of the tourism industry. Employees in the hotel industry in Sri Lanka leave for foreign jobs as soon as they get their first service certificate. Then another person is hired for it. I observe this situation as a big problem in the hotel industry in this country. We are taking immediate steps to solve that and other problems in the field as well. It has also been decided to hold an open short film festival on the beautiful places of Sri Lanka targeting tourists. It has been planned to select the best 10 short films through a jury consisting of experts in the field and give them financial rewards, as well as provide them with formal training. This program is planned to be held annually. Aiming at the promotion of the tourism industry, the ultra-luxury hotel of the Hilton Hotel chain is scheduled to be opened by the President on the 19th in Yala area. Along with that, it is planned to launch a series of tourism advertising programs. --PMD",

        "date": "August 15, 2023 09:28 am",
        "content": "Former US President Donald Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state of Georgia. He and 18 others have been indicted on counts that include racketeering in a 41-charge document issued by a Fulton County grand jury. The indictment marks the fourth time Mr Trump has been criminally charged this year. He has denied the accusations in all cases. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis launched an investigation in February 2021 into allegations of election meddling against Mr Trump and his associates. The list of defendants indicted late on Monday night includes former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former White House lawyer John Eastman and a former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark. The indictment says the alleged co-conspirators knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. The charge sheet also refers to the defendants as a criminal organization, accusing them of a number of crimes, including:  False statements and writings  Impersonating a public officer  Forgery  Filing false documents  Influencing witnesses  Computer trespass  Conspiracy to defraud the state  Theft and perjury The most serious charge, violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) Act, is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison. The act - designed to help take down organised criminal syndicates like the mafia - helps prosecutors connect the dots between underlings who broke laws and those who gave them marching orders. Mr Trump, currently the frontrunner in the Republican Partys race to pick its next candidate for the White House, said the investigation by Ms Willis, a Democrat, was politically motivated. In a statement, the Trump campaign described the district attorney as a rabid partisan who had filed these bogus indictments to interfere with the 2024 presidential race and damage the dominant Trump campaign. This latest co-ordinated strike by a biased prosecutor in an overwhelmingly Democrat jurisdiction not only betrays the trust of the American people, but also exposes the true motivation driving their fabricated accusations, said the statement. There was confusion earlier on Monday when a list of a criminal charges against Mr Trump appeared on a Fulton County website before the grand jury had even voted to return an indictment. The filing said Mr Trump had been charged with racketeering, conspiracy to commit fraud and making false statements. A spokesperson for Ms Willis said the document was fictitious but did not explain how it ended up on the courts website. Mr Trump and his allies seized on the apparent clerical error to claim the process was rigged. Mr Trump has already been charged by federal prosecutors in Washington DC with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden, a Democrat. That charge sheet devoted significant time to the Trump teams activities in Georgia. Ms Willis investigation focuses specifically on Georgia, a key battleground state for the US presidency that Mr Trump narrowly lost. In January 2021, Mr Trump was recorded on a phone call asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find 11,780 votes, the number he would have required to beat Mr Biden in that state. At least eight fake electors, who signed a bogus certificate claiming Mr Trump won the election in that state, have reached immunity deals in the case after agreeing to interviews with Fulton County prosecutors.

He also revealed that an inter-city express train service between Thalaimannar and Colombo will commence on 15 September aiming at enhancing connectivity and facilitate smoother travel between the two cities. It is also noteworthy that President Wickremesinghe participated in the morning service of the feast this year. Subsequent to the main ceremony, a revered statue of Lady Madhu was respectfully carried in procession throughout the church grounds to pay homage to the devoted attendees. A significant number of devotees from various parts of the island gathered for the annual feast. The year 2024 marks the completion of 100 years since the enshrinement of the revered statue of Lady Madhu. The church management board has decided to hold services throughout the year to commemorate this occasion. Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe, the Vatican Apostolic Nuncio of Sri Lanka, who attended the main service, commended President Wickremesinghes statement in Parliament regarding National Peace and Reconciliation. He mentioned that this statement has received the blessings of the Vatican and the Catholic Church. Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe emphasized that religious leaders have a crucial role in maintaining peace and harmony in the country. He also stressed that whether a religious figure divides or unites the country is determined by their own actions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented: It must be acknowledged that the annual feasts of the National Shrine of Lady Madhu are an integral part of our local culture. Therefore, considering this festival as a national event, the government bears the responsibility of safeguarding and supporting its continuation. Furthermore, on this occasion, I extend the governments gratitude to all the clergy who dedicate themselves to organizing the annual Madhu feast. Numerous devotees come here to seek solace through prayers to Lady Madhu. During last years economic crisis, a substantial number of devotees gathered here to pray for Lady Madhus assistance and protection. It can be said that Lady Madhus blessings provided us with strength during that challenging time. The Mannar region, where the National Shrine of Lady Madhu is located, possesses abundant renewable energy resources. With access to solar, wind, and green energies, the Mannar district can be developed into an energy hub. We have also formulated plans to transform Punarin into an energy city. It is important to note that all these development initiatives are designed to preserve this sacred land and its forests. I have instructed officials to seek advice and guidance from the clergy here during these development efforts. An inter-city express train service from Thalaimannar to Colombo is scheduled to commence on the 15th of September. This service is being launched in response to the request of MP Charles Nirmalanathan. Additionally, steps have been taken to establish a sugar factory in Vavuniya, as requested by MP Selvam Adekkalanathan. Cabinet approval has been obtained for this project. These measures aim to facilitate rapid development in these regions. Through these endeavors, we aspire to build a developed Sri Lanka by 2048. I count on your support in achieving this goal. The event was attended by bishops led by Bishop of Mannar Dr. Emmanuel Fernando, clergy including President of the Christian Development Foundation of Sri Lanka Dr. Chandru Fernando, Minister of Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake, Minister Naleen Fernando, State Minister Arundika Fernando, Kader Mastan, Member of Parliament Kavinda Jayawardene, Selvam Adekkalanathan, Charles Nirmalanathan, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Presidents Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, and a large number of devotees.",

The issue had originated after the land owners initially demanded a compensation of Rs. 48 million following a private estimate and then Rs. 9.6 million pursuant to Asian Development Bank (ADB) criteria, while the CEB had agreed to pay Rs. 1.6 million in compensation for the loss of land to lay a 630-meter power cable which would allow the Southern Province to be connected to CEBs main transmission line.

        "date": "August 15, 2023 07:08 pm",
        "content": "The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka, has renewed its demand for a federal system with self-determination rights, amidst President Ranil Wickremesinghes efforts to implement the 13th amendment to the Constitution, PTI reported on Tuesday. Last week, President Wickremesinghe made a special address to Parliament, urging all political parties to collaborate in the implementation of the 13A while excluding police powers. However, TNA leader R Sampanthan in a letter addressed to the President on Monday reiterated the partys commitment to a federal solution, the report said. We have repeatedly obtained a mandate from the Tamil populace in the north and east to work towards a political solution based on a federal structure consonant, with the right of self-determination in the area of our historical habitation, the letter stated. Recalling Indias pivotal role in 1987 on 13A, the veteran Tamil leader reminded Wickremesinghe that, despite the devolution of powers to the provinces envisioned by the amendment, the constitutions unitary nature has at times led to the central government reclaiming the devolved powers. India offered its good offices in 1983, which were accepted by the Sri Lankan government, culminating in the signing of the Indo-Lanka accord on July 29, 1987, he said in the letter. The TNA urged Wickremesinghe to expeditiously implement all the powers granted to the provinces in the Constitution and hold the long-delayed provincial council elections. The 13A was brought in after the India-Sri Lanka agreement of 1987. It created nine provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces. The elections for the nine provinces have been on hold since 2018 following a move to introduce electoral reforms. It now needs a parliamentary amendment to enable the elections to be held under the existing proportional representation system. President Wickremesinghe has been reiterating that he would bring in the 13A amendment to make the system of provincial councils more meaningful by reducing the central governments powers to curb their functioning. He has said the stalled provincial council elections could be held after the Parliaments agreement on their powers. Source: PTI -Agencies",

        "content": "Chinese oil major Sinopec expects to start operations in Sri Lanka on Sept. 20 and will be allowed to sell fuel for less than the maximum retail price set by the government, Sri Lankas power minister said on Tuesday. Sinopecs entry into Sri Lanka will help reduce pressure on Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves, and the island nation expects two other international fuel operators to start operations by October and November, Kanchana Wijesekera said. Reducing pressure on our foreign exchange with Sinopecs entry will also help us increase fuel imports and strengthen the economy, Wijesekera told reporters. Australias United Petroleum and U.S. firm RM Parks in collaboration with Shell are the other two companies that have received approval. The entry of the new players will end a market duopoly of state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corp and Lanka IOC, a unit of Indian Oil Corp. Under the new deal, the Chinese firm will be given a 20-year licence to operate 150 fuel stations and will also be able to invest in 50 new fuel stations. Sri Lanka is grappling with its worst financial crisis since independence from the British in 1948 with reserves at 3.8 billion at the end of July. The islands economy was severely hit last year by spiralling energy costs worsened by the war in Ukraine, which caused long lines at fuel stations and hours-long power cuts. Sinopec and Vitol have also been shortlisted for a refinery project in southern Sri Lanka and we expect their request for proposals to be handed over at the end of August, Wijesekera added. The refinery project is expected to cost as much as 4 billion and has been in talks since 2019 Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Although Sri Lanka has not given the green signal to Shi Yan 6 yet, reports said Indias strategic community is expecting the island nation to give its nod. Indian media raised concerns that the development comes as Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently visited India and assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the country will take care of Indias sensitive security and strategic concerns. According to Indian media reports, Shi Yan 6, a substantial weight of 3,999 tons and originating from Guangzhou, is presently situated within the South China Sea and is currently navigating in a southern direction. Speculations are rife that researchers affiliated with Sri Lankas National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) are set to commence a scientific expedition aboard the vessel Shi Yan 6, while the primary objective is to carry out an extensive survey encompassing both the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the island nation and the region of the southern Indian Ocean. The Indian government has released no official word on the matter but as per Hindustan Times, the officials are engaging with Sri Lanka at the highest diplomatic levels. In August 2022, controversy prevailed as Chinese high-tech research vessel known as Yuan Wang 5, successfully moored at the harbour of Hambantota. -with inputs from agencies",

        "date": "August 16, 2023 07:57 am",
        "content": "(AP)  The death toll from a powerful explosion near the Dominican Republics capital rose to 11 on Tuesday, with dozens injured. Firefighters were searching through smoldering rubble as people gathered outside hospitals, looking for missing loved ones. President Luis Abinader visited San Cristobal, located just west of Santo Domingo, to meet with those affected. Officials said an additional 10 people were missing and that authorities were still trying to extinguish the fire amid collapsed buildings and charred vehicles. The search for survivors has been very difficult, Abinader said. The explosion occurred Monday afternoon at a bakery, with authorities investigating what might have caused the blast as they vowed to take action if a business was not operating to proper standards. Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Emergency Operations Center, said at a press conference Tuesday night that responders had found the remains of unidentified people inside one building but were waiting on forensics to determine the number of bodies. Mondays explosion also left more than 50 people injured as the blast tore through a bustling commercial center in San Cristobal, authorities said. At least 36 of the injured remained hospitalized, said Joel Santos, minister of the presidency. Estefani Alcántara said her family was shopping when the explosion occurred. Her uncle, 42, is hospitalized with serious injuries and her aunt is still missing. We dont know if shes dead or alive, she said with tearful eyes as she waited outside a local hospital, feeling full of frustration, pain and distress. Meanwhile, Jeni Benzan de los Santos said her sister and baby niece died in the explosion, and that her father remains missing. They wont let me into the morgue to see if I can identify my father, she said. The countrys emergency telephone system said the explosion occurred at a bakery in the citys center, a bustling area known as Old Marketplace, where people buy goods ranging from vegetables to clothes. The fire then spread to a hardware store next door and a nearby furniture store. More than 500 first responders and officials responded to the explosion, which destroyed four buildings and damaged nine others, Méndez told reporters. Among the victims was a 4-month-old baby who died from head trauma and a woman who worked at a bank, officials said. José Ramón Ramírez Rivera, the owner of a local veterinary clinic, told reporters that one of his 15 employees is still missing. An office wall fell on top of me, he recalled. I couldnt breathe. Juan Jiménez, a farmer who lives several miles away, said he thought it was thunder at first, given the usual storms that occur in August. He is now waiting for information on his female cousin, a 31-year-old professor who remains missing. Smoke still engulfed the city center on Tuesday, and Health Minister Daniel Rivera urged everyone to wear face masks. This smoke is mixed with chemicals, he warned. Rivera and other officials went door to door to ensure that people had masks and determine whether they had any respiratory or skin problems. He also visited patients at a local hospital, where people were still searching for loved ones. The first 24 hours are very important, he said, adding that injuries included burns, fractures and respiratory problems. Abinader said the government would set up two mobile hospitals to provide further treatment, including psychological services to those affected. Meanwhile, Santos said the government is launching an investigation to determine whether the business where the explosion occurred was operating under proper regulations. It wasnt clear what caused the explosion, and authorities have not provided a preliminary estimate of damages. These catastrophes have an order of priority: save lives, save assets, ensure that the incident is extinguished and then assess damage, Santos said at a news conference. San Cristobal, the birthplace of dictator Rafael Trujillo, was the site of another explosion nearly 23 years ago. An arms depot exploded in October 2000, killing at least two people and injured more than two dozen others, forcing authorities to evacuate thousands. Source: AP --Agencies",

The lawmaker expressed these views while joining the press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre on Tuesday (Aug. 15) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Indigenous medical service in our country has existed as a quality medical service for a long time. Beyond that, the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine and the Department of Ayurveda have now started the program to develop the indigenous medicine sector as an industry that can generate foreign exchange with commercial value, Jayakodi commented further. The state minister, stating that necessary amendments would be made to the Ayurveda Act, subject to the Supreme Courts orders, mentioned that the top court has approved the clauses regarding the cultivation of medicinal plants necessary for the promotion of the following export sector in the county and the generation of foreign exchange. With the aim of boosting the tourism sector, the state minister said a new program is in progress to provide the contribution of the indigenous medical system to tourist hotels as a treatment method that goes beyond traditional methods. The program has already started producing well-trained certified therapists, he added. Jayakodi also spoke of the potential to promote the indigenous medicine as a sector that can generate incredible foreign exchange. Today there is a very high demand for herbal products all over the world. Also, the cosmetics industry is a place where billions roam today. Also, indigenous medicine has a special place in the field of tourism. The state minister also pointed out that many new trends have been made in the indigenous medicine system and Ayurvedic system in order to build a healthy population in the country as well as to solve the problems that have arisen in the health sector.",

        "date": "August 16, 2023 09:59 am",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has disclosed that the government has incurred a loss of Rs. 78 million due to a failed project for the construction of a radar system provided by the World Meteorological Organization in Gongala area. This was brought to light when the Department of Meteorology (DOM) officials appeared before the COPA meeting earlier this week under the chairmanship of State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna to examine the auditor generals report and current performance for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Through this project implemented in 2008, approximately Rs. 402 million had been spent on the said radar system and Rs. 323 million had been given by the World Meteorological Organization. It was also disclosed that before bringing this project to Sri Lanka, an officer of the DOM had inspected this machine and informed them not to bring it to Sri Lanka as it was not in working condition. Officials of the Auditor Generals Department stated that many years have passed for the preparation of a road to the relevant location and the equipment has become obsolete. They then pointed out that due to the collapse of the crane carrying this and the road, some equipment has been destroyed and the rest of the equipment is missing. It was disclosed that investigations by the police and the Bribery and Corruption Commission are underway. Therefore, the COPA emphasized the need for effective projects to be implemented quickly by the Meteorology Department to provide accurate forecasts with modern technology instead of such projects which have incurred huge losses and have completely failed. Inquiries were made regarding the existing reports about the current drought situation not being accurately predicted. The DOM Director General said that he was informed about this during the Monsoon discussions held last April with the Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority and related government institutions and other regional countries. However, the COPA pointed out that the relevant institutions did not provide them with the relevant information, so until the situation is resolved through an Act, a Cabinet decision or a joint mechanism should be prepared with all the relevant institutions. It was also instructed to report to the COPA in this regard within a month. The COPA also looked into whether there was data on the progress made in achieving the published predictions. However, it was revealed that there is no such program and the committee advised to prepare a formal program quickly and report within a month considering the situation in other countries of the world. While 453 rain gauges were installed, 73 of them have remained inactive. Furthermore, despite 122 automatic rain gauges being installed in 2018, special attention was paid to the fact that 70 remain inoperative to date. The DOM was instructed to present a program within a month to install these rain gauges properly and get the data immediately.",

The Appeals Courts verdict on the petition was initially supposed to be delivered on July 25.

        "date": "August 16, 2023 05:42 pm",
        "content": "Commemorating the 77th Independence Day, India officially handed over a substitute Dornier-228 maritime surveillance aircraft to Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security, Sagala Ratnayake today (16 Aug). Accordingly, the substitute Dornier-228 maritime surveillance aircraft, to be used by the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF), was handed over at a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Air Force Base in Katunayake today, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The substitute surveillance aircraft was handed over today as the Dornier-228 aircraft handed over to Sri Lanka a year ago was sent to India for obligatory yearly maintenance, the PMD said. During the bilateral security discussions that transpired between India and Sri Lanka on January 9, 2018, in New Delhi, the potential acquisition of maritime surveillance aircraft akin to the Dornier type from India was brought to attention. The aim was to bolster Sri Lankas capabilities in maritime surveillance. In response to Sri Lankas request, the Indian government took proactive measures during these deliberations. They decided to provide a Dornier-228 maritime surveillance aircraft, which was part of the Indian Navys fleet, to Sri Lanka free of cost for a span of two years. The formal handover of this aircraft took place at the Sri Lanka Air Force Base Katunayake, with Mr. Baglay officiating. Upon its delivery, the Dornier-228 aircraft was instrumental in performing specialized tasks within Sri Lanka over the past year. Subsequently, it underwent mandatory annual maintenance services in India. Since its initial arrival in Sri Lanka, the Dornier-228 maritime surveillance aircraft has significantly contributed to numerous operations, including the monitoring and safeguardingof Sri Lankas airspace and exclusive economic zone through maritime and coastal surveillance operations, executing search and rescue missions, and monitoring and controlling maritime pollution. The official handover of the successor aircraft to Sri Lanka was attended by a delegation representing the Sri Lankan Government, including Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Gopal Baglay, the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, General Kamal Gunaratne (Rtd) Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and other officials. Following is the speech delivered by Mr Sagala Ratnayaka during this event; It was just one year ago that we were here at a similar ceremony when the President accepted the first of the Dornier aircraft into the Sri Lanka Air Force fleet. Our friends, our neighbouring friends, were gracious enough to assist us. It is not only with this aircraft that we have received Indias assistance. Its been a longstanding relationship, but in more recent times, when we were going through the economic crisis, India stepped up beyond the call of duty to lend us a hand. We were having difficulty in providing the basics to our people, leaving alone our responsibilities in the region, such as the maritime reconnaissance or the maritime domain awareness work that is expected of Sri Lanka, considering its location in this important location in the Indian Ocean. I remember when President Wickremesinghe was here at that function, he made very special mention of this. And we, in our recent visit to India, have developed a closer bond and a vision for how we will work together in the future as well. Connectivity is the key word. Its a big word, actually. It has a wide area of meaning. It can be road connectivity, it can be people to people connectivity, economic connectivity, logistical connectivity, security connectivity, you know, its a large sphere. And we as neighbours cannot change the fact that we are neighbours. We will have to work together to ensure the safety of each other. We will have to also make mention that at difficult times the American Government and the government of Australia also stepped up in the area of maritime security to assist the Sri Lanka Air Force and the Sri Lanka Navy with much needed fuel. It sounds very primitive when I talk of fuel but that is the time we went through. Much needed fuel, and not stopping at that have also pledged further assistance to help us expand our fleet. Our fleet suffered during the economic crisis. It wasnt only the people, but many other things suffered, and along with that came the difficulties of fleeting the Sri Lanka Air Force. Our aircraft were in want of overhaul. We had to re-fleet to keep up with technology and the modern requirements. And this entire program has suffered. So again, I must say we are very grateful to India for supporting us through this. You were the first to step up and as always, we are very grateful to you for that. There was in the previous speeches the value of maritime reconnaissance and our responsibility in the maritime domain. It is actually a little beyond that. Okay, in one way you have to ensure the security. And security means preventing drug smuggling, preventing the transport of or smuggling of weapons, and people smuggling or even pirating. But it doesnt stop at that. It also goes into humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. All of these are required of us as a country that is located in a prime location as we are in this Indian Ocean. But we have to think beyond. Now, when the Sri Lanka Air Force started, these were not our threats. The threats have evolved over the time. Then came the war. During the war it was a different role that we played. Our role is different now and it keeps changing. And within the role, the demands will only keep increasing because everybodys technology will keep improving. It is important that we as a country strategize our requirements for the future, the three forces, the defence requirements of the three forces of Sri Lanka. We need to start thinking of that. We need to start thinking of how we modernize our armies, what our strategies would be and we will be starting on that work or we have started on that work as we speak. His Excellency the President will announce the way forward on Friday when he speaks at the naval pass out in Boossa. But we have to think beyond we were speaking on the tarmac, that deforestation is happening rapidly. Sand mining is happening. All of this takes away from the future of our country. So we need to work together to safeguard our environment. We can be in this prime location, we can have the best potential for solar energy, we can have the best potential for wind energy, we can be a strong force in the climate economy. But if our environment is going to keep deteriorating due to the bad deeds of our own people, then we need to make more steps towards stopping that. So the Air Force, the Navy, the Army, along with the other agencies that are tasked with these will have to work together, coordinate together to ensure that we safeguard the environment for the future of our country and for the future generations. I know His Excellency the High Commissioner has a meeting today with our Foreign Minister very shortly, so I dont want to keep speaking very much longer. I just want to say thank you again and thank you very much to the Sri Lanka Air Force for the efforts you have taken since the war to safeguard this country.",

        "content": "Algeria has banned the popular Barbie film three weeks after its release in the mainly Muslim North African nation. The culture ministry has asked cinemas to withdraw the Hollywood blockbuster immediately. The movie promoted homosexuality and did not comply with Algerias religious and cultural beliefs, an official source told the Reuters news agency. Cinemas in the cities of Algiers, Oran and Constantine have been packed, according to 24H Algérie news website. The film was officially being banned for damaging morals, the privately owned news website said, adding that since its release viewings had sold out every day. There has been criticism in the Arab world about the movies social values, with Kuwait banning Barbie last week to protect public ethics. The film, starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is a coming-of-age story based on the childrens toy, where Barbie journeys to the real world and explores her identity. Around the time of the films release, director Greta Gerwig told the New York Times that it was supposed to be funny and that her hope for the movie was for society to let go of the things that arent necessarily serving us as either women or men. Barbie has received a warmer welcome from leaders in other countries, such as the UK and Spain, where British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Spanish royal family were pictured on cinema outings to see it. Since the movies release it has grossed more than 1bn (786m) worldwide. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "State Minister of Irrigation Shashendra Rajapaksa has announced the recent completion and opening of the Diaraba Reservoir as part of the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose Development Project. This achievement brings an additional 120 megawatts of electricity to the national power grid and facilitates the cultivation of 15,000 acres of paddy fields in the Yala basin. Highlighting the Ministry of Irrigations pivotal role, the State Minister emphasized its significant contributions to President Ranil Wickramasinghes initiative for bolstering national food production. This concerted effort underscores the nations commitment to ensuring food security within the country. He expressed these views today (16) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). State Minister Shashendra Rajapaksa further said; The Ministry of Irrigation plays a substantial role in supporting the national food production initiative led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, ensuring the countrys food security. The management of cultivated land and irrigation water follows a systematic approach. The Ministry of Irrigation functions as a proactive entity, addressing challenges arising from current weather conditions with effective management. Collaborative efforts are in place, working closely with the Ministries of Agriculture, Plantation Industry, Electricity, and Water Supply, alongside the Department of Wildlife and Forest Conservation. This coordinated approach safeguards water sources, prioritizes agriculture while preserving ecosystems, and caters to drinking water, hydropower, industry, and wildlife needs. This years budget allocations have been strategically utilized for key projects, including the multi-phase climate mitigation program, integrated water resources management project (Dhahara), and Wav Gam Pubuduwa projects. District-level irrigation plans have been recently devised, prompting the commencement of a repair project for approximately 3,000 identified irrigation structures across 25 districts. Dilapidated culverts and tank embankments are being revitalized through this endeavour. Significantly, the filling of the Diaraba Reservoir within the Uma Oya Project began on the 13th, marking a notable hydroelectric venture. This project is set to contribute 120 megawatts of power to the national grid and facilitate the cultivation of 15,000 acres of paddy fields in the Yala and Maha seasons. These outcomes will soon bolster the National Food Security Program. Moreover, discussions are underway to address drinking water challenges in Monaragala and Badulla districts. To enhance water management decision-making, a mechanism empowered by the legal authority is being established, bringing together various institutions such as the Meteorological Department, Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority, and Electricity Board. In essence, the Ministry of Irrigation is dedicated to ensuring the irrigation water needs for agriculture and enhancing the populaces nutritional well-being, thus solidifying the countrys national food security.",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 07:47 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Public schools on Maui started the process of reopening and traffic resumed on a major access road in signs of recovery a week after wildfires demolished a historic town and killed at least 110 people, while the head of the islands emergency agency said he had no regret that sirens werent sounded to warn people about the encroaching flames. At least three schools untouched by flames in Lahaina, where entire neighborhoods were reduced to ash, were still being assessed after sustaining wind damage, said Hawaii Department of Education superintendent Keith Hayashi. The campuses will open when theyre deemed safe. Theres still a lot of work to do, but overall the campuses and classrooms are in good condition structurally, which is encouraging, Hayashi said in a video update. We know the recovery effort is still in the early stages, and we continue to grieve the many lives lost. Elsewhere crews cleaned up ash and debris at schools and tested air and water quality. Displaced students who enroll at those campuses can access services such as meals and counseling, Hayashi said. The education department is also offering counseling for kids, family members and staff. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened its first disaster recovery center on Maui, an important first step toward helping residents get information about assistance, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Wednesday. They also can go there for updates on their aid applications. Criswell said she would accompany President Joe Biden on Monday when he visits to survey the damage and bring hope. Meanwhile, transportation officials said the Lahaina Bypass Road, closed since Aug. 8, was open again, allowing residents access to some areas near the burn zone during specified hours. Herman Andaya, Maui Emergency Management Agency administrator, defended not sounding the sirens during the fire. We were afraid that people would have gone mauka, he said, using the Hawaiian directional term that can mean toward the mountains or inland. If that was the case then they would have gone into the fire. There are no sirens in the mountains, where the fire was spreading downhill. Hawaii created what it touts as the largest system of outdoor alert sirens in the world after a 1946 tsunami that killed more than 150 on the Big Island. Andaya said they are primarily meant to warn about tsunamis and have never been used for wildfires. The website for the Maui siren system says they may be used to alert for fires. With the death toll rising by four since Tuesday to 110, a mobile morgue unit with additional coroners arrived in Hawaii on Tuesday to help with the grim task of sorting through remains. Search and recovery crews using cadaver dogs had scoured approximately 38 of the burn area by Tuesday, officials said. The number of canine teams was increasing to more than 40 because of the difficulty and scope of the operation, FEMA said. The dogs need to rest frequently because of the terrain and heat. Searchers combing through the ashes found some of Lahainas most vulnerable residents, including children, among the victims. Gov. Josh Green said this week that teams found a family of four killed in a charred car and the remains of seven family members inside a burned-down house. Just over a quarter of Lahainas 13,000 residents are under age 18, according to Census Reporter, an organization that analyzes U.S. Census data. Another 10 are 71 or older. Kimberly Buen was awaiting word Wednesday of her father, Maurice Shadow Buen, a retired sport fisherman who lived in an assisted-living facility that was destroyed. The 79-year-old was blind in one eye, partially blind in the other and used a walker or an electric scooter to get around. In recent weeks, he also had swollen feet. For him, there is no moving quickly, Buen said. The stories from survivors who fled the fast-moving flames terrified her. If able-bodied people were having to run and jump into the ocean, I can only imagine whats happened to the assisted living and the lower income and the elderly people that didnt have warning, you know, or have any resources to get out, she said. Bill Seidl, 75, lived in the same complex. His daughter, Cassie Seidl, of Valencia, California, said her father knocked on doors before escaping. I think people were assuming it was just another brushfire, she said. I dont think people realized, and they were not warned. Seidl said her father made his way to a nearby mall and slept outside for two days, eating and drinking little to nothing. Hes now camping on a friends property in Wailuku. On Tuesday, the county released the names of two victims: Lahaina residents Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79. They were the first of five who have been identified. Maui Police Chief John Pelletier renewed an appeal for families missing relatives to provide DNA samples. Sacred Hearts School in Lahaina was destroyed and Principal Tonata Lolesio said lessons would resume in the coming weeks at another Catholic school. She said it was important for the students to be with their friends, teachers and books, and not constantly thinking about the tragedy. Im hoping to at least try to get some normalcy or get them in a room where they can continue to learn or just be in another environment where they can take their minds off of that, she said. None of the roughly 3,000 public school students in Lahaina were in classes last Tuesday when the fires started. The education department had closed several West Maui campuses because of dangerously high winds and many students stayed home while their parents worked, according to survivors accounts. Thousands of displaced residents were staying in shelters, hotel rooms and Airbnb units, or with friends. The power company restored electricity to over 10,000 customers but around 2,000 homes and businesses still had none Tuesday night, according to Maui County. The governor said Wednesday that he has instructed the states attorney general to institute a moratorium on land transactions in the Lahaina area. Green said he has heard of people he described as not even in real estate reaching out to ask about purchasing land owned by people in the disaster area. My intention from start to finish is to make sure that no one is victimized from a land grab, he said, adding that the state would provide more details Friday. The cause of the wildfires, already the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century, is under investigation. Green has warned that scores more bodies could be found. The Lahaina fire caused about 3.2 billion in insured property losses, according to Karen Clark  Company, a prominent disaster and risk modeling company. It said more than 2,200 buildings were damaged or destroyed by flames, with about 3,000 damaged by fire, smoke or both. John Allen and his daughter surveyed an ash-gray landscape once festooned with colorful orchids and plumerias from a hill above the Lahaina fire zone. His daughter wept as she pointed to the coffee shop where she used to work, and the places they used to live. Allen moved to Maui two years ago after leaving Oakland, California, where he witnessed a destructive wildfire race up hillsides in 1991. No one realizes how quickly fires move, Allen said.

Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Foreign Minister, made the remarks during a meeting with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at the sidelines of the seventh China-South Asian Expo in Kunming, southwest Chinas Yunnan Province. China is always Sri Lankas reliable strategic partner and appreciates that Sri Lanka has always been friendly to China and has stood by China on issues related to its core interests, he said. China also firmly supports Sri Lanka in safeguarding its sovereign independence and national dignity, and is willing to strengthen exchanges of experience in governance as well as cooperation in various fields with Sri Lanka, he said. Wang vowed that China will help Sri Lanka improve its capacity for independent development, get rid of the poverty trap and the trap of non-development, accelerate its industrialization process and agricultural modernization. He expressed belief that Sri Lanka will overcome its temporary difficulties, find a development path in line with its national conditions, and realize revitalization and prosperity. Noting that Sri Lanka is an important participant and beneficiary of the China-South Asia Expo, he welcomed the Sri Lankan side to continue to make good use of this important platform to further explore the Chinese market. For his part, Gunawardena thanked China for its firm support for Sri Lanka in safeguarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for its timely and effective assistance to Sri Lanka in times of difficulty. The forward-looking flagship cooperation projects between the two sides such as the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port will bring benefits to the Sri Lankan people and play a key role in regional connectivity and sustainable development, he said. Sri Lanka will work with China to expand cooperation in economy, trade and investment, agriculture, tourism, energy and innovation to help Sri Lanka achieve food self-sufficiency and accelerate the development of key industries, he added.

        "title": "Sri Lankas GDP allocation for education is among lowest in South Asia - UNICEF",
        "date": "August 17, 2023 10:00 am",
        "content": "The Ministry of Education (MOE) and UNICEF have jointly spearheaded a national initiative to help 1.6 million primary schoolchildren impacted by prolonged school closures and sporadic disruptions to their education over the past three years, to catch up on their learning. According to an Education Ministry-led national assessment, 85 of Grade 3 children are not achieving minimum proficiency in literacy and numeracy, which is essential in their transition to secondary school and beyond, both in life and work, a media release issued by UNICEF read. The event, held under the leadership of Minister of Education, Dr. Susil Premajayantha along with Christian Skoog, the UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka, was attended by government and development partners. According to UNICEF, Sri Lanka currently allocates less than 2 of its GDP on education, which falls well below the international benchmark of 4-6 of GDP and is among the lowest in the South Asia region. There is an urgent need to increase the national budget allocation for education, especially for primary grades, where we need to boost foundational learning for children, while also ensuring the implementation of vital Education Reforms so that we can build the solid human resource skills needed to support the countrys development, said Minister Premajayantha. UNICEF noted that the learning crisis has affected vulnerable children the most, including younger children in primary grades and those in plantation estates in the country. The basics of literacy, numeracy, and social economic skills are the platform on which children build their own, their families, their communities, and their countrys future, said Christian Skoog, UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka. We commend the MOE for its commitment to undertake urgent efforts to reverse the widening disparities in learning achievement for children who are lagging further behind, including slow learners, and missing out due to the continued hardship the country faces, Skoog added. In July, the Education Ministry and UNICEF held a special briefing on Learning Recovery to leverage the support of development partners, while more technical-level workshops were held across nine provinces, to identify gaps and prioritize actions.",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 11:40 am",
        "content": "Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha says steps will be taken to modify the preschool education system according to international standards. Joining an event held in Colombo, he stated that formal training will also be given to preschool teachers who havent obtained proper training and that the necessary arrangements for training will be made soon. Explaining the unevenness of the quality of countrys preschool education, the Minister said children who receive different types of education at preschools are enrolled in grade 01 at school. When one preschool provides activity-based learning, another preschool teaches to count up to 10, while another one teaches to count up to 100. But, all these children enter the grade 01, he added. The Minister, who mentioned that preschool education in Japan is entirely focused on activity-based learning, added that it is the internationally-accepted standard method. Therefore, we should prepare the framework for the two years of education provided by preschools in keeping with international standards. After that, we should start a certificate course for teachers who havent obtained proper training, followed by a diploma. We need to ensure that the teachers are qualified to teach in a preschool. Furthermore, he promised to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Child Affairs, the National Institute of Education and other professionals.",

        "title": "More than 60 migrants feared dead after boat capsizes off West Africa",
        "date": "August 17, 2023 11:40 am",
        "content": "More than 60 people are feared dead after a boat carrying migrants was found off Cape Verde in West Africa. Thirty-eight people, including children, were rescued, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal. Almost all those on board the boat, which was at sea for over a month, are thought to have been from Senegal. Cape Verde officials have called for global action on migration to help prevent further loss of life. The vessel was first spotted on Monday, police told the AFP news agency. Initial reports suggested the boat had sunk but it was later clarified that it had been found drifting. The wooden pirogue-style boat was seen almost 320km (200 miles) off Sal, a part of Cape Verde, by a Spanish fishing boat, which then alerted authorities, police said. The survivors include four children aged between 12 and 16, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. The boat left the Senegalese fishing village of Fasse Boye on 10 July with 101 people on board, Senegals foreign ministry said on Tuesday, citing survivors. Moda Samb, an elected official in the village, told AFP news agency nearly all those on the boat had grown up in the community and that some local families were still waiting to hear whether their relatives were among the survivors. The ministry said it was liaising with authorities in Cape Verde to arrange the repatriation of Senegalese nationals. The passengers other countries of origin reportedly include Sierra Leone and, in one case, Guinea-Bissau. Jose Moreira, a health official on Sal, said the survivors were improving and were being looked after, with a focus on rehydration and tests for conditions like malaria. Health Minister Filomena Goncalves said: We know that migration issues are global issues, which require international co-operation, a lot of discussion and global strategy. We all - all the nations - have to sit down at the table and see what we can do so that we dont lose any more lives at sea, above all. IOM spokeswoman Safa Msehli said safe pathways for migration were sorely lacking and that their absence gave room to smugglers and traffickers to put people on these deadly journeys. The survivors may have ended up in Cape Verde, but it was almost certainly not their intended destination. The archipelago sits around 600km off the coast of West Africa and on the migration route to the Canary Islands, a Spanish territory seen by many as a route to the EU. According to the IOM, it is one of the most dangerous journeys any migrant can make. As ever with irregular migration, exact figures are hard to come by, but between 2020 and 2023 at least 67,000 people arrived in the Canary Islands. Over that same period, just over 2,500 lost their lives. The IOM point out that figure covers the deaths that have been registered. Given the irregular and secretive nature of the route, the true figure could be far higher. So, what is driving people to leave their homes and risk such a dangerous journey? In many cases, poverty is thought to be a key factor. Europe is seen by many as a route to a better life for the person migrating, as well as remittances to support the families they leave behind. There are, however, other factors at play as well. Much of West Africa is increasingly unstable, with coups and Islamist insurgencies making an already difficult situation worse. In Senegal, opposition politicians have been imprisoned, with claims of violent crackdowns by the authorities. President Macky Sall recently announced he would not seek a third term in office, but tensions remain high. In the end, there are as many reasons to migrate as there are people on the move. Each person has their own motivation, their own story. It seems at least 60 of those came to a traumatic end in the Atlantic ocean. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Google reportedly building A.I. that offers life advice",
        "date": "August 17, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "One of Googles AI units is using generative AI to develop at least 21 different tools for life advice, planning and tutoring, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Googles DeepMind has become the nimble, fast-paced standard-bearer for the companys AI efforts, as CNBC previously reported, and is behind the development of the tools, the Times reported. News of the tools development comes after Googles own AI safety experts had reportedly presented a slide deck to executives in December that said users taking life advice from AI tools could experience diminished health and well-being and a loss of agency, per the Times. Google has reportedly contracted with Scale AI, the 7.3 billion startup focused on training and validating AI software, to test the tools. More than 100 people with Ph.D.s have been working on the project, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke with the Times. Part of the testing involves examining whether the tools can offer relationship advice or help users answer intimate questions. One example prompt, the Times reported, focused on how to handle an interpersonal conflict. I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just cant afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I wont be able to come? the prompt reportedly said. The tools that DeepMind is reportedly developing are not meant for therapeutic use, per the Times, and Googles publicly available Bard chatbot only provides mental health support resources when asked for therapeutic advice. Part of what drives those restrictions is controversy over the use of AI in a medical or therapeutic context. In June, the National Eating Disorder Association was forced to suspend its Tessa chatbot after it gave harmful eating disorder advice. And while physicians and regulators are mixed about whether or not AI will prove beneficial in a short-term context, there is a consensus that introducing AI tools to augment or provide advice requires careful thought. We have long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate our research and products across Google, which is a critical step in building safe and helpful technology, a Google DeepMind spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. At any time there are many such evaluations ongoing. Isolated samples of evaluation data are not representative of our product road map. --Agencies",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 12:39 pm",
        "content": "China has made a remarkable change in the international economic pattern to transfer its achievements to the global South for the betterment of mankind, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says. PM Gunawardena stated this on Wednesday (Aug. 16) in Kunming, China at the 7th China-South Asia Exhibition jointly organized by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Yunnan State Government. He attended the event as the chief guest. A total of 60 countries are participating in this giant trade exhibition, including all South and Southeast Asian countries as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation (RCEP) member countries. The exhibition includes 15 exhibition halls, including a biomedical and healthcare pavilion, a resource economic pavilion and a regional cooperation pavilion, with a total area of 150,000 square meters. This exhibition is scheduled to be held until August 20 under the theme of Cooperation and Coordination for Development. State Ministers Tharaka Balasuriya, Janaka Wakkambura and Kanaka Herath, MPs Yadamini Gunawardena, and Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake, are accompanying PM Gunawardena during this visit. Addressing the expo, PM Gunawardena commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for his tremendous leadership in the efforts to alleviate poverty and achieve economic growth. Further, PM Gunawardena conveyed warm wishes to the officials of Yunnan Province for the success of China-South Asia Exposition, bringing a larger segment of Asian countries together. This proudly speaks achievements in the backdrop of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. He said China and Sri Lanka have often regarded each other as good friends and a special relationship has existed between the two countries. He acknowledged with gratitude the unwavering support rendered by China to Sri Lanka for national sovereignty and integrity and for continuing to stand by the island nation during challenging times. I would like to reiterate that Sri Lanka continues to uphold the One China Policy in all spheres including bilateral and multilateral fora and I wish to affirm our commitment in this regard. Speaking further, the Sri Lankan prime minister recalled how China helped Sri Lanka during the devastating global Covid-19 pandemic and Sri Lankas recent economic crisis, through various humanitarian assistance, including RMB 500 million for fuel to farmers and fishermen, staple diet of rice to school students, and 70 of school uniform requirement for the year 2023. We acknowledge with appreciation that China has extended much-needed support in the debt restructuring process, which was essential to secure international support. We are confident that China will extend continued cooperation in the future towards Sri Lankas broader economic recovery. Speaking on major Chinese development projects in Sri Lanka including the Hambantota Port, Hambantota Industrial Zone, Mattala Airport, and Colombo Port City, PM Gunawardena said investments from China are critical to propelling Sri Lankas economy. He also called for more governmental and private sector investment, trade, cooperation, and ventures into Sri Lanka. With regard to Chinese tourist arrivals, PM Gunawardena said this has been one of the key strengths of the Sri Lankan tourism industry. He appreciated the announcement made in February this year by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism, placing Sri Lanka among the Top 20 countries for tourism. Further, PM Gunawardena called for a joint effort between Sri Lanka and China to boost tourism. Let us not forget that This Century Belongs to Asia. This is Asias Century, he added. He went on to note that the continuous leadership of the Communist Party of China has guided China to emerge on the path of Socialism with Chinese characteristics as a true decisive global giant with a grand new era of development, especially in Asia, Africa,  Latin America, and towards the prosperity of all nations.",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 12:43 pm",
        "content": "One of the largest cities in Canadas far north is being evacuated amid warnings that a wildfire could reach it by the weekend. The 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, have been given until noon Friday (18:00 GMT) to leave. As of late Wednesday, the fire was within 17km (11 miles) of the city. Another fire is threatening the community of Hay River. One evacuee told the CBC her car began melting as she and her family drove through embers while fleeing the town. The Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency late on Tuesday as it battles more than 200 wildfires. Shane Thompson, the regions environment minister, told a press conference on Wednesday that the fires had taken another turn for the worse and now represented a real threat to Yellowknife. I want to stress that the city is not in immediate danger, he said. But without rain, it is possible the fire will reach the city outskirts by the weekend. You put yourself and others at risk if you choose to stay. Hay River Mayor Kandis Jameson estimated that about 500 people were still in the community of some 3,500 people as of Tuesday despite an evacuation notice issued for the town over the weekend. The fire moved 30km in a few hours because of strong winds earlier this week, closing the only two highways out of the town. The road out of Hay River is treacherous, the mayor said, and food and petrol supplies are getting low in the town. Phone and internet services have also been down in the remote region. Resident Lisa Mundy described how her bumper had begun to melt, her windscreen had cracked and her car had filled with smoke as she and her husband left the town with their two children on Sunday. You couldnt see anything  we were driving through embers, she said. My six-year-old son actually said to me, I dont want to die, mommy, and he kept saying it so many times. Canadas military has been co-ordinating airlift operations out of several communities in Northwest Territories South Slave Region that have been threatened by wildfires in recent days. It is the largest airlift evacuation effort in the territorys history. Most evacuees have been brought south to the neighbouring province of Alberta, with no indication as to when they will be able to return home. Fort Smith, Katlodeeche First Nation, Hay River, Enterprise and Jean Marie River are all under evacuation orders. Enterprise, home to 120 people, is 90 gone after a wildfire swept through this week, the communitys mayor told the CBC on Tuesday. Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 1,100 active fires burning across the country as of Wednesday. Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason. Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

The current government which has no mandate is trying to amend the labour laws that people fought for and won in the history of the world, not just in Sri Lanka, he said. The world worked for 08 hours in the 1800s. At present, people work for 6 hours only. There are no laws in the world to employ women at night. He said that providing them with night shifts in its place is not the solution and that instead, the government should provide the working people with the necessary facilities. Not to work overtime. Give them a wage they can live off when they work for 08 hours. We will continue to carry out the necessary campaigns to defeat these labor laws by gathering the working people of the country, Samarasinghe added.",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 03:56 pm",
        "content": "British broadcaster Michael Parkinson, best known for interviewing some of the worlds biggest celebrities on his long-running eponymous chat show, has died aged 88, the BBC said on Thursday. Born in Yorkshire in northern England, he left school at the age of 16 with dreams of becoming a professional cricketer before turning to local newspaper journalism. After moving into current affairs television in the late 1960s, he was given his own prime-time chat show Parkinson by the BBC in 1971. Michael was the king of the chat show and he defined the format for all the presenters and shows that followed, said BBC Director General Tim Davie. He interviewed the biggest stars of the 20th century and did so in a way that enthralled the public. Michael was not only brilliant at asking questions, he was also a wonderful listener. Parkinson, who became affectionately known as Parky, estimated he had interviewed more than 2,000 guests in total, with the most high-profile including Muhammad Ali, Elton John, John Lennon and Madonna. He was the greatest interviewer of our age who owned Saturday night TV for year after year, BBC journalist Nick Robinson said in a post on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Parkinson was also known for two uncomfortable interviews with actors Helen Mirren and Meg Ryan. With Mirren he was accused of sexism after he asked if her physical attributes had hindered her career and whether her figure could detract from her performance. With Ryan, the two engaged in a frosty, terse interview before Ryan told him to wrap it up. Parkinson later said he regretted getting angry with the actress. In 2013 Parkinson revealed he was receiving radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer, but got the all-clear from doctors two years later. After a brief illness Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family, a family statement said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 04:52 pm",
        "content": "New York City on Wednesday banned TikTok on government-owned devices, citing security concerns, joining a number of U.S. cities and states that have put such restrictions on the short video sharing app. TikTok, which is used by more than 150 million Americans and is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has faced growing calls from U.S. lawmakers for a nationwide ban over concerns about possible Chinese government influence. TikTok posed a security threat to the citys technical networks, the administration of New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement. New York City agencies are required to remove the app within 30 days and employees will lose access to the app and its website on city-owned devices and networks. New York State had already banned TikTok on state-issued mobile devices. TikTok said it has not shared, and would not share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government, and has taken substantial measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok users. Top U.S. security officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director William Burns have said TikTok poses a threat. Wray said in March that Chinas government could use TikTok to control software on millions of devices and drive narratives to divide Americans, adding the app screams of national security concerns. Former President Donald Trump in 2020 sought to bar new downloads of TikTok, but a series of court decisions blocked the ban from taking effect. Many U.S. states and cities have restricted TikTok on government devices. Montana recently passed a bill banning the app across the state, a rule set to go into effect on Jan. 1 and being challenged legally. Close to half of American adults support a ban on TikTok, according to a new ReutersIpsos survey released on Wednesday. Source - Reuters -Agencies",
