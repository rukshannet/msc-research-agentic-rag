        "title": "Britain to stop those arriving illegally from staying",
        "date": "March 5, 2023 10:03 pm",
        "content": "Anyone arriving illegally in Britain will be prevented from staying, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in an interview published on Sunday, ahead of new legislation which is expected to be set out next week. Under pressure from his own lawmakers to find a solution to the flow of migrants arriving in Britain across the channel from Europe, Sunak has made stopping small boats one of his five key priorities. Make no mistake, if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay, Sunak told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. Under current practice, asylum seekers who reach Britain are often able to remain in the country to have their case heard. A new law to tackle the issue is due to be set out on Tuesday, the newspaper reported, after more than 45,000 people made the perilous crossing last year. Asylum applications to the United Kingdom are below the European Union average, official data shows. Last year, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed a deal to send tens of thousands of migrants, many having made the journey from Afghanistan, Syria or other countries suffering war, more than 4,000 miles away (6,400 kms) to Rwanda. The policy has faced a legal battle after the first planned deportation flight was blocked by a last-minute injunction granted by the European Court of Human Rights. It was ruled lawful by Londons High Court in December, but opponents are seeking to appeal that verdict. Asked on Sky News whether those arriving in Britain illegally would be banned from claiming asylum, government minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: I believe so, yes. Should people come to this country illegally then they will be returned or sent to somewhere like Rwanda. The Mail on Sunday reported that under the new law asylum claims from those who arrive on small boats would be ruled inadmissible and they would be removed and permanently banned from returning. Our laws will be simple in their intention and practice - the only route to the UK will be a safe and legal route, interior minister Suella Braverman told the Sun on Sunday newspaper. Heaton-Harris said he believed more safe and legal routes would be made available as part of the plan. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas northern fishermen fiercely oppose proposal to issue license to Indian fishermen",
        "date": "March 6, 2023 09:38 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas northern fishermen on Sunday said they fiercely oppose the governments plan to issue licenses to Indian fishermen to enter Sri Lankan waters, terming the move a serious setback to their nearly 15-year-long struggle. On February 22, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Parliament that authorities were looking into possibly issuing licences to Indian fishermen, as part of Sri Lankas efforts to find a solution to the long-persisting fisheries conflict, through cordial bilateral talks. This was discussed this with Indian Foreign Minister JaishankarSri Lankas priority is to safeguard fishermens livelihoods, the countrys marine resources, and find a long-term solutionIndia has proposed this licensing system as a solution, and we are holding discussions on it, he said, adding that such a system would help Indian authorities better regulate their fishermen, and will also bring in money that could be used for Sri Lankan fishermens betterment. About 2,000 to 3,000 Indian trawlers come to our seas every day and our Navy is unable to control that, Mr. Sabry further noted. The Ministers remarks have sparked serious concern among northern fishermen, said Annalingam Annarasa, who leads a Jaffna-based fishermens association. We are very worried, this will be a serious setback to our struggle for the last 15 years to stop Indian trawlers from entering our seas, he told The Hindu. Moreover, some political actors are trying to turn fishermen of our two countries against each other, using this problem. We need an urgent solution to this. Fisher leaders including him on Sunday put forward this view to Tamil MPs representing northern districts and sought their support to resist the Sri Lankan governments proposal, and to urge Colombo to fully implement Sri Lankan laws that ban bottom trawling and illegal fishing. Following the meeting, Jaffna MP M.A. Sumanthiran  whose Bill against bottom trawling was passed by the Sri Lankan parliament in 2017  said the legislators across parties agreed that no permits should be issued to Indian trawlers. Even without permits, Indian trawlers are already entering Sri Lankan waters and destroying marine resources. Issuing licenses will only aggravate the problem, he said, adding that the MPs and fisher leaders would make a joint call to the government. The fisheries conflict affecting fishermen of Sri Lanka and India has remained a thorny issue in Indo-Lanka bilateral ties. From the time Sri Lankas civil war ended in 2009, Tamil fishermen living in Sri Lankas northern districts have consistently protested Indian trawlers  originating from Tamil Nadu  fishing along their coastline, citing the destruction they cause to marine biodiversity and their livelihoods that are closely tied to it. Sri Lankan fishermen also frequently report serious damage to their fishing nets and gear, and huge losses, owing to the bottom trawlers. Despite several rounds of bilateral talks and discussions among fishermens representatives from either side of the Palk Strait, the problem is yet to be resolved, leaving the northern Sri Lankan fisher folk, who are struggling to resurrect their war-battered livelihoods, in a precarious situation. In 2016, the two governments agreed to expedite the transition towards ending the practice of bottom trawling at the earliest, acknowledging the Sri Lankan fishermens demand as genuine. However, with no solution in sight, northern fishermen have continued to agitate. Last year, they wrote to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, seeking his intervention to decisively address the issue. They submitted multiple petitions to the Indian missions in Sri Lanka as well. The proposed licensing system will undermine fishing as a way of life for the next generations of Sri Lankan fishermen, according to Ahilan Kadirgamar, a senior lecturer at the University of Jaffna, who researches northern livelihoods. The fishermens struggle since the end of the war has been to find a diplomatically negotiated solution to this serious problem caused by Indian trawlers. They feel both the Sri Lankan and Indian governments have betrayed them, he said. Source - The Hindu -Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2023 10:02 am",
        "content": "A massive fire at a crammed camp for Rohingya Muslims in southern Bangladesh left thousands of the refugees homeless Sunday, a fire official and the United Nations said. No casualties were reported at Balukhali camp in Coxs Bazar district, said Emdadul Haque, a fire service official. The UNHCR in Bangladesh said in a tweet that Rohingya refugee volunteers responded to the fire with the agency and its partners providing support. It provided no further details. More than 1 million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar over several decades, including about 740,000 who crossed the border starting in August 2017, when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown. Conditions in Myanmar have worsened since a military takeover in 2021, and attempts to send back the refugees have failed. Last year, the United States said the oppression of Rohingya in Myanmar amounts to genocide after U.S. authorities confirmed accounts of mass atrocities against civilians by the military in a systematic campaign against the ethnic minority. Muslim Rohingya face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where most are denied citizenship and many other rights. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

The damage caused by the fire has not been estimated as of yet. Dimbula Pathana Police, who are investigating the fire, mentioned that the cause of the fire is suspected to be electrical short. Meanwhile, President of Kotagala Traders Association, Viswanathan Pushpa said that the shops in Kotagala city will remain closed for a few hours today, protesting against the lack of support from the Fire Fighting Unit of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) or the Dikoya urban councils fire brigade to control the fire that broke out in the city.",

        "content": "New Zealander Georgina Beyer, the worlds first openly transgender member of parliament and tireless advocate for LGBTQ rights, has died at the age of 65. She had long battled kidney disease but statements about her death did not mention the cause. A former sex worker, actor and drag queen, Beyer was elected to national parliament in 1999 after several years as mayor of Carterton, a rural town on the countrys North Island. She served as a Labour MP until 2007. Made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II in 2020 for services to the rainbow community, she was known for her work in the legalisation of civil unions and gay marriage as well as the decriminalisation of prostitution. Speaking before parliament on the issue of prostitution reform in 2003, she said: I support this bill for all the prostitutes I have ever known who have died before the age of 20 because of the inhumanity and hypocrisy of a society that would not ever give them the chance to redeem whatever circumstances made them arrive in that industry. Of Maori descent, she ran again for parliament for the former Mana Party in 2014 but was unsuccessful. Beyer received a kidney transplant in 2017 after four years of end-stage renal failure that required daily dialysis. She died in hospice care on Monday, according to a Facebook post by Scotty Kennedy, a friend. Georgie was surrounded by her nearest and dearest 247 over the past week, she accepted what was happening, was cracking jokes and had a twinkle in her eye, right until the final moment, Kennedy wrote. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said Beyer made a lasting impression on parliament. I certainly think that Georgina blazed a trail that has made it much easier for others to follow.

The Police Special Task Force (STF) stated that the arrested male suspect is an active serving member of the Sri Lanka Navy. Wanted criminal Booru Moona, who is said to be involved in 13 murders including killing the owner of a shop in Hanwella on December 18, 2022, had arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on February 24 to board a flight to Dubai using a forged passport. At that time, the suspect was arrested by the airport police, on account of receiving information from immigration officials. Later, three Buddhist monks had arrived at the airport police station to inquire about Booru Muna who was under arrest, and in the meantime, the latter had managed to flee in a car. However, at the time of his arrest, the suspect had confessed that after the murder of the shop owner in Hanwella, he was hiding in a house located on Malwatta Road in Millaniya, Bandaragama. Accordingly, the police launched an investigation and it was revealed that the married couple living in the said house that had sheltered Booru Muna had also fled the area. Later, the duo was arrested in Nuwara Eliya yesterday (March 05), following extensive investigations. Police have uncovered that the 35-year-old arrested male suspect is actively serving in Sri Lanka Navy, and that he has not reported to duty following the relevant incident. Earlier, two Buddhist monks and a Police Sergeant attached to airport police were arrested and remanded in custody in connection with the incident of Booru Muna escaping from police custody.",

        "date": "March 6, 2023 06:56 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans media regulator has banned television channels from broadcasting speeches and news conferences by Imran Khan, accusing the former prime minister of attacking the states institutions and promoting hatred. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) imposed the ban late on Sunday after Khan gave a speech in the eastern city of Lahore, where he alleged that former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was behind his removal from power in April last year. The cricketer-turned-politician made the speech after police from the capital Islamabad made an attempt to arrest him in a corruption case. Khan, who denies the charges, evaded the arrest. In its notification, the PEMRA said Khan was levelling baseless allegations and spreading hate speech through his provocative statements against state institutions and officers which is prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and is likely to disturb public peace and tranquillity. This was the third time the PEMRA has banned TV channels from airing Khans statements since he lost the premiership and started holding mass rallies to demand immediate national elections. News channel suspended Nearly two hours after the ban, the media regulator also suspended the licence of ARY News, a private news channel, for broadcasting Khans Lahore speech. The PEMRA said the news channel  considered sympathetic to Khan  violated its order. But an ARY official rejected the allegation. The PEMRA statement came after 8pm and almost all the channels ran clippings of Imran Khans speech in their 9pm bulletins. However, the regulatory authority suspended only our licence, the ARY official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned the regulators decision to ban the airing of Khans speeches on electronic media. We have always opposed measures to curb voices in the past  whether under the previous government or earlier  and we continue to stand by our commitment to freedom of speech, irrespective of the persons political opinion, it said in a statement, demanding that the ban be lifted immediately. PEMRA is a tool Hammad Azhar, a politician belonging to Khans Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, said the country was fast descending into darkness and there were concerted efforts by the government to put its democracy under threat. This ban on Khans speeches is not only unconstitutional as it goes against freedom of expression  There cannot be a blanket ban on speeches of politicians. Other than questions of legality, it is also extremely anti-democratic in nature, he told Al Jazeera. This regime is petrified of Imran Khan and his ever-soaring popularity, he is now seen as a prime minister-in-waiting. We are seeing police action against Khan and the party workers. There is a media crackdown. We are fast becoming a fascist state. Former PEMRA chief Absar Alam said the implementation of law in Pakistan is flawed and the media regulator needs to improve itself. PEMRA has become a tool; whoever can use it often does it for their interest, he told Al Jazeera. Alam, however, added that the TV channels should take responsibility for what they broadcast. There is so much polarisation in Pakistan that one persons virtue is another persons sin. Unfortunately, media has amplified this a lot and they are not following media ethics or showing professionalism, he said. Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) last year ranked Pakistan 157 among 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index list. Source - Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2023 08:38 pm",
        "content": "A suicide bomber killed nine police officers and wounded 16 others Monday in an attack on their truck in southwestern Pakistan, officials said. Security forces have been battling a years-long insurgency by militants in Balochistan demanding a bigger share of the provinces wealth, as well as attacks by the Pakistan Taliban (TTP). The suicide bomber was riding a motorbike and hit the truck from behind, senior police official Abdul Hai Aamir told AFP. The incident took place near Dhadar, the main town of Kachhi district, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of Quetta in Balochistan. Photos of the aftermath showed the police truck upside down on the road with its windows shattered. Mehmood Notezai, police chief for Kachhi district, told AFP the officers were returning from a week-long cattle show where they had been providing security. There has been no claim of responsiblity for the attack. Terrorism in Balochistan is part of a nefarious agenda to destabilise the country, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement released by his office. The country is facing overlapping political, economic and environmental crises, as well as a worsening security situation. Attacks on the rise Attacks have been on the rise in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban seized control of Kabul in August 2021, emboldening militant groups along the border which have increasingly targeted security forces. Last month five people died when a TTP suicide squad stormed a police compound in the port city of Karachi. It came just weeks after a bomb blast at a police mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar killed more than 80 officers -- an attack claimed by a group sometimes affiliated with the TTP. Despite different ideological, ethnic and political outlooks, (militant groups) are all franchises bound by one objective: to hit the security forces and instil a sense of fear and uncertainty in Pakistan, said Imtiaz Gul, an analyst with Islamabads Center for Research and Security Studies. Balochistan, which borders both Afghanistan and Iran, is the largest, least populous and poorest province in Pakistan. It has abundant natural resources, but locals have long harboured resentment, claiming they do not receive a fair share of its riches. Tensions have been stoked further by a flood of Chinese investment under Beijings Belt and Road Initiative, which locals say has not reached them. China is investing in the area under a 54 billion project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, upgrading infrastructure, power and transport links between its far-western Xinjiang region and Pakistans Gwadar port.

        "content": "China has given assurances that it will support Sri Lankas debt restructuring, clearing the biggest hurdle for the South Asian nation to secure a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Sri Lankas largest bilateral creditor gave written support for the debt restructuring via the Export-Import Bank of China on March 6, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified as the information isnt public. The letter meets the requirements of the IMF, the people said. China Eximbank didnt immediately reply to request for comment. The office of Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whos also the finance minister, hasnt responded to calls for confirmation. Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe hasnt picked up calls to his mobile phone. Chinas backing completes the support Sri Lanka needs from creditor nations to allow the IMF board to approve the loan that was agreed upon by the Fund staff in September. Sri Lanka had anticipated the boards nod by the end of 2022 although it has since adjusted expectations to within this quarter. The bailout will pave the way for more funding and set the bankrupt nations debt restructuring on a steadier path since last years default. While paralyzing supply shortages in the island nation have eased, foreign currency reserves have been inching up and inflation somewhat cooling, the nation needs the IMF loan to get more funding and turn the corner. IMF financial support can only be provided for countries with sustainable debt. For countries with unsustainable debt, IMF financing may proceed before a debt restructuring is completed if official bilateral creditors provide the IMF with adequate assurances that they will take steps to help restore debt sustainability. In the past months, Sri Lanka has increased taxes, cut energy subsidies and loosened its grip on the currency to secure the IMF loan. Authorities recently boosted borrowing costs further to ensure that inflation which has come off nearly 70 doesnt flare up while loosening grip on the currency to strengthen market confidence. China accounts for 52 of the nations bilateral debt. India and the Paris Club of creditors have previously given their support to the debt restructuring thats dragged since Sri Lanka defaulted in May last year. The troubled economy seeks to turn the corner after the bailout, expecting inflation to ease to single-digit levels by the end of 2023 as tourism and remittances pick up.

        "date": "March 7, 2023 12:28 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has assured that efforts are underway to ensure economic growth. Speaking at this mornings (07 March) Parliamentary session, the Head of State said that efforts are now being made to ensure economic growth, after several key economic decisions were taken, although extremely difficult. He further explained that although severely unpopular, the economic measures were taken to stabilize the countrys deteriorating economy, and that economic growth is now being ensured, gradually, despite the ongoing suffering inflicted on the society as a whole, as a consequence. Meanwhile, speaking on the provision of fertilizer, Wickremesinghe stated that with the aid of the fertilizer provided to farmers, the country achieved successful Yala and Maha harvests, adding that the export level of agricultural goods has also regained a fair degree of normalcy. During his speech, the President also noted that the countrys economic problems have also been resolved to a certain extent since June 2022. Following is the full speech delivered in Parliament by President Ranil Wickremesinghe; In mid-March 2022, the Government decided to seek the assistance of the IMF as a positive solution to Sri Lankas economic crisis. When the foreign exchange crisis worsened thereafter, in mid-April 2022, it was declared that it was impossible to pay the countrys foreign debt. Since then, Sri Lanka has operated as a bankrupt economy. All of you in this country have experienced its negative impact. By mid-2022, this country has experienced many problems such as fuel queues, gas queues, electricity cuts, food shortages, difficulties in procuring medicines, inflation, depreciating rupee, and increasing poverty. It is a fact which everyone accepts that the country has never experienced such a catastrophic situation in modern history. The economic problems that existed since June 2022 have gradually been resolved to some extent. Due to the provision of fertilizer, we achieved a good harvest last year during the Yala and Maha seasons. The export of agricultural products also returned to normalcy. In order to gradually solve the economic problems of the country, a stabilization program was entered into. The Government implemented a suitable program for this purpose. I would like to place some of them before this august assembly. The Government has implement various measures to ensure the availability of gas and petroleum, proper functioning of schools and examinations, providing continuous electricity supply, providing fertilizer and allocating additional funds for Samurdhi beneficiaries. Also, the Government had to go back to the same tax policy implemented in 2019. After the emergency tax cuts implemented at the end of 2019, Government revenues fell by as much as 8 of GDP. To restore it we had to go for new tax policies. Similarly, interest rates had to be raised under the Central Banks monetary policies. Raising interest rates was a positive step we had to take in order to control the rising inflation. By September last year, average inflation had risen to around 70. Food inflation crossed the 90 mark. However, currently the rate of inflation has decreased to approximately 50, and food inflation has also dropped to 54. Additionally, due to a shortage of foreign exchange, exchange regulations were tightened, and imports were limited. Following the announcement of Sri Lankas inability to pay its foreign debt, foreign nations and financial institutions imposed restrictions on financial transactions with the country. This included the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) who ceased providing new funds, leading to the suspension of nearly all foreign aid projects. Sri Lanka was also unable to open Letters of Credit (LC) and its credit rating was downgraded to the point where lending to the country was not advisable. Given the aforementioned restrictions, Sri Lanka was able to acquire foreign exchange through various means, including  Exports  Remittances from foreign workers  Income generated from tourism In 2022, the unfavourable conditions in the country resulted in an unsuccessful tourism industry. However, there are indications that the situation is improving this year. Although foreign exchange remittances decreased to one-third of the level in normal conditions, they show a tendency of increasing. Sri Lanka still faces a shortage of foreign currency to import inputs that could also help boost export earnings. Starting in 2021, the IMF has been issuing consistent warnings about Sri Lankas economic crisis, specifically regarding the foreign exchange crisis. Since mid-2022, discussions between the IMF and Sri Lanka have been on-going, with regular delegations visiting the country for extensive talks concerning the balance of payments, fiscal crisis, and foreign exchange crisis. Additionally, the IMF has emphasized the need for implementing long-overdue structural reforms, stating that there is no room for delay. We had a staff-level agreement with the IMF by September 1, 2022, but the IMF stated that the agreement couldnt be presented to the Executive Board until our country achieves debt sustainability. To achieve debt sustainability, the Government continued discussions with creditors and sought the help of international agencies like Lazard and Clifford Chance. The discussions were lengthy and complex. Accordingly, discussions were held with both Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors, including India and China, who have provided loans to Sri Lanka, to secure financing assurance. India provided their assurance on January 16, 2023, while China extended their assurance on January 18. The Paris Club agreed to provide financing assurances to Sri Lanka at their meeting held on January 25, 2023. In addition, we had lengthy discussions with India and China as well. Subsequently, I discussed with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva on the fund facility by the IMF on March 2. Last evening I discussed with the current secretary of the Treasury of the United States, Janet Yellen as well. The Government had to fulfil the requirements set by the IMF, which included revisions to electricity tariffs and fossil fuel prices, ensuring the independence of the Central Bank, and increasing interest rates to control inflation, reforming public enterprises, strengthening the social safety net, working to increase public revenue and controlling public expenditure. Expanding competition in the petroleum and electricity sectors had to be done in advance. Those tasks that Sri Lanka should have done proactively have been completed by now. I am aware of the hardships that the people of this country had to suffer. As a Government, we apologize for that. We received the letter of financial assurance from Exim Bank of China last night. Accordingly, on the same night, I and the Governor of the Central Bank signed the letter of agreement and forwarded it to the IMF. Now our duties are done. I hope that before the end of this month, by the fourth week, the IMF will do its duty. After that we get the first round of money from the World Bank and ADB. This time, there is no room for failure in completing every task agreed upon with the IMF, unlike the previous 16 occasions. If Sri Lanka fails to fulfil the tasks agreed upon with the IMF, it could result in the IMF discontinuing its collaboration with the country, and this could in turn lead to other multilateral and bilateral financial institutions being unable to work with Sri Lanka. Accordingly, if the existing agreement with the IMF is breached, foreign economic activities will be largely hindered, and we would have to pay loans taken from foreign countries and private banks. An annual amount of approximately Rs. 6-7 billion of foreign loans are due to be paid until 2029, and we do not have the foreign exchange to pay this debt. Thus, we need the IMF to continue the agreed debt sustainability discussion with foreign creditors. The agreement with the IMF is of special importance to restore our economy, and there is no alternative path to be seen at present. Therefore, I would like to remind you that the agreement with the IMF is an agreement with special importance to restore our economy. We took many extremely difficult economic measures to stabilize the economy. Efforts are now being made to ensure economic growth. The suffering caused by this continues for everyone in our society. Amidst a difficult and complex situation, we have worked hard for the past seven to eight months to bring about a positive state. Economic reforms are crucial to move forward, and it is important for everyone in the country to understand this. Various influential groups, including political parties, voluntary organizations, and trade unions, should consider this deeply. Professionals have highlighted that the tax burden is high. However, this situation should be maintained for a short period of time. Otherwise, if this program is disrupted, the country will be pushed to a far more dangerous place than the state it was in during February- March 2022. At that time, many people thought that salaries would be lost, pensions would be lost, jobs would be lost, industries would be closed, schools would be closed, etc. We have controlled this situation to a certain extent. However, if the groups that can influence the society disrupt the program that we have proposed through various measures, the social alternative that will emerge from it will be extremely dangerous. It could lead to period of unprecedented woes in our society. Therefore, we accept the peoples right to freedom of speech. But that should be done peacefully. Holding meetings and holding protests is not a problem. But I would like to say that if this program is disrupted through this agitation, this government will act strongly on it. I must say one thing, right now the dollar price is going down. If this country had collapsed on July 9th, this situation would not exist today. There was no support from anyone at that time. I would like to express my thanks to the armed forces and the police who acted to uphold peace in the country. As a result of their efforts, we have fuel and electricity today. Also, before long dollars will be available. Therefore, we will not allow these sinister forces to destabilize this program. I invite the Opposition to join us in this endeavour of stabilizing the countrys economy. After accomplishing this, we can decide on holding the presidential election and general election. The country would take this decision. Until then, I am asking you if you are ready or not. You can accept this, or reject it. The countrys income situation should be considered especially by mid-June. Accordingly, it is from there that decisions could be made. Once the IMF agreement is reached, the agreement would be tabled in Parliament. I request the House to accept it or give an alternative. Following that, we will bring a new draft on the Governments way forward and road-map. I will also give it to the National Assembly. I will present a long-term and mid-term plan after the Parliament has discussed and reached an agreement on it. At present, a number of reports have been received from the National Assembly and Committees of the Parliament. I am thankful for that. But we were able to complete this work within a short period of 08 months. I declare that we will take advantage of it and move forward.",

Speaking on the matter, Prof. Jayasumana stated that it is not MP Peiris that needs to be removed, but SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, for acting against the policies of the party. On 04 March, Kariyawasam announced the unanimous decision of the Executive Council of the SLPP to remove Prof. Peiris from his post as SLPP Chairman, adding that the Council is scheduled to meet this week to decide on who will fill the vacant position. Commenting on the matter, Prof. Jayasumana explained that the Executive Council of the party cannot make such decisions, and that it is the SLPP Central Committee that can make these decisions. Deeming the whole encounter a joke, he stated that they intend on taking legal action against the unfair removal of Prof. Peiris. He does not know the policies of the party.

Later, the election commission convened several meetings to decide on the LG polls and a conclusive decision on the election date was scheduled to be taken on March 03. Nevertheless, announcing the new election dates was put off following a meeting held by the members of the Commission that day.

        "date": "March 7, 2023 08:03 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said Sri Lanka has secured financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors, paving the way for the IMF board to consider approval of a long-awaited 2.9 billion four-year bailout agreed last year. The IMF said its board will meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement first signed in September, offering a lifeline to the South Asian country which faces its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Approval is expected since the board generally will not add items to its agenda unless its members are ready to act. Sri Lanka has now received financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors, Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department (APD) said in a statement. This paves the way for consideration by the IMFs Board on March 20 the approval of the Staff Level Agreement reached on September 1, 2022 for financing under an Extended Fund Facility, Srinivasan added. A source familiar with the matter said China had agreed on Monday to back Sri Lankas debt restructuring with stronger financial assurances, allowing the IMF to move forward. The announcement comes days after the IMF praised Sri Lankas surprise decision on March 3 to raise interest rates and move toward a market-determined exchange rate as evidence of a commitment to reducing inflation and enacting reforms. Sri Lanka, which has been facing shortages of food, fuel and medicines, has been waiting for more than 180 days for approval of the IMF loan, mostly due to IMF concerns over the quality of the initial financing assurances offered by China and other bilateral creditors, and its insistence on painful reforms. Central bank Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said last week that Sri Lanka had fulfilled its conditions with the rate hike and he was hopeful the IMF bailout would be approved this month. The IMF said the boards approval of a new loan for Sri Lanka would help catalyze financing from other creditors, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The arrangement will support the authorities program of ambitious reforms, that they have already embarked upon, which will help Sri Lanka emerge from its current crisis and set it on a trajectory of strong and inclusive growth, he said.

The explosion shook the fourth and fifth floors of a five-storey building in Gulistan, a major hub for wholesale goods in the capital, shortly before 5pm local time (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Authorities could not immediately provide the reason behind the huge explosion in the bustling commercial area. So far, 15 people (two women and 13 men) have died and more than 140 injured have been brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), Inspector Bachchu Mia was quoted as saying by Bangladeshs Daily Star newspaper and the Reuters news agency. No fire broke out in the building but more than 150 firefighters were at the site to assist in rescue efforts, a fire services spokesperson told AFP. A middle-aged man in a blood-soaked shirt told reporters he had been injured in the blast, which shattered windows and damaged a wall of the building. There were people lying on the floor. I escaped by climbing out from the window, he said. History of fire accidents Bangladesh has a history of industrial disasters, including factories catching fire with workers trapped inside. Monitoring groups have blamed corruption and lax enforcement. In 2012, about 117 workers died when they were trapped behind locked exits in a garment factory in Dhaka. The countrys worst industrial disaster occurred the following year, when the Rana Plaza garment factory outside Dhaka collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people. In 2019, a blaze ripped through a 400-year-old area cramped with apartments, shops and warehouses in the oldest part of Dhaka and killed at least 67 people. Another fire in Old Dhaka in a house illegally storing chemicals killed at least 123 people in 2010. In 2021, a fire at a food and beverage factory outside Dhaka killed at least 52 people, many of whom were trapped inside by an illegally locked door. Last year, a fire at a shipping container storage depot near the countrys main Chittagong Seaport killed at least 41 people, including nine firefighters, and injured more than 100 others.

In a statement, Kristalina Georgieva said she looks forward to presenting the IMF-supported program to the organizations Executive Board on March 20. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) will support the authorities program of ambitious reforms, which will help Sri Lanka emerge from its current crisis and set it on a trajectory of strong and inclusive growth, the IMF chief said further. Sri Lanka has closed in on getting a sign-off on the long-awaited bailout package of USD 2.9 billion from the IMF upon receiving fresh financial assurances from China on restructuring the islands debt. Addressing the parliament this morning, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said a letter of agreement, signed by him as the finance minister and the Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, was forwarded to the IMF soon after receiving assurances from the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China last night. However, the Deputy Ambassador of China to Sri Lanka, Hu Wei officially handed over the financial assurance letter issued by the EXIM Bank of China to Sri Lankas Finance Ministry Secretary, Mahinda Siriwardana this afternoon at the Presidential Secretariat. The envoy noted that large-scale Chinese companies are looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka in the near future to explore new investment opportunities. This evening, the IMF confirmed that Sri Lanka has now secured financial assurances from all major bilateral creditors, paving way for the IMFs executive board to consider green-lighting the EFF for the island nation grappling with its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. The IMF said its executive board will meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement first signed in September, offering a lifeline to Sri Lanka with a 48-month arrangement under the EFF of about USD 2.9 billion.

The credit line is to due to expire on March 17 with Sri Lanka having used only about two-thirds of it, mainly for medicines and food, said the sources and another person familiar with the matter. The extension talks come as the economy improves and forex reserves rise for Sri Lanka, where huge protests took place last year amid widespread shortages of essentials after the COVID-19 pandemic hurt tourism and remittances while exposing low tax revenues. A source at the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry said the government wanted to extend the credit line by 6-12 months because there was about 300 million of it left unused. No agreement had been reached, said the source. All the sources declined to be named ahead of an announcement. Sri Lankas finance ministry and Indias foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sri Lankas central bank said on Tuesday the countrys official reserves had risen 4.5 to 2.22 billion in February from a month earlier. President Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament there were signs the economy was improving but there was still insufficient foreign currency for all imports, making the IMF deal crucial so other creditors could also start releasing funds. He said China, Sri Lankas biggest lender, extended support for the IMF programme on Monday, clearing the way for the loan. The IMF said its board would meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement first signed with Sri Lanka in September.

        "date": "March 8, 2023 10:11 am",
        "content": "Defence officials in Madagascar have officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka of the arrest of 08 suspects including the drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and his accomplice identified as Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu. Foreign media reported yesterday that a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father were also among the suspects arrested in Madagascar last Wednesday (March 01). LExpress, a leading media network in Madagascar, said the suspects were taken into custody at the Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo, Madagascar while trying to fly out of the country. The arrests had been made in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. According to LExpress, five of the Sri Lankan suspects had landed in Nosy Be on a private jet on February 12. The group had later travelled to Antananarivo on a domestic flight the following day. After staying at two hotels in Ivato and Ambohimangakely, the suspects had arrived at the airport in two luxury cars. The gendarmes (paramilitary police officers in France or French-speaking countries) had recognized and arrested them with the help of the red notices previously issued by the INTERPOL. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata has posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others posed as his bodyguards. The two luxury cars and the mobile phones of the suspects were also seized by the Madagascar law-enforcement authorities. Further, a sum of Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 32 million found on the woman who claimed to be the wife of Harak Kata was also confiscated. The arrestees are currently detained by the Bridage Criminelle (criminal squad) in Anosy. Speaking to Ada Derana on the matter, Sri Lankas Defence Ministry said necessary measures are underway through the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles to extradite the arrestees from Madagascar as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission there. Soon after being officially informed of the arrest of the suspects, a group of local law-enforcement authorities comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police attached to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will depart for Madagascar, a senior police officer said. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his in Dubai. Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on October 03, 2022 as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation.",

        "date": "March 8, 2023 12:27 pm",
        "content": "Oklahoma voters on Tuesday rejected the legalization of recreational marijuana, following a late blitz of opposition from faith leaders, law enforcement and prosecutors. Oklahoma would have become the 22nd state to legalize adult use of cannabis and join conservative states like Montana and Missouri that have approved similar proposals in recent years. Many conservative states have also rejected the idea, including Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota last year. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and many of the states GOP legislators, including nearly every Republican senator, opposed the idea. Former Republican Gov. Frank Keating, an ex-FBI agent, and Terri White, the former head of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, led the no campaign. Were pleased the voters have spoken, said Pat McFerron, a Republican political strategist who ran the opposition campaign. We think this sends a clear signal that voters are not happy with the recreational nature of our medicinal system. We also think it shows voters recognize the criminal aspects, as well as the need for addressing mental health needs of the state. Oklahoma voters already approved medical marijuana in 2018 by 14 percentage points and the state has one of the most liberal programs in the country, with more than 2,800 licensed dispensaries and roughly 10 of the states adult population having a medical license to buy and consume cannabis. On Tuesdays legalization question, the no side was outspent more than 20-to-1, with supporters of the initiative spending more than 4.9 million, compared to about 219,000 against, last-minute campaign finance reports show. State Question 820, the result of a signature gathering drive last year, was the only item on the statewide ballot, and early results showed heavy opposition in rural areas. Oklahoma is a law and order state, Stitt said in a statement after Tuesdays vote. I remain committed to protecting Oklahomans and my administration will continue to hold bad actors accountable and crack down on illegal marijuana operations in our state. The proposal, if passed, would have allowed anyone over the age of 21 to purchase and possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana, plus concentrates and marijuana-infused products. Recreational sales would have been subjected to a 15 excise tax on top of the standard sales tax. The excise tax would be used to help fund local municipalities, the court system, public schools, substance abuse treatment and the states general revenue fund. The prospect of having more Oklahomans smoking anything, including marijuana, didnt sit well with Mark Grossman, an attorney who voted against the proposal Tuesday at the Crown Heights Christian Church in Oklahoma City. I was a no vote because Im against smoking, Grossman said. Tobacco smoking was a huge problem for my family. The low barriers for entry into Oklahomas medical marijuana industry has led to a flood of growers, processors and dispensary operators competing for a limited number of customers. Supporters had hoped the states marijuana industry would be buoyed by a rush of out-of-state customers, particularly from Texas, which has close to 8 million people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area just a little more than an hour drive from the Oklahoma border. Michelle Tilley, campaign director for Yes on 820, said despite Tuesdays result, full marijuana legalization was inevitable. She noted that almost 400,000 Oklahomans already use marijuana legally and many thousands more use it illegally. A two-tiered system, where one group of Oklahomans is free to use this product and the other is treated like criminals does not make logical sense, she said in a statement.

        "date": "March 8, 2023 12:49 pm",
        "content": "The Women Parliamentarians Caucus (WPC) has proposed the development of a more effective and efficient complaint and investigative mechanism to regulate gender-based violence on digital platforms. Issuing a statement in this regard, the WPC stated that it is necessary to build awareness on digital gender-based violence and safer means of using digital platforms among the general public, to safeguard the well-being and dignity of women and girls. The relevant statement was issued by MP Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, Chairperson of the WPC, to mark International Womens Day celebrated on 08 March. In line with the theme for this years International Womens Day, DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality, the statement raised concerns on the violence and harassment faced online by women and girls, amidst a society in which almost all key everyday activities have been digitized following the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Fernandopulle shed light on the fact that complaints received by the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) and National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) from distressed individuals and parents reached a record-high by a pandemic-hit society, emphasizing that most victims were women and girls. Therefore, building awareness on digital gender-based violence and safer means of using digital platforms among the general public is an imperative, the MP said in this regard. In a similar vein, Dr. Fernandopulles statement also raised caution on the disparities faced between genders, in relation to accessibility to online platforms and the internet. With the advancement of technology and globalization, the challenges that women face have altered. However, prejudices and stereotypical beliefs still stand in the way of women realizing their full potential, even in the 21st century, she said, adding that globally, digital literacy is lower for women than for men due to the limitations faced by women in their access to devices, networks and data. It also appears that in instances where a family could afford just one device, the male child is given preference over the female child to use the device due to prejudicial beliefs. Whereas an international day dedicated towards women might appear inconsequential, the observance of this day is crucial in creating public awareness on womens rights and issues faced by women, and above all it is a powerful advocacy tool to mobilize political will and resources to realize gender equality and womens empowerment, the statement read.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has recommended that a committee, headed by a retired court judge, be appointed to investigate the issues raised by the special audit report of the Central Cultural Fund for the period between 2015 and 2019. It was also recommended that the report of the newly-proposed committee be presented before COPE within 03 months. These recommendations were amongst five recommendations given during a COPE meeting held yesterday (07 March), under the patronage of Prof. Ranjith Bandara. The meeting was held in order to investigate the matters raised by the special audit report on the functioning of the Central Cultural Fund and to examine the progress of the implementation of recommendations previously given by COPE on 24 November 2022. The Internal Inquiry Committee, appointed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, to investigate the matters raised in the said Special Audit Report for the purpose of reporting to COPE, was also discussed at length, with COPE recommending that the committee be dissolved. Meanwhile, the validity of the 209th meeting of the governing council of the Central Cultural Fund was also discussed, after concerns in this regard were raised at the previous COPE meeting. Accordingly, the Auditor General pointed out that only seven of the 11 members have agreed to the decisions of the 209th meeting and four, including the former Prime Minister, have not signed. Stating that there is a discrepancy between the signatures used by the seven signatories on the signature list of this meeting and the signatures used by them in the previous governing board meetings, the Auditor General pointed out that the decisions of the 209th governing board meeting have not been adopted in the 210th meeting. The Auditor General also stated that the then Prime Ministers Secretary and the current Presidents Secretary, who were members of the relevant governing body, confirmed that he was not a party to such a meeting. Thus, COPE recommended that the validity of the signature list of the 209th meeting be checked and that the relevant list be referred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Government Inspector. As per COPEs recommendations, the Central Cultural Fund is due to be recalled before COPE to review the progress of the previous recommendations made by COPE. State Ministers Janaka Wakkumbura, Lohan Ratwatte, Indika Anuruddha Herath, D. V.

        "date": "March 8, 2023 04:49 pm",
        "content": "The Export-Import Bank of China has told Sri Lanka it will try to finalise in the months ahead how it treats debt owed by the crisis-hit nation, according to a letter seen by Reuters which also reiterated a moratorium for debt due in 2022 and 2023. The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that Sri Lanka had secured financing assurances from China, India and all its major bilateral creditors, setting the stage for final approval of the IMFs 2.9 billion, four-year bailout for the island nation on March 20. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades and a shortage of dollars has disrupted imports of essentials, though the situation has improved this year from last year when protesters ousted its president. China has extended its firm support to Sri Lanka through a debt treatment, EXIM Bank wrote in the letter to the Sri Lankan government on March 6. The banks Vice President, Zhang Wencai, said in the letter that the island nation would not have to immediately repay the principal and interest due on its loans for the two years, so as to help relieve your short-term debt repayment pressure. Meanwhile, we would like to expedite the negotiation process with your side regarding medium- and long-term debt treatment in this window period, with a view to finalising the specifics of a debt treatment in the coming months. We will make our best efforts to contribute to the debt sustainability of Sri Lanka. The letter mirrors what EXIM Bank sent to Sri Lanka in January, except for the target of finalising debt-treatment specifics in the coming months. By end-2020, Sri Lanka owed EXIM 2.83 billion, or 3.5 of its external debt, according to IMF data. The letter added that China would call on commercial creditors to provide debt treatment in an equally comparable manner, and encourage multilateral creditors to do their utmost to make contributions to help you better respond to the crisis and emerge from it. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed the contents of the letter. It fully reflects our sincerity and efforts to support Sri Lanka in achieving debt sustainability, and we hope that relevant parties will respond positively to Sri Lankas loan application as soon as possible, Mao Ning told a regular news conference. LONG TALKS WITH CHINA Winning the support of China, the worlds and Sri Lankas biggest sovereign creditor, was crucial for the IMF deal to go ahead. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament on Tuesday that the government received the China letter on Monday night and soon after, he and the central bank governor sent a letter of intent to the IMF. A source at Wickremesinghes office said the president had been expecting the letter from EXIM Bank from Thursday. Sri Lanka has been talking, discussing and negotiating with China EXIM Bank for weeks, mostly virtually, because that was what we were tasked with doing, said the source, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to talk to the media. He said the support from the international community, especially Japan and the United States talking to the Chinese government, helped Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas case was also boosted by a G20 meeting in India last month, said the source. Sri Lanka cabinet spokesperson and transport minister, Bandula Gunawardena, told a weekly news briefing that the possible final IMF approval was a great achievement. Sri Lanka has worked hard and spent months to fulfill requirements for the IMF programme, at certain times the president engaged at personal level to get support, he said. Without the IMF programme, Sri Lanka cannot turn around its economy. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The Core Group on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) says it is deeply concerned about what it called heavy-handed responses of the Sri Lankan government to the peaceful protests. In a statement delivered by Simon Manley, the UKs Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations in Geneva, the Sri Lankan government has been urged to safeguard the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of expression. Emphasizing that civil society has an important part to play in encouraging the protection of human rights, the Core Group called for accountability for any protest-related violence. On behalf of the Core Group, Manley stressed the crucial importance of upholding rule of law and safeguarding representative democracy. Referring to the postponement of the local government election in Sri Lanka, which was initially scheduled to be held on March 09, the Core Group said ensuring the independence of institutions and governance systems, including the electoral system is imperative. Further, the Core Group underlined the need for good governance, addressing the long-standing issues of impunity and corruption. It reiterated the calls to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) with legislation that aligns with Sri Lankas international obligations. The Core Group, however, welcomed the islands most recent commitments with respect to the protection of human rights in Sri Lanka, efforts at constitutional reform and initiatives aimed at fostering political inclusion. It also acknowledged Sri Lankas positive engagement in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process in January. We are keen to assist Sri Lanka in implementing its UPR recommendations. Led by the United Kingdom, the Core Group comprises Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia and the United States.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has recognized three women within the international forum as integral parts in providing Sri Lanka with the required foreign assistance during its most unprecedented economic crises. Speaking at the International Womens Day celebration held at the Waters Edge Hotel this morning (08 March), the Head of State acknowledged the efforts of Indias Minister of Finance  Nirmala Sitharaman, U.S. Secretary to the Treasury Janet Yellen and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva in securing the funds and aid required by the island nation in its hour of need. Commenting on the looming economic crisis Sri Lanka has been forced to face since 2022, Wickremesinghe acknowledged that while several persons have aided Sri Lankas road to recovery, three females have dominated this sector. Commenting on each of them individually, Wickremeisnghe acknowledged Sitharamans efforts in providing the USD 3 billion loan to Sri Lanka in April last year following talks with the Indian Cabinet and Prime Minister. She talked to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and took the decision to give Sri Lanka a loan of USD 3 billion. This was after we declared our country bankrupt. That was a brave step, he said, emphasising that the consequences that the island nation would have had to face if the loan was not received at the time goes without saying. The President also thanked U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen for taking the reins during discussions that were held with several countries, including the United States of America, on Sri Lankas economic situation. He further acknowledged the personal commitment shown by the IMFs Kristalina Georgievea towards Sri Lanka, and thanked her for having the relevant discussions with other countries, the World Bank and the Paris Club about Sri Lankas debt restructuring and the relief due to be received in this regard. Without these three women, we would be in a lot of trouble, the President stated. Meanwhile, he also noted that Sri Lankan women are ahead of others in comparison to other countries in the region, adding that the island nation will take leadership in championing the rights of women within the Asian region. He further assured that Sri Lanka is committed to working towards achieving gender equality and womens empowerment in all areas.",

The new round of job cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the flattening, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Meta declined to comment on the Bloomberg report when contacted by Reuters. Last month, the Washington Post newspaper had reported that Meta was planning to cut jobs in a reorganization and downsizing effort. Meta, at that time, declined to comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way. Metas mass layoffs in November that cut more than 11,000 jobs was among the biggest last year and the first in the companys history. Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft Corp, have also cut thousands of jobs. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2023 07:58 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas rupee, which became the worlds best performing currency this year amid hopes of an International Monetary Fund bailout, may resume declines and lose a fifth of its value against the dollar by end-2023, according to Fitch Solutions. We are optimistic that Sri Lanka will be able to secure an IMF board approval by early 2Q 2023, said Seah Wang Ting, country risk analyst at Fitch Solutions. Nevertheless, theres potential for disruptions after the initial board approval as authorities may find it challenging to stay on track with the IMF program amid a weakening economy and a local election likely on the horizon, he said. Fitch maintained its forecast for the rupee to weaken to a record low of 390 per dollar by year-end. The rupee advanced 3 to 317.7 per dollar on Wednesday, taking its annual gains to over 15. Thats after the IMF said it plans to decide on a 2.9 billion bailout for Sri Lanka following Chinas assurance that it will support the nations debt restructuring. Sri Lanka has increased taxes, cut energy subsidies and loosened its grip on the currency to secure the IMF loan. The central bank recently lifted borrowing costs further to ensure that inflation which has slowed from nearly 70 doesnt flare up. Sri Lanka still has significant external debt repayment needs and will need to build up its foreign reserve buffer over the coming months, which would put downside pressure on the exchange rate, Fitch said in a report Wednesday. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Tuesday the country needs to repay about 6 billion-7 billion foreign loans on average each year until 2029. The Sri Lankan rupee may also be pressured by tightening global monetary conditions, according to Fitch. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.

        "date": "March 8, 2023 09:32 pm",
        "content": "India helped Sri Lanka more than any other country, especially when the island nation was struggling through an unprecedented crisis, Sri Lankas Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said during Raisina Dialogue Ideas Pod. While the Indian government took some bold decisions to help the country tide over its economic crisis, even the Indian public came forward to support Sri Lanka, the countrys foreign minister said in the podcast released on Tuesday. Mr Sabry said, Your real friends are tested when bad time comes. India has stood by us, a friend in need and a friend indeed that they say. So we are very grateful to India, for what it has done for us. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister also stated that the Indian government took some very bold, decisive actions by providing the island nation with about 3.9 billion worth of bilateral credit and accreditation. He further stated that it is the line which gave Sri Lanka the lifeline to fight the battle for another day, which probably saved the bankrupt country from oblivion. Recalling Indias effort in saving Sri Lanka from drowning in the debt, Mr Sabry said that India comes at the very beginning. He further stated that Indias intervention was higher than the others countries. India sent financing assurances to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), becoming the first of Sri Lankas creditors to officially back the crisis-hit island nations debt restructuring programme. This takes Sri Lanka one step closer to getting a crucial USD 2.9-billion package from the IMF, made contingent on receiving financing assurances from Sri Lankas official creditors and making a good faith effort to reach a collaborative agreement with private creditors, Mr Sabry said. Sri Lankan foreign affairs minister was on an official visit to New Delhi to attend Raisina Dialogue - 2023, Indias premier conference on geopolitics and geo-economics, jointly hosted by the Observer Research Foundation in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs of India from March 2-4. Notably, China, Japan, and India are Sri Lankas three largest bilateral lenders. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in January visited Sri Lanka and said that India is committed to increasing investment flows to Sri Lanka to hasten its economic recovery. Talking regarding the IMF bailout package at Raisina Dialogue Ideas Pod, Sri Lankas Foreign Minister said,  Yeah, I think it will help out in the sense when it comes to IMF bailing out of a country which has been declared bankrupt or otherwise, it had been declared as unsustainable of paying the debt. There are two components. One is you have to get debt assurances from the bilaterals which is not challenging. And as far as the IMF pre-actions that we need to take in terms of the staff level agreement we have taken all those things of 15 of them for example cost, reflective pricing, more revenue basis and then independent central bank. So many of those things we have done, Mr Sabry said. I think those things we could have done or should have done with or without IMF, which is good for the country, though it is not very popular. But the problem is how to sell these reforms to the people because it will directly affect them. All these files, what we have done is used printing machine to print the money and then inflation resulted in that giving hope to people, he added. He further stated that IMF will bring a lot of confidence to the country. It will probably give the island nation access back to the financial market as well as it will also open up an investment which was ceased last year or so. Sri Lanka sank into a financial crisis after the COVID-19 pandemic affected tourism and remittances from citizens working abroad fell. The war in Ukraine escalated the crisis as prices for imports, particularly fuel, rose sharply due to soaring inflation. With worsening fuel and medicine shortages, thousands of protestors took to streets and stormed government buildings leading to President Gotabaye Rajapakse to flee the country and send in his resignation from abroad in July last year. Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected President of the island country on July after defeating his main rival, Dullus Alahapperuma, with 134 votes to 82 in a parliamentary vote. Source - NDTV -Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court today (09) gave the Attorney General a period of four weeks to file objections pertaining to the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by two persons involved in the protests near former President Gotabaya Rajapaksas residence in Mirihana last year. The petition was filed by the protesters seeking a court order affirming that their fundamental rights had been violated when they were arrested by the Police during the protests near the former Presidents residence in March 2022. Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema informed the court that they intend on filing initial objections stating that the relevant petitions cannot be maintained. Thus, the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, A. H. M. D Nawaz and Janak de Silva ordered that the petition be reconsidered on 17 July, while the Attorney General was given four weeks to submit his objections.",

        "date": "March 9, 2023 12:45 pm",
        "content": "Both commercial and multilateral creditors should take part in the process to restructure Sri Lankas debt, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday (March 08). Acknowledging the necessity of burden-sharing, Mao Ning assured that China stands ready to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to jointly play a positive role to help Sri Lanka navigate the situation, ease its debt burden and achieve sustainable development. In response to a question raised during a regular media briefing, Mao reiterated that China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral creditor, supports its Export-Import (EXIM) Bank to have active consultations with Sri Lanka on debt treatment. The Chinese foreign ministry spokespersons remarks came after the EXIM Bank of China, in a letter, assured Sri Lanka that it would try to finalize in the coming month how it plans to treat debt owed by the island nation. Sri Lanka received fresh financial assurances from the EXIM Bank of China earlier this week, which paved way for the final stage to unlock the USD 2.9 billion bailout package under the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility (EFF). On Tuesday, the global lender confirmed that Sri Lanka has now secured financing assurances from all its major bilateral creditors, including China, India and the Paris Club. The IMFs executive board is scheduled to meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement, initially signed in September 2022, offering a lifeline to the crisis-hit island nation with a four-year arrangement under the EFF. In his letter to the Sri Lankan government, the EXIM Banks vice president Zhang Wencai has extended firm support to Sri Lanka through debt treatment. Zhang reiterated a moratorium for debt due in 2022 and 2023, noting that Sri Lanka does not have to immediately repay the principal and interest due on its loans for the two years. He said this would help relieve Sri Lankas short-term debt repayment pressure. The EXIM Banks vice president said China would like to expedite the negotiation process with Sri Lanka regarding medium- and long-term debt treatment in this window period, with a view to finalising the specifics of a debt treatment in the coming months. Confirming the contents of the letter, the foreign ministry spokesperson said Chinas actions fully speak to its sincerity and action to support Sri Lankas effort to achieve debt sustainability.",

        "title": "Scientists discover enzyme that turns air into electricity, providing a new clean source of energy",
        "date": "March 9, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "Australian scientists have discovered an enzyme that converts air into energy. The finding, published in the top journal Nature, reveals that this enzyme uses the low amounts of the hydrogen in the atmosphere to create an electrical current. This finding opens the way to create devices that literally make energy from thin air. The research team, led by Dr Rhys Grinter, PhD student Ashleigh Kropp, and Professor Chris Greening from the Monash University Biomedicine Discovery Institute in Melbourne, Australia, produced and analysed a hydrogen-consuming enzyme from a common soil bacterium. Recent work by the team has shown that many bacteria use hydrogen from the atmosphere as an energy source in nutrient-poor environments. Weve known for some time that bacteria can use the trace hydrogen in the air as a source of energy to help them grow and survive, including in Antarctic soils, volcanic craters, and the deep ocean, Professor Greening said. But we didnt know how they did this, until now. In this Nature paper, the researchers extracted the enzyme responsible for using atmospheric hydrogen from a bacterium called Mycobacterium smegmatis. They showed that this enzyme, called Huc, turns hydrogen gas into an electrical current. Dr Grinter notes, Huc is extraordinarily efficient. Unlike all other known enzymes and chemical catalysts, it even consumes hydrogen below atmospheric levels  as little as 0.00005 of the air we breathe. The researchers used several cutting-edge methods to reveal the molecular blueprint of atmospheric hydrogen oxidation. They used advanced microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine its atomic structure and electrical pathways, pushing boundaries to produce the most resolved enzyme structure reported by this method to date. They also used a technique called electrochemistry to demonstrate the purified enzyme creates electricity at minute hydrogen concentrations. Laboratory work performed by Ms Kropp shows that it is possible to store purified Huc for long periods. It is astonishingly stable. It is possible to freeze the enzyme or heat it to 80 degrees celsius, and it retains its power to generate energy, Ms Kropp said. This reflects that this enzyme helps bacteria to survive in the most extreme environments. Huc is a natural battery that produces a sustained electrical current from air or added hydrogen. While this research is at an early stage, the discovery of Huc has considerable potential to develop small air-powered devices, for example as an alternative to solar-powered devices. The bacteria that produce enzymes like Huc are common and can be grown in large quantities, meaning we have access to a sustainable source of the enzyme. Dr Grinter says that a key objective for future work is to scale up Huc production. Once we produce Huc in sufficient quantities, the sky is quite literally the limit for using it to produce clean energy. Source - Monash University -Agencies",

        "date": "March 9, 2023 01:54 pm",
        "content": "Jenna Ortegas first order of business as the next host of Saturday Night Live is to escape the teenage purgatory of performing the iconic Wednesday dance yet again. In a new SNL promo released on Wednesday, of course, Ortega looks at a script as she speaks to Ben Marshall, John Higgins and Martin Herlihy, the Please Dont Destroy Boys comedy trio. Honestly, this is really well written, I just dont feel like I want to do the Wednesday dance for promo because weve seen so much of that already and I think its time to do something new, Ortega says. The PDD Boys agree with Ortega, until the camera pans out to reveal theyre dressed down to the frill in Wednesday Addams-inspired black dresses and braided wigs. After pretending like they dont know the Wednesday dance at all and had no intention of filming it for the promo, Ortega finally agrees to go along with their poorly masked desire to indeed do the dance. In true Wednesday Addams fashion, Ortega stoically performs a snippet of the dance on the iconic SNL stage in between Higgins and Marshall while Herlihy captures the moment on a smartphone. The Wednesday dance took on a life of its own when it went viral on social media after the scene appeared in the Netflix show late last year. The SNL promo comes on the heels of an interview in which Ortega spoke about how shed frequently change her characters lines during Wednesdays production, which spurred mixed reactions from those in the television industry. SNL airs live Saturday at 11:30pm EST8:30pm PST on NBC and streams live on Peacock. Ortega is this weeks host with The 1975 as the musical guest. Source - CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka aims to announce a debt-restructuring strategy in April and step up talks with commercial creditors ahead of an International Monetary Fund review of a bailout package in six months, the countrys central bank governor told Reuters on Thursday. The crisis-hit island has secured financing assurances from all its major bilateral creditors, including India and China, and so had set the stage for the IMF to give its final approval for a 2.9 billion, four-year bailout package on March 20, the multilateral lender said on Tuesday. The bailout is the culmination of months of negotiations as Sri Lanka looks to emerge from its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades. When you see the staff level agreement published - that will contain our commitment to debt restructuring and that will also reveal medium-term debt targets for us to restore debt sustainability on a long-term basis, central bank Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said. So somewhere in April we will announce ... how we are going to meet those medium-to-long-term (debt) targets. That is the next step. Weerasinghe said the country would expedite negotiations with commercial creditors and announce the debt restructuring strategy in consultation with them, before finalising the debt restructuring terms. We are trying to finalise this in about the next six months time, so before the next (IMF) review will be completed, he said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Accordingly, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles has been summoned to the HRCSL on Monday (March 13) for an inquiry into the matter. The lawmaker has been asked to appear before the human rights body at 10.00 a.m. on the said date. Tense situations ensued near Colombo and Kelaniya university premises on March 07 and 08 as the police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesting university students. The demonstrations had been staged to urge the authorities to hold the deferred elections, abolish what they called the Ranil-Rajapaksa government, do away with the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and scrap the unfair tax revision. Further, the HRCSL has called for a list of senior police officers deployed to the protest sites on the aforementioned dates. The police chief has been asked to submit the list to the human rights body before March 10.",

        "date": "March 9, 2023 03:36 pm",
        "content": "Former Malaysian prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin will be charged with corruption-related offences on Friday, the chief of the countrys anti-graft agency told Reuters. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief, Azam Baki, did not give further details, but said the agency will issue a statement later on Thursday. Muhyiddin, who was prime minister for 17 months between 2020 and 2021, arrived at the MACC offices on Thursday morning for questioning. Muhyiddin and his party have faced graft investigations since losing to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in a tightly contested election in November. Anwar last year ordered a review of government projects worth billions of dollars approved by Muhyiddin, including COVID-19 relief programmes, alleging they did not follow proper procedures. Muhyiddin has previously denied the accusations, describing them as a political vendetta. Anwar on Thursday said he has not interfered in graft investigations involving Muhyiddin, state media Bernama reported. Two leaders belonging to Muhyiddins party have been charged by the MACC with bribery over an economic recovery project launched by his government. The MACC questioned Muhyiddin last month regarding the same project and has also frozen bank accounts belonging to Muhyiddins party. The charges against Muhyiddin come ahead of regional elections due to be held in six states by mid-year, with the ex-premiers coalition expected to pose a strong challenge to Anwars alliance.
