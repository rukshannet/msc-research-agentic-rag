        "date": "December 11, 2023 03:36 pm",
        "content": "The teenage children of imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi accepted this years Nobel Peace Prize in the Norwegian capital on Sunday on behalf of the mother they havent seen in years, reading out a speech she penned from a Tehran prison as her medal rested on an empty chair. Mohammadi, 51, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize in October for her decades of activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars. She is renowned for campaigning for womens rights and democracy in her country, as well as fighting against the death penalty. Kiana and Ali Rahmani, Mohammadis 17-year-old twins who live in exile in Paris with their father, received the prestigious award at Oslo City Hall, which was richly adorned with blue orchids for the occasion. Daughter Kiana read the first part of the Nobel Peace Prize lecture in their mothers name, and her brother continued it. I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison, Mohammadi said in the speech. I am a Middle Eastern woman, and come from a region which, despite its rich civilization, is now trapped amid war, the fire of terrorism, and extremism. I am confident that the light of freedom and justice will shine brightly on the land of Iran, she said. At that moment, we will celebrate the victory of democracy and human rights over tyranny and authoritarianism, and the anthem of the peoples triumph on the streets of Iran will resonate worldwide. The Iranian people will dismantle obstruction and despotism through their persistence. Have no doubt - this is certain, she added. In the presence of Norways King Harald and Queen Sonja and other dignitaries, Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, cited Mohammadis life-long struggle in support of human rights and strong civil society. A large portrait on display showed Mohammadi in pastel colours and smiling. She has asked us to use this particular photograph, which expresses how she wants to lead her life, looking happy in colourful garments, exposing her hair and with a steady gaze towards us, Reiss-Andersen said. No punishment has stopped her, Reiss-Andersen said, citing the sentences of imprisonment and over 150 lashes that have been imposed on her. She said when Mohammadi needed medical treatment recently, she was told she would be taken to a hospital on condition she wore a hijab. She refused and was eventually taken to a different medical facility. When everything has been denied her, she still mobilises the willpower and courage to make a statement, Reiss-Andersen said. This years Peace Prize recognises the brave women in Iran and around the world who fight for basic human rights and for an end to the discrimination and against segregation of women. In their speeches, Mohammadis children both expressed regret that their mother wasnt allowed to be present in Oslo. She should have been here herself, but she was prevented by the executioners. I lend my voice to hers, and to all the girls and women of Iran whom nothing can silence, Kiana Rahmani said in Farsi at the beginning of her speech given in French. Her brother noted that their mothers body is behind bars but her pen and thoughts have burst through the walls and reached us. She and the Iranian people have never been more oppressed than now. But never has their voice resonated so strongly in the world. Let us continue to spread the reverberation so that Narges Mohammadi and the Iranian people will one day be able to break their chains, he said. At a news conference in Oslo on Saturday, Kiana Rahmani read out a message from her mother in which she praised the role international media played in conveying the voice of dissenters, protesters and human rights defenders to the world. Iranian society needs global support and you, journalists and media professionals are our greatest and most important allies in the difficult struggle against the destructive tyranny of the Islamic Republic government. I sincerely thank you for your efforts, for all youve done for us, Mohammadi said. Kiana Rahmani said she held little hope of seeing her mother again. Maybe Ill see her in 30 or 40 years, but I think I wont see her again. But that doesnt matter, because my mother will always live on in my heart, values that are worth fighting for, she said. Mohammadis brother and husband told reporters that she planned to go on a hunger strike on Sunday in solidarity with the Bahai Faith religious minority in Iran. Mohammadis husband, Taghi, was in the audience to watch their children accept the prestigious prize. He had previously said that he hadnt been able to see his wife for 11 years, while their children hadnt seen their mother for nearly eight years. Mohammadi played a leading role in protests triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last year while in police custody for allegedly violating the countrys strict headscarf law, which forces women to cover their hair and entire bodies. Iranian authorities banned members of Aminis family from travelling to accept the European Unions top human rights prize - the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought - on her behalf, the US-based HRANA said late Saturday. Narges Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Its the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the Peace Prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest. The rest of the Nobel prizes were handed out in a separate ceremony in Stockholm later Sunday. Source: Euronews with AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa has assured that a cadre of 25 police personnel will remain at Mihintale, thereby ensuring that there lies no threat to the security of the sacred site. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday afternoon (11 Dec.), Thalduwa stated that although the army personnel stationed at Mihintale were withdrawn on Sunday (10 Dec.), no such decision has been taken with regards to the police personnel. The State Minister of Defence said that the personnel belonging to the army, navy and civil defense service which come under that Ministry who were stationed at Mihintale are being withdrawn. However, police personnel will not be withdrawn, as the police department comes under the Ministry of Public Security. No decision has been taken to withdraw police personnel from the Mihintale site, the police spokesman said, adding that 25 police officers including a Police Inspector, a Sergeant and Constables and are currently stationed at Mihintale. Earlier today, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon assured that despite the withdrawal of army personnel from Mihintale, there is no threat to the security of the sacred site. Speaking in Parliament this morning, he noted that all 252 army personnel stationed at Mihintale were not there for security purposes, and thus, their withdrawal has no effect on the security of the sacred site. The withdrawal of army personnel from the sacred site comes on the heels of the recent allegations made by the Chief Prelate of Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya, who claimed that his life was at risk due to the security personnel entering the temple premises, clad in civilian clothes. Commenting regarding the matter, Tennakoon said: We learned only recently that an army officer cannot enter a temple in civilian clothes. Now we have decided that if he Mihintale Chief Prelate deems the military presence at the temple a threat to his life, we will remove all 252 officers from the temple premises today itself.",

Addressing the Committee, officials of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands mentioned that they have planned to implement the Home Stay concept, while officials also pointed out that plans have been made to bring wealthy tourists to Sri Lanka in the coming year. Furthermore, in order to attract more tourists to Sri Lanka, the Committee pointed out that the general society of Sri Lanka should be prepared to welcome such tourists in a respectful manner, as opposed to cheating them out of their money. The officials pointed out that training programs are already being conducted in selected areas. Furthermore, the Committee also pointed out that it is important to identify the places with tourist attractions at the local level and prepare methods to promote them. In addition, approval was given following consideration of the 2022 annual report of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands, the 2020 annual report of the Tourism Promotion Bureau, the 2022 annual report of the Ministry of Industry and the 2022 annual report of the Registrar of Companies Department, the 20192020 annual reports of Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited, the 20212022 annual reports of Lanka Phosphate Limited, the 2020 annual report of the Sri Lanka Institute of Textile and Apparel.

        "date": "December 12, 2023 09:45 am",
        "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to take up for consideration the first review of the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement for Sri Lanka today (Dec12). This was previously mentioned in the global lenders Executive Boards calendar, which mentioned that the first review of Sri Lankas extended arrangement under the EFF, request for waiver of nonobservance of performance criterion, request for modification of performance criteria, financing assurances review, and rephasing of access would be taken up for consideration today. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of USD 2.9 billion in March, the South Asian island nation has managed to partly stabilise its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. An IMF mission visited the island nation from September 14-27 for the first review of the EFF-supported economic adjustment program. In October, IMF and Sri Lanka reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of the EFF-supported program, which is expected to unlock the second tranche  which amounts to about USD 330 million in financing  once the review is approved by the IMF Management and Executive Board. This will bring the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement about USD 660 million. Sri Lanka has now reached in-principle deals with the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China, its largest bilateral creditor, and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) to restructure its debts. On November 29, the Sri Lankan government and the OCC revealed that they have reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of debt treatment. The in-principle deal covers approximately USD 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and consists of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. Following the launch of a common platform in April 2023 for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, the OCC  co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as the chair of the Paris Club)  was formally formed on May 09 with 17 countries to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for a debt treatment. Since its formation, the OCC has engaged extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, the World Bank as well as China, and Sri Lankas private creditors. The deal between OCC and Sri Lanka came about a month after the island nations agreement with the Chinas Exim Bank covering about USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. The IMF earlier said Sri Lankas in-principle pact with creditor nations and Chinas Exim Bank to restructure its debt prepares the way for the global lender to consider clearing the first review of the bailout.",

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said through this deal, plans are afoot to invest in a 700MW Solar Power Project with a 1,500MW Battery Energy Storage System. The Solar power project will be installed on the surface of the Poonakary Tank in the Killinochchi District, with a Foreign Direct Investment of USD 1,727 Million, Wijesekera added. Earlier this year, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to call for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from prospective investors to develop renewable energy projects with a capacity of 50MW or more in order to support the implementation of expeditious renewable energy development programs in the country. As such, United Solar Energy Sri Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., the local subsidiary of United Solar Group, had submitted a proposal to develop a solar power plant of 700MW with a battery energy storage system, at Poonakary Tank, Kilinochchi enabling to provide a power supply of 134MW. In an earlier statement, the government said the proposed project would be implemented with a total investment of USD 1,727 million, adding that as a 100 foreign direct investment, out of which USD 500 million will be allocated for local project components. As a part of the proposed project, the project proponent company has proposed to construct 03 barrages around the Poonakary Tank at a cost of USD 13.5 million to prevent the sea water intrusion and to rehabilitate the tank. Instead, the Northern Provincial Council, the Northern Provincial Irrigation Department and the Department of Agrarian Development have already agreed to provide 1,080 acres of the shallow area of the tank to the said company on a 35-year lease agreement for the installation of the 700 MW solar power plant. Accordingly, in September, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the approval to accept the project proposal submitted by United Solar Energy Sri Lanka (Pvt.)

Even though Vidyapathy was born and brought up in Sri Lankas Kotte, the former student of Bachelor of Performing Arts (BPA) in Bhatkhande is extremely fluent in Hindi and well trained in Kathak. She gave the influence of Bollywood and Hindi movies as her inspiration for her fluent Hindi. Im extremely glad that my 10 years of hard work paid off and I am the only international student to bag the gold medal, she said, giving all the credit to her three Gurus Ruchi Khare Verma of Bhatkhande, Moksha Samasooriya and Vihanga Rukshan (her Sri Lanka teachers). Talking about her inclination she said, I come from a family of artists and Im the ninth generation in my family who has been into the profession of art including dance and music. In fact, my mother and father both met in a Kathak class, so it runs in my blood. No dance background, but 8 gold medals in kitty Kanak Kulshestra, 24, has not bagged one or two medals, but eight gold medals for kathak, although she has no background in dance. Im in disbelief as I have no dance background. But today, I topped the university, said Kulshestra, the daughter of a businessman, who has been learning dance since the age of five. I remember the day when I wanted to study here but Bhaktkahnde was too big a name for me as I was a little sceptical if I would get admission, but today, I made it, she said. All credit goes to my mother who put me into the classical dance school in childhood seeing my interest in dance. My guru Ruchi Khare deserves equal credit for my success, said the Swaraj Nagar resident of Kanpur, who is currently pursuing UGC NET and wants to pursue a dance career to become a professor.

        "title": "Epic Games wins antitrust case against Google over Play app store",
        "date": "December 12, 2023 11:25 am",
        "content": "Fortnite maker Epic Games has prevailed in its high-profile antitrust trial over Alphabets Google, which alleged the Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, in a ruling that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy. Jurors found for Epic on all counts, a court filing showed, after more than a month of trial in Epics lawsuit, which accused Google of taking action to quash competitors and charge unduly high fees of up to 30 to app developers. The court in January will begin work on what remedies to implement. The ruling marks a stunning defeat for Google, which alongside Apple operates one of the worlds largest app stores. If the ruling holds, it has the potential to give developers more sway over how their apps are distributed and how they profit off them. Google said it would appeal. We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem, Wilson White, vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google, said in an emailed statement. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on Monday cheered the ruling on social media site X, calling out the Google Play monopoly. Lawyers for the two companies made their final arguments on Monday morning and the federal judge handed the case to the jury less than four hours earlier, with instructions that a decision must be unanimous. Among Epics allegations were that Google illegally ties together its Play store and billing service, meaning developers were required to use both to have their apps included in the store. While the Play store represents a much smaller chunk of Googles revenue compared to its massively profitable search business, it is symbolically important as the central gatekeeper to billions of mobile phones and tablets. Google may be compelled to allow for more app stores on Android-powered devices and lose revenue from the cut it takes out of in-app purchases. (Todays verdict) proves that Googles app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation, Epic said in a statement on its website. GOOGLE ACCUSED OF DELETING MESSAGES The trial has shone a very bright light on what Google has done to impair the competition, a lawyer for Epic, Gary Bornstein, told jurors earlier in the day, adding Google systematically blocks alternative app stores on the companys Play store. Among the more sensational allegations were that Google had a system for deleting texts and internal messages for the purpose of concealing its anticompetitive behavior. An attorney for Epic instructed jurors on Monday that they could assume the content of the deleted messages was pertinent to the case and would have been unfavorable to Google. Google has denied wrongdoing, arguing that it competes intensely on price, quality, and security against Apples App Store. A lawyer for Google, Jonathan Kravis, told jurors that Google does not want to lose 60 million Android users to Apple every year. Google lowered its fee structure to compete with Apple, Kravis said. This is not the behavior of a monopolist, he said. Google settled related claims from dating app maker Match (MTCH.O) before the trial started. The tech giant also settled related antitrust claims by U.S. states and consumers under terms that have not been made public. Epic lodged a similar antitrust case against Apple in 2020, but a U.S. judge largely ruled in favor of Apple in September 2021. Epic has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, and Apple is fighting part of a ruling for Epic that would require changes to App Store rules. Epic purposefully violated Play store rules by skirting its billing systems allowing for customers to make in-app purchases directly with Epic, an attorney for the gamemaker said on Monday. As a result, Google banned Fortnite and Epic filed its suit in response. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "New COP28 draft deal draws criticism for dropping phaseout of fossil fuels",
        "date": "December 12, 2023 11:34 am",
        "content": "A draft of a potential climate deal at the COP28 summit on Monday suggested a range of measures countries could take to slash greenhouse gas emissions, but omitted the phase out of fossil fuels many nations have demanded - drawing criticism from the U.S., EU and climate-vulnerable countries. The draft has set the stage for contentious last-minute negotiations in the two-week summit in Dubai, which has laid bare deep international divisions over whether oil, gas and coal should have a place in a climate-friendly future. A coalition of more than 100 countries have been pushing for an agreement would for the first time promise an eventual end to the oil age - but are up against opposition from members of the oil producer group OPEC. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber - who has previously used the conference to call for a paradigm shift - urged the nearly 200 countries at the talks to redouble their efforts to finalize a deal ahead of the scheduled close of the conference on Tuesday, saying they still have a lot to do. You know what remains to be agreed. And you know that I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items including on fossil fuel language, he said. The new draft of a COP28 agreement, published by the United Arab Emirates presidency of the summit, proposed various options but did not refer to a phase out of fossil fuels. Instead, it listed eight options that countries could use to cut emissions, including: reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050. Other actions listed included tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, rapidly phasing down unabated coal and scaling up technologies including those to capture CO2 emissions to keep them from the atmosphere. Alden Meyer, a senior associate at environmental think tank E3G, criticised the new deal as basically an a la carte menu that allows countries to individually choose what they want to do. Despite the fact emissions from burning fossil fuels are by far the main driver of climate change, 30 years worth of international climate negotiations have never resulted in a global agreement to cut their use. The text triggered a protest from dozens of delegates who stood in near silence, holding hands and lining the long route into a room where negotiators gathered, forcing them to run an eerie gauntlet before getting back to work. Please give us a good text, one delegate pleaded as negotiators filed in. U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry told the meeting, which ran for around three hours, that the draft agreement had to be strengthened. Were not where were meant to be in terms of the text, Kerry said. Many of us have called for the world to largely phase out fossil fuels, and that starts with a critical reduction this decade. Speaking with voice worn hoarse by the summit, he said the outcome of COP28 was existential: This is a war for survival. EU chief negotiator Wopke Hoekstra told reporters the draft was clearly insufficient and not adequate to addressing the problem we are here to address. Representatives from Pacific Island nations Samoa and the Marshall Islands, already suffering the impacts of rising seas, said the draft was a death sentence. We will not go silently to our watery graves, said John Silk, the head of the Marshall Islands delegation. We cannot sign on to a text that does not have strong commitment on phasing out fossil fuels, Samoa environment minister Cedric Schuster told reporters. Dan Jorgensen, the Danish climate minister, said he believed many countries opposed the current text. So, it was clear that this is only the starting point and that we are not even close to getting a result. A new draft document is expected early on Tuesday, which would leave little time for further disagreement ahead of the conferences scheduled close at 0700 GMT. COP summits rarely finish on schedule. Sources familiar with the discussions said the UAE had come under pressure from Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the OPEC oil producers group of which UAE is a member, to drop any mention of fossil fuels from the text. Saudi Arabias government did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. CONSENSUS It was unclear if China, currently the worlds top greenhouse gas emitter, supported the draft. Leaving their pavilion late on Monday, senior members of the China delegation, including chief envoy Xie Zhenhua, did not respond to questions. But observers noted that some of the language in the document was in line with Chinas previous policy positions, as well as parts of the Sunnylands agreement signed by China and the United States in November. The Sunnylands agreement did not use phrases like phasing out but instead called for the accelerated substitution of coal, oil and gas with renewable energy sources, and backed the pledge to triple renewable energy by 2030. Speaking to ministers and negotiators on Sunday, a representative for Saudi Arabias delegation said a COP28 deal should not pick and choose energy sources but should instead focus on cutting emissions. That position echoes a call made by OPEC in a letter to its members earlier in the summit, seen by Reuters, which asked them to oppose any language targeting fossil fuels directly. Deals at U.N. climate summits must be passed by consensus among the nearly 200 countries present. Developing nations have said any COP28 deal to overhaul the worlds energy system must be matched with sufficient financial support to help them do this. We need support as developing countries and economies for a just transition, said Colombias Environment Minister Susana Muhamad. Colombia supports phasing out fossil fuels. Despite the rapid growth of renewable energy, fossil fuels still produce around 80 of the worlds energy. Negotiators told Reuters that other OPEC and OPEC members including Russia, Iraq and Iran, have also resisted attempts to insert a fossil fuel phase-out into the COP28 deal.

        "date": "December 12, 2023 12:16 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mahinda Amaraweera, has highlighted the ongoing initiatives aimed at attracting the youth community to agriculture. He emphasized that proactive measures are being implemented to modernize the agricultural sector, fostering a more appealing environment for the youth. During a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country held on Monday (11), Minister Amaraweera expressed appreciation for the swift compensation provided within two months after crop damage, a historic achievement facilitated by the President and the Ministry of Finance, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Expanding on the recent budget debate concerning the allocation of funds to the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantations, Minister Amaraweera reflected on the commendable state of affairs within the ministry. Addressing concerns about the number of allegations levelled at the Agriculture Ministry compared to other ministries, the lawmaker clarified that the issues raised were primarily historical in nature and that the ministry is making significant strides in various cooperative projects across all sectors. Minister Amaraweera, noting that he assumed duties during a challenging period, recounted his proactive approach to instil confidence in farmers. He cited an example where, following his encouragement, farmers cultivated 212,000 hectares of rice, demonstrating a positive response. Subsequently, with continued dedication, the rice cultivation area expanded to an impressive 512,000 hectares, marking a substantial increase and achieving the highest yield in recent times. Addressing allegations regarding the quality of fertilizers and concerns about their weight, Minister Amaraweera emphasized the unwavering faith that farmers placed in the President and the government. Despite challenges, the farmers actively engaged in cultivation and the ministry took prompt measures to ensure timely provision of various types of fertilizers. Additionally, financial assistance and fuel subsidies were arranged, contributing to the overall success of cultivation efforts and resulting in a high yield, the PMD mentioned. Minister Amaraweeras remarks shed light on the ministrys commitment to overcoming challenges, ensuring the timely support of farmers and achieving notable progress in the agricultural sector. The focus on increasing yields and addressing concerns reflects a proactive and responsive approach to agricultural development under Minister Amaraweeras leadership. He shared crucial insights into Sri Lankas rice production and outlined measures to address potential challenges in the agricultural sector. Notably, the annual rice requirement stands at 25,40,000 metric tons and this years harvest has exceeded expectations, reaching 27,50,000 metric tons. The Minister attributed this success to strategic measures, resulting in an additional yield of over 200,000 metric tons. However, despite the surplus, the need for rice imports persists due to market dynamics. The lawmaker explained that although the paddy yield is high, mill owners reluctance to release the entire stock to the market necessitates imports. Similarly, despite a decrease in the harvest of Keeri Samba, there has not been a reduction in the variety of rice consumed by the general populace. Therefore, if rice is not imported during this festive season, the price of rice will rise rapidly. Consequently, the importation of rice from abroad becomes a necessity, whether willingly or not. Looking ahead to 2024, the Minister outlined the governments agricultural priorities, with a focus on four key crops. While paddy cultivation has achieved success, efforts are underway to encourage the cultivation of maize, chillies, and yams. An ongoing program aims to foster domestic cultivation of these crops, with dedicated areas allocated for each type. The government envisions self-sufficiency in growing these crops, reducing reliance on imports. Highlighting Sri Lankas status as a bird flu-free country, Minister Amaraweera emphasized the opportunity for expanding chicken exports. Current exports to the Maldives are poised for expansion to other countries, capitalizing on Sri Lankas bird flu-free status. Compensation is now provided for crop damage and we are actively working to expedite the program by resolving any arising issues. Remarkably, this marks the first time in history that compensation has been disbursed within a month or two of crop damage. I extend my commendation to the President and the Ministry of Finance for their prompt actions. The cultivation of rubber in our country has faced challenges and plans are underway to revitalize it. Steps are being taken to enhance the quality and increase the yield of tea. Additionally, a dedicated department has been established for the development of cinnamon cultivation. Special attention is also being directed towards coffee cultivation, with comprehensive improvement plans in progress. Recognizing the decline in youth participation in agriculture, largely attributed to factors such as insufficient income, we are implementing necessary measures to attract the younger generation to agriculture. In this regard, efforts are being made to further strengthen agricultural modernization activities, according to the PMD.",

The Cabinet of Ministers, on October 30, had given the nod to amend the VAT Act No.14 of 2002, imposing provisions to slash the limit of registration for VAT to the total value of supplies that tax can be charged from to Rs.60 million from the total value of supplies that can be recovered per year. Further, Cabinet approval was also given to raise the VAT rate from 15 to 18. The Bill was subsequently drafted by the Legal Draftsman adding applicable revisions and the clearance of the Attorney General, too, was received for the document. Later, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted the resolution submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister, to publish the draft bill in the government gazette and subsequently furnish the same to the parliament for its concurrence. As such, the Third Reading of the VAT (Amendment) Bill was passed with amendments in parliament on Monday, by a majority of 45 votes, with 100 MPs voting for the Bill, and 55 voting against it. Accordingly, the House had approved a hike in VAT up to 18 from the current 15, ahead of the International Monetary Funds preparations to approve the second tranche of a 2.9 billion bailout for the crisis-hit country. The Executive Board of the IMF is set to take up for consideration the first review of the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement for Sri Lanka today. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has raised concerns about the proposed increase of the VAT to 18, emphasizing that the move could lead to a further decline in consumption.",

        "content": "The former Sri Lanka Army sniper, who was arrested over his suspected involvement in the plot to help notorious underworld figure Harak Kata to escape from the custody of the CID, has been remanded until December 20. The accused was produced before Colombo Magistrate Thilina Gamage today (Dec.12). The 33-year-old suspect, a former Commando Sniper, was arrested in November by officers of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in Godagama in Matara, and was handed over to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) for further investigations. On September 10, Nadun Chinthaka, alias Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable, who is still evading arrest. The police officer in question, named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara, remains at large since September 10. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date while certain reports have claimed that he is presumed to have fled the country. On 18 September, the mother and brother-in-law of the police constable in question were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention order to interrogate them. Meanwhile, another Constable was arrested on 30 September on suspicion of his involvement in notorious underworld figure Harak Katas escape bid.",

        "date": "December 12, 2023 03:00 pm",
        "content": "A suicide bomber detonated his explosive-laden vehicle at a police stations main gate in northwest Pakistan early Tuesday, killing at least 22 officers and wounding 32 others, and causing a part of the building to collapse upon impact, officials said, in one of the deadliest attacks in recent months. Some militants also opened fire and a shootout ensued for hours between them and security forces before three attackers were gunned down, local police officer Kamal Khan said. The death toll from the attack was likely to rise as some of the officers were in critical condition, authorities said. The bodies of the 22 security forces killed were transferred to a hospital, Mohammad Adnan, a senior police official told reporters. Police launched a search operation in the surrounding area to apprehend the militants who got away, officials said. The attack happened in Dera Ismail Khan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, Khan said. The province is a former stronghold of the militant Pakistani Taliban group, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. The newly formed militant group Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan, or TJP  believed to be an offshoot of the TTP  claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying it targeted the officers who were at the police station. The statement also claimed that 20 officers were killed. However, this couldnt be independently verified. A larger number of security forces from across the country have had a constant presence lately at the Daraban police station where they were conducting intelligence-based operations against militants in the area with help from local police, said Khan. Pakistans caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti denounced the onslaught in a statement and conveyed his condolences to those who were martyred. He couldnt immediately confirm the number of officers killed in the attack which he called an act of terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has witnessed a rise in violence with several deadly incursions this year. In January, at least 101 people were killed, mostly police officers, when a suicide bomber disguised as a policeman attacked a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up attacks on security forces since 2022. Authorities say the insurgents have become emboldened while living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover of that country in 2021. The TTP, though a separate group, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban. Dera Ismail Khan is located near South Waziristan, a former sanctuary for militants. Pakistans army carried out multiple operations against militants there after some attacked an army-run school, killing more than 150 people, mostly school children, in 2014.

As an example, there are 182 students of Ananda College, Colombo who have obtained 9As at the examination and there are 206 students of Visaka College, Colombo with 9As.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has made several clarifications pertaining to the new Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in Parliament on Monday (11 Dec.). Addressing the House during the ongoing parliamentary debate on the 2024 Budget, the Head of State assured that while the IT sector will now be levied a VAT of up to 18, the increased tax will not be a burden on the industry, as it is an export-oriented industry. He emphasized that the export of IT services is a 0-rated supply. Acknowledging that certain parties within the sector remain unsatisfied with the increased tax rates, President Wickremesinghe noted that as per the decision to increase the VAT, it must be applicable to all sectors, with no exceptions. Even in India, the GST rate for all kinds of IT software supply services and products are 18, he said. Whatever we have collected out of by increasing to 18 will come back to the sector, because there is Rs. 1.5 billion kept aside for research, just on AI, and another Rs. 8 billion for all other technological research, of which Im sure this sector should take anything from Rs. 1 billion  Rs. 2 billion, so about Rs. 3.5 billion. What were doing is shifting the emphasis on to research and helping research. Wherever they want to go ahead, the government is prepared to support them, and we are moving very fast towards the digitalization, and we will be looking in the next two three years to do that, well go piggybacking on India and then let us develop it, so the whole digital sector will expand. You might pay 18 VAT but youre going to expand here in Sri Lanka and thats the development, the President stated, emphasizing that artificial intelligence (AI) is the future, and should therefore be the premise on which Sri Lanka expands. Speaking on the funds made available for research, President Wickremesinghe said, There is money available, nearly 9.5 billion available next year for research. We have never made that much of money available, for the first time that money is made available. He further emphasized the need for Sri Lanka to become a country that has a strong science and technology base. We cannot survive without it, the Head of State further highlighted. Talking on renewable energy, President Wickremesinghe emphasized that Sri Lanka has a large potential in this regard, which is yet to be tapped into. We have all this energy which we dont really require. We can even sell some to India on connectivity. ... We have this tremendous potential which we havent used and on which we have to do research, he said, highlighting that Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that can export renewable energy. Further commenting on the education sector and universities, the President highlighted that in addition to the existing universities, new universities, both state and private, are planned to be established with a special focus on management, science and technology. Commenting on potential investments in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe revealed that and Economic Commission is expected to replace both, the Board of Investments (BOI) and the Export Development Board (EDB), in a bid to draw investments from all fields. He subsequently briefed the House as to how this would play out, emphasising that it is likely to be very different to how things work now. The Presidents remarks came after the VAT (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament on Monday evening, with a majority of 45 votes, with 100 MPs voting in favour, and 55 voting against the Bill.

Colombo High Court Judge Namal Balalle further ordered that they be sentenced to 24 months of rigorous imprisonment, in the event that they fail to pay the relevant fine. In July this year, the disgraced former English tutor and his wife had pleaded guilty to financial fraud charges after they were accused of operating an unauthorized financial institution and misusing its deposits worth over Rs. 164 million obtained from the public. Ranasinghe and his wife had misappropriated an amount to the tune of Rs. 164,185,000 by misusing the funds of the depositors of his illegal financial company S.R. Property Sharing Investment (Pvt) Ltd during the period between January 01, 2006 and September 03, 2008. Ranasinghe started off as an English language tutor, and after gaining some popularity he had set up a financial institution that offered higher interest rates for depositors to invest their money. He is also said to have been involved in a real estate business through his other company Sakvithi Constructions, which he used to purchase and sell properties using forged deeds. The scam was eventually exposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in September 2008 after looking into a multitude of complaints filed by its victims. Ranasinghe then fled to Chennai, India shortly after his illegal activities had come under the spotlight. However, upon his return to the island, Mirihana Police arrested both him and his wife in August 2010. In 2022, the Colombo High Court handed Ranasinghe a 22-year rigorous imprisonment sentence suspended for five years after the accused pleaded guilty to 11 charges laid against him. The accused was fined Rs. 25,000 for each charge. Meanwhile, his wife, who pleaded guilty to one of the charges levelled in this case, was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for five years. She was fined Rs. 25,000.",

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the lawmaker said the move is an effort to lift the suspension imposed by the International Cricket Committee (ICC) on SLC. Fernando says he has also written to the ICC, seeking their observations on the Auditor Generals report on the national cricket body, and to the Attorney Generals Department for future actions. On Nov.06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. It was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga and consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move. Later, on Nov.13, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on Nov.27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was subsequently sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasinghe. On Dec.05, Fernando gave an undertaking before the Appeals Court, pledging that no further action would be taken in respect of the Gazette notification issued by his predecessor. Against this backdrop, the SLC decided to establish an independent committee to inquire into audit reports, and make recommendations to ensure the prevention of corruption. The panel comprises Retired Supreme Court Judges S. I. Imam and Rohini Marasinghe and Retired High Court Judge Irangani Perera.",

        "title": "IMF finalizes first review of Sri Lankas bailout package",
        "date": "December 13, 2023 12:38 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says its Executive Board on Tuesday (Dec.12) completed the first review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka. The completion of the first review paves the way for an immediate disbursement of the much-anticipated second tranche of the IMF loan which amounts to SDR 254 million (approximately USD 337 million). This will bring the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far to SDR 508 million (approximately USD 670 million). The total amount of Sri Lankas EFF Arrangement is SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion) as of the time of program approval on March 20, 2023. In a statement issued following the Executive Boards meeting, IMFs Deputy Managing Director Kenji Okamura commended Sri Lankas performance under the EFF-supported program, saying that it has been satisfactory. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June were met, except the one on expenditure arrears. All indicative targets were met, except the one on tax revenues. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of USD 2.9 billion in March 2023, the island nation has managed to partly stabilise its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. The EFF program supports Sri Lankas efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has reached in-principle deals with the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China, its largest bilateral creditor, and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) to restructure its debts. On November 29, the Sri Lankan government and the OCC revealed that they had reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of debt treatment. The in-principle deal covers approximately USD 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and consists of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. The deal between OCC and Sri Lanka came about a month after the island nations agreement with Chinas Exim Bank covering about USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. In his statement, Mr. Okamura said Sri Lankas in-principle agreements with the OCC and Chinas Exim Bank on debt treatments are consistent with the EFF targets. They are an important milestone putting Sri Lankas debt on the path towards sustainability. He noted that a swift completion and signature of the agreement with the official creditors is of importance. Mr. Okamura also highlighted that sustaining the reform momentum and strong ownership of reforms is imperative to ensure a full and swift recovery. The full statement issued by Mr. Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director, is as follows: Macroeconomic policy reforms are starting to bear fruit and the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization, with rapid disinflation, significant revenue-based fiscal adjustment, and reserves build-up. Performance under the EFF-supported program has been satisfactory. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June were met, except the one on expenditure arrears. All indicative targets were met, except the one on tax revenues. Most structural benchmarks were either met or implemented with delay by end-October 2023. The publication of a Governance Diagnostic Report, the first in Asia and a structural benchmark under the program, is a commendable first step towards addressing deep-rooted corruption weaknesses. Continued commitment to improving governance and timely implementation of the reports recommendations can deliver tangible economic gains to all citizens. Sri Lankas agreements-in-principle with the Official Creditors Committee and Export-Import Bank of China on debt treatments are consistent with the EFF targets. They are an important milestone putting Sri Lankas debt on the path towards sustainability. A swift completion and signature of the Memoranda of Understanding with the official creditors is important. Timely implementation of the agreements, together with reaching a resolution with external private creditors on comparable terms, should help restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability over the medium term. To ensure a full and swift recovery, sustaining the reform momentum and strong ownership of reforms is of paramount importance. Key priorities include advancing revenue mobilization, aligning energy pricing with costs, strengthening social safety nets, rebuilding external buffers, safeguarding financial stability, eradicating corruption, and enhancing governance. Reinforcing the revenue-based fiscal consolidation supported by revenue administration reforms is critical to recover from program slippages and promote a break from past policy shortcomings. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka should continue to focus on the multi-pronged disinflation strategy to safeguard the credibility of its inflation targeting regime. Accumulating reserves, supported by exchange rate flexibility, remains an important priority under the EFF. Implementing the bank recapitalization plan and strengthening financial supervision and crisis management framework are crucial to safeguard financial sector stability. Further strengthening the social safety net and protecting social spending remains critical to safeguarding the poor and vulnerable.",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 06:07 am",
        "content": "The new Extraordinary Gazette, signed by Minister of Sports Harin Fernando on Tuesday (Dec.12) to revoke the decision appointing an Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), has been published. By means of the new communiqué, the Extraordinary Gazette bearing reference No. 235643 dated November 05, 2023, has been rescinded with immediate effect, thereby dissolving the Interim Committee appointed for the purpose of exercising the powers, functions and duties of SLC. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the lawmaker said on Tuesday that, through this move, he intends to lift the suspension imposed by the International Cricket Committee (ICC) on SLC. On Nov.06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. It was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga and consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move. Later, on Nov.13, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on Nov.27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was subsequently sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasinghe. Against this backdrop, the SLC decided to establish an independent committee to inquire into audit reports, and make recommendations to ensure the prevention of corruption. The panel comprises Retired Supreme Court Judges S. I. Imam and Rohini Marasinghe and Retired High Court Judge Irangani Perera.",

        "title": "UN General Assembly votes overwhelmingly to demand a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza",
        "date": "December 13, 2023 07:25 am",
        "content": "The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to demand a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza in a strong demonstration of global support for ending the Israel-Hamas war. The vote also showed the growing isolation of the United States and Israel. The vote in the 193-member world body was 153 in favor, 10 against and 23 abstentions, and ambassadors and other diplomats burst into applause as the final numbers were displayed. The United States and Israel were joined in opposing the resolution by eight countries  Austria, Czechia, Guatemala, Liberia, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay. The support was much higher than for an Oct. 27 Arab-sponsored resolution that called for a humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities, where the vote was 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Today was a historic day in terms of the powerful message that was sent from the General Assembly, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, said after the vote. And it is our collective duty to continue in this path until we see an end to this aggression against our people, to see this war stopping against our people. It is our duty to save lives. The United States has grown increasingly isolated in its support for Israels military campaign in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted about 240 in a surprise attack on Oct. 7. More than the United Nations or any other international organization, the United States is seen as the only entity capable of persuading Israel to accept a cease-fire as its closest ally and biggest supplier of weaponry. In tougher language than usual, though, President Joe Biden warned before the vote that Israel was losing international support because of its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza. After the United States vetoed a resolution in the Security Council on Friday demanding a humanitarian cease-fire, Arab and Islamic nations called for Tuesdays emergency session of the General Assembly to vote on a resolution making the same demand. Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding. But the assemblys messages are important barometers of world opinion. But Mansour said we will not rest until we see compliance of Israel with this demand from the General Assembly so that we can see a cease-fire in place. The resolution makes no mention of Hamas, and the assembly defeated two proposed amendments mentioning the militant group. One, proposed by the United States, would have added a paragraph stating that the assembly unequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas. The other, proposed by Austria, would have added a call for the immediate release of hostages still held by Hamas. The war, now in its third month, has brought unprecedented death and destruction, with much of northern Gaza obliterated, more than 18,000 Palestinians killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry, 70 of them reportedly children and women, and over 80 of the population of 2.3 million pushed from their homes. General Assembly President Dennis Francis, who chaired the meeting, said the world is witnessing an onslaught on civilians, the breakdown of humanitarian systems, and profound disrespect for both international law and international humanitarian law. He said civilians should never undergo the level of suffering in Gaza and asked, How many more thousands of lives must be lost before we do something? No more time is left. The carnage must stop. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly how Israel defends itself matters, and she delivered several U.S. demands, which she said the Biden administration will press at the highest levels. Israel must avoid mass displacement of civilians in the south of Gaza, Thomas-Greenfield said. It must ensure sufficient humanitarian assistance to those who have fled violence and it must allow civilians in Gaza to return home as soon as conditions allow. But she made clear that the U.S. remains committed to Israels right to defend itself. She asked assembly members why it was so difficult for U.N. nations to condemn Hamas terrorist actions on Oct. 7, to say unequivocally that murdering babies and gunning down parents in front of their children is horrific, that burning down houses while families shelter inside and taking civilian hostages in abhorrent. Israels U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan warned before the vote that a cease-fire will only prolong the death and destruction in the region and will be a death sentence for countless more Israelis and Gazans. A cease-fire means one thing and one thing only  ensuring the survival of Hamas, ensuring the survival of genocidal terrorists committed to the annihilation of Israel and Jews, he said. Erdan said if U.N. member nations want a cease-fire they should call Hamas office in Gaza. He held up a sign with a phone number and the name Yehya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Hamas attack, who is at the top of Israels hit list. The resolution expresses grave concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population, and it says Palestinians and Israelis must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law. It also demands that all parties comply with international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians, and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access. Tuesdays vote showed major shifts in voting. More than 25 countries that abstained on Oct. 27 supported Tuesdays cease-fire demand, including Albania, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, India, Iraq, Japan, Latvia, Monaco, North Macedonia, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Moldova, San Marino, Serbia, Sweden, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Zambia. Croatia and Fiji went from voting no on Oct. 27 to voting yes on Tuesday, while Hungary, the Marshall Islands and Tonga went from voting no to abstaining. Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 09:38 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund says its second review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2024, says IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer. Additionally, an IMF team is planning to visit the island nation in March or April next year, Mr. Breuer commented further addressing a special virtual media briefing convened this morning. IMFs Deputy Mission Chief Katsiaryna Svirydzenka and Resident Representative for Sri Lanka Sarwat Jahan also joined the press briefing, which came after the global lenders Executive Board finalized the first review on Sri Lanka. The boards approval gives access to the much-anticipated second tranche of its loan which adds up to SDR 254 million (about USD 337 million). This will bring the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far to SDR 508 million (approximately USD 670 million). Meanwhile, the third review is expected to be held on or after October 01, 2024. In his opening remarks, Mr. Breuer said the IMFs Executive Boards approval recognizes the challenging policy actions implemented by Sri Lankan people to put the crisis behind them. He lauded Sri Lankas performance under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF)-supported program, emphasizing that it was satisfactory. Stating that Sri Lankas macroeconomic policy reforms have started to bear fruit and the economy is showing signs of stabilization, rapid disinflation and significant revenue-based fiscal adjustment, and reserves build-up, Mr. Breuer urged the authorities to continue to build on these hard-won gains. He noted that the key to transitioning from stabilization to a full and swift recovery is sustaining the reform momentum and strong ownership of reforms. The Senior IMF Missions Chief went on to appeal to Sri Lankan authorities to further advance revenue mobilization, align energy prizing with costs, strengthen social safety nets, rebuild external buffers, safeguard financial stability, eradicate corruption and enhance governance. Speaking on the in-principle agreements Sri Lanka has reached with the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC), Mr. Breuer said the deals are consistent with the EFF-supported programs targets. It is now important for SL authorities and the official creditors to sign the respective Memorandums of Understanding. Timely implementation of the agreements, together with reaching a resolution with external private creditors on comparable terms, should help restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability over the medium term.

        "date": "December 13, 2023 10:30 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka currently imports most of its energy needs, including oil, coal and hydrocarbons. To ease the economic burden, the island nation aims to generate 70 of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Russia has emerged as one of the strongest contenders to build nuclear power plants in Sri Lanka, according to a media report published on Tuesday. According to the report, a high-level delegation from Russia recently visited the island nation and discussed proposed cooperation in the nuclear energy sector with the Sri Lankan authorities. Chairman of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Authority (SLAEA) Prof. S.R.D. Rosa briefed the Russian delegation on the status of Moscows proposal to develop an offshore or onshore nuclear power plant in Sri Lanka. He said his office had in principle given its approval for nuclear power to enhance Sri Lankas energy mix and it had been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval. We can implement this project only if the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) is signed between Sri Lanka and Russia. That is now pending, he added. Many countries, including the US, Denmark and China, have expressed interest in investing in nuclear power plants in the island nation after the SLAEA gave the green light to nuclear power. Why Russia Is Foremost Contender Russia has taken a leading position in building nuclear power plants in South Asian countries. It has demonstrated its efficiency and understanding of the region by building plants in countries such as Bangladesh, China and India. In addition, recently, Russia signed a memorandum with Burkina Faso, a country in West Africa, to construct a nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, earlier speaking with Sputnik, Sergey Pikin, director of the Energy Development Fund, a Moscow-based think tank, said Russia can support them as it is also a supplier of technology, help them (Sri Lanka) while constructing the station, and with other requirements, including finances. I think the choice of Sri Lanka is obvious, Pikin said, adding, Russia is a global leader, and Colombo should move forward with Russia. In July, media reports quoted Wijesekera saying that Sri Lanka is assessing nuclear power plant offers from Russia and other countries. Sri Lanka, a country of 22 million people, secured a 2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund to end its worst economic crisis since the end of colonial rule in 1948. According to media reports, Sri Lankas electricity generation in 2020 was heavily reliant on fossil fuels (10 TWh) and hydropower (5 TWh), with small contributions from wind and solar. The CEBs long-term energy plans include nuclear power from 2030. In 2022, a team of IAEA experts assessed Sri Lankas readiness for a nuclear power programme through an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review. This review was part of the IAEAs Milestones Approach, designed for countries introducing nuclear energy. Source - Sputnik - Agencies",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 11:13 am",
        "content": "Electricity tariffs are set to be revised in January 2024, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera has revealed. Accordingly, owing to the change in weather forecasts, Minister Wijesekera hinted that electricity tariffs will likely be reduced in 2024. Speaking further in this regard, the Minister noted that in light of the fact that Sri Lankas electricity requirement is still being met through hydroelectric power generation due to the ongoing monsoonal weather, consumers can be given some relief next year. In the past years, we did not have this much of rainfall around this time of the year. But now, the amount of rain received in a day has increased continuously, and we have gained an advantage because of this. We are able to maximize the use of hydropower generation, and have been able to halt our coal power plants, and the other oil and diesel plants we have, the Minister said. Minister Wijesekera further explained that although it was initially decided to amend the electricity tariffs in April 2024, a tariff revision is set to take place in mid-January, in a bid to provide certain relief to consumers.",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 11:17 am",
        "content": "Pastor Jerome Fernando, who was under fire over his controversial remarks on several religions, has been further remanded until December 27. The self-styled prophet was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate this morning (Dec.13). He was first placed behind bars on remand on December 01, following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day. Pastor Fernando had made his first appearance at the CID on November 30 and provided a statement for around 08 hours. He found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Fernando then flew out to Singapore on May 14, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on Wednesday morning (Nov.29). He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. As per a court directive, the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",

        "title": "IMF says increasing revenue of paramount importance for Sri Lanka; defends VAT hike",
        "date": "December 13, 2023 12:21 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says increasing state revenue is of paramount importance for Sri Lanka as the South Asian island nation continues to be an economy with exceptionally low tax revenues. Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer, addressing a special virtual media briefing convened this morning (Dec.13) after the IMF Executive Boards cleared the Extended Fund Facility (EFF)-supported program for Sri Lanka, mentioned that the countrys revenue was 8.3 of the GDP in 2022, compared to an average of other emerging market countries. The press briefing was co-chaired by IMFs Deputy Mission Chief Katsiaryna Svirydzenka and Resident Representative for Sri Lanka Sarwat Jahan, along with Mr. Breuer. The Senior Mission Chief emphasized that revenue is needed for the government to provide the essential services and without such revenue it is impossible for the authorities to provide the services that the citizens expect of the government. Raising revenue continues to be of paramount importance in Sri Lanka. Despite all these measures that have been taken, there is still a long road ahead. Speaking further, Mr. Breuer said the IMF projects positive growth for Sri Lanka in 2024, adding that there are signs that all these reforms are paying off now. But clearly, the economy is not yet out of the woods. Sustaining the reform momentum is imperative for the economy to safely emerge from the crisis. Regarding the upcoming increase of the Value-Added Tax (VAT), Mr. Breuer said the IMF is cognizant that VAT is not an optimal tax. He noted that despite the tax reforms implemented last year, there have been shortfalls in tax collection. In a situation like that, one has to look into second-best options. So raising the VAT is one of those. Meanwhile, IMF Resident Representative for Sri Lanka Sarwat Jahan commented that regardless of the increase in VAT there are measures to help the poor and the vulnerable, adding that some of the most essential items including the ones that are consumed by the low-income households, such as fruits, vegetables, rice flour, wheat flour, are exempt from the VAT. The IMFs Executive Board finalized the first review on Sri Lankas bailout package on Tuesday (Dec.12), giving access to SDR 254 million (about USD 337 million) and bringing the total IMF disbursements thus far to SDR 508 million (about USD 670 million) out of the SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion). In his opening remarks, Mr. Breuer said the EFF continues to support Sri Lankas efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms. He underscored Sri Lankas performance under the EFF-supported program, which is deemed satisfactory. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June were met, except the one on expenditure arrears. All indicative targets were met, except the one on tax revenues. Most structural benchmarks were either met or implemented with delay by end-October 2023. The key to transitioning from stabilization to a full and swift recovery is sustaining the reform momentum and strong ownership of reforms, Mr. Breuer continued. He said the IMF continues to encourage the authorities to further build on the hard-won gains and further advance revenue mobilization, align energy prizing with costs, strengthen social safety nets, rebuild external buffers, safeguard financial stability, eradicate corruption and enhance governance. Commenting further, Mr. Breuer also highlighted the importance of reinforcing the revenue-based fiscal consolidation with revenue administration reforms to recover from program slippages; implementing the bank recapitalization plan and strengthening financial supervision and crisis management framework to safeguard financial sector stability; and further strengthening the social safety net and protecting social spending to safeguard the poor and vulnerable. The Senior Mission Chief said the IMF looks forward to further engagement and collaboration with stakeholders and civil society organizations on critical reforms. He further revealed that the second review of the EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2024 and that an IMF delegation is slated to visit the island nation in March or April next year.",

        "content": "Sports Minister Harin Fernando on Wednesday (13 Dec.) informed the Court of Appeal of the move to revoke an earlier gazette notification appointing an Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and to dissolve the said panel. The court was informed of the relevant matter when a petition filed by SLC President Shammi Silva against the said Interim Committee was taken up for consideration this morning. Meanwhile, the decision of the Appellate Court on whether or not the relevant petition would be further taken up is due to be announced on 15 December. The new Extraordinary Gazette signed by Minister Fernando to revoke the decision appointing an Interim Committee for SLC was published on Tuesday (12 Dec.). Accordingly, by means of the new communiqué, the Extraordinary Gazette bearing reference No. 235643 dated November 05, 2023, has been rescinded with immediate effect, thereby dissolving the Interim Committee appointed for the purpose of exercising the powers, functions and duties of SLC. On 06 November, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. It was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga and consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move. Later, on 13 November, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on 27 November, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was subsequently sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasingh",

        "content": "The 8th Round of Sri Lanka-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (SLTFTA) Negotiations have been successfully concluded. The negotiations, which took place from 27-29 November in Bangkok, were co-chaired by the Director General of the Department of Trade Negotiations and the Chief Negotiator of Thailand, Auramon Supthaweethum and the Chief Negotiator of Sri Lanka, K.J. Weerasinghe, according to the Embassy and Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Bangkok. The Chief Negotiator of Thailand has welcomed the Sri Lankan delegation to the 8th Round of SLTFTA Negotiations and stated that both countries have agreed to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2023. The FTA is expected to be signed on February 03, 2024, to coincide with the Independence Day celebrations of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the Chief Negotiator of Sri Lanka has appreciated Thailand for hosting the 8th Round of SLTFTA Negotiations, while expressing gratitude for agreeing to conclude the SLTFTA Negotiations by the end of this year. On the sidelines of negotiations, a seminar on trade and investment opportunities in Thailand and Sri Lanka was organised by Thailands Department of Trade Negotiations and the Department of International Trade Promotion on November 29. The opening remarks at the Seminar were delivered by the Deputy Minister of Commerce, Napintorn Srisunpang and Ambassador of Sri Lanka and Permanent Representative to the UNESCAP, C. A. Chaminda I. Colonne. Deputy Minister Napintorn, in his remarks, has highlighted that the establishment of the Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA is an opportunity to expand trade and investment into new markets in South Asia. Sri Lanka is strategically located on the shipping routes of the Indian Ocean. It is linked to South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa and is a key strategic link in Chinas Maritime Silk Road and has abundant resources such as gems, aquatic animals and minerals, which are raw materials that Thailands domestic industry needs. During her remarks, Ambassador Colonne stated that despite the longstanding historical relations between our two brotherly nations based on Buddhist religious values, the two-way trade between Sri Lanka and Thailand amounted to only USD 352 million in 2022. It is regrettable to state that the total investment received from Thailand in Sri Lanka is negligible, with only USD 0.74 million recorded in 2022. The vision of the Government of Sri Lanka is to integrate into the global economy and in this context, to expand economic and trade relations to South Asia and then to the East and to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Sri Lanka has submitted its letter of intent to RCEP Secretariat. The delegation of Thailand consisted of Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Trade Negotiations, Department of Foreign Trade, Thai Customs Department, Board of Investment and Office of the Council of State. Meanwhile, the delegation of Sri Lanka comprised senior Officials from the Embassy and Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Thailand, Presidential Secretariat, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Commerce, Department of Trade and Investment Policies, Attorney Generals Department, Sri Lanka Customs, Central Bank, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 01:21 pm",
        "content": "In a significant stride toward advancing the fisheries and aquatic resources sector, Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda announced the enactment of a revised Fisheries Act. The draft of this transformative legislation has been forwarded to solicit opinions and insights from field experts, marking a collaborative effort to optimize the industrys potential, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Addressing the media at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective path to a stable country, on Tuesday (12 Dec.), Minister Devananda highlighted key initiatives aimed at bolstering the fishing community. Notably, the encouragement of using battery motors for fishing boats was underscored as a measure to alleviate production costs for fishermen and address fuel-related challenges. Minister Douglas Devananda, while providing his insights during the press conference, expressed admiration for the unprecedented budget plan presented by the current government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The multifaceted challenges posed by factors such as the aftermath of war and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to economic setbacks, causing the country to face considerable adversity. He attributed the rapid recovery of the economically challenged country to the Presidents guidance, leadership and the collective support of the nation. He also said that while abroad, the Minister frequently faces queries from international counterparts curious about Sri Lankas rapid recovery. In response, the Minister credits this success to President Ranil Wickremeinghes adept guidance and strong leadership. The Minister highlights the Presidents distinctive personality and commends the unwavering support from those aligned with the current government. Additionally, the Minister underscores the vital role played by the people of Sri Lanka in understanding the nations challenges. Their active cooperation and collaborative efforts with the government have proven instrumental in navigating the crisis and expediting the recovery process. In the 2024 budget, the Ministry of Fisheries has been allocated Rs. 8,400 million, off that Rs. 6,077 million allocated for capital expenditure and Rs. 2,323 million for recurrent expenditure. Minister Devananda emphasized the importance of utilizing these funds to enhance the overall development of the country, particularly focusing on improving the livelihoods of the fishermen. He also called for support from domestic and foreign private investments to further boost the marine industry. Owing to the surge in fuel prices, the fishing industry in Sri Lanka has experienced significant setbacks. Acknowledging the uncontrollable fluctuations in international fuel prices, the government cannot be held responsible for the resulting increase in prices domestically. In response to this challenge, strategic plans are underway to enhance the maritime sector by maximizing available opportunities. The government is actively exploring various alternative methods, with a specific focus on reducing both fuel and production costs within the fishing industry. Concurrently, a comprehensive study has been undertaken to assess the viability of incorporating battery motors in fishing boats. This initiative aims to alleviate the production costs for fishermen and address the on-going challenges associated with fuel consumption. Experimental trials have been conducted in this domain to gauge the effectiveness and feasibility of integrating battery-powered motors into fishing activities. The Minister highlighted the forthcoming introduction of a new amended Act on Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, emphasizing the collaborative approach taken to seek expert opinions and improve the draft. The matter of Indian fishermen participating in fishing activities within Sri Lankan waters necessitates a diplomatic resolution between the two nations. As per the Constitution of India, fisheries issues fall under the jurisdiction of the state government. In line with this, it is the Ministers stance that the most effective solution involves direct engagement. Therefore, he advocates for all members of parliament representing the Northern Province to engage in discussions directly with Indian authorities, including those from Pondicherry and the Tamil Nadu state government and the Indian Media.",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 02:00 pm",
        "content": "Two U.S. senators, together with two congressmen, have introduced a bicameral and bipartisan resolution expressing the United States support for the peaceful democratic and economic aspirations of the people of Sri Lanka. The resolution was put forward by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, respectively, along with Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.-08) and Bill Johnson (R-Ohio-06). U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in a statement that the resolution urges the Sri Lankan government to listen to and respect the rights of Sri Lankan people by addressing corruption, ensuring justice and accountability for human rights abuses, and holding free and fair local and provincial elections without further delay. The resolution recognizes that the people of Sri Lanka have faced a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis which has had devastating human impact. It also notes that this crisis is exacerbated by government corruption, financial mismanagement, failures in the rule of law, and predatory lending associated with the Peoples Republic of China, the statement reads further. In the resolution, the Sri Lankan government is accused of not doing enough to address endemic corruption and impunity, and weakening Sri Lankas democracy by indefinitely postponing local elections. Many of those responsible for this crisis are also implicated in human rights abuses against Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims across Sri Lanka dating back to the civil war. Speaking in this regard, Chair of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin said: Sri Lankas ongoing economic, governance, and humanitarian crises  which have had crippling impacts on the Sri Lankan people  are exacerbated by the Sri Lankan governments unwillingness to meaningfully address the devastating legacy and impacts of its civil war and provide justice to those who suffered serious human rights abuses. This resolution makes clear that the United States stands with the people of Sri Lanka in their effort to form a more inclusive, just, democratic, and economically sustainable future. Meanwhile, the committees Ranking Member Jim Risch said: Strengthening Sri Lankas democracy supports a more secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. This resolution urges the government of Sri Lanka to hold free and fair local elections as soon as possible and to strengthen good governance, rule of law, corruption, justice, accountability, and human rights measures. The United States will continue to support the people of Sri Lanka in their pursuit of peace, prosperity, and democracy. Congressman Krishnamoorthi commented: The people of Sri Lanka have experienced decades of war, economic crisis, and political suppression that have led to this moment of inflection in the nations history. As a result of our resolution, the U.S. House of Representatives will express its strong support for the Sri Lankan citizenry and their ongoing efforts to bring about a peaceful, democratic society that will ensure prosperity for the nation and accountability for the tragic actions of the past. It would further reinforce the principle that Sri Lankas leaders must safeguard the political, economic, and social rights of the populace, including and especially the ethnic and religious communities who have been deliberately suppressed and targeted by previous governments. Congressman Johnson remarked: Im proud to co-lead this bipartisan, bicameral resolution with Rep. Krishnamoorthi and Senators Cardin and Risch. As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Ethnic and Religious Freedom in Sri Lanka, I have long advocated for increasing civil and human rights for all ethnicities and religions in Sri Lanka who are being excluded from society, the economy, and political life through discrimination, harassment, and persecution. I am hopeful that it encourages the Sri Lankan government to take positive, visible, and concrete actions to provide greater transparency, increased human rights, and accountability for past alleged war crimes and violations of human and civil rights.",

        "content": "In a major security breach coming on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament attack, two men entered the Lok Sabha chamber on Wednesday and opened canisters that emitted a yellow-coloured smoke, Indian media reported. They were seated in the visitors gallery and they took out canisters from their shoes. Television footage showed them jumping from desk to desk, and appeared to be headed towards the Well of the House. Members present inside the House told reporters later that they (the protesters) were chanting slogans such as tana shahi nahi chalegi (dictatorship wont be accepted). They have been detained. Two more protesters, a man named Amol, from Latur (Maharashtra), and a woman named Neelam, from Hisaar (Haryana), were held from near Transport Bhavan, which is in close proximity to the Parliament complex. The identity of the two who entered Lok Sabha is yet to be disclosed by security agencies. BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal, who was presiding over the House proceedings said that he saw one person falling from the visitors gallery, and simultaneously, another man was jumping on the desks. One of them took something out of his shoes that was emitting smoke. The security personnel caught them, and it remains to seen who they are, what was their objective and what organisation are they associated with, he added. Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury: Two young men jumped from the gallery and something was hurled by them from which gas was emitting. They were caught by MPs, (and) they were brought out by security personnel. The House was adjourned till 2 pm. This is certainly a security breach because today we observed the death anniversary of people who sacrificed their lives in 2001. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said that the canisters were emitting yellow smoke, and raised concerns that it could have been poisonous. Suddenly two young men around 20 years old jumped into the House from the visitors gallery and had canisters in their hand. These canisters were emitting yellow smoke. One of them was attempting to run towards the Speakers chair. They were shouting some slogans. The smoke could have been poisonous. This is a serious breach of security especially on December 13, the day when Parliament was attacked in 2001. Source: Indian Express --Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe states that the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sri Lanka, can only be removed by continuing along the same path and strengthening the countrys economy. Delivering a special statement in Parliament on the IMF Executive Boards completion of the first review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka this morning (13), Wickremesinghe expressed optimism that the IMF now admits that Sri Lanka has taken decisive steps to overcome the state of bankruptcy. Now they IMF admit that we have taken decisive steps to save ourselves from the label of a bankrupt state. I am humbled to be able to lead this proud journey, the President mentioned. I took over a bankrupt country last year. No leader came forward to take over that bankrupt country. Everyone was afraid to accept this challenge. None of the heroes who are now addressing the Parliament had the courage to come forward. I accepted that challenge... All I had was determination and dedication. Not a single MP representing my party was in the Parliament. But the majority of MPs supported me although they were also insulted and mocked. The people of the country also supported me. They faced various hardships for the country and supported this journey, he added. Speaking further, the Head of the State highlighted that the countrys inflation prevailed at 70 at the time he took over the country, but it has now been brought down to 1.5. At the time the depreciation of the rupee had risen to 80. The value of the rupee increased to Rs. 360 per dollar. Now it has stabilized at the level of Rs. 325 - Rs. 330 per dollar. Moreover, Wickremesinghe expressed, We have no other path but this path. There are two main factors in this path - having access to IMF assistance and debt restructuring. We handled both those factors properly. So we have been able to obtain good results. Furthermore, he emphasized that with the approval of the second tranche from the IMF, the country will receive multiple advantages including USD 150 million from the World Bank for deposit insurance, which will make the financial sector tremendously strong. This makes the banking and financial sector 100 secure, Wickremesinghe added. Foreign investors can invest in Sri Lanka without any doubt then. Our Letters of Credit are now accepted at the international level again. The President also expressed that the government is aware that a certain group of the society has faced hardships as a result of imposing taxes including VAT, adding that the government had no other choice. Some parties question what the purpose of a government to govern the country if it has to be subjected to the conditions of the IMF. They claim that they will impose conditions on the IMF once they come to power. These are just childish stories. Only the people who have Montessori-level knowledge about the economy can tell such stories, he added. Remember, we can get out of the IMF conditions only if we continue on this path and build a strong economy under these conditions, the President assured.",

        "date": "December 13, 2023 04:01 pm",
        "content": "Representatives from nearly 200 countries agreed at the COP28 climate summit on Wednesday to begin reducing global consumption of fossil fuels to avert the worst of climate change, a first of its kind deal signaling the eventual end of the oil age. The deal struck in Dubai after two weeks of hard-fought negotiations was meant to send a powerful signal to investors and policy-makers that the world is united in its desire to break with fossil fuels, something scientists say is the last best hope to stave off climate catastrophe. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber called the deal historic but added that its true success would be in its implementation. We are what we do, not what we say, he told the crowded plenary at the summit. We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into tangible actions. Several countries cheered the deal for accomplishing something elusive in decades of climate talks. It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels, said Norway Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide. More than 100 countries had lobbied hard for strong language in the COP28 agreement to phase out oil, gas and coal use, but came up against powerful opposition from the Saudi Arabia-led oil producer group OPEC, which argued that the world can slash emissions without shunning specific fuels. That battle pushed the summit a full day into overtime on Wednesday, and had some observers worried the negotiations would end at an impasse. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries control nearly 80 of the worlds proven oil reserves along with about a third of global oil output, and their governments rely heavily on those revenues. Small climate-vulnerable island states, meanwhile, were among the most vocal supporters of language to phase out fossil fuels and had the backing of huge oil and gas producers such as the United States, Canada and Norway, along with the EU bloc and scores of other governments. This is a moment where multilateralism has actually come together and people have taken individual interests and attempted to define the common good, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said after the deal was adopted. The lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, Anne Rasmussen, criticised the deal as unambitious. We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual, when what we really need is an exponential step change in our actions, she said. But she did not formally object to the pact, and her speech drew a standing ovation. Danish Minister for Climate and Energy Dan Jorgensen marveled at the circumstances of the deal: Were standing here in an oil country, surrounded by oil countries, and we made the decision saying lets move away from oil and gas. EMISSIONS REDUCTION The deal calls for transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science. It also calls for a tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, speeding up efforts to reduce coal use, and accelerating technologies such as carbon capture and storage that can clean up hard-to-decarbonize industries. A representative for Saudi Arabia welcomed the deal, saying it would help the world limit global warming to the targeted 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times set in the 2015 Paris deal, but repeated the oil producers stance that tackling climate change was about reducing emissions. We must use every opportunity to reduce emissions regardless of the source, he said. Several other oil producer countries, including the summit host UAE, had advocated for a role for carbon capture in the pact. Critics say the technology remains expensive and unproven at scale, and argue it is a false flag to justify continued drilling. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore also welcomed the deal, but said: The influence of petrostates is still evident in the half measures and loopholes included in the final agreement. Now that the deal is struck, countries are responsible for delivering through national policies and investments. In the United States, the worlds top producer of oil and gas and the top historical emitter of greenhouse gases, climate-conscious administrations have struggled to pass laws aligned with their climate vows through a divided Congress. U.S. President Joe Biden scored a major victory on that front last year with passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contained hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy subsidies. Mounting public support for renewables and electric vehicles from Brussels to Beijing in recent years, along with improving technology, sliding costs, and rising private investment have also driven rapid growth in their deployments. Even so, oil, gas, and coal still account for about 80 of the worlds energy, and projections vary widely about when global demand will finally hit its peak. Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, praised the climate deal, but noted that it does not commit rich countries to offer more financing to help developing countries pay for the transition away from fossil fuels. The finance and equity provisions... are seriously insufficient and must be improved in the time ahead in order to ensure low- and middle-income countries can transition to clean energy and close the energy poverty gap, she said.

        "date": "December 13, 2023 05:20 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed that several international parties have expressed their willingness to climb aboard Sri Lankas initiatives to tackle the looming climate crisis. Speaking to Gulf Business on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai, President Wickremesinghe revealed that several international parties have expressed their interest to corporate with Sri Lanka on the proposals presented with regards to combatting the climate crisis. Sri Lanka is already being impacted by the climate crisis, along with several other countries in the tropic, President Wickremesinge said, highlighting the urgency with which the matter should be addressed. For the last few years, weve been thinking the same waywhere have we got? Were still stuck where we are. So weve proposed to think out of the box, because you are having a crisis, if you are not getting results on the present path, then we have to look at something new, the Head of State said. Speaking on the proposals presented, President Wickremesinghe revealed that Sri Lanka is currently spearheading numerous initiatives in this regard, including the Climate Justice Forum, which is expected to be presented before the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) conference in 2024, and the International Climate Change University (ICCU), which Sri Lanka plans on hosting with support from stakeholders. There has to be capacity building, there has to be also a focal point where research goes on. This is more a university for postgraduate research as well as training of officials, President Wickremesinghe said, adding that it is likely to draw several similarities to the East-West Center in Hawaii. Moreover, the President also spoke of the Tropical Belt Initiative, which focuses on harnessing commercial investments in vital natural resources within the tropical belt, such as forests, swamps, and mangroves. At the end of the day, we need trillions of dollars, President Wickremesinghe said, explaining that in light of the fact that no government would be willing to, nor capable of, sourcing such funds annually, it is crucial that such an investment be commercially viable. At any case, governments cant raise the trillions that are needed. We have to get it from the private market, we have to find a way of unlocking it, he emphasised. President Wickremesinghe also shed light on the collaboration with the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to promote the blue economy and create a sustainable Indian Ocean, highlighting that the combination of the Tropical Belt Initiative and the efforts in the Indian Ocean is envisioned to become the worlds largest global sink for carbon. When asked as to the response received from other nations, if any, with regard to the proposals, President Wickremesinghe stated that discussions with world leaders, including the Presidents of Maldives, Kenya, Brazil and Ghana showcased widespread interest in the initiatives. I think there will be sufficient support, he said. Meanwhile, speaking on Sri Lankas ongoing recovery from its infamous economic crisis in 2022, President Wickremesinghe assured that the country is expecting positive economic growth next year. Speaking on its debt restructuring programme, the Head of State further said, Weve finished the negotiations with our official creditors, with the Paris Club, with India and with China, and we anticipate that the official creditors committee will come up with a positive statement at the end of the year, adding that Sri Lanka is only left with having to negotiate with the private creditors.

        "date": "December 13, 2023 10:10 pm",
        "content": "Tesla is recalling nearly all vehicles sold in the U.S., more than 2 million, to update software and fix a defective system thats supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot. Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the update will increase warnings and alerts to drivers and even limit the areas where basic versions of Autopilot can operate. The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly. The agency says its investigation found Autopilots method of making sure that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to foreseeable misuse of the system. The added controls and alerts will further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility, the documents said. But safety experts said while the recall is a good step, it still makes the driver responsible and doesnt fix the underlying problem that Teslas automated systems have trouble spotting and stopping for obstacles in their path. The recall covers models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7 of this year. The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday, with the rest getting it later. Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when its not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on City Streets. The software update will limit where Autosteer can be used. If the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage, the recall documents said. Depending on a Teslas hardware, the added controls include increasing prominence of visual alerts, simplifying how Autosteer is turned on and off, and additional checks on whether Autosteer is being used outside of controlled access roads and when approaching traffic control devices. A driver could be suspended from using Autosteer if they repeatedly fail to demonstrate continuous and sustained driving responsibility, the documents say. According to recall documents, agency investigators met with Tesla starting in October to explain tentative conclusions about the fixing the monitoring system. Tesla did not concur with NHTSAs analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the investigation. Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether a drivers hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by other automakers with similar systems. Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety, called the software update a compromise that doesnt address a lack of night vision cameras to watch drivers eyes, as well as Teslas failing to spot and stop for obstacles. The compromise is disappointing because it does not fix the problem that the older cars do not have adequate hardware for driver monitoring, Koopman said. Koopman and Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, contend that crashing into emergency vehicles is a safety defect that isnt addressed. Its not digging at the root of what the investigation is looking at, Brooks said. Its not answering the question of why are Teslas on Autopilot not detecting and responding to emergency activity? Koopman said NHTSA apparently decided that the software change was the most it could get from the company, and the benefits of doing this now outweigh the costs of spending another year wrangling with Tesla. In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the investigation remains open as we monitor the efficacy of Teslas remedies and continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of safety. Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane, but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name. Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool, so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even sitting in the back seat. In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said Autopilots controls may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse. A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the Austin, Texas, company. Tesla says on its website that Autopilot and a more sophisticated Full Self Driving system are meant to help drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. Full Self Driving is being tested by Tesla owners on public roads. In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged. NHTSA has dispatched investigators to 35 Tesla crashes since 2016 in which the agency suspects the vehicles were running on an automated system. At least 17 people have been killed. The investigations are part of a larger probe by the NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into emergency vehicles. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas, including a recall of Full Self Driving software. In May, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department includes NHTSA, said Tesla shouldnt be calling the system Autopilot because it cant drive itself.

        "date": "December 14, 2023 08:16 am",
        "content": "The Cop28 global climate summit has reached a historic deal hailed by the United Nations as the beginning of the end for the fossil fuel era. After more than 24 hours of fraught negotiations, an agreement was made to start transitioning away from all oil, coal and gas this decade, with a view to reaching net zero by 2050. The world currently is far off course from this target. The pledge, signed by 200 countries in the final conference session on Wednesday morning in Dubai, also recognised the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. As the UAEs Cop28 president Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber banged the gavel to signal agreement, delegates from around the world rose to their feet, clapping and hugging each other. But there was dissent from a number of countries, including the small island nations who condemned the final text as a litany of loopholes. In a day of drama, delegates agreed to commit to: Tripling renewable energy capacity worldwide by 2030 Phasing down coal usage and limiting the number of new and unabated coal power stations Transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner to achieve net zero by 2050 Substantially reducing non-CO2 emissions, in particular methane, by 2030 Describing the deal as the UAE Consensus, the Cop president said it was a plan led by the science with commitments to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. We have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement for the first time ever, added Mr Jaber, who is chief executive of the UAEs state oil company. The UN welcomed the move, with its climate secretary Simon Stiell saying Cop28 had needed to send a signal on humanitys core climate problem: fossil fuels and their planet-burning pollution. Whilst we didnt turn the page on the fossil fuel era in Dubai, this outcome is the beginning of the end, he said. The price of crude oil took a dip soon after the announcement was made. The final text was a strengthening of language after an initial draft of the deal had removed any reference to phasing out fossil fuels, with the US and China claiming it was due to their intervention that negotiations got moving again. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres had a stark message for those who blocked the inclusion of a call to phase out fossil fuels, with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Russia, and members of the Opec group of oil-rich nations among those named publicly for opposing this language. Whether you like it or not, fossil fuel phase-out is inevitable. Lets hope it doesnt come too late, he said. Despite the historic shift on fossil fuels, there were many left deeply disappointed by the agreement. More than 100 countries, including the coalition of small islands and others facing extreme impacts, had called specifically for the phase-out or phase-down of fossil fuels to be included. Anne Rasmussen, representative for Samoa speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said they were confused about what just happened and that they were not in the room when the text was adopted. This process has failed us, she said, describing the document as a litany of loopholes. Her remarks were met with cheering and a longer standing ovation than the original fossil-fuel announcement. Mr Jaber, who did not rise to clap, said that the AOSIS statement would be added to the record. Delegates largely acknowledged that the Dubai agreement  which required consensus of all countries, from the greenest to the oil-rich powers  was a step forward but that much more needed to be done to support and protect the most vulnerable. It had been an exhausting and emotional marathon slog to reach this point after the summit ran nearly 18 hours past its official end time. On Monday, a previous draft had provoked fury over its significantly weaker language. John Kerry, the US special climate envoy, said developing countries needed to be supported every step of the way to build their clean energy systems. UK climate minister Graham Stuart, back at Cop28 after a brief 7,000-mile round trip to London on Tuesday to back prime minister Rishi Sunaks Rwanda deportation bill, called for keeping 1.5C as the North Star. He heralded the loss and damage fund, set up on the first day of the conference, as long overdue. But he said there was disappointment that more had not been done on coal in the Dubai text, an issue that the UK has championed at Cop28. There are elements here we do not like, he said. Germanys climate minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking on behalf of the European Union, acknowledged the small islands, pointing to Samoa and the Marshall Islands, and said that the bloc had decided on a phase-out of fossil fuels to meet the 1.5C goal. We feel you, we see you, Germanys representative said. We know for your children that this agreement might not be enough. We are walking the path of climate justice together.

        "date": "December 14, 2023 10:12 am",
        "content": "The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) says that a revision in bus fares is possible in January, owing to the increase of Value Added Tax (VAT). President of the association Gemunu Wijeratne stated that measures will be taken to discuss the matter with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the coming days. When importing buses from January, an average bus will cost around Rs. 15,700,000. With the increase in VAT to 18, the cost of importing a bus will increase by at least another Rs. 2 million. The bus owners are not able to buy a bus at that rate and transport the public, Wijeratne stressed. Further, he said that along with that, the prices of spare parts, fuel and service charges will also increase. The most serious issue is the increase in fuel prices. VAT has been imposed on fuel too. Then surely the price of diesel will increase. If all these prices increase, there is a possibility for bus fares to increase once again too. I hope to discuss this matter with the President and Finance Ministry officials soon, he added.",

Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, the Ambassador noted that the step was a crucial step for Sri Lanka, which emphasises the continued importance of sustained reforms and improved governance, not only for the progress of the country, but also to safeguard those who are most vulnerable. The United States will continue to support Sri Lankas path to economic stability and prosperity, Ambassador Chung assured. On 12 December, the IMF completed the first review under the 48-month EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka, which paved the way for an immediate disbursement of the much-anticipated second tranche of the IMF loan which amounts to SDR 254 million (approximately USD 337 million). This will bring the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far to SDR 508 million (approximately USD 670 million). The total amount of Sri Lankas EFF Arrangement is SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion) as of the time of program approval on March 20, 2023.",

        "date": "December 14, 2023 11:31 am",
        "content": "The director of the Miss Universe franchise in Nicaragua said she is retiring from her role with the beauty contest after she was charged alongside her husband and son with conspiracy against the government. Last month, Karen Celebertti oversaw the Central American nations first victory in the pageant, when Nicaraguan Sheynnis Palacios was crowned Miss Universe in El Salvador. Palacios coronation caused a political stir after videos were leaked of the beauty queen participating in anti-government marches in 2018 when she was 17, prompting the government to accuse the opposition of using her victory to plan new protests. The government has banned protests, with a violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in 2018 leaving more than 320 dead, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Celebertti was banned from entering Nicaragua over accusations of conspiracy, with authorities saying she, her husband and her son played a role in organizing the anti-government protests. Her current wherabouts could not be immediately established. The time has come for me to retire, Celebertti said on Monday evening in an Instagram post, ending a 23-year stint as the countrys beauty contest head. The businesswoman did not explain the reasons for her retirement but defended her family. My husband and I come from hardworking, honest families... we have raised our children to be good, educated and responsible human beings. She also defended the beauty queens victory, saying that a crown should be respected as an achievement of all. Palacios has not returned to Nicaragua since her victory. Nicaraguan police said earlier this month that the national Miss Universe organization had been used to turn pageants into political traps and political ambushes, financed by foreign agents. The Miss Universe organization said in a statement posted to social media that it was seeking a peaceful resolution of the issues raised by the country of Nicaragua, as well as the safety of everyone associated with the organization.

        "date": "December 14, 2023 02:12 pm",
        "content": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is reportedly planning to establish a university in Austin, Texas, as revealed in tax filings for one of his charities, reported by Bloomberg News and The Texas Tribune. Musk, in recent years, moved from California to Austin, Texas, blaming Californias ultra left political leanings and policies. The charity in question, named The Foundation, will also use a 100 million donation from Musk to the charity, and establish a primary and secondary school in Austin, with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. According to the tax filing, once the school becomes fully operational, it will shift its focus towards developing a university. The institution aims to seek accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, marking a crucial step in its establishment. The university, as outlined in the filing, plans to employ both in-person teaching and distance education technologies. Initial enrollment is expected to include 50 students, with plans to scale up over time. The school intends to finance its operations through a combination of donations and tuition fees. Additionally, the filing specifies that the institution may offer financial aid to students unable to afford tuition or fees. The university is currently in the process of hiring an executive director, teachers, and administrators. Elon Musks proposal for a new university in Austin, where the University of Texas at Austin and other private universities already exist, coincides with the impending opening of another private school in the city, the University of Austin. Launched two years ago, the University of Austin aims to be a proponent of free speech and open inquiry on college campuses, according to its president, Pano Kanelos. Its worth noting that Elon Musks university project does not yet have an official name. The Foundations trustees, according to Bloomberg, include Jared Birchall (head of Musks family office), Steven Chidester (a tax attorney at Withersworldwide), and Ronald Gong and Teresa Holland (associated with Catalyst Family Office in California).
