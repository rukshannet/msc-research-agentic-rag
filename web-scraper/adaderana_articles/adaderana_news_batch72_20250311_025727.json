Accordingly, cases have been filed with the Kaduwela Magistrates Court against the owners of 14 street food stalls in question. The Medical Officer of Health (MOH) in Maharagama, Dr. Kosala Muthukumarana said that a total of 55 street food stalls were inspected during the operation, including all 35 food stalls established at Kimbulawala, Thalawathugoda. There, the PHIs have found that due to the open display of the food items including meat and fish dishes for sale, the food items had been contaminated as a result of the direct impact of dust and smoke emitted from the vehicles. In addition, keeping cooked food together with raw food, roasting meat on rusty iron trays, using days-old oil to fry meat have made the food items unfit for human consumption. Apart from that, the food stall owners have also been warned over not using hand gloves, face masks, and hair covers or aprons while preparing the food. Concerns were also raised regarding the waste water discharge and the garbage bins being left opened. Meanwhile, Public Health Inspectors have taken steps to destroy 12 kilograms of chicken and also some flavouring agents which were found to be unhealthy for consumption in Kottawa area during the inspections.",

        "content": "In a bid to address the pressing challenges posed by climate change and the need for robust institutional frameworks, President Ranil Wickremesinghe officially launched the International Climate Change University (ICCU) today (03), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The President emphasized the necessity of institutional changes following the Paris Climate Agreement and highlighted the absence of alternative bodies to effectively tackle the on-going climate crisis. President Wickremesinghe underlined that, despite the global commitment to the Paris Agreement, no significant institutional changes were implemented to assist the world in achieving the agreed-upon targets. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the ICCU aims to fill this void by developing postgraduate-level capacity building, serving as a crucial support system for climate sciences. The campus for the ICCU is set to be established on initially allocated 600 acres of land in Sri Lanka. However, President Wickremesinghe clarified that the university will not be confined to Sri Lanka; it will be an international stakeholder university, welcoming collaboration and contributions from around the world. Highlighting the global nature of climate responsibility, President Wickremesinghe announced that Bangladesh, Seychelles and Moldova have already pledged their support to the ICCU. He emphasized that climate action is not the sole responsibility of any single nation and called upon the international community to join hands in this endeavour. President Wickremesinghe concluded by urging nations and individuals worldwide to recognize the shared responsibility for climate issues and actively participate in the International Climate Change University. The launch of the ICCU marks a significant step towards fostering international collaboration, knowledge exchange and building a collective response to the urgent and complex challenges posed by climate change. --PMD--",

        "content": "Sri Lankan spin-bowling legend Muttiah Muralitharan said the teams performance in the 2023 mens ODI World Cup was very disappointing, and something which he wasnt expecting to unfold the way it did. In the tournament, Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions, won just two matches while losing seven games to end their campaign in India at ninth place. They also missed out on qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy as they finished outside of the top eight teams in the points table. As far as the Sri Lanka team are concerned, they have the talent, but the thing is they are lacking in commitment and discipline a little bit. If they put in the hard yards and effort, they can definitely be a formidable side. They showed some glimpses of it, winning the 2022 Asia Cup, and are capable of beating India, Pakistan and other good sides. But in this years World Cup, it was very disappointing and a very below par performance, I didnt expect that, said Muralitharan in a conversation with IANS on the sidelines of the OTT launch of his biopic 800 on JioCinema, on Saturday. Twenty-four hours after their World Cup campaign ended, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Sri Lanka Crickets membership due to government interference in administration, though they can still play international matches. So many problems are happening back home. This cricket board and the country have helped me come to this position. I would say, its a mess at the moment and somebody has to come in to set things right, Muralitharan added. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "content": "At least eight people including soldiers were killed in northern Pakistan when terrorists attacked a passenger bus near the countrys border with China. At least eight people including two soldiers are killed in the attack, Ghulam Abbas, a spokesperson for Gilgit-Baltistan Police said late on Saturday. The bus was travelling on the Karakoram Highway, one of the highest roads in the world, which connects Islamabad with Beijing. The attack, according to officials, took place around 6:30pm local time when terrorists opened fire at the bus and it subsequently collided with an oncoming truck. Another 26 passengers of the bus were wounded in the attack and some had bullet injuries, Abbas said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. The government will ensure that the terrorists involved in the attack are given the appropriate punishment, Chief Minister Gilgit-Baltistan Haji Gulbar Khan said in a statement. The latest attack comes amid an uptick in terrorist attacks in the country, particularly in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southwestern province of Balochistan. Both provinces border Afghanistan. Last month, a Pakistani air force base came under attack in central Punjab province that the military said was repulsed successfully. Around two dozen soldiers and civilians were killed in November. Violence against security forces and civilians has surged in Pakistan since the takeover of the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan. Islamabad blames Islamist militants hiding in Afghan border regions for deadly bombings and shootings in Pakistan. Kabul rejects the charges. Source: DPA --Agencies",

        "content": "Walmart said on Friday it is not advertising on social media platform X, one of the latest brands to say it has dropped the Elon Musk-owned site. We arent advertising on X as weve found other platforms to better reach our customers, a Walmart spokesperson said. X, formerly known as Twitter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The platform has struggled to retain advertisers since Musk acquired the company in October 2022, and faced a fresh exodus in recent weeks over rising concern about antisemitic content. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with an X user who falsely claimed members of the Jewish community were stoking hatred against white people, saying the user was speaking the actual truth. The user had also referenced the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which purports that Jewish people and leftists are engineering the ethnic and cultural replacement of white populations with non-white immigrants that will lead to a white genocide. Musk apologized for his post during an interview at a New York Times DealBook event on Wednesday, but hurled expletives against advertisers that suspended their ads, accusing them of blackmail. An executive at a major ad-buying agency, who declined to be named, said X ad sales representatives appeared frustrated in the aftermath of Musks outburst against brands and did not have much to say in conversations. Major brands including Apple, Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery also suspended their ads on X this month following a report from liberal watchdog group Media Matters, which said ads had appeared next to antisemitic posts.

        "date": "December 3, 2023 06:51 pm",
        "content": "Indias Hindu nationalist party was headed for a clear win in three out of four states Sunday, according to the election commissions website. The crucial poll has pitted Indias opposition against the ruling party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of next years vital national vote. Ballot counting showed Modis Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, was poised to wrest control of the states of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan from the Indian National Congress, Indias main opposition party. The BJP was also likely to be re-elected in Madhya Pradesh in for a record fifth term. The Congress was comfortably leading in Telangana state which is ruled by the strong Telangana Rashtra Samithi, known for opposing BJP in the state. Final results are expected later Sunday. Vote counting in a fifth state, Mizoram, is set for Monday where BJPs regional ally, Mizo National Front, is in power. Elections in the five states were held last month where more than 160 million people, or a sixth of Indias electorate were eligible to vote in the polls. Polling in India is generally done in phases owing to the large population. Modi thanked voters for their unwavering support in the states his party was leading. The results in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan indicate that the people of India are firmly with politics of good governance and development, which the BJP4India stands for, Modi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, conceded defeat in the three states where his party was trailing behind the BJP. The battle of ideology will continue, he wrote on X, formally known as Twitter, and thanked the people of Telangana where his party was winning. Modi and his party remain popular on a national level after nearly a decade in power and surveys suggest he is expected to win a third consecutive term in 2024. But a new alliance of 28 opposition parties, called INDIA, is expected to challenge Modis party nationally. The acronym, which stands for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprises Indias previously fractured opposition parties and is led by the Congress party. Both the Indian premier and the Congress leader Gandhi flew across the five states to woo voters as they campaigned to support their parties candidates. The charged-up voting campaigns witnessed both leaders promising voters subsidies, loan waivers and employment guarantees. Modi will seek reelection next year at a time when Indias global diplomatic reach is rising. But in recent polls, Congress has dented his partys image of invincibility by toppling local BJP governments in state elections in southern Karnataka and northern Himachal Pradesh. The elections come at a time when India is facing multiple challenges; rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against the countrys minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.

        "date": "December 3, 2023 08:04 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman has welcomed the decision of the Madras High Court, which he says brings to light the longstanding injustices faced by the Indian Origin Tamil (IOT) community of Sri Lanka. The Indian government is yet to fulfil its treaty obligations on agreements entered into with the Sri Lankan government to repatriate not less than 600,000 Indian-origin Tamils (IOTs) in Sri Lanka and grant them citizenship, observed Indias Madras high court on Thursday (Nov. 30) while granting relief to a repatriate from Sri Lanka by directing the Central Government of India to treat him and his family members as Indian citizens. Taking into X (formerly Twitter) to welcome this, Thondaman said the Sirima-Shashthri pacts forced repatriation of our people, who had enriched Sri Lanka for over 150 years at the time, remains a stark reminder of the historical injustices imposed on my community that continue to resonate. Our community, torn from their homeland, denied Sri Lankan citizenship for nearly 50 years, and left in limbo without Indian citizenship, has endured decades of statelessness, he added. Meanwhile, the minister also mentioned that although citizenship issues were finally resolved in Sri Lanka in 2009, this has profoundly affected their access to basic rights, identity, and dignity. Today, our Government is working on healing the deep scars left by these injustices, Thondaman said, adding that President Ranil Wickremesinghes committee on Integration of the Plantation Community seeks to find and implement practical solutions to fully integrate the IOT plantation community to Sri Lankan society. He also highlighted that the Presidents recent announcement to provide every estate worker family 10 perches of land, will finally give them ownership over the land they have lived and toiled in for 200 years. But this is not enough. Every IOT forcibly taken away, must also have the right to return back to Sri Lanka. This is not just a demand; its a call to rectify historical wrongs, he said. Both Sri Lanka and India must take responsibility for restoring the rights and dignity of every individual affected. The long-term impact of statelessness on the IOTs is a collective failure of both countries. The minister said he is committed to work with all partners including neighbours India, to ensure justice and a rightful place for the IOT community in our shared history.",

Two police officers were injured responding to the home, where a fire also broke out, and the suspect is dead. An 11-year-old girl, 12-year-old boy, 44-year-old woman and man in his 30s were killed, and all are believed to be family members, police said. Police received a 911 call shortly after 5 a.m. from a young female caller, who said her cousin was killing her family members, New York City Police Department Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said at a Sunday morning news conference. The officers responded to a residential block in Queens, where they pulled into a driveway and saw a man walking out with luggage, according to Maddrey. The man drew a kitchen steak knife on the officers, stabbing one in the neck and chest, and striking the other in the head, the chief added. One of the officers drew his weapon and fired, killing the suspect, Maddrey said. Maddrey commended the officers, a 28-year veteran a 16-year veteran. They could have easily let this person walk past them with his luggage. Instead, they stopped, asked a couple of questions, tried to get some intel before they walked right up in there, he said. Unfortunately, they were met with the perpetrator in this incident. He went right at them. The officers were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and are expected to recover, police said. An 11-year-old girl found in front of the house died from her injuries, police said. A fire in the living room and foyer area left police unable to enter the home initially, but fire officials were quickly able to put out the fire. The suspect likely lit a couch on fire on his way out of the home, police said. After putting out the fire, officials found three people dead inside the home: a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s. Police believe all four died of stab wounds, Maddrey said. A 61-year-old female is at Mt. Sinai Hospital in critical condition, according to Joseph Kenny, NYPD Chief of Detectives. The stabbing suspect has been identified as a 38-year-old Bronx resident, Kenny said during the news conference. He has one prior arrest for a strangulation domestic violence incident in the Bronx, Kenny said. Kenny said the incident seems to be family related, though police are still investigating. The 911 caller is being interviewed, police said. Far Rockaway is a long inlet along the shore of Long Island, in the southernmost part of Queens in New York. Source  CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "December 4, 2023 10:32 am",
        "content": "SriLankan Airlines has introduced double daily flights between Colombo and Mumbai, multiplying the convenience for passengers travelling to and from Indias financial and entertainment capital, the Sri Lankas national carrier announced. In a statement, SriLankan Airlines said the new double daily service to Mumbai will not only give a 50 per cent boost to SriLankans capacity on its Mumbai route, but will also strengthen the airlines already vast network in India. Flights UL 142 and UL 144 will depart daily from Mumbai to Colombo at 3:10hrs and 20:45hrs and flights UL 141 and UL 143 from Colombo to Mumbai will depart at 23:45hrs and 17:10hrs, respectively, according to SriLankan Airlines. Thus, passengers travelling out of Mumbai on SriLankan Airlines will now have the advantage of more flight options to Colombo and convenient connections via Colombo to popular destinations in the Far East, Europe and Australia including Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Melbourne and Sydney. Meanwhile, the Head of Worldwide Sales and Distribution of SriLankan Airlines Dimuthu Tennakoon stated: The Indian market has been incredibly important to SriLankan Airlines since the get-go, and with India fast becoming one of the worlds largest outbound travel markets, we are only happy to expand our operations in one of Indias most celebrated cities and make travel between Mumbai and Colombo extra seamless. Our frequency increase comes on the heels of Sri Lanka announcing free visa for Indian visitors and we hope that these positive developments will encourage more travellers from Mumbai to stop by Sri Lanka. India is the only country with nine cities featured in SriLankan Airlines network. This includes Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kochi, Trivandrum, Chennai, Trichy and Madurai in addition to Mumbai, to which altogether SriLankan operates close to 100 flights every week. Given the geographic and cultural proximity of the two countries, most Indians are likely to find a welcoming familiarity in Sri Lanka not found elsewhere, and SriLankan Airlines is the best bet for Indians who want to experience the best of both worlds onboard, it added.

        "date": "December 4, 2023 11:23 am",
        "content": "At least 47 people have been killed and 85 others injured in landslides caused by flooding in northern Tanzania, says a local official, with warnings the toll could rise. Heavy rain on Saturday hit the town of Katesh, some 300km (186 miles) north of the capital Dodoma, district commissioner Janeth Mayanja said. Up to this Sunday evening, the death toll reached 47 and 85 injured, Queen Sendiga, regional commissioner in the Manyara area of northern Tanzania, told local media. Both warned the death toll was likely to increase. Mayanja added that many roads in the area had been blocked by mud, water and dislodged trees and stones. Tanzanias President Samia Suluhu Hassan, in Dubai for the COP28 climate conference, sent her condolences and said she ordered the deployment of more government efforts to rescue people. We are very shocked by this event, she said in a video message posted online by the Tanzanian Ministry of Health. Vulnerable region After experiencing an unprecedented drought, East Africa has been hit for weeks by torrential rain and flooding linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon. El Nino is a naturally occurring weather pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean and drives increased heat worldwide, bringing drought to some areas and heavy rains elsewhere. The downpours have displaced more than a million people in Somalia and left hundreds dead. In May, torrential rains caused devastating floods and landslides in Rwanda that killed at least 130 people. The Horn of Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with extreme weather events growing increasingly common and intense. Since late 2020, Somalia as well as parts of Ethiopia and Kenya have been suffering the regions worst drought in 40 years. In 2019, at least 265 people died and tens of thousands were displaced during two months of relentless rainfall in several countries in East Africa. The impact of El Nino, a weather pattern that contributes to rising global temperatures, can be exacerbated by climate change, scientists say. In response, African leaders are pushing for new global taxes and changes to international financial institutions to help fund climate change action. The launch of a loss and damage fund at the COP28 summit in Dubai earlier this week was hailed as a historic as it will see the biggest historical polluters pay for the damages sustained by countries that have been hit the hardest by the climate crisis, while also being the least responsible for it. But details of the fund have not been fleshed out, and while 118 countries have pledged to boost clean energy at the summit, the world continues to fall far short of the Paris Agreements target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F). Scientists expect the worst effects of the current El Nino will be felt at the end of 2023 and into next year. Source: Al Jazeera --Agencies",

        "content": "When Lasith Malinga was on song, his toe-crushing yorkers terrifying opposition batters in white-ball cricket for a decade-and-a-half, Sri Lanka did not have to worry much. Three years after retirement, Malinga is on song again, but on a different pitch. The former speedster has penned some songs and he looks to rock with his deliveries this time too. Mastering the Yorker has been a great journey of following my passion. Now, I am again restless with my newest passion. What do you think about the Songwriter Lasith Malinga? Malinga wrote a few days back on a professional networking site. Life, an album featuring 14 songs, is one creation of Malinga, the only other player alongside Arjuna Ranatunga to lead Sri Lanka to World Cup glory (T20 World Cup title in 2014). That apart, he has also written two other songs, Yakka Gennala (To the giants looking from the outside) and Palamuwarata (For the first time). The songs though will not just be confined in the Sinhalese industry. Dura Dakke Na (Far away), one of the songs of Life, will be having its Hindi version soon with voice likely to be lent by a Sri Lankan artist. Ive already started working on the Hindi version. One of the most talented Sri Lankan singers has decided to sing that. Once that is released, Im sure all the fans in Sri Lanka and India would love it, Malinga told The Telegraph. The idea to write songs struck him quite recently while working on his book (name yet to be finalised) about his experiences in fast bowling. I didnt have an idea to be a songwriter, Malinga stated. I was writing a book about my experiences and techniques a fast bowler should learn about. I was working on the book and everything that came to mind. It then clicked to me that those are the things people would generally experience, and some experiences are related to life. So, I just gave it a shot... to write these as songs. His songs will mostly be about ordinary people and their life experiences. Whenever I find some free time, I will be writing whatever comes to my mind. They will be based on life experiences. With that, people will find it lovely when those stories coming out of my songs are closer to their lives, Malinga said. Cricket or songwriting, which ones tougher? Cricket is harder, no debate on it, Malinga, currently the fast bowling coach of Mumbai Indians, replied. With the opposition changing, you need to adapt technically, tactically and read and understand situations. A person who has played cricket would know how hard the game is and how hard it is to remain at the top for a long time. Source: The Telegraph --Agencies",

        "content": "India has agreed to withdraw its troops from the Maldives, the president of the strategically located archipelago has said, meeting a promise he made ahead of recent elections. President Mohamed Muizzu was elected in September as a proxy for a pro-China predecessor jailed on corruption charges, but has said his intention is not to upend the regional balance by replacing Indian forces with Chinese troops. After a series of constructive meetings and dialogues with the Indian government, an agreement has been reached to withdraw Indian military personnel, a statement from the presidents office said late Sunday. Indian personnel are deployed to operate three gifted aircraft patrolling the maritime territory. Primarily known as one of the most expensive holiday destinations in South Asia, with pristine white beaches and secluded resorts, the Maldives has also become a geopolitical hotspot. Global east-west shipping lanes pass the nations chain of 1,192 tiny coral islands, stretching around 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator. Muizzus office said the agreement for the withdrawal of troops was in progress at a technical level. It stressed its commitment to employing diplomatic channels as the primary instrument to ensure the absence of foreign military presence on its soil. It did not give any timeframe for the withdrawal, and there was no immediate response from New Delhi on Monday. It followed a meeting between Muizzu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of COP28 in Dubai. Both the leaders... agreed to establish a high-level committee... tasked with coordinating efforts to address the challenges associated with ongoing development projects in the Maldives, the Maldives added.

        "content": "The chairperson of the Parliamentary Caucus for Persons with Disabilities, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said in a press conference that as justice has not been served for the disabled community in Sri Lanka so far, they will stand for them regardless of party politics. This press conference was organized in Colombo recently, in line with the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which falls on December 03, and the press conference was attended by Members of Parliament, Disabled Organizations Joint Front, Commissioner General of Elections, Election Monitoring Organizations and Civil Organizations, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. According to the request made by several parties including the Disability Organizations Joint Front, the members of all parties of the Parliament established this caucus last September irrespective of political differences, the Chairman said. He also assured that the caucus will stand up for the rights of the disabled people inside and outside the Parliament. Alahapperuma further said that since there is a proposal to buy 600 buses in this years budget, it will be proposed in Parliament on the 4th December to buy a few buses for the disabled as a pilot project. The chairman also expressed his gratitude to the National Democratic Institute (NDI) for bringing this proposal. The chairman of the caucus pointed out that although Sri Lanka signed the United Nations Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, we are far behind compared to developed countries. Thus, Dullas Alahapperuma said that it is the intention of his caucus to create coordination between the disabled community and policy makers by appearing collectively in policy making. He also pointed out that since the needs of the disabled community are linked with various government institutions, departments, etc., the aim of this new caucus is to stand for them and become their voice by coordinating all together. Speaking at the event, Commissioner General of Elections Saman Ratnayake, said that in the next national election, steps will be taken to provide a special Tactile ballot paper to each polling station for the visually impaired community. He said that the piolet project with regard to this was successful in 10 polling stations in Nuwara Eliya district. He said that special attention will be given to the needs of the hearing-impaired community and the accessibility of the disabled community in the polling stations. Mr. Ratnayake also said that steps will be taken to provide an ID card to the disabled community. Mrs. Rasanjali Pathirage, President of Disability Organizations Joint Front (DOJF), who spoke at the event, said that 8.7 of the countrys population, nearly 1,600,000 people belong to the disabled community. She also said that it was a great achievement to establish a parliamentary caucus on behalf of their voices on September 6. She also pointed out that people with disabilities in this country do not have access to public transport including buses and trains, as there are no facilities in many public places in this country. She also drew attention to the fact that people with disabilities are being badly abused and the obstacles to education. Therefore, she emphasized the need to draft a new law that legally enforces the rights of people with disabilities and pointed out that people with disabilities should also be represented in politics. She also said that the chairman of the caucus Dullas Alahapperuma is highly commendable for his contribution to the disabled community as a very sensitive leader. The medias responsibility to create a good society that respects the rights of people with disabilities was also emphasized here. Also, Brian Kingston, a visually impaired student who has passed the G.C.E Ordinary Level examination with flying colours and currently studying advanced in biology stream at Ananda College, Colombo, addressed the press conference and expressed issues related to his community. Member of Parliament Premnath Dolawatta, who participated in this event, presented his visiting card prepared with Braille facility to the chairman of the caucus and student Brian Kingston.

The complaint has been filed over the alleged misuse of funds provided by SLC to the National Sports Fund for the development of various other sports in Sri Lanka, the SLC said in a statement. The SLC said the decision to file this complaint stems from the concern that MP Roshan Ranasinghe has not appropriately disclosed the utilization of funds allocated by SLC for the intended purposes. This move comes in the wake of a discernible disparity between the information disclosed to the media by Mr. Ranasinghe and the response received by SLC under a Right to Information (RTI) application, outlining the specifics of the expenditures made, SLC further claimed. SLC wishes to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of financial transactions and ensuring that funds are utilized for their designated purposes and the said formal complaint filed with the Bribery Commission underscores SLCs dedication to upholding the highest standards of governance and ethics within the realm of sports administration. SLC says it trusts that the Bribery Commission will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter to ascertain the facts and take appropriate action as necessary and that Sri Lanka Cricket will continue to collaborate with relevant authorities to ensure a fair and just resolution to this issue, as part of its ongoing commitment to the promotion and advancement of sports in Sri Lanka.",

Additional Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, revealed this to the court when the writ petition filed by Mr. Shani Abeysekera, requesting the court to issue a directive to the respondents including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to provide adequate protection for him due to threats to his life, was taken up for consideration today (04). The writ was called before a judge bench comprising President of the Appeal Court, Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi. The court had previously issued an order to the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses to submit a report on the nature of the threats against Mr. Abeysekera. When the petition was called before the court today, Additional Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya stated before the court that the Intelligence Division of the authority has sent a report detailing the nature of the threats against the petitioner. Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya, who appeared for the petitioner Shani Abeysekara, presented facts before the court and said that they cannot be satisfied at all with the protection presently given to his client.

        "date": "December 4, 2023 10:42 pm",
        "content": "Disclosing the proposed new educational reforms, the Ministry of Education stated that it is intended to reduce the number of school grades from 13 to 12. This was disclosed at the time of presenting the progress of the year 2023 and plans for the year 2024 for the budget of the Ministry of Education by (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, for the Ministers and Members of Parliament. Accordingly, the educational authorities stated that through the proposed new education reforms, every child will be given the opportunity to finish school in 17 years. Accordingly, pre-school education is classified as 4 years old, primary section 1-5, junior section 6-8 and senior section 9 to 12. While it has been proposed to give a certain percentage of marks from school-based evaluations and a certain percentage from exams for the grade 5 scholarship exam, the Ministry of Education has also proposed to simplify the grade 5 scholarship exam and eliminate competition, the statement said. Furthermore, through the proposed new education reforms, the Ministry of Education has proposed to conduct the general level examination in grade 10 and the advanced level examination is scheduled for grade 12. It has also been decided to reduce the number of subjects for OLs from 9 to 7. Officials representing the Ministry of Education stated that among those 7 subjects, it has been proposed to make it mandatory to study three new subjects; Information and Communication Technology (ICT), technical and professional skills and religious and values. The officials of the Ministry of Education, who pointed out that more than eighty thousand (80,000) students fail in the ordinary level examination in a year, have suggested that no child will fail through the new education reforms and that all children who passed the ordinary level examination should be given the opportunity to study vocational training courses. For that, A-level subjects have been classified into two categories as academic education and vocational education and a path has been prepared for every child to obtain a degree. The Ministry of Education also pointed out that two new subjects have been added under academic studies by increasing the current subjects from 6 to 8. Furthermore, the officials of the Ministry stated that the children will receive the opportunity to obtain education through 10 subject areas under practical studies and through that, the children will get the opportunity to obtain degrees by going through vocational fields. The Ministry pointed out that administrative restructuring is also taking place in the education service. The number of existing educational zones will increase from 100 to 122 and the total number of ten thousand one hundred and twenty-six (10,126) schools will be classified as cluster schools of one thousand two hundred and twenty (1220). All the existing national schools will be a flagship school in a cluster of schools as flagship schools at the provincial level. Officials of the Ministry said that 517.05 billion rupees have been allocated for the Ministry of Education in this years budget for the year 2024. Of this, two thousand million rupees have been allocated for providing school textbooks, six million rupees for school uniforms, and two thousand five hundred million rupees for providing school shoes to seven hundred twenty-eight thousand four hundred and eighty (728,480) children. About 1.07 million school children are currently being given lunch and the same number is ready to be given to 1.5 million children in the year 2024, the Ministry of Education officials said.

        "title": "UK unveils tougher visa rules in a bid to cut migration",
        "date": "December 5, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "The UK government has introduced measures it promised would deliver the biggest-ever cut in net migration after levels soared to a record high. Home Secretary James Cleverly announced a five-point plan to curb immigration, which he said was far too high. The changes included hiking the minimum salary needed for skilled overseas workers from 26,200 to 38,700. Mr Cleverly claimed 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK last year would not be able to in future. The minimum income for family visas has also risen to 38,700. In a statement to MPs, the home secretary said migration to the UK needs to come down and there had been abuse of health and care visas for years. Enough is enough, Mr Cleverly said. Immigration policy must be fair, legal, and sustainable. The migration plan comes after official figures last month showed net migration had soared to a record 745,000 in 2022. Conservative MPs have since piled pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government to bring down net migration, which is the difference between those entering and leaving the UK. The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since winning power in 2010, and take back control of the UKs borders since the Brexit vote. The partys 2019 election manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000 when he was prime minister. Immigration is shaping up to be a key issue ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024. With Labour leading in opinion polls, Mr Sunak has vowed to do what is necessary to bring down net migration. On top of the new salary requirements, the government said it would:  Ban health and care workers bringing family dependants to the UK  End companies being able to pay workers 20 less than the going rate for jobs on a shortage occupation list  Increase the annual charge foreign workers pay to use the NHS from 624 to 1,035  Raise the minimum income for family visas to 38,700, from 18,600 from next spring  Ask the governments migration adviser to review the graduate visa route to prevent abuse The home secretary told MPs the changes would take effect in the spring next year. In total, this package, plus our reduction in students dependants, will mean around 300,000 fewer people will come in future years than have come to the UK last year, Mr Cleverly told MPs. The figure of 300,000 is an estimate, based on internal Home Office calculations. The Home Office believes the previously announced ban on most overseas students bringing dependents with them will account for almost half of the overall reduction. Labours shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mondays announcement was an admission of years of Tory failure on both the immigration system and the economy. She said while net migration should come down, the Conservatives were failing to introduce more substantial reforms that link immigration to training and fair pay requirements in the UK, meaning many sectors will continue to see rising numbers of work visas because of skills shortages. Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said the cruel plans spell total disaster for the NHS and social care. Migrant workers were encouraged to come here because both sectors are critically short of staff. Hospitals and care homes simply couldnt function without them, she said. The plans were welcomed by some Conservative MPs, with former cabinet minister Simon Clarke calling the changes serious and credible steps. But Mr Cleverlys predecessor as home secretary, Suella Braverman, was less impressed. She said the package was too late and the government can go further on salary requirements and shortening the graduate route. Mrs Braverman claimed she had put forward similar proposals six times when she was home secretary but the delay has reduced their impact. She has lambasted the governments record on immigration since she was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak last month. The latest statistics show the challenge ministers will face in reducing migration into the health sector, which has come to rely heavily on hiring workers from abroad. The government said in the year ending September 2023, 101,000 visas were issued to care workers. An estimated 120,000 visas were granted to the family dependants of those care workers, the government said. The care sector is facing staffing shortages and providers have resisted curbs on their ability to hire foreign workers. The governments migration advisers have previously said persistent underfunding of local councils, which funds most adult social care, is the most important factor in the staffing crisis. Mr Cleverly acknowledged some care workers might be deterred from coming to the UK because they would not be able to bring families under the new rules. But he said he believed there would still be care workers who would be willing to work in the UK. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said the decision to raise the family income threshold to 38,700 was the biggest surprise of the day. The governments changes to the minimum income for family visas mean that people may be blocked from bringing their relatives to stay in the UK under certain circumstances. Family migration makes up a small share of the total, but those who are affected by it can be affected very significantly, Dr Sumption said. The largest impacts will fall on lower-income British citizens, and particularly women and younger people who tend to earn lower wages. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The Head of State attended the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which is being held from November 30 until December 12. According to Ada Derana correspondent, President Wickremesinghe and the delegation had returned on board Emirates flights at around 9:55 p.m. yesterday (Dec.04). The Sri Lankan leader, accompanied by 3 ministers, 2 opposition MPs and 20 young participants passionate about environmental concerns, took part in this pivotal conference in Dubai. The primary objective of the Sri Lankan delegation was to harness support and collaboration from countries in the Tropical Belt to influence policy-making decisions on a global scale. The 28th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC convened world leaders, public-private representatives, environmentalists, and scholars to tackle pressing climate change issues and address critical decisions. President Wickremesinghe envisioned 3 key focal points at the event: the launch of the Climate Justice Forum, the Tropical Belt Initiative and the establishment of a Climate Change University. The concept behind the Climate Justice Forum aims to address the pressing issue of climate change and exert influence, particularly on the Global North. It was launched on Saturday (Dec.02). The Tropical Belt Initiative was also inaugurated on Saturday, focused on harnessing commercial investments in vital natural resources within the tropical belt, such as forests, swamps, and mangroves. Meanwhile, the International Climate Change University (ICCU) was inaugurated on Sunday (Dec.03) by the Sri Lankan president, in consideration of the need for robust institutional frameworks to address the gaps in global climate action.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to introduce new legislative framework to regulate microfinance institutions",
        "date": "December 5, 2023 10:02 am",
        "content": "The Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs  Constitutional Reforms, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has unveiled plans to introduce a new legislative framework aimed at regulating microfinance institutions operating within the country. Expressing deep concern regarding the unregulated status of certain microfinance entities, the lawmaker emphasized the necessity for decisive measures. He underscored the intention to establish an independent regulatory institution, distinct from the Central Bank, dedicated to the oversight and effective regulation of microfinance entities. Minister Rajapakshe made these remarks on Monday (Dec.04) during a press briefing at the Presidents Media Centre (PMC), themed Collective path to a stable Country. Rajapakshe further commented that the Justice Ministry presently oversees the operational responsibilities of 21 institutions, encompassing a diverse range of subjects, including law enforcement and law reform. With a caseload exceeding 1.1 million in the courts across the country, concerted efforts have been undertaken in recent times to mitigate delays in case adjudication. He added that substantial measures have been implemented to address the backlog and streamline the judicial process, with a particular focus on the establishment and operation of conciliation boards aimed at facilitating the expeditious resolution of select cases. The minister further stated that globally recognized expedited methods for resolving criminal cases stand in contrast to our nations outdate legal framework, resulting in prolonged durations for case resolutions. He said the delay in criminal proceedings represents a substantial issue, jeopardizing the administration of justice and leaving all parties involved without timely recourse. Rajapakshe mentioned that in order to address this challenge, a draft law aimed at expediting the resolution of criminal cases is currently under development and is slated for submission to Parliament in January. In advanced jurisdictions, there is a paradigm shift towards non-custodial measures for individuals involved in minor offenses. Recognizing that incarceration, in many instances, is not the most suitable recourse, the new legal framework being proposed aims to explore alternatives. Notably, some individuals find themselves incarcerated due to societal oversights, and the proposed legislation acknowledges this by providing avenues for release on bail conditions. This approach aims to strike a balance between societal concerns and individual liberties, fostering a more nuanced and equitable criminal justice system. Speaking further on the Office of Missing Persons which currently manages a caseload of approximately 14,000 complaints, Rajapakshe highlighted that investigations for 4,795 complaints have successfully been concluded, reflecting a substantial improvement in case resolution which stood at 62 by the time he assumed duties. All outstanding complaints lodged with the Office of Missing Persons are slated for resolution by the coming year, the minister added. In addition, to fortify and enhance the efficiency of the judicial process, Rajapakshe said a comprehensive set of eight new bills is set to be submitted to Parliament. Efforts are underway to establish a reconciliation society within each village, where government officials and politicians do not play a direct role. The activities of these societal initiatives, referred to as reconciliation societies, are guided by the preferences of elders and religious leaders within the respective villages. The responsibilities encompass the independent execution of tasks such as infrastructure development, including road construction and provision of electricity, rendering political involvement unnecessary. The villagers take charge of organizing religious festivals, sports events and cultural celebrations, fostering a sense of community ownership and participation. The overarching vision is to seamlessly integrate each Grama Seva Division into a unified network, operating independently from external interference. The reconciliation society is entrusted with safeguarding the welfare and interests of the village, thereby ensuring the preservation and well-being of the community. Presently, widespread discourse revolves around the state of the countrys economy, which has been adversely affected by various factors. The extensive toll on lives and property incurred during Prabhakarans war and the destructive actions of the JVP, including the burning of buses, transformers and over 25 courts, have significantly impacted the economic landscape. The repercussions of these incidents continue to reverberate, influencing the nations economic trajectory. One pressing issue contributing to economic challenges is the unregulated proliferation of microfinance institutions, perceived as a substantial concern in the country. The absence of legal frameworks and regulatory oversight, coupled with the lack of registration with the Central Bank, has created an environment where individuals find it challenging to secure loans through conventional financial institutions due to their stringent rules. Consequently, many turn to microfinance institutions, exacerbating the existing economic predicament. To address this concern, there is a pressing need to establish a dedicated regulatory body, separate from the Central Bank, to oversee and govern microfinance institutions. Efforts are underway to introduce comprehensive laws aimed at regulating these entities and mitigating the potential adverse effects they pose to the countrys economic stability. The goal is to instate a regulatory framework that ensures responsible and accountable practices within the microfinance sector, thereby contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Defence has refuted the media reports claiming that an outrageous sum of money has been spent in 2022 for entertaining military heads, who periodically arrive on inspection visits to the Defence Services and Staff College (DSCSC). In a statement, the ministry emphasized that there is no truth to these speculations, and deemed them false propaganda. The DSCSC plays a unique role in imparting military officers of both Sri Lankan and foreign nations with combat tactics and advanced knowledge. Accordingly, 148 military officers including 25 military officers from foreign countries and 123 military officers from Sri Lanka participated in the DSCSC course held in 2022. The ministry explained that as per any other Defence Staff College in the Commonwealth Nations, the Defence Secretary, Chief of the Defence Staff and the Tri Forces Commanders conduct lectures every year on national security to student officers which is an integral part of this DSCSC course. These lectures are done on separate occasions due to the nature of the duties and the practical issues of conducting the lectures on one occasion, the ministry clarified adding that such lectures were conducted on 5 separate occasions. It is a military norm for the Defence Secretary, Chief of Defence Staff or the Commanders of the Armed Forces to have refreshments at the conclusion of their lecture with the participants of about 200 personnel that may include student officers, directing and permanent staff members providing an opportunity to expand their knowledge. The ministry noted that such expenditures are not incurred only to host the Secretary of Defence, Chief of Defence Staff or the Tri Forces Commanders and such media reports may mislead public perception. Furthermore, the Ministry of Defence expresses its regret on such actions of certain media organizations working with the aim of damaging the publics trust in the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces by irresponsibly expressing opinions about this incident without proper verification of facts, the statement read further.",

        "date": "December 5, 2023 12:06 pm",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal has decided to defer further consideration of the case filed against the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee until December 13. When the case was called before the Appeals Court this morning, the attorney-at-law representing the new Sports Minister Harin Fernando sought more time for his client to deliberate on the matter and convey his stance to the bench. Accordingly, the case was fixed for December 13 for further consideration. Further, Sports Minister Fernando gave an undertaking before the Appeals Court, pledging that no further action would be taken in respect of the Gazette notification issued by his predecessor MP Roshan Ranasinghe. On Nov.06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by the then-Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe. It was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga and consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President Shammi Silva challenging the move. Later, on Nov.13, then Sports Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on Nov.27, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his positions including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Harin Fernando, who was serving as the Minister of Tourism, was thus sworn in as the new Minister of Sports to replace Ranasinghe.",

        "date": "December 5, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "British Home Secretary James Cleverly arrived in Rwanda on Tuesday to sign a new treaty to send asylum seekers to the African nation after the UKs top court declared the deportation scheme unlawful. The Rwanda plan is at the centre of the governments strategy to cut migration and is being watched closely by other countries considering similar policies. But the United Kingdoms Supreme Court last month ruled that such a move would violate international human rights laws enshrined in domestic legislation. Since that ruling, Britain has been seeking to renegotiate its agreement with Rwanda to include a binding treaty that it would not expel asylum seekers sent there by Britain - one of the courts major concerns. Cleverly, who arrived in Rwandas capital Kigali on Tuesday morning, is due to meet with the countrys foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, to sign the agreement. Rwanda cares deeply about the rights of refugees, and I look forward to meeting with counterparts to sign this agreement and further discuss how we work together to tackle the global challenge of illegal migration, Cleverly said. Under the plan, Britain intends to send thousands of asylum seekers who arrived on its shores without permission to Rwanda to deter migrants crossing the Channel from Europe in small boats. In return, Rwanda has received an initial payment of 140 million pounds (180 million) with the promise of more money to fund the accommodation and care of any deported individuals. PRESSURE Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to cut net migration, which hit a record 745,000 last year, and end the flow of asylum seekers who pay people smugglers for their Channel crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats. Britains immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the government had to act because those arriving on small boats were effectively breaking into the country. The law says you cant enter the country illegally. If you or I crossed an international border, we literally broke into another country, we would expect to be treated very seriously, he told Sky News. The vast majority of those arriving in Britain came via legal routes, and the government also announced plans to cut those numbers on Monday, raising the minimum salary they must earn in a skilled job. Ministers are also expected to publish new legislation soon, declaring Rwanda a so-called safe country, designed to stop legal challenges against the planned deportation flights. Stop the boats is one of five goals Sunak set for his government before a national election expected next year. The Supreme Court ruled the governments scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful because there was a risk that deported refugees would have their claims wrongly assessed or returned to their country of origin to face persecution. The court said the plan breached international undertakings - including the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations Refugee Convention and Convention against Torture. There are growing tensions in the Conservative Party over how to respond, with some members of parliament putting pressure on the government to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, after the European Court of Human Rights originally blocked deportation flights from leaving. This year almost 29,000 people have arrived on the southern English coast without permission, after a record 45,755 were detected in 2022. The Rwanda policy was originally announced by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year, but no asylum seekers have been sent to the country yet. Critics, ranging from opposition lawmakers as well as some Conservatives to church leaders and the United Nations refugee agency, have argued the policy is flawed, a waste of money, immoral and simply would not work.

        "date": "December 5, 2023 07:41 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The United States on Monday charged a former ambassador to Bolivia with spying for Cuba for over 40 years, in what the Justice Department described as one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the U.S. government by a foreign agent. Victor Manuel Rocha, who served as U.S. ambassador to Bolivia from 2000 to 2002, was charged with committing multiple federal crimes including acting as an illegal foreign agent and using a fraudulently obtained passport, the Justice Department said in a statement. We allege that for over 40 years, Victor Manuel Rocha served as an agent of the Cuban government and sought out and obtained positions within the United States government that would provide him with access to non-public information and the ability to affect U.S. foreign policy, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the statement. Rocha, 73, was arrested and is expected to appear before a federal judge in Miami on Monday. He was not immediately reachable for comment. Rocha worked for the State Department from 1981 to 2002, the Justice Department said. He served on the White Houses National Security Council from 1994 to 1995, and worked as an adviser to the Commander of the U.S. militarys Southern Command from around 2006 to around 2012, the department added. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters he was unable to provide details on an ongoing law enforcement matter. We will in the coming days, weeks, months, work with our partners in the intelligence community to assess any long-term national security implications for this matter, Miller said at a regular press briefing. In a court document filed in the southern district of Florida, the U.S. accuses Rocha of having secretly supported Cuba and its clandestine intelligence-gathering mission against Washington since 1981. Rocha admitted his decades of work for Cuba in a series of meetings in 2022 and 2023 with an undercover FBI agent who posed as a covert Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence representative, according to the court document.

        "date": "December 5, 2023 07:53 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will get about 600 million, on a staggered basis, from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) releases the second tranche of a 2.9 billion bailout for the crisis-hit country, an official said on Tuesday. Sri Lanka is inching out of its worst financial crisis in decades, triggered by record-low foreign exchange reserves last year that saw its economy contract 7.8 in 2022. The islands economy has been gradually stabilising after locking down a four-year programme with the IMF in March. Its first review is expected to be approved by the global lender next week, which will release a second tranche of about 334 million in funding. Alongside the IMF programme the Asian Development Bank is likely to provide total budget support of 2 billion over the next four years, said ADB, Sri Lanka Resident Mission, Country Director Takafumi Kadono. I would say 500 million to 600 million budget support is what is planned (for 2024) but, again, it is subject to attainment, satisfying the policy actions, so its not free money, Kadono said in an interview with Reuters. The bulk of the support will likely be extended next year in a combination of policy-based loans and project lending. The first instalment of 200 million is tabled for ADB Board support on Dec. 8 but will only be given to Sri Lanka after the IMF approves its first review on Dec. 12. Another 200 million for power sector reforms is expected in 2024, along with 100 million to the water sector and 50-70 million for the tourism sector. An additional 100 million is earmarked in ADB support to improve access to financing for small- and medium-sized enterprises, along with another 100 million to improve public finance and debt management. Sri Lanka has to remain committed to pushing forward reforms pledged under the IMF programme, Kadono said, which include restructuring its loss-making state enterprises, reducing budget deficits and improving governance. These are not bandage measures. I think Sri Lanka has done a lot of that in the past so, I think its really time to fix the fundamentals of the economy and to address these latent weaknesses in the economy and the institutions, Kadono said.

        "content": "In a momentous ceremony held today (Dec.05), the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) marked a significant chapter in the history with the ceremonial induction of two Harbin Y-12 IV aircraft at SLAF Base in Ratmalana. The ceremony was graced by State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon and the Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China, Qi Zhenhong. The No. 8 Tactical Transport Squadron, renowned as The Cradle of Transport Pilots, laid the foundation for this historic occasion on 02 April 1996. Originally equipped with eight Y-12 II aircraft (SCL 851 to SCL 859) inducted in 1987, these aircraft played a pivotal role in various air operations during the local theatre of war. The formal proceedings commenced with the signing of documents symbolizing the transfer of the Harbin Y-12 aircraft to the Sri Lanka Air Force. Commander of the Air Force, Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa and Mr. Den Ling from China National Aero Technology Import  Export Cooperation presided over this key moment, marking the official handover. Addressing the gathering, Air Force Chief expressed gratitude for the strategic partnership and elaborating the significance of the new additions to the Sri Lanka Air Forces fleet. He emphasized the continued commitment to strengthening international collaborations, highlighting the value of the Harbin Y-12 IV aircraft in enhancing the Air Forces operational capabilities. In a gesture of appreciation, a memento was presented to the chief guest, State Minister Tennakoon, to commemorate the historical milestone. Meanwhile, Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa extended his gratitude to the State Minister of Defence, acknowledging the untiring support in advancing the capabilities of the Sri Lanka Air Force. State Minister Tennakoon expressed pride in witnessing this significant occasion and reiterated the governments commitment, guided by the Chief of the Armed Forces and President Ranil Wickremasinghe, to ensuring regional security and stability. This significant occasion was attended by Sagala Ratnayake, the Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff; General Kamal Gunaratne (Retd), Secretary to the Ministry of Defence; General Shavendra Silva, Chief of Defence Staff; Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, Commander of the Navy, as well as the Chief of Staff of the SLAF, members of the Air Force Board of Management, officials of the Chinese Embassy in Colombo, members of the CATIC from China and representatives of CATIC Sri Lanka, senior officers of the SLAF and other officials.",

        "date": "December 5, 2023 10:37 pm",
        "content": "The government has instituted a unique opportunity to facilitate professional education tailored to the demands of the job market for the students who have faced G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, regardless of their results. Saman Rubasinghe, the Director of Registration Accreditation and Quality Management at the Tertiary Education and Vocational Education Commission, said the students can initiate the application process even prior to the release of examination results. He explained that this program spans across 525 schools island-wide. All candidates who have participated in the Ordinary Level examination are eligible to apply after the Vocational Training Institute issues the relevant newspaper advertisement. All courses are meticulously designed with a focus on the contemporary job market, he added. Speaking on the 101 Katha program produced by the Presidents Media Division (PMD), Mr. Rubasinghe highlighted that vocational education is integrated into the school curriculum during the first year, followed by the conferment of an NVQ level certificate in the second year through collaboration with a vocational training institute. Upon obtaining the NVQ 4 certificate, individuals have the opportunity to pursue further education at various levels, including diplomas, advanced diplomas and degrees. Under the conventional practice, the students who fail the Ordinary Level examination would typically be excluded from the education process. However, during the premiership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the 13-year continuous education program was introduced, recognizing the need to direct students to vocational education through the school itself to prepare the student community to face future challenges. Mr. Rubasinghe, providing further insights, emphasized that through this program, all students who participated in the Ordinary Level examination have been offered the opportunity to pursue vocational education, regardless of their examination outcomes. Additionally, individuals preparing for Advanced Level examination and those aspiring to pursue professional education abroad often inquire about opportunities. In such cases, they can undertake short-term courses to acquire requisite language proficiency, he explained. Moreover, possessing computer knowledge is deemed highly beneficial across various fields, including motor mechanics, welding technology, agricultural assistance and the hotel industry. While it may not constitute a professional qualification, it holds significant importance as an additional qualification in enhancing overall skills. Furthermore, there are individuals who make a conscious choice to pursue vocational education, irrespective of whether they have successfully passed the Ordinary Level examination. Dedicated vocational education programs have been initiated for such individuals across 525 schools in Sri Lanka. The 13-year continuous education program facilitates the pursuit of vocational education directly from school, allowing individuals to proactively engage in skill development. Meanwhile, notifications for applications will be communicated through newspaper advertisements, ensuring widespread awareness of the opportunities available.

        "date": "December 5, 2023 11:31 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) together with the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE), through licensed commercial banks, commenced popularizing the new Manusavi Migrant Worker Loan Scheme from Monday (Dec.04). The event was held under the patronage of Labor and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara. On behalf of the SLBFE, its chairman Hilmi Asis, and on behalf of the CBSL, Senarath Dharmawardena, the Regional Development Director exchanged the relevant loan proposal agreements. The SLBFE has earmarked a total of Rs. 5 billion to implement this loan scheme. To be eligible for the loan scheme, a migrant worker is required to maintain an individual or a joint Personal Foreign Currency Account (PFCA) or Savings Account (RSA) in a licensed commercial bank and should have remitted foreign exchange to the respective account (at least within the past three months). The SLBFE says the loan can be obtained for starting expanding a business, buying constructing expanding a house, buying land vehicles, higher education of children or any other productive purposes. The maximum limit of the loan a migrant worker can obtain is Rs. 2 million. The maximum interest rate that can be charged from the borrower is 8 and a maximum period of 36 months is given to repay the money. For this, individual or joint loan applications can be forwarded to the respective bank before going abroad or while abroad. The loan applicant can authorize a close relative through power of attorney (POA) to receive the loan amount on their behalf. The SLBFE says the loans cannot be repaid in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR). However, the opportunity is given to settle the loan in LKR after returning to Sri Lanka upon completion of the foreign employment. If the loan is repaid in LKR, prevailing market interest rates will be applied. Refinancing facilities are provided through the Regional Development Department (RDD) of the CBSL at an annual interest rate of 4 for the following licensed commercial banks that contribute to this initiative:  Bank of Ceylon  Peoples Bank  Commercial Bank  Hatton National Bank (HNB)  Sampath Bank  Seylan Bank  Cargills Bank  DFCC Bank  National Development Bank (NDB)  Pan Asia Bank  Union Bank",

        "content": "Police have arrested five more suspects who were complicit in the operation of an unregistered educational institute in Bambalapitiya. The arrestees, aged 23, 25, and 26 years, are reportedly residents of Puwakpitiya, Pallewela, Dematagoda, Polonnaruwa and Mathugama. After being produced before the Aluthkade Court No.3 earlier today, the suspects have been released on surety bails each valued at Rs. 100,000. The institute in question which goes by the name Evolve College of Education was located on the Lauries Road in Bambalapitiya and had advertised on social media platforms that it provides educational qualifications such as diplomas and higher diplomas required for local and foreign employment. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old woman from Narangamuwa in Giriulla, who acted as the director of the said fake educational institute, was also arrested and later released on a surety bail of Rs. 500,000 on the orders of Aluthkade Court No.3. The fake institute had also issued fake diploma certificates after providing academic services without legal approval. Further, it has been in operation without meeting either local or international standards and has charged sums of money ranging between Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 445,000 from each student, depending on the type of course. The police said they have received 43 complaints in total related to this higher education scam. Investigations also revealed that the institute in question had not obtained the approval of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission either. At least 1,000 individuals countrywide have reportedly fallen victim to this fraudulent activity.",

        "title": "UK interior minister signs new Rwanda treaty to resurrect asylum plan",
        "date": "December 6, 2023 07:43 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Britain signed a new treaty with Rwanda on Tuesday which it said would overcome a court decision blocking its plan to deport asylum seekers to the East African country, a ruling that dealt a huge blow to the governments immigration policy. The Rwanda scheme is at the centre of the governments strategy to stop illegal migration and is being watched closely by other countries considering similar policies. But last month, the United Kingdoms Supreme Court ruled that the plan would violate international human rights laws enshrined in domestic legislation. Under the new treaty, signed by British Home Secretary (interior minister) James Cleverly and which replaces a non-binding memorandum of understanding, Britain said Rwanda would not expel asylum seekers to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened - one of the courts major concerns. There will also be a monitoring committee to enable individuals to lodge confidential complaints directly to them, and a new appeal body made up of judges from around the world. Cleverly said he expected migrants to be heading to Rwanda in the coming months because the treaty addressed all the issues raised by the Supreme Court I really hope that we can now move quickly, Cleverly told reporters in Rwandas capital Kigali. However, many lawyers and charities said it was unlikely that deportation flights could start before an election expected next year. The opposition Labour Party, which has a double-digit lead in the polls, plans to ditch the Rwanda policy if it wins. Under the plan agreed last year, Britain intends to send thousands of asylum seekers who arrived on its shores without permission to Rwanda to deter migrants making the dangerous journey across the Channel from Europe in small boats. In return, Rwanda has received an initial payment of 140 million pounds (180 million) with the promise of more money to fund the accommodation and care of any deported individuals. PRESSURE Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, now in power for just over a year, is under intense pressure from both his own lawmakers and many voters to cut net migration, which hit a record 745,000 last year, with the vast majority coming through legal routes. Stop the boats is one of five goals Sunak set for his government to end the flow of asylum seekers who pay people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded boats that are not seaworthy. The Supreme Court ruled against the Rwanda plan - first brought in by then prime minister Boris Johnson in April last year - because there was a risk that deported refugees would have their claims wrongly assessed or returned to their country of origin to face persecution. The new treaty is expected to be followed later this week by the publication of legislation declaring Rwanda a so-called safe country, designed to stop legal challenges against the planned deportation flights. However, this is likely to trigger a new round of political and legal wrangling. The first flight was scheduled to go last summer but was cancelled at the last moment because of legal challenges. Sarah Gogan, an immigration lawyer at Harbottle  Lewis, said Rwandas human rights record meant the governments highly contentious policy would be challenged in the courts and parliament. You cannot in a matter of weeks or months reform a country and turn it into one with an impartial judiciary and administrative culture, she said. The treaty appears to be yet more fairytale politics and completely unworkable. Yvette Cooper, Labours home affairs spokeswoman, dismissed the governments latest plans as another gimmick.

        "date": "December 6, 2023 11:32 am",
        "content": "The U.S. on Tuesday began imposing visa bans on people involved in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Washington officials said, after several appeals for Israel to do more prevent violence by Jewish settlers. A new State Department visa restriction policy targets individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians access to essential services and basic necessities, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. President Joe Biden and other senior U.S. officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. Attacks there have surged in recent months as Jewish settlements have expanded, and then spiked again since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Blinken made clear to Israeli officials during a visit last week that they need to do more to stop extremist violence against Palestinians, and hold those responsible for it accountable, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters in a press briefing after the announcement. Palestinian leaders must also do more to curb Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the West Bank, he added. The first bans under the new policy would be imposed on Tuesday and more designations will be made in the coming days, Miller said. We expect ultimately for this action to impact dozens of individuals and potentially their family members, Miller said, adding that any Israeli with an existing U.S. visa who was targeted would be notified that their visa was revoked. Since a 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. It has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land. Asked about settler violence in a news conference on Tuesday, Israels Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said no one besides Israeli authorities had the right to use violence. Israel is a state of law. The right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government, he said. Miller said Israel had taken some steps to hold people responsible for the West Bank violence, like putting them in administrative detention, but U.S. officials believe they should be prosecuted. Washingtons move on Tuesday does not obviate the need for the government of Israel to take its own actions and we will continue to be clear with them about it, he said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has green-lighted a proposal seeking to enter into necessary agreements with the World Bank to secure financing under the Sri Lanka Financial Sector Safety Net Strengthening Project. The proposal was tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, at the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday (Dec.05). The project was designed to boost the financial and institutional capacity of the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme (SLDIS), which is managed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The financing will help boost reserves of SLDIS which could be used towards the payout to insured depositors of banks and licensed finance companies. In parallel, the project will support institutional strengthening of the SLDIS in line with international good practices for effective deposit insurance schemes. On April 24, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to implement the financial sector safety net strengthening project under World Bank funds. Later, on November 09, the World Banks Board of Executive Directors approved USD 150 million in financing for Sri Lanka to strengthen the resilience of its financial sector. The SLDIS was established in 2010 and has conducted several payouts for failed licensed finance companies in recent years. At present, the SLDIS guarantees the deposits of households and enterprises up to LKR 1,100,000, which covers more than 90 of deposit accounts in Sri Lanka. The legal framework for deposit insurance in Sri Lanka was upgraded earlier this year through the approval of Banking Special Provisions Act by Parliament. The World Bank earlier said SLDIS should now be strengthened institutionally and financially for the deposit insurance scheme to be able to effectively fulfill its legal mandate of protecting the financial sector stability. Addressing the Cabinet media briefing earlier today, Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said the World Banks financing for the project will ensure a strong deposit insurance system, enhanced supervision. He said it will safeguard public confidence in the financial system.",

        "date": "December 6, 2023 01:32 pm",
        "content": "Swedish music-streaming giant Spotify has announced it is cutting 17 of its workforce, about 1,500 jobs, as the company seeks to clamp down on costs. Chief executive Daniel Ek said he had made the difficult decisionn with economic growth slowing dramatically. Spotify employs about 9,000 people, and Mr Ek said substantial action to rightsize our costs was needed for the company to meet its objectives. He added he understood the cuts would be incredibly painful for our team. I recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions, Mr Ek said. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us. Spotify cut staff earlier this year but these plans dwarf those previous announcements. In its latest results, Spotify had reported a profit of 65m (55.7m) for the three months to September - its first quarterly profit for more than a year - helped by price rises and higher subscriber numbers. The tech company has been expanding worldwide as it seeks to reach a billion users by 2030. It currently has 601 million of them, up from 345 million at the end of 2020. Mr Ek said that given the recent positive results, the job cuts being announced will feel surprisingly large for many people. He said Spotify had considered making smaller reductions during 2024 and 2025, but decided that more drastic action was needed to improve the companys finances. Since it launched, Spotify has spent a lot of money on growing the business, and in securing exclusive content, such as podcasts created by the likes of Michelle and Barack Obama as well as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The deal with Harry and Meghan cost a reported 25m (19.7m) and saw just 12 episodes delivered over two and a half years before the deal ended in June. Commenting on podcast content, Mr Ek told the BBC in September: The truth of the matter is some of it has worked, some of it hasnt. The company will start informing affected employees on Monday. Employees will get about five months of severance pay, holiday pay, and healthcare coverage for the severance period. Spotify will also offer immigration support to employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment. Tech layoffs continue to bite These jobs losses are the latest in a series of layoffs announced in the tech industry, which has cut tens of thousands of jobs following a boom during Covid pandemic lockdowns. British telecom group BT said in May that it will axe up to 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade. Tech giants Meta and Microsoft also revealed plans to reduce their workforce by as many as 10,000 employees this year. Online retail giant Amazon announced it was cutting over 18,000 jobs worldwide and Google parent company Alphabet announced cuts of around 12,000 people. Smaller firms have also felt the pinch with Yahoo and LinkedIn both announcing cuts this year too. Apple however seems to have bucked the trend, announcing that it would be hiring some staff in the AI sector. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The Colombo Fort Magistrate gave orders to release de Silva after the Attorney General informed the court that insufficient evidence was found to support the allegations. In September 2018, the Director (Operations) of Anti-Corruption Movement, Namal Kumara had exposed an alleged conspiracy and the purported conversations on controversial topics that he had had with former DIG Nalaka de Silva in this regard. The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) subsequently commenced investigations into the matter and grilled the former Director of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) on multiple occasions. De Silva was arrested by the CID on October 25, 2018, over the suspected plot to assassinate former presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He had since been in remand custody as his bail applications were rejected. He was granted bail in May 2019 on the orders of Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. He had also filed an FR petition seeking the Supreme Court to rule that his arrest and detention were unlawful, however withdrew it in September 2020.",

The judge bench also dismissed the petition filed by Harak Kata seeking a writ order invalidating the detention order issued to keep him in the custody of the CID. Harak Kata was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu on March 01 this year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry on March 08 of the arrest of eight suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking. While in the custody on detention order, the ill-famed underworld figure also attempted an escape bid at the CID premises in September, which was ultimately foiled by the officials.",

        "date": "December 6, 2023 04:10 pm",
        "content": "K-pop superstars Blackpink have renewed their agency contract as a group, ensuring that the quartet will continue to perform together. This follows months of contract negotiations during which fans feared the group could split up. In a statement on Wednesday, YG Entertainment said an exclusive contract for group activities based on strong trust has been signed. Blackpink, formed in 2016, have become the worlds biggest K-pop girl group. The new contract is believed to be among the most lucrative signed by any music group this year. The agency also said Blackpink plan to repay their fans around the world with activities that match their global status in the K-pop scene with new albums and world tours. Details of the new group contract are not immediately clear, and YGs statement also did not mention the agencys individual contracts with Jisoo, Lisa, Jennie and Rosé. South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that these contracts are still being negotiated. According to previous South Korean media reports, if the four stars choose not to renew their individual contracts, they are free to pursue solo careers under different representation. This means that they would perform as a group only when their schedules allow. It is very rare for K-pop groups to fully reunite after some members leave or refuse to renew individual contracts with their management. This has happened to popular YG acts such as Bigbang and 2NE1. Local newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported in November that no Blackpink member had agreed an individual contract with YG and that there were offers from rival agencies worth tens of billions of won (11314). Now their fans, who have been been on tenterhooks since the groups contract expired in August, are overjoyed by the news. See you next tour, a post liked more than a hundred times on X, formerly known as Twitter, reads. The biggest girl group in the world is there to stay! Blackpink will and always remain as four, says another X user. YGs share price closed more than 25 higher on Wednesday. However, the companys stock market value is still almost 30 lower than it was six months ago. The four members - all in their 20s - are celebrities in their own right. Their official YouTube channel has more than 92 million subscribers, while each of them has more than 70 million followers on Instagram. They have represented some of the biggest fashion brands, such as Chanel and Dior, and headlined major international music festivals such as Coachella and BST Hyde Park. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "December 6, 2023 04:40 pm",
        "content": "President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the centenary celebration of the Government Valuation Department held at Solis Hotel in Pitakotte, declared the initiation of a ground-breaking economic program today (06 Dec.). Set to kick off on January 1, this transformative initiative is designed to modernize various sectors and propel the nation towards progress. The President underscored the imperative nature of adopting new economic reforms, emphasizing that the nation cannot afford to persist with out-dated systems. He highlighted that the hardships endured over the past years should not be passed down to the next generation, asserting that the only viable course of action is to embrace the proposed economic changes, urging collective participation. Reflecting on the recent economic challenges, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the concerted efforts that rescued the country from financial distress over the past 18 months and commended the heads of public institutions and the workforce for their dedication. He cautioned against complacency, warning that without prudent management of the current economic stability, the nation might face another crisis within the next decade. The President advocated for a shift towards a digital economy, citing the necessity of employing modern economic methodologies. President Wickremesinghe additionally emphasized that global financial entities have acknowledged Sri Lankas remarkable and swift recovery from economic challenges, particularly in comparison to countries facing bankruptcy amid the global economic recession. Expressing gratitude to the employees of the Government Valuation Department for their dedicated service, the President presented awards and issued a commemorative stamp worth Rs. 25 and a first day cover to mark the centenary celebration. He unveiled the song and flag of the department and introduced the e Valuation system to digitize its operations. President Wickremesinghe, in his additional remarks, highlighted the historical evolution of the Valuation Department, tracing its origins back to the Portuguese period and noting significant developments during the British era, including the establishment of the Assessor position in 1923. Underlining the continued evolution, the President pointed out that the role of the Valuation Department experienced further expansion with the introduction of the land policy in 1972, ushering in a new era. The President stressed the critical importance of digitization in this context, emphasizing the necessity for a skilled workforce in assessment within the framework of the digital economy. To achieve this, he proposed an increase in university enrolment to nurture future Valuers. Looking ahead, President Wickremesinghe advocated for a regular property valuation cycle, suggesting that assessments should be conducted every five years. He underscored the vital contribution of the assessment process to the tax collection system, expressing high regard for the initiation of digitalization within the Valuation Department starting from the current year. Reflecting on the challenges of the past year, during which the nation confronted a significant economic crisis, it is essential to acknowledge the substantial sacrifices made by both government officials and the broader population in steering the country towards recovery. Gratitude is due to all those who played a part in this collective effort, he said. In the upcoming weeks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is poised to issue a statement signalling the countrys exit from bankruptcy. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored that, for sustained economic stability, a departure from out-dated economic methods is imperative. He cautioned against the implementation of conventional economic strategies, emphasizing that without adopting innovative approaches, the risk of a recurrent economic crisis looms over the nation within the next decade. Key measures have already been implemented to reinforce fiscal prudence. The Central Bank has ceased the practice of printing money and loans from state banks earmarked for development, have been halted. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that adherence to these conditions is indispensable for fostering economic growth. The President emphasized the crucial need for financial discipline, asserting that effective management of the economy in alignment with disciplined financial practices will pave the way for providing greater relief to the citizens in the future. The prevailing economic crisis in the country, stemming from the disparity between imports and exports coupled with a budget deficit, necessitates strategic interventions. To address these challenges, comprehensive plans have been formulated to augment export earnings, curtail government expenditure and enhance government income. Recognizing the potential of the tourism industry to generate substantial foreign exchange, a targeted initiative has been set in motion with the aim of attracting 2.5 million tourists to Sri Lanka next year. The government is optimistic that by further doubling this figure to 5 million, a rapid alleviation of the countrys economic woes can be achieved. As part of this years budget proposal, a significant allocation of 300,000 acres has been earmarked for cultivation, representing a key component of the economic revitalization strategy. The Valuation Department is poised to play a pivotal role in realizing this agricultural objective. Acknowledging the importance of efficiency in this process, the digitization of the Valuation Department has been prioritized, foreseeing enhanced effectiveness in its operations. In addressing the pressing needs of the energy sector, a paradigm shift towards renewable energy is imperative. The emphasis should be placed on harnessing wind and solar power resources, with the potential to generate 35GW and 200GW, respectively. Given that the national consumption requirement is less than 50GW, this surplus capacity positions the energy sector as a potential foreign exchange earner. In addition to prioritizing renewable energy, due attention must be accorded to the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the energy sector and broader digital economy. The strategic deployment of AI has the potential to rapidly bolster the nations economic prowess. The event was attended by, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, State Minister for Mass Media Shanta Bandara, Chief Government Valuer Pushpa Muthukumarana, Post Master General Ruwan Satkumara and employees of the Government Valuation Department.",

        "content": "The chairman of Committee on Public Finance (COPF) says the Finance Ministry is preparing to impose Value-Added Tax (VAT) on a number of goods, including infants food items, fertilizers, medical equipment, and ambulances including Suwaseriya. Addressing the parliament earlier today (Dec.06), Dr. Harsha de Silva said, while the COPF acknowledges the fact that tax revenue is imperative to boost state income, there should be equitableness in tax imposition. He said the COPF has appealed to the Finance Ministry to reconsider its decision to impose VAT on the aforementioned goods. The Cabinet of Ministers in October gave the nod to increase the VAT from 15 to 18 starting January 01, 2024. In addition, some of the new tax proposals are also expected to be implemented effective from January 01, 2024, in order to enable the realization of tax revenue and primary balance targets as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The decision was taken after observing that the tax collection targets agreed with the IMF are yet to be accomplished. Earlier, the government mentioned that state tax revenue of the first nine months of 2023 went up by 51 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 after various tax-based increases and developmental tax policy proposals were implemented from June last year for the state financial stability based on the income, to ensure loan sustainability. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, raising concerns about the proposed increase of the VAT to 18, has cautioned that the move could lead to a further decline in consumption.",

        "content": "Indias health ministry has ordered a probe into Apollo Hospital Delhi, part of largest private hospital chain Apollo Hospitals (APLH.NS), after media reports linked it to the illegal sale by Myanmar nationals of their kidneys for organ transplants. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), which falls under the health ministry, has asked Delhi Health Secretary S B Deepak Kumar to get the matter examined, take appropriate action ... and furnish an action-taken report within a week, according to a letter seen by Reuters. A committee was being formed to probe the matter and details of donors and patients have been sought from the hospital, Kumar told local media. Reuters was unable to reach Kumar. Apollo Hospitals did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Indraprastha Medical Corp (IMCL.NS), an associate of Apollo which manages its two hospitals in the capital region of Delhi, said it had initiated an inquiry into the matter and called the allegations against it absolutely false, ill-informed and misleading. A report in Britains Telegraph accused Apollo of being embroiled in a cash for kidneys scandal in which young villagers from Myanmar were being flown to its Delhi hospital and enticed to sell their kidneys to rich Burmese patients. The Myanmar government did not respond to Reuters request for comment. Chennai-based chain Apollo, which runs over 70 hospitals across India, performed 1,641 solid organ transplants in 2022, according to company data.

        "date": "December 6, 2023 10:19 pm",
        "content": "Members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union approved a three-year contract with major studios on Tuesday, formally ending six months of Hollywood labor disputes that halted film and television production. SAG-AFTRA said 78 of those who voted supported the deal with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and other members of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Just 38 of eligible SAG-AFTRA members cast a ballot, the union said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. SAG-AFTRA represents roughly 160,000 actors and other media professionals. The new contract provides for pay raises and streaming bonuses that union leaders said amounted to more than 1 billion over three years. It also includes guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in filmmaking, though some actors complained that the AI protections were not sufficient. This is a golden age for SAG-AFTRA, and our union has never been more powerful, the unions president, The Nanny actor Fran Drescher, said in a statement. SAG-AFTRA members walked off the job in July and reached a tentative agreement with major studios in November. Actors started returning to work immediately after the preliminary deal. Film and television writers also went on strike this year, walking out ahead of the actors union. After a five-month walkout, the writers approved a new contract in October with 99 of the vote. Some actors had objected to AI provisions in the contract. The deal requires studios to obtain permission from celebrities to use their digital likenesses and to pay them for the use. Critics argued that the language allows creation of synthetic performers that could eliminate the need for many human actors. The dual strikes shut down a large swath of film and TV production, halted late-night talk shows and forced broadcast networks to fill their fall schedules with repeats and reality shows. Major movies including Dune: Part Two and Marvels Thunderbolts also were delayed. Hollywood studios welcomed the contract ratification, saying the agreement offered historic gains and protections. With this vote, the industry and the jobs it supports will be able to return in full force, the AMPTP said in a statement. SAG-AFTRA noted that other Hollywood unions representing crew members, musicians and drivers will start negotiations on new contracts next year. They will be able to use our groundbreaking gains as leverage in their own bargaining efforts, SAG-AFTRA said. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The goal is to bring about positive changes in the countrys school system by prioritizing these areas. The digitalization of the entire education system is underway, with support from both local and foreign assistance.

The attack sent shock waves through a city still scarred by the deaths of 60 people in a 2017 mass shooting only a few miles away on the famous Strip. Reports of shots fired at about 11:45 a.m. sent police swarming onto the campus while students and professors barricaded themselves inside classrooms and dorm rooms. UNLV Police Chief Adam Garcia said at an evening news conference that campus and local police rushed to the scene, a building housing UNLVs Lee Business School, where two university detectives killed the suspect during a shootout. Authorities gave the all-clear about 40 minutes after the first report of an active shooter. Sheriff Kevin McMahill said students had gathered outside the building to eat and play games. If police hadnt killed the attacker, it could have been countless additional lives taken, he said. No student should have to fear pursuing their dreams on a college campus, the sheriff said. Authorities didnt immediately release any additional details about the shootings, the victims, the suspect or a possible motive. Professor Kevaney Martin took cover under a desk in her classroom, where another faculty member and three students took shelter with her. It was terrifying, I cant even begin to explain, Martin said. I was trying to hold it together for my students, and trying not to cry, but the emotions are something I never want to experience again. Martin said she was texting friends and loved ones, hoping to receive word a suspect had been detained. When another professor came to the room and told everyone to evacuate, they joined dozens of others rushing out of the building. Martin had her students pile into her car and drove them off campus. Once we got away from UNLV, we parked and sat in silence, she said. Nobody said a word. We were in utter shock. Students and the community were alerted to the emergency by a university post on X that warned: This is not a test. RUN-HIDE-FIGHT. The university said the shooter was at the Beam Hall, Frank and Estella Building, and that police responded to an additional report of shots fired at the nearby student union. Student Matthew Felsenfeld said he and about 12 classmates barricaded their door in a building near the student union. Its the moment you call your parents and tell them you love them, said Felsenfeld, a 21-year-old journalism student. Jordan Eckermann, 25, said he was in his business law class in a second-floor classroom when he heard a loud bang that he thought came from a neighboring music class. But then a piercing alarm went off, sending students to their feet. Some ran from the room in panic while others heeded the professors urging to stay calm, said Eckermann, who walked out and was directed to an exit by a law enforcement officer in a bulletproof vest holding a long gun. UNLVs 332-acre (135-hectare) campus is less than 2 miles east of the Las Vegas Strip. it wasnt immediately clear how many of the 30,000 students were on campus. The shooting occurred in a city still scarred by one of the worst mass killings in U.S. history, the Oct. 1, 2017, massacre by a gunman in which 60 people attending a music festival were killed and hundreds more were wounded. The gunman opened fire from a high-rise suite at the Mandalay Bay casino. The UNLV campus is just over 3 miles (5 kilometers) from that location. In response to the campus shootings, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop of all flights coming into Harry Reid International Airport. The university is roughly 2 miles (3 kilometers) north of the airport. Classes were canceled through Friday at the university, and UNLVs basketball game at the University of Dayton, Ohio, was canceled Wednesday night because of the Las Vegas shootings.
