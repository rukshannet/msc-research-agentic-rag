        "date": "July 26, 2023 05:49 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella has assured the Ministrys full support towards the efforts made regarding pandemic prevention preparedness, at a regional level. Rambukwella made these remarks during a conference hosted by the World Bank, together with the Government of Sri Lanka, themed Improving Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response through One Health Approach. Accordingly, the Minister said, Under my leadership, my team will assure their full support for the activities under the regional pandemic prevention preparedness programme to uplift the wellbeing of the population of the region and beyond. Moreover, the Minister further emphasised that the pandemic prevention preparedness programme is of key importance to the Ministry, as South Asia remains a hotspot for emerging, and re-emerging, infectious diseases. Preparation through education is less costly than learning through tragedy, he said in this regard. Meanwhile, also present at the conference was Chief of Presidential Staff and Senior Advisor on National Security to the President Sagala Ratnyake, who, in a similar manner, urged that Sri Lanka needs to be prepared for the likelihood of another pandemic. We have to be prepared for it, for prevention and to respond, he said, adding that the possibility for the next pandemic on a similar scale could be anything between 22 and 28. Deeming a regional response for improving pandemic prevention preparedness indispensible, the Presidential Chief of Staff also noted that Sri Lanka needs to start thinking of an equitable health service. Speaking further in this regard, Ratnayake opined that government funding is no longer the way forward in terms of Sri Lankas healthcare system, suggesting that Sri Lanka adopt more Western cultures such as health insurance services. The conference was hosted in Colombo this afternoon (26 July), with the objective of reviewing and updating the recent developments on the global health security agenda. Delegates from the Bay-of-Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) nations were also present at the event. Accordingly, the conference will focus on introducing decisions on regional mechanisms in this regard need to be established or strengthened, and will also include brainstorming sessions on the roadmap ahead in terms of improving pandemic prevention preparedness, at a regional level, through the One Health approach, within the South Asian region.",

        "title": "Cambodias Hun Sen to resign after four decades and appoint son as PM",
        "date": "July 26, 2023 06:12 pm",
        "content": "Cambodias Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the worlds longest-serving leaders, has announced he will resign and hand over to his son in early August. The anticipated announcement came three days after his party again won all seats at an uncompetitive election. Hun Sen, 70, has become increasingly authoritarian after nearly four decades of rule in Cambodia. He first flagged a transition in 2021, but up to now no one knew exactly when it would take place. His eldest son, Hun Manet, until recently the commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, has long been groomed for the role. In his announcement, Hun Sen said his son would be appointed prime minister on 10 August. I would like to ask for understanding from the people as I announce that I will not continue as prime minister, he said in a special broadcast on state television. He said he would be stepping down as staying in office could cause instability. However he will retain leadership of the ruling Cambodian Peoples Party - a position political analysts say still gives him ultimate control. Earlier on Wednesday, state media showed Hun Sen visiting the Cambodian monarchs palace to announce the news of the dynastic succession. Hun Manet, 45, took a leading role in campaigning for the 23 July election this year - and was often spotted leading rallies next to his father, who has ruled the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people since 1985. Sundays election was widely seen as a done deal, because the only credible opposition party had been disqualified from the vote. There were 17 other parties on the ballot but they were all too small, new or aligned with the CPP to be considered a real alternative for voters. The US and the EU both released statements condemning the vote as neither free nor fair. Hun Sens elimination of political opponents is part of his wider crackdown on civil space in Cambodia in recent years. Having consistently crushed his opponents, in 2017 he used the courts to dissolve another popular opposition party, the CNRP, and jail or exile its leaders. He has also increasingly stifled dissent and free speech - shutting down most independent media in the country. Rights groups, trade unions and NGOs also report facing threats of closure. Analysts had speculated that his clampdown this year was driven by the need for a smooth transition. It will be Cambodias first transfer of power in four decades. Compared to his father, whose iron-fisted rule was forged during and after the days of the Khmer Rouge regime, there is some speculation that Hun Manet, who attended US military academy West Point and the University of Bristol, could lead a less repressive regime and be more receptive to Western calls on human rights. However analysts say he has shown no evidence that he may be more open. Hun Sen has also made it clear that he will continue to wield enormous influence over the running of the country.

        "title": "COPF expresses displeasure over absence of Finance Ministry officials",
        "date": "July 26, 2023 07:31 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance chaired by (Dr.) Harsha de Silva expressed displeasure over the absence of the officials responsible who had been summoned before the committee. The committee was of the view that where matters pertaining to the Ministry is taken up for discussions, heads of the Ministry who are responsible and answerable to Parliament should be present before the Committee in order to proceed forth, a statement said. This was stated when the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2023 issued under Section 10 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, by the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies was taken up for consideration at the committee meeting held yesterday (25) in Parliament. MoF presented the fiscal status as of the end of June 2023. According to this report, the primary balance of the budget had a surplus of 0.1. Revenue collection has increased by 41.9 YoY to 1,317 Bn, mainly as a result of the substantial increase in VAT on goods and services. Expenditure for the first half was 2,560 Bn, which witnessed an increase of 40.5 YoY. The biggest increase was in domestic interest expense, which rose by 51.6 to 1,273 Bn in the first half of this year. The Committee members raised various questions regarding the fiscal position, Economic performance, expenditure and the performance of the state-owned enterprises based on the statistics presented by the officials present, the release added. Key concerns raised by the member of COPF were regarding the 11.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee questioned the root causes of such contraction and the specific measures taken to address such root causes preventing further economic downturns The Committee further questioned the sustainable plan of the Ministry to achieve growth in line with the Hon. Presidents vision 2048. Though there was a substantial discussion on the plan for growth to reach a developed country, it was disclosed that there was no coherent strategy. The Committee was of the notion that the response to the Committee queries by the officials who were present, were ineffective and in lacks clarity. The Committee also queried the increase of taxes due naturally to inflation vs policy changes in taxes. Whilst expressing the importance of being prepared with adequate data and statistics when presenting before the Committee, COPF also emphasized that the officials to the Ministry of Finance should be more responsible and have a proper vision along with a focused team to achieve the goal of a sustainable economy. State Ministers (Dr.) Suren Raghavan, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Madhura Withanage, Harshana Rajakaruna, (Dr.) Nalaka Godahewa, Mayantha Dissanayake were present at the Committee meeting held.",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 08:06 pm",
        "content": "During the All-Party Conference at the Presidential Secretariat today (26), President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the significance of discussing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution with all parties, as it is a matter that affects the entire country. He highlighted that a decision on this matter should involve input from all relevant parties. The conference was organized to update the Parliaments party leaders on the National Reconciliation Program and the North-East Development Plan, the PMD reported. President Wickremesinghe recalled that neither he nor the previous seven Executive Presidents had the authority to pass new laws to address existing problems; that power rested solely with the Parliament. He asserted that he was bringing forth relevant proposals for the betterment of the country, but the responsibility of implementing them lay with all the representatives in the Parliament, as he alone couldnt achieve it with his single vote. The President noted that seven out of the nine provincial councils were located in areas with a majority of Sinhalese. If the provincial council system were to be maintained, he emphasized the need to address the shortcomings that had already been experienced. He suggested granting provincial councils powers over subjects currently under the central government, including grassroots activities like agriculture and tourism. According to President Wickremesinghe, the central government should formulate policies for the country, while provincial councils should provide the necessary facilities for the successful implementation of development activities in all fields. Collaboration between all parties and levels of government was crucial for progress and development. In addition, President Ranil Wickremesinghe called for collective discussions among all parties to decide on granting police powers to the Provincial Councils as outlined in the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe proposed arrangements that would allow members of the Provincial Councils to concurrently hold positions and be appointed as Members of Parliament, while members of Parliament could also serve as members of the Provincial Councils. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, former President Maithripala Sirisena, Tamil National Alliance Leader and Member of Parliament R. Sampanthan, M. A. Sumanthiran, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and Member of Parliament Sagara Kariyawasam, as well as other Members of Parliament such as Dullas Alahapperuma, Wimal Weerawansa, Gevindu Kumaratunga, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Udaya Gammanpila, Sarath Weerasekera, Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Weerasumana Weerasinghe, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, C.V.

        "date": "July 26, 2023 09:48 pm",
        "content": "The current foreign policy implemented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the best diplomatic approach put into action in independent Sri Lanka, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said. The State Minister further noted that Sri Lanka stands to gain greatly in the future as a result of President Ranil Wickremesinghes non-aligned foreign policy and his strong cooperation with all countries, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. He expressed these views today (26) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), according to the PMD. State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya further commented; Some earlier governments were accused for maintaining close relationships with China while some were accused for maintaining close ties with the West. Today, such accusations are not made due to the foreign policy of the current government and strong foreign relationships maintained. President Ranil Wickremesinghe follows a non-aligned foreign policy. The close relationship with our neighbour India is very important for us as a country. It will provide strong support for the nations future growth. During President Ranil Wickremesinghes recent visit to India, it was possible to improve the relationship with India. Additionally, there are advantageous aspects between the two nations in terms of investments as well as development projects. 85 of the containers destined for this country go to India. Therefore, we may benefit economically if we negotiate with India and expand the ports that are already in place. Also, a direct ferry service between the two countries as well as the improvement of the Palali airport are under discussion. Attention has also been focused on making Sri Lanka an energy hub. Discussions will be held on how to develop offshore wind energy, solar energy and green energy in the future. Modernizing the Trincomalee Oil Tank Complex and enhancing trade between the two nations have also received attention. The President is scheduled visit China and a number of countries in the future. We should also improve our relations with regionally powerful countries. Until now, only policies to develop political relations with countries were implemented through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But in the same way, the government is currently focusing on how to develop economic and social relations with other countries in the world. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is working closely with all countries through a non-aligned foreign policy. We have been successful in obtaining international support as a country. The current foreign policy can be called the best era of foreign relations in Sri Lankas history. This makes it possible for the country to grow while maintaining close ties with the international community.",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis government will face a no-confidence vote in parliament amid deadlock with the opposition over violence in the state of Manipur. A lawmaker from the opposition Congress party tabled a no-confidence motion on Wednesday. Mr Modis government wont lose the vote as his party and its allies have a clear majority in parliament. But opposition leaders say the move will force Mr Modi to speak on Manipur. They have been demanding that he address parliament on ethnic clashes in the state which broke out in May between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority. At least 130 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in the violence. Last week, a video that showed two women being paraded naked by a mob had sparked global outrage and condemnation. It also forced Mr Modi to break his silence on Manipur: he said that the incident had shamed India and that the attackers wouldnt be spared. Federal home minister Amit Shah told the Lok Sabha - the lower house of parliament - earlier this week that the government was ready to discuss the violence and accused the opposition of preventing this. This is the second time that Mr Modis government is facing a no-confidence motion since it came to power in 2014. In 2018, a lawmaker had moved a motion over the issue of granting a special category status to Andhra Pradesh state. It was defeated after a 12-hour debate. A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha and will be accepted if at least 50 lawmakers support it. Once accepted, the speaker will announce a date for a vote within 10 days. If the government is unable to prove its majority, it will have to resign. On Wednesday, two motions were moved by MPs from the Congress party and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi - the first was accepted. Speaker Om Birla said he would announce a date for the debate and vote after speaking with leaders of all parties. We are well aware that the numbers are not in our favour, Manoj K Jha, an opposition MP, said on Wednesday. But it is not about the numbers, the PM will have to speak in parliament following a no-confidence motion. The opposition was forced to move the no-confidence motion as it was the last weapon, Congress leader Manickam Tagore said. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Mutinous soldiers claim to have overthrown Nigers president",
        "date": "July 27, 2023 07:46 am",
        "content": "NIAMEY, Niger (AP)  Mutinous soldiers claimed to have overthrown Nigers democratically elected president, announcing on state television late Wednesday that they have put an end to the government over the African countrys deteriorating security. The soldiers said all institutions had been suspended and security forces were managing the situation. They urged external partners not to interfere. The announcement came after a day of uncertainty as members of Nigers presidential guard surrounded the presidential palace and detained President Mohamed Bazoum. It was unclear where the president was at the time of the announcement or if he had resigned. This is as a result of the continuing degradation of the security situation, the bad economic and social governance, air force Col. Major Amadou Abdramane said on the video. Seated at a table in front of nine other officers, he said aerial and land borders were closed and a curfew was imposed until the situation stabilized. The group, which is calling itself National Council for the Safeguarding of the Country, said it remained committed to its engagements with the international and national community. Earlier Wednesday, a tweet from the account of Nigers presidency reported that members of the elite guard unit engaged in an anti-Republican demonstration and unsuccessfully tried to obtain support from other security forces. It said Bazoum and his family were doing well but that Nigers army and national guard are ready to attack if those involved in the action did not back down. The commissions of the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States described the events as an effort to unseat Bazoum, who was elected president two years ago in the nations first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since its independence from France in 1960. Threats to Bazoums leadership would undermine the Wests efforts to stabilize Africas Sahel region, which has been overrun with coups in recent years. Mali and Burkina Faso have had four coups since 2020, and both are being overrun by extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. U.S. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Niger in March, seeking to strengthen ties with a country where extremists have carried out attacks on civilians and military personnel but the overall security situation was not as dire as in neighboring nations. During a stop in New Zealand on Thursday, Blinken repeated the U.S. condemnation of the mutiny against Nigers president and said his team was in close contact with officials in France and Africa. Blinken added that he had spoken with Bazoum on Wednesday, saying that he made clear that we strongly support him as the democratically elected president of the country. Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, said the mutiny was a nightmare scenario for Western powers who had betted on Bazoum and Niger as new security anchor for the Sahel. It remains to be seen whether this is the last word. Parts of the army are probably still loyal to Bazoum. They benefited much from equipment and training as part of foreign military assistance, Laessing said. Before the announcement, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital, Niamey, and chanted No coup detat while marching in support of the president. Multiple rounds of gunfire that appeared to come from the presidential palace dispersed the demonstrators and sent people scrambling for cover, according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene. We are here to show the people that we are not happy about this movement going on, just to show these military people that they cant just take the power like this, protester Mohammed Sidi said. We are a democratic country, we support democracy and we dont need this kind of movement. The international community strongly condemned the attempted seizure of power. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Bazoum on Wednesday afternoon and expressed his full support and solidarity, the U.N. spokesperson tweeted. Earlier, Guterres condemned any effort to seize power by force in the strongest terms and called on all actors involved to exercise restraint and to ensure the protection of constitutional order, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The governments of France and the United States also voiced concern and urged the participating guardsmen to change course. Bazoums administration has made Niger a key Western partner in the fight against Islamist extremism in Africas Sahel region. We strongly condemn any effort to detain or subvert the functioning of Nigers democratically elected government, led by President Bazoum, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. We specifically urge elements of the presidential guard to release President Bazoum from detention and refrain from violence. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who was selected this month as the ECOWAS Commissions chairman, said the regional blocs leadership would resist any attempt to unseat Nigers government. It should be quite clear to all players in the Republic of Niger that the leadership of the ECOWAS region and all lovers of democracy around the world will not tolerate any situation that incapacitates the democratically elected government of the country, Tinubu said in a statement he issued in Abuja. We will do everything within our powers to ensure democracy is firmly planted, nurtured, well rooted and thrives in our region. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "State Minister Suren Raghavan says there was a conflict of opinions among the Tamil political parties during the all-party conference chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday (July 26). The conference was organized to update the parliaments political party leaders on the National Reconciliation Program and the North-East Development Plan. All political parties with representation in the parliament except the National Peoples Power (NPP) were in attendance. Commenting on the meeting, Raghavan said the Tamil political party leaders did not have a common consensus about what they truly want. According to the lawmaker, MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, C. V. Vigneswaran and other Tamil parliamentarians were of conflicting opinions about the 13 Amendment to the Constitution, local government elections and devolution of power to the Tamil community. Urging Tamil political party members to reach common ground soon, the state minister underscored the importance of unity if the country is to ride out the crisis. A multitude of problems facing both the North and South stand to be resolved once the economy recovers, he pointed out. Hinting at another all-party conference next month, Raghavan expressed hopes about reaching a more clear and consensual position there. During the course of the all-party conference convened at the Presidential Secretariat, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the significance of discussing the 13th constitutional amendment with all parties, as it is a matter that affects the entire country. The Head of State, noting that seven out of the nine provincial councils are located in areas with a majority of Sinhalese, said if the provincial council system were to be maintained, the shortcomings that had already been experienced should be addressed first.

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said the President should take notes from the past when searching for answers to issues such as the 13th constitutional amendment. The general secretary of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said the government MPs have no common consensus about the 13th constitutional amendment, while Tamil National Alliance MP Sumanthiran rejected the solution proposed by the President with regard to the much-talked-about constitutional amendment.",

        "content": "Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage, the newly-appointed Ambassador of Sri Lanka to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), has presented credentials to ASEAN Secretary-General Dr. Kao Kim Hourn on Wednesday (July 26). Prof. Colombage and Dr. Kao have discussed ways and means to further enhance ASEAN-Sri Lanka relations to bring about more benefits to their people. The ASEAN chief also commended the efforts taken by Sri Lanka to overcome the economic challenges. The ambassador highlighted Sri Lankas Look East policy, current activities of Sri Lanka with the member states of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to join RCEP, and Sri Lankas interest in becoming Sectoral Dialogue Partner in ASEAN, especially in ASEAN Maritime Outlook and Blue Economy. The ASEAN chief meanwhile appreciated the efforts taken by Sri Lanka to overcome the economic challenges and emphasized that Sri Lanka plays a critical role in ASEAN Regional Forum while engaging in a friendly relationship with all countries. Further, the Secretary-General appraised Sri Lankas interest in becoming Sectoral Dialogue Partner in ASEAN. Last month, the ASEAN chief, during a meeting with Sri Lankan presidential secretariat delegation, hinted at the possibility of Sri Lanka joining the worlds largest trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement. The RCEP encompasses the 10 ASEAN member states, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. All these countries represent 32 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP).",

        "title": "Sinéad OConnor, gifted and provocative Irish singer-songwriter, dies at 56",
        "date": "July 27, 2023 11:52 am",
        "content": "Sinéad OConnor, the gifted Irish singer-songwriter who became a superstar in her mid-20s and was known as much for her private struggles and provocative actions as for her fierce and expressive music, has died at 56. It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad. Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time, the singers family said in a statement reported Wednesday by the BBC and RTE. No cause was disclosed. She was public about her mental illness, saying that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. OConnor posted a Facebook video in 2017 from a New Jersey motel where she had been living, saying that she was staying alive for the sake of others and that if it were up to her, shed be gone. When her teenage son Shane died by suicide last year, OConnor tweeted there was no point living without him and she was soon hospitalized. Her final tweet, sent July 17, read: For all mothers of Suicided children, and linked to a Tibetan compassion mantra. Recognizable by her shaved head and with a multi-octave mezzo soprano of extraordinary emotional range, OConnor began her career singing on the streets of Dublin and soon rose to international fame. She was a star from her 1987 debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, and became a sensation in 1990 with her cover of Princes ballad Nothing Compares 2 U, a seething, shattering performance that topped charts from Europe to Australia and was heightened by a promotional video featuring the gray-eyed OConnor in intense close-up. She was a lifelong non-conformist  she said she shaved her head in response to record executives pressuring her to be conventionally glamorous  but her political and cultural stances and troubled private life often overshadowed her music. A critic of the Roman Catholic Church well before allegations of sexual abuse were widely reported, OConnor made headlines in October 1992 when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing on NBCs Saturday Night Live and denounced the church as the enemy. The next week, Joe Pesci hosted Saturday Night Live, held up a repaired photo of the Pope and said if he had been on the show with OConnor he would have gave her such a smack. Days later, she appeared at an all-star tribute for Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden and was immediately booed. She was supposed to sing Dylans I Believe in You, but switched to an a cappella version of Bob Marleys War, which she had sung on Saturday Night Live. Although consoled and encouraged on stage by her friend Kris Kristofferson, she left and broke down, and her performance was kept off the concert CD. (Years later, Kristofferson recorded Sister Sinead, for which he wrote, And maybe shes crazy and maybe she aintBut so was Picasso and so were the saints.) She also feuded with Frank Sinatra over her refusal to allow the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner at one of her shows and accused Prince of physically threatening her. In 1989 she declared her support for the Irish Republican Army, a statement she retracted a year later. Around the same time, she skipped the Grammy ceremony, saying it was too commercialized. In 1999, OConnor caused uproar in Ireland when she became a priestess of the breakaway Latin Tridentine Church  a position that was not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. For many years, she called for a full investigation into the extent of the churchs role in concealing child abuse by clergy. In 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI apologized to Ireland to atone for decades of abuse, OConnor condemned the apology for not going far enough and called for Catholics to boycott Mass until there was a full investigation into the Vaticans role. People assumed I didnt believe in God. Thats not the case at all. Im Catholic by birth and culture and would be the first at the church door if the Vatican offered sincere reconciliation, she wrote in the Washington Post in 2010. OConnor announced in 2018 that she had converted to Islam and would be adopting the name Shuhada Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat  although she continued to use Sinéad OConnor professionally. Her music was loved around the world and her talent was unmatched and beyond compare, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement on social media. OConnor was born on Dec. 8, 1966. She had a difficult childhood, with a mother she alleged was abusive and encouraged her to shoplift. As a teenager she spent time in a church-sponsored institution for girls, where she said she washed priests clothes for no wages. But a nun gave OConnor her first guitar, and soon she sang and performed on the streets of Dublin, her influences ranging from Dylan to Siouxsie and the Banshees. Her performance with a local band caught the eye of a small record label, and, in 1987, OConnor released, The Lion and the Cobra, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies and featured the hit Mandinka, driven by a hard-rock guitar riff and OConnors piercing vocals. OConnor, then 20 and pregnant, co-produced the album. I suppose Ive got to say that music saved me, she said in an interview with the Independent newspaper in 2013. I didnt have any other abilities, and there was no learning support for girls like me, not in Ireland at that time. It was either jail or music. I got lucky. Nothing Compares 2 U received three Grammy nominations and was the featured track on her acclaimed album, I Do Not Want What I Havent Got, which helped lead Rolling Stone to name her Artist of the Year in 1991. She proved that a recording artist could refuse to compromise and still connect with millions of listeners hungry for music of substance, the magazine declared. OConnors other musical credits included the albums, Universal Mother and Faith and Courage, a cover of Cole Porters You Do Something to Me, from the AIDS fundraising album Red Hot  Blue, and backing vocals on Peter Gabriels Blood of Eden. She received eight Grammy nominations and in 1991 won for best alternative musical performance. OConnor announced she was retiring from music in 2003, but continued to record new material. Her most recent album was  Im Not Bossy, Im the Boss, released in 2014 and she sang the theme song for Season 7 of Outlander. The singer married four times; her union to drug counsellor Barry Herridge, in 2011, lasted just 16 days. OConnor had four children: Jake, with her husband John Reynolds; Roisin, with John Waters; Shane, with Donal Lunny; and Yeshua Bonadio, with Frank Bonadio. In 2014, she said she was joining the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party and called for its leaders to step aside so that a younger generation of activists could take over. She later withdrew her application. Singer Tori Amos was among the many musicians who paid tribute to OConnor on Wednesday, calling her a force of nature. Such passion, such intense presence and a beautiful soul, who battled her own personal demons courageously, Amos said. Be at peace dear Sinead, you will forever be in our hearts.

The arrested mother-of-three is a resident of the Marapola area, the police said. The police have taken custody of 1 gram and 400 milligrams of heroin, 06 national identity cards, 05 passports and 08 mobile phones which were found inside the loft built on the tree. Investigations have revealed that the suspected woman has run the drug racket from the loft made of logs and planks on top of a huge tree in a forested area adjacent to her house, to make sure no one can see it. She has sent the drugs down from the loft after money was put in a bag and sent up with the help of a rope, according to police. Police also mentioned that the loft atop the tree in question has provided a range of vision to conduct long-distance observations.",

        "title": "15 Sri Lankans among victims rescued in intl operation against human trafficking",
        "date": "July 27, 2023 12:51 pm",
        "content": "INTERPOL and AFRIPOLs first joint operation against human trafficking and migrant smuggling resulted in more than 1,000 arrests worldwide and thousands of victims detected. Coordinated with the participation of law enforcement in 54 countries, operation FLASH-WEKA took place in two phases between May and June to dismantle the organized crime networks behind human trafficking and migrant smuggling in Africa and beyond. Using INTERPOLs global criminal databases, local law enforcement worked with INTERPOL and AFRIPOL to locate, intercept and stop criminals operating across borders. Human trafficking and migrant smuggling are often part of a wider and more complex criminal chain. This is why close cooperation between INTERPOL and AFRIPOL is so important in uniting our resources to dismantle these networks and ultimately identify and rescue thousands of unsuspecting victims, said INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock. The leads generated by Operation FLASH-WEKA will no doubt result in further arrests, bringing to justice those who traffic in human misery, added Secretary General Stock. Widespread trafficking across West Africa FLASH-WEKA revealed an increase in online recruitment through e-commerce platforms such as Q.Net, with networks identified in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte dIvoire, Ghana, Guinea and Mali. Police in Yaoundé rescued victims involved in a Q.Net pyramid scheme, detaining the suspected perpetrators at Cameroons INTERPOL National Central Bureau Command Post where investigations are ongoing. Intelligence received in Sierra Leone via INTERPOL triggered a police raid rescuing 15 suspected trafficking victims, all men from Sri Lanka. During a raid in a hotel in Lomé, Togo authorities rescued. 30 victims of human trafficking recruited in Nigeria for sexual exploitation. Two cases of sports-related human trafficking were detected in two countries where recruiters had lured victims to Gulf countries with false promises of registration with football academies. The real strength of FLASH-WEKA lies in the tight union between our two Organizations and member countries which together form a formidable alliance against the forces of darkness that exploit peoples hopes and aspirations, said AFRIPOL Executive Director Jalel Chelba. Through better intelligence sharing, collaborative efforts by law enforcement agencies and comprehensive victim support, we aim to dismantle the networks that profit from the desperation of others. We will bring light to the shadows, uncovering hidden routes and bringing perpetrators to justice, added Mr Chelba. Preventing the Mediterranean crossing Sahel operations focused on the prevention of migrant smuggling across the Mediterranean towards Europe. Eight Moroccan men were detected with a rubber boat and life jackets preparing for an illegal crossing to Spain. In Tunisia, investigations into a damaged boat discovered 80 miles off the coast of Kerkennah revealed the vessel had capsized between Italy and Libya with 59 passengers on board, including children, from a wide range of countries including Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan and Syria. Beyond Africa Many of the cases detected during FLASH-WEKA involved victims from Asia, particularly Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In Angola seven Vietnamese women recruited online with promises of work in hotels and beauty salons were rescued from their trafficker, also from Vietnam, who forced them to work in the sex industry. Authorities in Iraq arrested nine suspects thought to be involved in organ trafficking cases. Syrian police rescued an underage girl and arrested two men for her suspected trafficking for sexual exploitation. Confirming the severity of a growing global trend, Operation FLASH-WEKA unveiled several cases of large-scale human trafficking involving victims who would start online jobs and end up forced to commit cyber-enabled financial crime on an industrial scale. A collaborative operation INTERPOLs Regional Bureaus in Harare, Abidjan and Yaoundé each hosted an Operational Coordination Unit during the operation, with round-the-clock support from the Organizations Command and Coordination Centre. INTERPOL and AFRIPOL officials were deployed into the field to support local law enforcement in Côte dIvoire, Ghana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles. FLASH-WEKA is funded by the German Federal Foreign Office, the European Commission, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Other organizations supporting FLASH-WEKA include Europol, IOM and ROCK (Regional Operational Center in Khartoum in support of the Khartoum Process and AU-Horn of Africa initiative). The operation was coordinated with the help of INTERPOLs Support Programme for the African Union which assists AFRIPOL in developing its strategic framework and operational functions across the continent. Law enforcement agencies in the following countries took part in FLASH-WEKA: Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina-Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Congo DRC, Côte dIvoire, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Greece, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Iraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Zambia and Zimbabwe. --Interpol--",

        "date": "July 27, 2023 01:22 pm",
        "content": "Highlighting the significance of establishing a Truth-Seeking Commission to address the ethnic problems impact on affected communities, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has stressed that the commission should operate independently, with the governments role limited to providing necessary support and facilities. Briefing trade unions and civil organizations on the Truth-Finding Commission at a discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (26 July), Sabry acknowledged the importance of an internationally recognized accountability process and assured that the government is committed to creating such a mechanism. He further pledged to take all essential steps to instill confidence in the truth-seeking commission. Director General of Trade Unions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe Saman Ratnapriya, who also expressed his views at the event, pointed out that the three-decade-long war had caused extensive damage throughout the country as a whole, and there is a pressing need for a thorough investigation. He noted that previous commissions proposals on this matter were not adequately implemented, leading to the consideration of models from countries like South Africa to devise a suitable mechanism for Sri Lanka. Ratnapriya further emphasised that informing society about the commission and garnering support for its implementation is vital to prevent the country from facing further difficulties. Also addressing the event, Director General of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Asanga Gunawansa drew attention to Singapores remarkable transformation into a developed country through reconciliation, two decades after gaining independence. He underscored that reconciliation is an indispensable factor for Sri Lankas own development, highlighting the commissions potential to create an environment where the unfortunate past would not be repeated. Accordingly, an Interim Secretariat with three divisions, namely the Legal and Policy Division, Public Relations Division, along with the Information Technology Division, have been set up in a bid to support the establishment of this commission and contribute to a locally effective and internationally recognized mechanism. The event witnessed the participation of numerous representatives from trade unions and civil organizations.",

        "title": "Singapore to execute a woman for first time in 20 years",
        "date": "July 27, 2023 02:09 pm",
        "content": "Singapore is scheduled to execute a woman for the first time in almost 20 years, human rights advocates say. Singaporean national Saridewi Djamani, 45, was found guilty of trafficking 30g (1.06oz) of heroin in 2018. She will be the second drug convict to be executed in three days, after fellow Singaporean Mohd Aziz bin Hussain, and the 15th since March 2022. Singapore has some of the worlds toughest anti-drug laws, which it says are necessary to protect society. Aziz was convicted of trafficking 50g of heroin. Under Singapore law, the death penalty can be applied for trafficking of more than 15g of heroin and more than 500g of cannabis. Last April, another Singaporean, Tangaraju Suppiah, was executed for trafficking 1kg (35oz) of cannabis that he never touched. Authorities say he co-ordinated the sale via mobile phone. Singapores Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) declined to comment on Djamanis case when contacted by the BBC. In an earlier statement, the CNB said Aziz was accorded full due process, and that his appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed in 2018. British billionaire Sir Richard Branson, has again criticised Singapore for its executions, saying the death penalty is not a deterrent against crime. Small-scale drug traffickers need help, as most are bullied due to their circumstances, Mr Branson said on Twitter. It is not too late to stop Saridewis execution, he said. Saridewi is one of two women on death row in Singapore, according to the Transformative Justice Collective, a Singapore-based human rights group. She will be the first woman executed by the city-state since hairdresser Yen May Woen in 2004, the group said. Yen was also convicted of drug trafficking. Local media reported that Saridewi testified during her trial that she was stocking up on heroin for personal use during the Islamic fasting month. While she did not deny selling drugs such as heroin and methamphetamine from her flat, she downplayed the scale of those activities, noted judge See Kee Oon. Authorities argue that strict drug laws help keep Singapore as one of the safest places in the world and that capital punishment for drug offences enjoys wide public support. But anti-death penalty advocates refute this. There is no evidence that the death penalty has a unique deterrent effect or that it has any impact on the use and availability of drugs, said Amnesty Internationals Chiara Sangiorgio in a statement. The only message that these executions send is that the government of Singapore is willing to once again defy international safeguards on the use of the death penalty, she said. Amnesty International noted that alongside China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Singapore is one of only four countries to have recently carried out drug-related executions. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 27, 2023 03:18 pm",
        "content": "Myanmars ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved to house arrest after the military detained her following a coup in February 2021. Ms Suu Kyi was taken to a government building in Nay Pyi Taw on Monday, prison sources told BBC Burmese. Shed spent a year in solitary confinement. The 78-year-old is serving a 33-year sentence, after being jailed in closed-door, military-run trials. Almost no news has emerged about her condition in more than two years. There has been no public confirmation of her transfer from jail, but the move to house arrest could be a positive sign from the military authorities, who have faced numerous calls to release the countrys democratically-elected leader. Ms Suu Kyi was rumoured to have been ill, but the military has denied the reports. Earlier this week a source from the Nay Pyi Taw prison where she was being held told BBC Burmese that she was in good health. Thailands foreign minister also revealed this month that he had visited Ms Suu Kyi - however he disclosed no further detail. The military has arranged a meeting between Ms Suu Kyi and T Khun Myat, the Speaker of the lower house of parliament, BBC Burmese reported. However no details have been confirmed. Since the coup, Myanmar has spiralled into a civil war, which has killed thousands of people. Sanctions imposed on the military have failed to stop the violence. The 78-year-old Nobel laureate was under house arrest until June this year, when she was moved to solitary confinement in a prison in the countrys capital. She denies all of the accusations and rights groups have condemned the court trials as a sham. The daughter of independence hero General Aung San, she emerged as a leader of the pro-democracy movement against the military dictatorship. She co-founded the National League for Democracy (NLD), but was put under house arrest in 1989. Awarded the Nobel peace prize, Ms Suu Kyi was one of the worlds leading democracy icons. Her release from detention in 2010 was celebrated in Myanmar and around the world. But she was later criticised for defending her country against allegations of genocide at the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ) after widespread claims that Myanmar had committed atrocities against Muslim Rohingya while her government was in power. Nearly a million of them have fled Myanmar in recent years, and now live as refugees in neighbouring Bangladesh. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 27, 2023 03:32 pm",
        "content": "Kuwait said Thursday it executed five prisoners, including a convicted drug dealer from Sri Lanka and an inmate convicted over the bombing of a Shiite mosque in 2015 that killed 27 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group, foreign media reported. The inmates were hanged at the Central Prison, Kuwaits Public Prosecution said in a statement. Prosecutors said the five include the mosque attacker, three people convicted of murder and a convicted drug dealer. One of the convicted murderers was Egyptian, another was Kuwaiti, and the convicted drug dealer was from Sri Lanka, AP reports. The statement didnt provide the nationality of the mosque attacker or the third convicted murderer, saying only that they were in Kuwait unlawfully. The 2015 bombing occurred during midday Friday prayers inside one of Kuwaits oldest Shiite mosques. The Islamic State group, which at the time controlled large areas in both Syria and Iraq, claimed the attack. The Sunni extremist group views Shiites as apostates deserving of death. It was the first militant attack in Kuwait, a small oil-rich country, in more than two decades. The attack was likely intended to foment unrest between Kuwaits Sunni and Shiite populations, but instead it backfired, reawakening a sense of national solidarity not seen since Saddam Husseins 1990 invasion. The extremist group no longer controls any territory following a grueling military campaign by an array of forces, but continues to carry out sporadic attacks in Syria and Iraq. It also boasts affiliates in several Asian and African countries. Executions are relatively rare in Kuwait, which put seven inmates to death last November. Before that, the last one was in 2017, when it executed seven prisoners, including a ruling family member. --Agencies--",

        "title": "Climate change: July set to be worlds warmest month on record",
        "date": "July 28, 2023 08:50 am",
        "content": "Amid blistering heatwaves, July is virtually certain to be the worlds warmest month on record, say scientists. So hot has the month been to date that researchers are confident the 2019 record will be broken, even with several days to go. UN chief Antonio Guterres said the planet is entering an era of global boiling. Scientists agree the extra heat is mainly linked to fossil fuel use. US President Joe Biden described climate change as an existential threat and that no one can deny the impact of climate change anymore. Some experts believe that July might well be the warmest month in the past 120,000 years. Researchers are not surprised that July is set to break the current record for the warmest month as there have been plenty of indications in recent weeks that the world is seeing far greater levels of heating. The worlds warmest day occurred on July 6, and the hottest 23 days ever recorded were all this month, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Their provisional average temperature for the first 25 days of the month is 16.95C, which is well above the 16.63C figure for the whole of July 2019. Other analysis has come to the same conclusion. Dr Karsten Haustein from the University of Leipzig has calculated that July 2023 will be 1.3C-1.7C above the average July temperatures recorded before the widespread use of fossil fuels. The best guess is around 1.5C. Hes confident that even if the last few days are cooler, the margin of error is enough to make July the hottest yet seen. Not only will it be the warmest July, but the warmest month ever in terms of absolute global mean temperature, he said in a statement. We may have to go back thousands if not tens of thousands of years to find similarly warm conditions on our planet. Researchers work out the global air temperature by taking readings from weather stations dotted around the world. However, there are not enough stations to give a completely accurate global picture so scientists feed all of these readings - plus some measurements from the atmosphere itself - into computer models. These allow scientists to create a map without gaps, meaning the global temperature can be reliably estimated. By combining these datasets with global weather forecasts for the next few days, scientists can come up with a reliable estimate of the global temperature even before the end of the month. While July is likely to be the warmest in records dating back around 150 years or so, some researchers believe the final temperature may be the warmest in tens of thousands of years. To work out these ancient figures, scientists use records like the air trapped in polar ice cores, or sediments in the deep ocean. These capture a signal of the climate at the time. From this evidence, while scientists cant pinpoint specific months going that far back, they say the last time the world was similarly warm was about 120,000 years ago - when sea levels were around 8m higher than today, and hippos were present as far north as Britain. Why are these records happening? Researchers are confident that emissions of fossil fuels from human activities are mostly to blame for the levels of warming we are now seeing. The extreme weather which has affected many millions of people in July is unfortunately the harsh reality of climate change and a foretaste of the future, said the World Meteorological Organizations Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is more urgent than ever before, he said. Climate action is not a luxury but a must. Experts believe that Julys temperature record will not be the last one broken this year. As well as the ongoing impact of greenhouse gases, theres the growing effect of the El Niño weather system - a natural event where oceans warm in the east Pacific and release heat into the atmosphere. This is likely to push temperatures even higher and may make 2023 or 2024 the warmest year yet recorded, because scientists warn were yet to see its full impacts. There are other factors that have might have added to global temperatures. New shipping rules have led to a smaller amount of pollutants being released, and until recently levels of Saharan dust in the atmosphere have been low. These airborne particles, called aerosols, typically reflect some of the suns energy back into space - although the science is very complicated. Its thought that having less of these aerosols may have made a small contribution to record North Atlantic heat. The eruption of an underwater volcano in Tonga in 2022 has also added to the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which heats the planet like carbon dioxide. What does this mean for the Paris agreement? In 2015, nearly 200 countries signed up to the Paris climate agreement. They pledged to try to keep long-term global temperature rises to 1.5C above the pre-industrial period - before humans started burning fossil fuels at scale. Scientists caution that while the July temperatures are worrying, extreme temperatures in a single month dont mean that international climate agreements have been broken. That does not mean we reach or breach the Paris goal or 1.5C because that is understood as the long-term increase in global warming, explains Dr Friederike Otto, a climate scientist from Imperial College London. Limiting warming to 1.5C is seen as key to avoiding the most dangerous impacts of climate change. But as the recent heatwaves have shown, the consequences of climate change increase with every fraction of a degree of warming. While southern Europe has been experiencing intense heat, the UK has been considerably milder. This is linked to the position of the jet stream, according to weather experts. But the Met Office warned today that the UK can expect to see warmer temperatures in years to come due to the ongoing rise in global temperatures. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 28, 2023 03:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka tops the list of nations that may host a Chinese naval base in the coming years as Beijing seeks to expand its maritime capabilities, according to a new report. The South Asian nations Hambantota port is the most likely spot for a base given the US2.19 billion China has already invested there, according to an assessment by the AidData research project at William  Mary university in Virginia. Sites in Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and Cameroon were listed as the next possibilities over the next two to five years. Chinas single largest port investment anywhere is at Hambantota, and Beijing exercises direct control over the facility, said AidData, which released the report on Thursday (July 27). Coupled with its strategic location, the popularity of China among elites and the population, and Sri Lankas alignment with China in UNGA voting, Hambantota is our top candidate for a future base. For years, observers have tried to parse the extent that China uses its economic clout to advance its military ambitions. The Asian nation has the worlds largest navy by number of warships, and its construction and engineering companies are busy building port facilities around the world. It provided loans and grants worth nearly US30 billion from 2000-2021 to build or expand 78 ports in 46 countries, the AidData report said. Despite frequent speculation about Chinese bases in the works, Beijing has established just one overseas military facility, in the East African nation of Djibouti. AidData said China invested 466 million in the Djibouti facility from 2000-2021, placing it No. 12 on its list. Still, the Pentagon has raised concern that it was considering more overseas military logistics facilities in locations including Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan. The US also identified a military facility in Cambodia that it says will be Chinas first overseas base in the Indo-Pacific region, something the government in Phnom Penh has repeatedly denied. The Defense Ministry in Beijing didnt immediately respond to a request for comment about the AidData report. Commercial imagery company BlackSky, said this week that recent photos showed a China-funded naval base in Cambodia has neared completion. The facility includes new piers able to support aircraft carriers. Leaders in Colombo have said they wont allow the Hambantota port to host any foreign armed forces. A Chinese entity took over the facility in 2017 when Sri Lanka couldnt repay the loans that helped build it. AidData also said that China could pursue a base in Gwadar, Pakistan, citing the two nations close ties. The report also found a high concentration of Chinese port investments in Africa, ranking Bata, Equatorial Guinea, as the second most likely spot for a naval base after Beijing committed 659 million to a port there.

        "date": "July 28, 2023 06:32 pm",
        "content": "A Niger general, Abdourahamane Tiani, appeared on state television as the countrys new leader following a military coup that sparked international condemnation. Tiani appeared on Télé Sahel with a banner identifying him as President of the national council for the preservation of the fatherland. The appearance comes a day after the West African countrys military endorsed the leaders behind the toppling of President Mohamed Bazoums government. Tiani said in the broadcast that Wednesdays coup was motivated by both the desire to preserve our homeland in a context of a deteriorating security situation, and poor economic and social governance. Nigers former government, he said, did not give Nigeriens a glimpse of a real way out of the (security) crisis. On Thursday, the Nigerien army command said it was supporting the seizure in a bid to thwart bloodshed. The militarys statement also warned against foreign military intervention, which it said risks having disastrous and uncontrolled consequences. Bazoum was reportedly detained two days ago by members of his own presidential guard. International condemnation Niger lies at the heart of Africas Sahel region, which has seen numerous power grabs in recent years including in Mali and Burkina Faso. A key ally of the United States, France and other Western governments, Niger had been one of the few democracies in a region fraught with Islamist insurgencies. The ongoing situation unfolding in Niger in recent days has prompted swift condemnation from the global community. French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that the coup was deeply dangerous for Niger and the whole region, and called for Bazoums release. Macron, who was on an overseas trip to Papua New Guinea Friday and spoke at a press conference alongside the prime minister, described Bazoum as a courageous leader who is making the reforms and investments that his country needs. He added that France  once Nigers colonial ruler  would support regional organizations should they decide to impose sanctions against the putsch leaders. He also confirmed that he had spoken with the Nigerien president several times since he was detained. Frances foreign minister Catherine Colonna said Friday the coup was not final and there was still a way out of the current crisis for coup leaders if they listen to the international community. Bazoums whereabouts unknown The presidents whereabouts remain unknown, though Macron is one of several global leaders who have said theyve been in contact with him since he was taken into custody. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke with Bazoum to express her strong support for the democratically-elected leader, the spokesperson for the US Mission to the United Nations said. Bazoum is feeling well, Chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said after speaking with him, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Mahamat added that Nigerian mediators are in Niger for talks with rebels. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also said he had spoken with Bazoum to convey to him all our solidarity. Bazoum took office in 2021 in the countrys first democratic transfer of power was following years of military coups. Niger has experienced four takeovers since its independence from France in 1960. The hard-won achievements will be safeguarded. All Nigeriens who love democracy and freedom will see to it, Nigers presidential office tweeted on Thursday, after the coup was announced late Wednesday night. A man identified as Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane appeared in the video, flanked by several apparent soldiers, and announced: We have decided to put an end to the regime that you know. Abdramane later said all activities of political parties had been suspended until the new order. Source - CNN - Agencies",

Members of the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild are striking in the biggest walkout for 60 years. It means those in the unions cant work or do any publicity, so cant appear at awards shows. A new date for the 2023 ceremony has not been confirmed, but organisers want to wait until an agreement has been reached with TV companies. An Emmy is the most prestigious US prize in television, with Succession, The Last of Us, The White Lotus and Ted Lasso leading this years nominees. The WGA and Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) are currently trying to negotiate with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over a number of issues, including the use of Artificial Intelligence in productions and a fair split of profits in the age of streaming. The 75th Emmy Awards were originally scheduled for 18 September but could have played out to an empty room with no host. WGA writers are also often employed to write material for hosts and presenters too, meaning it be almost impossible for a show to go ahead. This is the first time the Emmys have been postponed in more than 20 years - the last time was in response to the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001. Voting in the awards is still set to go ahead in the coming weeks, but whether they awards will actually be handed out remains to be seen. The Creative Arts Emmys are also likely to be postponed from early September, which celebrate artistic and technical achievements in television. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The Australian Defence Force MRH-90 Taipan helicopter crashed into waters off the northeastern state of Queensland at around 10:30pm on Friday (12:30 GMT), Defence Minister Richard Marles said. The families of the four aircrew have been notified of this incident and our hopes and thoughts are very much with the aircrew and their families, Marles said We desperately hope for better news during the course of this day. The aircraft had been taking part in the Talisman Sabre, a joint Australia-US military exercise involving 13 countries, including Japan, France and Germany, and more than 30,000 personnel. Officials have not offered a cause for the incident or indicated when the exercises might resume. Searches for the missing aircrew have been under way since overnight. Brigadier Damian Hill said the exercises had been paused to allow participants to reach out and let their families know what is going on. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is in Australia with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks, paid tribute to the missing aircrew. Its always tough when you have accidents in training, but  the reason that we train to such high standards is so that we can be successful, and we can protect lives when we are called to answer any kind of crisis, Austin said. Our guys tend to make this look easy and they make it look easy because theyre so well exercised and rehearsed and trained, and this is unfortunately a part of that, what it takes to get them to where we need them to be, Austin added.

        "content": "Sri Lanka was looking to explore new areas of cooperation with Egypt as the countries sought to take bilateral relations to the next level, a top foreign ministry official said on Thursday. To prepare the ground for revisiting existing agreements and consolidating ties, the two nations held consultations in Colombo last week, with Sri Lankas State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya and Egypts Assistant Minister for Asian Affairs Ayman Kamel co-chairing the sessions. Mohammed Jauhar, additional secretary for Africa at the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Arab News there were many unexplored areas of cooperation between the countries and those discussed during the consultations included judicial and legal matters, maritime transport, youth and sports, defense, and cooperation in the apparel industry. We have a longstanding bilateral relationship between the two countries, and we could take them to new heights if we are able to implement the proposals made at the recent bilateral talks in Colombo, he said. Relations are to be elevated to the next level in all areas, including in economic and trade cooperation. Sri Lanka and Egypt have also discussed working together on global issues such as climate change, food security, and debt restructuring. State minister Balasuriya emphasized the importance of deepening the engagement in political and economic cooperation and in the cultural sphere, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Egypt was the first Arab country to open an embassy in Sri Lanka in 1957, and relations between the two nations flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, when both were involved in the Non-Aligned Movement.

        "content": "Foreign Minister of Japan Hayashi Yoshimasa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (July 29) engaged in discussions concerning the bilateral relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka, with a mutual commitment to further strengthen their traditionally robust ties. The visiting Japanese minister paid a courtesy call to President Wickremesinghe in Colombo earlier today. President Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to the Japanese Government for their support in the debt restructuring process and shared the details of French President Emmanuel Macrons offer, aiming to play a pivotal role in enhancing the common platform for debt restructuring and expediting the process. Another significant aspect of their talks revolved around key areas of cooperation, namely the Light Rail Transit (LRT), the East Terminal, the Kandy Development Plan, Central Highway, and the expansion of the Bandaranaike International Airport, according to the PMD. Both parties expressed the importance of expediting the implementation of these projects. Additionally, they have delved into bilateral, regional, and global issues, emphasizing their shared commitment to maintaining the region as a peaceful and stable area. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted the investment opportunities in Sri Lankas high-tech industries, envisioning a transformation from a labour market-oriented economy to one that caters to cutting-edge technological advancements. This strategic move is expected to present significant prospects for Japanese investors, the PMD added. During the bilateral talks, Minister Yoshimasa welcomed Sri Lankas efforts under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement including its anti-corruption measures and transparency in the policy-making process. The Japanese legislator commended Sri Lankas efforts on national reconciliation and expressed Japans intention to support the island nations efforts. Recalling the speech delivered by former Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayawardena at the San Francisco Peace Treaty Conference in 1951 after the World War II, Minister Yoshimasa said Japan has been working side by side with Sri Lanka since then and is quite eager to support the island nation along the way in the future as well. Emphasizing the importance of Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean and the fact that the island nation is an important partner in realizing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, the Japanese minister spoke of the new plan for FOIP that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in March 2023.

        "date": "July 29, 2023 09:42 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Higher Education, Suren Raghavan, says President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to implement the 13th Amendment of the Constitution without police powers as a measure to foster national harmony may not be popular, but it is a forward-looking decision for the future of the country. Additionally, Minister Raghavan, highlighted that this decision was taken despite the considerable risk involved, in order to pave the way for a new political journey anticipated by the young people who have been actively engaged in the Aragalaya. He conveyed these perspectives while addressing a Press briefing themed Collective Path to a Stable Country at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (July 28). During his remarks, the state minister asserted that a national dialogue has once again emerged regarding the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. He clarified misconceptions about the current presidents approach to this matter, emphasizing that all former presidents have previously discussed the issue. He pointed out that the country is now transitioning into a post-war phase. Raghavan made it clear that while he does not consider himself a participant in any on-going struggle, the essence of the struggle is evident. He stressed the significance of renewing the agreement between the citizens and the state, a sentiment echoed by the people of the country and the younger generation poised to shape its future. Emphasizing the states responsibility, he underscored the need to address the aspirations and social needs of all citizens in order to revitalize the nation. At present, President Ranil Wickremesinghes actions may not be widely supported, as it is a known fact that elections are on the horizon. Typically, popular decisions are made during such times to garner public favour. State Minister of Higher Education, Mr. Suren Raghavan, suggested that providing essential necessities like free bread, dal, gas, and electricity, or making promises to do so, could be a favourable approach during this period. Despite the potential risks involved, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown boldness in initiating this discourse during his political tenure. It is evident that the President holds a deep belief in democracy and firmly believes that even if a decision is not popular, it must be the right thing to do. The President embarked on this task with the hope of resolving the issue without burdening future generations. During a discussion with party leaders and opposition ministers in parliament, President Ranil Wickremesinghe raised the question of whether they support the 13th Constitutional Amendment. It was pointed out that this amendment has been a part of the constitution for several decades, and significant funds, around Rs. 300 billion per year, are allocated to the Northern Provincial Council alone. This has led to a crucial question regarding the meaningfulness of maintaining the provincial council at such a substantial financial cost. Furthermore, the President made it clear that if the 13th Amendment is not accepted politically, Parliament should step in and take action to abolish it. The Tamil political elite also face internal disunity, with varying opinions and stances on the matter. Some members are abstaining from the discussion and refuse to accept any solution that does not involve federalism. On the other hand, when others request a solution, they do not actively work towards finding one. This lack of consensus and commitment from certain factions within the Tamil political elite poses a challenge to the nations progress on this issue. In light of the situation, adopting a dialogical democracy appears to be the most suitable approach. The enforcement of the 13th Constitutional Amendment, as proposed, should not be further delayed. Moreover, some parties advocate for 13, as discussed with Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, and given the prolonged postponement of provincial council elections for nearly seven years, resolving the underlying issues is essential before holding the election. One critical matter raised is whether all the powers outlined in the 13th Constitutional Amendment will be granted. Specifically, there is an on-going discussion regarding the granting of police powers. While the amendment mentions police powers, it has not been implemented due to mutual suspicions. Hence, there is a pressing need for a constructive dialogue to establish a new consensus between the state and its citizens, particularly concerning the Tamil people. As a former governor, I have observed that 95 of the Tamil-speaking population faces daily struggles for survival, encompassing essential aspects like access to clean drinking water, healthcare, education, transportation, security, and economic opportunities. It is imperative to address these challenges promptly. It is equally important not to exploit the existing differences among Tamil leaders for political gains. Instead, we must focus on genuine efforts to win the hearts of the Tamil people and foster a unified approach towards building a prosperous and inclusive future for all citizens. --PMD",

The data was recorded at Swifts sell-out Eras tour performances at Lumen Field on 22 and 23 July. Seismologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach said the activity was caused by Swifts fans or the sound system. The shows beat the previous record in Seattle, known as the citys Beast Quake in 2011. That was generated by American football fans celebrating Marshawn Lynchs touchdown for the Seattle Seahawks during a game against the New Orleans Saints. Dr Caplan-Auerbach, a geology professor at Western Washington University, told CNN the difference between the NFL game and Swifts recent concerts was just 0.3, but the shaking was twice as strong and absolutely doubled it. I grabbed the data from both nights of the concert and quickly noticed they were clearly the same pattern of signals, she said. If I overlay them on top of each other, theyre nearly identical. The Seattle concerts were played in front of a total of 144,000 fans over two nights. Posting on Instagram afterwards, Swift said: Seattle that was genuinely one of my favourite weekends ever. Thank you for everything. All the cheering, screaming, jumping, dancing, singing at the top of your lungs. Swifts Seattle concerts came towards the end of the US leg of the Eras tour - her first tour in five years. Music concerts have been known to cause seismic activity before, for example during a 2011 Foo Fighters concert in New Zealand. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 30, 2023 08:17 am",
        "content": "As a large creditor to Sri Lanka, China is welcome to join the effort steered by Japan, India and France to help the island nation cope with its debt distress, Indias Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday. She also called upon the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to speed up relief measures for countries facing debt vulnerabilities. Terming multilateral development banks (MDBs) reforms and debt-relief measures for many stressed economies as the top two finance track priorities for India during its G-20 Presidency, Ms. Sitharaman said that a comprehensive, better and quicker approach is required to address the problem within the common framework of the IMF and World Bank, as well as outside it. I quote the outside of it equally as much as within the framework, as we have the example of Sri Lanka, a middle-income country which got into distress because its earnings were limited to tourism and some other areas like export of tea Sri Lanka required a quick redressal, although outside of the framework because they are a middle-income country, she noted in a discussion at the India Japan Forum. In Sri Lankas case, Japan, which holds the G-7 Presidency currently, quickly took the lead to address the distress, she pointed out. Japan came up, along with France and India, with a quick committee of creditors group, which started addressing the issue. And of course, it was an open forum, it wasnt limited to just to the three countries, China is welcome to participate as one of the big creditors, Ms. Sitharaman said. Japans leadership in such cases with a constructive approach to address debt distress has been well-received, the Minister said, adding that this is an indicator that the G-7 and G-20 together would come up with solutions to the problem. While the MDBs are acting to alleviate debt distress, they need to be more nimble, the Minister said, noting that we are looking at situations where countries are waiting for more than three or four years after the application seeking some redressal, to get the actual resolution of the issues.

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy has recovered 51 commercial explosive sticks in Ariyalai beach, Jaffna yesterday (July 29). The SLNS Welusumana in the Northern Naval Command has nabbed this explosives stock stuffed in a sack concealed in nearby shrubs, during a special search operation carried out in the beach area of Ariyalai. It is suspected that the explosive items have been hidden away with the intention of using them for illegal fishing activities later, the Sri Lanka Navy said. The cache of explosives has been kept in naval custody until they are handed over to authorities for onward legal action, according to the Navy. The use of explosives for fishing poses a serious threat to marine life and can cause long-lasting damage to the marine ecosystems, the navy said in a statement, adding that thus, the Sri Lanka Navy has been conducting regular operations to crack down on fishing using explosives and other illegal fishing practices in the island waters.",

In response to a question raised, whether the circular was issued in an attempt by the government to coverup any shortcomings, the Minister expressed that people can make different statements and that the statements authenticity must be considered. Therefore, somebody must hold responsibility, if they make a statement. Rambukwella further claimed that there is an establishment code for the government administrative sector, adding that once the code is breached, the ministrys secretary has the right to write to them, informing them to obtain permission from department heads, before making any statement. Furthermore, it was also questioned whether this system was not in place thus far.

        "content": "The Bajur district in Pakistan was rocked by a bomb blast on Sunday evening after a suicide bomber carried out an attack, killing 44 people in the bomb blast and injuring over 200 till now. It must be noted that the Bajur district is a stronghold of militants, and is near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The suicide blast in Pakistan was meant to target the leaders and supporters of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-F (JUI-F) party, which is a government coalition party, which was conducting a rally in Khar, a town which is near the Afghan border of Pakistan. The Bajur district near the Afghan border was a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban  a close ally of Afghanistans Taliban government  before the Pakistani army drove the militants out of the area. Supporters of hardline Pakistani cleric and political party leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman, whose Jamiat Ulema Islam generally supports regional Islamists, were meeting in Bajur in a hall close to a market outside the district capital. This suicide bombing has become one of Pakistans bloodiest attacks in recent years just as the death toll from the bomb blast climbed to 44, with dozens left injured. Eyewitnesses recounted the horror of the attack, where they could see pools of blood on the ground and limbs scattered across the rally. The Pakistan Taliban, or TTP, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that the bombing was aimed at setting Islamists against each other. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, said that such crimes cannot be justified in any way. One of the injured party supporters from the blast said that the tent had collapsed from one side, making it impossible for panicked people to escape. The bomb was deployed in close proximity to the stage of the political rally, with the aim of injuring the maximum number of party leaders and supporters. (With inputs from agencies)",

Our prognosis is a lifespan between 100 and 120 years within 50 years or so, at least in developed countries, Ignat Kulkov, a researcher at Malardalen University (MDU), told SVT. Elderly people are also expected to be as healthy as those in their forties -- much thanks to rapid technological advancements, Kulkov explained about study findings which was done with colleagues at universities in Finland, France and the United Kingdom and has been published in the scientific journal Futures. More and more people will wear wearable devices to track their health status. These devices will be connected with doctors and hospitals, Kulkov said, adding that some of these sensors will be in the form of implants. Such devices will lead to physicians being able to recommend lifestyle changes at an early stage, with improved health and longer lifespan as a result, he said. Advancements in other fields will also contribute to a longer life, the scientists have found. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in better knowledge of how to trace viruses more efficiently, while AI is already used to diagnose diseases quicker and to develop new treatments, Kulkov said. Personalized medicine with individually tailored drugs is also expected to contribute to improved health, he added. There are, however, also new challenges, Kulkov noted. Climate change will have the biggest influence on our healthcare systems and our lives, not only in the future but already nowadays, he said. Source  Xinhua -Agencies",

        "date": "July 31, 2023 12:07 pm",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development took into account the displeasure received by Sri Lanka both locally and internationally due to the tusker Muthu Raja, who was gifted to Sri Lanka from Thailand, being returned back. The Committee Chair, MP Ajith Mannapperuma inquired from the Secretary to the Ministry whether this tusker was taken back to Thailand with conditions and the reasons for the said, the Parliamentary Communications Department reported. In a statement, it mentioned that this matter was discussed when the Committee met in Parliament recently, with the participation of the Secretary to the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation and the Director Generals of the relevant departments to look into the Annual Performance Report of Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, Annual Report of Zoological Department and State Timber Corporation. As disclosed, the tusker Muthu Raja who was brought to Sri Lanka as a gift from the Thai government in the year 2001 and was given to the Kande Vihara temple in Aluthgama by way of a Sannasa for private use. The tusker has been registered as a tame elephant under the Wild Fauna and Flora Act under File No. 178 of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and has since been treated as private property. Thus, it was disclosed that the matter is beyond the control of the Zoological Department and the Wildlife Department, it added. The health condition of the tusker has deteriorated due to the shortcomings in the care given to it, and based on that, non-governmental organizations in Thailand have requested the government and the Thai ambassador in the country to bring the tusker back to Thailand. Accordingly, following the requests made from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Thai Ambassador, the National Zoological Department intervened and treated the wounds on the back of the tuskers legs as a primary treatment which resulted in more than 90 healing, until the tusker was taken back to Thailand, according to the statement. Given the wounds on the front legs of the tusker take time to heal and given that Thailand has better facilities for treating the tusker there than in this country, the Thai government took the tusker back to Thailand in a separate plane at a cost of Rs. 220 million, promising to the Chief monk of the Vihara that the tusker would be handed over after recovery. However, as the Environment Minister of Thailand stated that Muthu Raja would not return to Sri Lanka, the Committee inquired about the government institution that is really responsible for this as it has stained the reputation of Sri Lanka. The Secretary to the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation reiterated that since the tusker was given to a temple for private use, the responsibility of the elephant is outside the responsibility of the National Zoological Department and the Wildlife Department. According to the notice received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he further stated that his Ministry has provided only the necessary facilities to take the tusker back. Nevertheless, the Chair of the Committee said that as a nation which is famous for its elephants, in a context where even tourists come to see elephants, it is greatly concerning that Sri Lanka finds it difficult to take care of the tusker that was gifted to the country. The authorities said that although they were able to facilitate the treatment of the tusker with the help of veterinarians, due to the strong influence of the Thai government and the people of the country, the tusker had to be taken back to Thailand. The Committee also focused its attention on the problems that have arisen during the construction of the elephant dam in the Balangoda area. It was also considered that there should be some regulation regarding the sale of consumer goods including drinking water bottles at exorbitant prices in the Dehiwala zoo. It was also discussed that the butterfly garden has not been opened to tourists for many years. Members of the Committee Akila Ellawala, and Waruna Liyanage were present at the Committee meeting held, it added.",
