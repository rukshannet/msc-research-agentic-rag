        "date": "February 20, 2025 10:18 am",
        "content": "Former captain Dasun Shanaka has been fined USD 10,000 by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) for breaching his contractual obligations after allegedly faking an injury to leave a first-class match in Sri Lanka in order to play for the Dubai Capitals in the UAE, according to sources. Former Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka found himself in major trouble after being accused of faking concussion in a first-class match in Colombo on February 2 in a bid to travel to Dubai to participate in Dubai Capitals ILT20 game against Abu Dhabi Knight Riders that same evening. According to a report, SLCs chargesheet has revealed that first-class match referee Wendell Labrooy was led to believe that Shanaka had a concussion and needed a substitute to be approved. This was based on SLC CEO Ashley de Silva statement: SSC Shanakas first-class club would probably be conducting their own inquiry as well. However, Shanaka had later clarified that de Silva and others were aware of his Dubai plans. He added that after leaving the ground following his dismissal on the third morning of the three-dayer, he visited a doctor to seek medical clearance having incurred a blow to his neck while batting that day, before leaving for the UAE. SLC and the club knew I had to leave, Shanaka said. I only came back because there was a request from the SSC to play this first-class match. But my other team wanted me back, as Id helped win two games for them earlier in the tournament. Shanaka scored a century before leaving for Dubai. In a bid to avoid relegation, SSC recalled three of their Sri Lanka stars from ILT20 for the match against Moors Sports Club in the Major League Tournament. He picked up a wicket in the 21 overs he bowled on the opening day, before he scored an unbeaten 39 on day 2 and converted it into a century on the final morning, en route to a 123 for 87. Shanaka did not take further part in the game, before he resurfaced in Dubai that same evening, where he scored 34 off 12 at batting at No. 5 for Dubai Capitals. He did not bowl in that game either. Later, the all-rounder did not return home as he had played three more matches in ILT20 en route to a title haul.",

        "title": "Fitch Ratings optimistic on Sri Lankas Budget",
        "date": "February 20, 2025 11:13 am",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments budget highlights the authorities commitment to raising fiscal revenues as a share of GDP - an approach that, if successful, would alleviate a long-standing weakness in the sovereigns credit profile, says Fitch Ratings. Nonetheless, risks to the fiscal outlook remain significant, and plans to slow the pace of fiscal consolidation could weigh on prospects for debt reduction over the medium term. The budget, unveiled on 17 February, is the first since President Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was elected in September 2024, and provides greater clarity over the administrations medium-term fiscal and economic reform agenda. We view most of the budget announcements as being consistent with our assumptions made during our December 2024 assessment, when we upgraded Sri Lankas rating to CCC, from RD (Restricted Default). The provisional budget deficit outturn of 6.8 of GDP in 2024, for example, was in line with Fitchs expectations. The governments goal of raising revenueGDP to 15.1 in 2025, from 11.4 in 2023, would exceed our assumptions that the 15 threshold would only be achieved by 2026. The budget incorporates a 36.5 increase in revenue from taxes on external trade and a 13.1 increase in revenues from income taxes. Fitch believes the goal is achievable, given revenue-raising measures already announced and implemented. However, it will depend heavily on a smooth liberalisation of import restrictions, notably for vehicles. There remains a risk that the authorities could look to slow that process if higher imports weaken Sri Lankas external stability, for example by eroding foreign-exchange reserves. The medium-term fiscal outlook for Sri Lanka remains challenging, and we believe revenue growth is likely to slow sharply from 2026, unless additional policies are introduced. Sri Lankas public finances remain fragile, and the budget projects a slowing of fiscal consolidation, with the deficit falling only to 6.7 of GDP in 2025. This reflects sharply higher spending on public capex (up by 61), as well as increases in salaries and wages (up 12) and subsidies (up 11). The deficit could be smaller than the government expects if implementing such a large capex increase proves difficult. However, we believe Sri Lankas medium-term growth prospects would be impeded if public capex remains at the low levels seen in 2024 (2.7 of GDP), even considering other measures announced in the budget that have the potential to lift private investment in export-oriented sectors and infrastructure. The budgets projected pace of consolidation is slower than envisioned in Sri Lankas four-year USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, agreed with the IMF in 2023. The government still expects to achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3 of GDP in 2025, in line with the EFF programme targets, while expected interest payments of 8.9 of GDP are significantly larger than anticipated in the programme. We assume the divergence from the programmes projections implied in the budget will not prompt the IMF to suspend disbursements under the EFF. However, the slow pace of fiscal consolidation is notable, given that the governments projected medium-term growth rate of 5 is well above that envisioned in the EFF. Limited progress on debt reduction would weigh on Sri Lankas credit profile and could leave the government with little capacity to respond if the economy faces economic shocks. --Fitch",

        "content": "Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala says that the shooting incident that took place inside the Hulftsdrop (Aluthkade) Courts Complex on Wednesday (19) was not any sort of threat to the national security, but instead is linked to longstanding conflicts between organized criminal gangs. Responding to a request in parliament from Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa to take stricter measures to ensure the safety of judges, journalists and civilians of the country citing yesterdays incident, the Public Security Minister stated: These underworld conflicts have existed for a long time. Media houses have been torched under various governments, and journalists have been murdered on the streets. Not only that, but numerous murders have taken place, some of which remain unsolved for over 10 to 15 years. However, as soon as this incident occurred, we promptly arrested the main suspect. We will also conduct investigations into past incidents. Our findings indicate that the suspect arrested yesterday was involved in several other murders committed in the past two weeks. As soon as these crimes occur, we take immediate steps to arrest the suspects after conducting separate investigations, he added. So, as a government, we believe that isolated incidents like this should not be considered threats to national security. Overall, we have ensured national security, and we can firmly certify that, Wijepala asserted. Furthermore, the Public Security Minister emphasized that the security detail for judges has not been reduced in any way. He attributed yesterdays events within the Hulftsdorp Courts Complex to police personnel being prohibited from carrying or using weapons inside the court premises. He also noted that security authorities had successfully ensured the safe transport of the notorious underworld figure Ganemulla Sanjeewa from Boossa Prison to the court complex.",

        "date": "February 20, 2025 09:13 pm",
        "content": "The suspect arrested in connection with the assassination of the notorious drug trafficker and criminal gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararatne, alias Ganemulla Sanjeewa, has confessed to carrying out the murder based on a contract of Rs. 15 million, police sources revealed. During the interrogation, the suspect has revealed that the assassination was orchestrated by underworld figures infamously known by the aliases Kehelbaddara Padme, Commando Salinda, and Avishka. The suspect has further stated that he was paid Rs. 200,000 fortnightly as part of the agreement. According to the confession, the shooter received the firearm inside the court premises from a female accomplice, identified as 25-year-old Pingpura Devage Ishara Sewwandi, a resident of Katuwellegama, Negombo. The suspect also admitted to having a close relationship with the woman. He has later concealed the weapon in his waist before opening fire on Ganemulla Sanjeewa inside the No. 05 Magistrates Court in Hulftsdorp Courts Complex. Following the shooting, the gunman has fled the scene using a rental vehicle booked via a ride-hailing app as a pre-arranged vehicle had failed to show up. After reaching an area near Negombo, he and the female suspect visited a shop to purchase new clothing. He has stated that he then rented a van in order to travel to Kalpitiya, from where he intended to flee to India. Further revelations from the suspect indicate that criminal figure known as Avishka had provided him with the necessary fake identification cards. Additionally, he confessed to also carrying out the recent double murder in Watarappala, Mount Lavinia.

A further report was submitted to the court today. Police are now seeking public assistance in locating Pingpura Devage Ishara Sewwandi, who allegedly aided the shooter. Her grandmother has claimed that she has not returned home for some time. Investigations have also revealed that following the murder, Sewwandi had made a phone call to an officer attached to the Negombo Police Station. She was reportedly required to appear at the Negombo Police Station on the first Sunday of each month in connection with a prior drug-related offense. However, during the call, she had informed the officer that she would not be able to appear next month as she was planning to travel to Dubai. The officer had warned her that she could not leave the country without a court order, leading to an official statement being recorded from him. Police urge anyone with information regarding the female suspects whereabouts to contact the following numbers: 071-8591727  Director, Colombo Crimes Division 071-8591735  OIC, Colombo Crimes Division Suspects Details: Name: Pinpura Devage Ishara Sewwandi Age: 25 years NIC Number: 995892480V Address: 24301, Negombo Road, Jaya Mawatha, Katuwellegama Additionally, Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Priyantha Weerasuriya has announced a cash reward from the Police Reward Fund for anyone providing information leading to the suspects arrest.

Support can now be spotted around the recent record highs at 2942 to 2940, which because of inverse polarity, might act as a minor support zone. WTI rally stalls The WTI light crude oil price seems to have ended its three-day bullish stint as a reported increase in US crude inventories, showing a potential fourth consecutive week of inventory builds, indicates ample supply. A rise above the 55-day simple moving average (SMA) at 72.36 and also Wednesdays high at 72.87 is needed for the recent ascent to resume. In this case, last weeks high at 73.64 and the 200-day SMA at 73.90 would likely be targeted. Strong support remains to be seen between the early to mid-February lows at 70.46 to 70.16. Natural gas prices hit 2-year high NYMEX natural gas futures briefly overcame their 4369 January peak and rallied to a two-year 4476 high on Thursday amid severe cold weather which significantly increased gas consumption and also halted gas production, leading to supply reductions.

As long as the January to February highs at 4369 to 4476 cap, a minor retracement back to the 24 January high at 4050 may unfold. --IG Bank--",

        "date": "February 21, 2025 07:41 am",
        "content": "A chartered flight repatriating the first batch of Chinese nationals totaling 200 suspected of being involved in fraud crimes from Myanmar landed in Nanjing, East Chinas Jiangsu Province, via Thailand on Thursday afternoon. This marks a milestone and remarkable achievement in multinational law-enforcement efforts between China, Thailand and Myanmar to crack down on telecom and cyber fraud, according to Chinas Ministry of Public Security. More than 800 Chinese suspects involved in fraud crimes in Thailand-Myanmar border area will be sequentially repatriated on chartered flights into Jiangsu Province within the next three days, the Global Times learned from Chinas Ministry of Public Security. It fully demonstrates the firm resolve of the three nations to jointly combat transnational crimes such as telecom and cyber fraud, and to collectively safeguard regional security and stability, said the Ministry of Public Security. At 5:10 PM on Thursday, a chartered flight landed at Nanjing Lukou International Airport, carrying 200 Chinese criminal suspects returning from Myanmar - mostly men - each escorted by two police officers and then transferred to judicial authorities for further case processing. The Global Times learned from a source close to the matter that this round of operations has seen the strongest support given to China from Thailand and Myanmar since the joint law enforcement action against cross-border telecom and cyber fraud in the Thailand-Myanmar border area. In the next phase, the tripartite mechanism between China, Myanmar, and Thailand for combating transnational cybercrime will operate on a regular basis. Efforts will be intensified to rescue trapped individuals, apprehend telecom fraud syndicates, dismantle their core structures, and decisively eradicate the telecom fraud hubs in Myawaddy, Liu Ningning, a second-level inspector at the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security, said during an interview with media in Thailand. Public security authorities will also deepen practical cooperation with more countries, rigorously crack down on transnational cybercrime in accordance with the law, and effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, said Liu. In response to a question regarding the matter, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Thursday at a press meeting that fighting online gambling and scam demonstrates our commitment to the people-centered development philosophy. It is also a must choice for safeguarding the common interests of regional countries, and meets the shared aspiration of the people of all countries. China is carrying out active bilateral and multilateral cooperation with countries including Thailand and Myanmar. We have adopted various means to address both symptoms and the root cause and worked together to prevent lawbreakers from crossing borders, so as to jointly eradicate the problems of online gambling and scam, safeguard the life and property of the people, and uphold the order of exchanges between regional countries, Guo said. Recently, the security authorities of China, Myanmar, and Thailand have intensified their efforts and joined hands to launch a concentrated crackdown on telecom and internet fraud crimes in the Myawaddy area. After the successful rescue of Chinese actor Wang Xing from Myawaddy, rampant criminal activities along the Thailand-Myanmar border have drawn great attention worldwide as Thai police said Wang was a victim of human trafficking. At the end of January, with the support of Chinese embassies and consulates in Thailand and Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security dispatched working groups to both countries. They held multiple rounds of talks and consultations with law enforcement agencies there, reaching a consensus on further strengthening trilateral law enforcement cooperation among China, Myanmar, and Thailand, according to the Ministry of Public Security on Thursday. Thailand has also implemented measures such as cutting off electricity, internet, and fuel supplies to the Myawaddy area, and has strengthened patrols and control along the Thai-Myanmar border to resolutely block the smuggling and transfer channels for fraud suspects. Myanmar has deployed a centralized inspection of the telecom fraud compounds in the Myawaddy area, arresting suspects involved in fraud and rescuing trapped Chinese citizens. Through close collaboration and joint efforts by all three parties, significant progress has been made in the crackdown, resulting in the arrest of a large number of suspects involved in fraud crimes in the Myawaddy area of Myanmar, the ministry noted.

        "date": "February 21, 2025 09:37 am",
        "content": "A court in Argentina dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October, according to a ruling obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday. In its decision issued Wednesday, the Argentine federal appeals court ordered the other two defendants in the case to remain in custody. They are facing prosecution on charges that they supplied the famed British boyband star with narcotics. The ruling drops charges against three key defendants: Rogelio Nores, an Argentine businessman with U.S. citizenship who had accompanied Payne during his trip in Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the CasaSur Hotel in the trendy neighborhood of Palermo where Payne died on Oct. 16; and Esteban Grassi, the hotels main receptionist. The charge of negligent homicide carries a sentence of one to five years in prison in Argentina. A toxicology report from tests taken after an autopsy revealed that Payne, 31, had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell from the balcony. Prosecutors argued that Nores had failed to comply with his duties of care by leaving Payne alone while inebriated. The court sided with defense attorneys who contended that Nores had no legal, moral or social duty to care for Payne. He also was outside the hotel at the time of his friends death. The two hotel employees, Martin and Grassi, were in the CasaSur Hotel lobby on Oct. 16 when they saw Payne severely intoxicated and decided to take him to his room with the help of others, investigators determined. Prosecutors said that Payne should have been kept away from his hotel room, where a balcony posed a clear danger, until he could receive proper medical care. On Wednesday, the court ruled that prosecutors failed to prove how taking Payne to his hotel room constituted unlawful, unruly, clumsy, reckless, imprudent or negligent conduct. The court also ordered the other two defendants in the case  Ezequiel David Pereyra, a former employee at CasaSur Hotel and Braian Paiz, a waiter who had served Payne at an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant  to remain in detention on charges that they supplied Payne with narcotics in the days, even hours, leading up to his death. Because the charge they face carries a sentence of four to 15 years in prison, the court said that preventative detention was justified. Paynes sudden death drew an outpouring of grief around the world from heartbroken fans of One Direction, among the best-selling boy bands of all time. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 21, 2025 09:39 am",
        "content": "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup. The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model thats sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhones standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022. Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the devices virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera. All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at 600, a 40 increase from 430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at 800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday. Were so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people, said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the companys revenue. But Apple is also trying to balance its desire to offer a more affordable iPhone that will lure more people into its sphere of product against its self interest in maximizing its profits from selling higher price products, according to Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. The problem with a lower-end product in a luxury portfolio is that you want it to be good but not so good as to cannibalize the crown jewels, Chatterjee said. Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still havent been released in the U.S. and the technology still isnt even available in some parts of the world. The delays in making the iPhones AI  dubbed Apple Intelligence  more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels. Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasnt yet specified when the iPhones AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring. Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do. Apples shares edged higher Wednesday to close at 244.87, below the stocks peak of roughly 260 reached in late December. Source: AP --Agencies",

These remarks were made by President Dissanayake at the Innovation Island Summit - 2025, held yesterday (20) at the ITC Ratnadipa Hotel in Colombo, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD).

        "title": "Sri Lankans among migrants deported from US to Panama, moved to jungle region",
        "date": "February 21, 2025 01:14 pm",
        "content": "A group of nearly 100 migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama last week, including Sri Lankans, has been moved from a hotel in the capital to the Darien jungle region in the south of the country, Panamas government said on Wednesday. In a statement, Panamas security ministry said of the 299 migrants deported from the U.S. in recent days, 13 had been repatriated to their countries of origin while another 175 remained in the hotel in Panama City awaiting onward journeys after agreeing to return home. The migrants have been staying at the hotel under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the U.N.-related International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, according to the Panamanian government. The migrants include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, according to Panamas president, Jose Raul Mulino, who has agreed with the U.S. to receive non-Panamanian deportees. The deportation of non-Panamanian migrants to Panama is part of the Trump administrations attempt to ramp up deportations of migrants living in the U.S. illegally. One of the challenges of Trumps plan is that some migrants come from countries that refuse to accept U.S. deportation flights due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons. The arrangement with Panama allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it Panamas responsibility to organize their repatriation. The process has been criticized by human rights groups that worry migrants could be mistreated and also fear for their safety if they are ultimately returned to violent or war-torn countries of origin, such as Afghanistan. Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian migration lawyer representing one of the families transferred to the San Vicente shelter in the Darien region, said she had not been able to see her clients while they were held at the hotel in Panama City and is seeking permission to visit them at their new location. She declined to identify their nationality, but said they were a Muslim family who could be decapitated if they returned home. Sabalza said the family would be requesting asylum in Panama or any country that will receive them other than their own. The security ministry statement said 97 migrants had been transferred to the shelter in the Darien region, which includes dense and lawless jungle separating Central America from South America. In recent years, it has become a corridor for hundreds of thousands of migrants aiming to reach the United States. Eight more migrants would be moved there soon, the statement added. Early on Wednesday, the hotel in Panama City where the migrants had been held appeared quiet, according to a Reuters witness. On Tuesday some migrants had been seen holding hands and looking out of a window of the hotel to get the attention of reporters outside. Migrants in the hotel were not allowed to leave, according to media reports. A Chinese national, Zheng Lijuan, escaped from the hotel, according to Panamas migration service, but was later caught in Costa Rica and returned to Panama. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Kash Patel confirmed to head FBI despite fear he will persecute Trump adversaries",
        "date": "February 21, 2025 01:19 pm",
        "content": "The Senate on Thursday narrowly voted to confirm Kash Patel as director of the FBI, moving to place him atop the nations premier federal law enforcement agency despite doubts from Democrats about his qualifications and concerns he will do Donald Trumps bidding and go after the Republican presidents adversaries. I cannot imagine a worse choice, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told colleagues before the 51-49 vote by the GOP-controlled Senate. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the lone Republican holdouts. A Trump loyalist who has fiercely criticized the agency he will now lead, Patel will inherit an FBI gripped by turmoil as the Justice Department over the past month has forced out a group of senior bureau officials and made a highly unusual demand for the names of thousands of agents who participated in investigations related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Patel has spoken of his desire to implement major changes at the FBI, including a reduced footprint in Washington and a renewed emphasis on the bureaus traditional crime-fighting duties rather than the intelligence-gathering work that has come to define its mandate over the past two decades as national security threats have proliferated. But hes also echoed Trumps stated desire for reprisal, raising alarm among Democrats for saying before he was nominated that he would come after anti-Trump conspirators in the federal government and the media. In a statement posted after the vote on the social media platform X, Patel wrote that he was honored to be confirmed as the ninth director of the FBI, an institution he said had a storied legacy. The American people deserve an FBI that is transparent, accountable, and committed to justice. The politicalization of our justice system has eroded public trust  but that ends today, he wrote. He said his mission as director was to let good cops be cops  and rebuild trust in the FBI. Republicans angry over what they see as law enforcement bias against conservatives during the Democratic Biden administration, as well as criminal investigations into Trump, have rallied behind Patel as the right person for the job. Mr. Patel wants to make the FBI accountable once again - get back the reputation that the FBI has had historically for law enforcement, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said this week before Patel was confirmed. He wants to hold the FBI accountable to Congress, to the president and, most importantly, to the people they serve  the American taxpayer. Democrats complained about Patels lack of management experience compared with previous FBI directors and they highlighted incendiary past statements that they said called his judgment into question. I am absolutely sure of this one thing: this vote will haunt anyone who votes for him. They will rue the day they did it, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. He added: To my Republican colleagues, think about what you will tell your constituents and family about why you voted for this person who will so completely and utterly disgrace this office and do such grave damage to our nations justice system. About a half-dozen Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered outside FBI headquarters earlier Thursday in a last-ditch plea to derail his confirmation. This is someone we cannot trust, said Sen. Adam Schiff of California. This is someone who lacks the character to do this job, someone who lacks the integrity to do this job. We know that, our Republican colleagues know that. Patels eyebrow-raising remarks on hundreds of podcasts and in other interviews over the past four years include referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as criminal gangsters, saying some Jan. 6 rioters were political prisoners and opining that FBI headquarters should be shut down and turned into a museum for the so-called deep state. At his Senate hearing in January, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point he was trying to make. He also denied the idea that a list in a book he authored of government officials who he said were part of a deep state amounted to an enemies list, calling that a total mischaracterization. I have no interest, no desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards, Patel said as he vowed that there would be no politicization at the FBI and no retributive actions taken. He said at the hearing that the only thing that will matter if Im confirmed is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice. Patel was selected in November to replace Christopher Wray, who was picked by Trump in 2017 and who resigned at the conclusion of the Biden administration to make way for his chosen successor. Wray infuriated Trump throughout his tenure, including after FBI agents searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in August 2022 for classified documents in one of two federal investigations that resulted in indictments against Trump that were dismissed after his election win. FBI directors are given 10-year terms as a way to insulate them from political influence and keep them from becoming beholden to a particular president or administration. But Trump fired the FBI director he inherited, James Comey, after Comey had spent over three years on the job and replaced Wray after more than seven years in the position. Since Wrays resignation, the FBI has been led by interim leaders, who have clashed with the Justice Department over its demands for details about the agents who investigated the Capitol riot  a move seen as a possible prelude to broader firings. Patel denied having any knowledge of discussions about potential firings, but a letter from Durbin last week that cited information that he said had come from insiders suggested that Patel may have been covertly involved in that process. Trump has said that he expects some of those agents will be fired. Patel is a former federal defender and Justice Department counterterrorism prosecutor. He attracted Trumps attention during the presidents first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, Patel helped produce a memo that showcased surveillance-related errors during the FBIs investigation into ties between Russia and Trumps 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trumps administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the defense secretary. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2025 06:01 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A newly discovered bat coronavirus uses the same cell-surface protein to gain entry into human cells as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, raising the possibility that it could someday spread to humans, Chinese researchers have reported. The virus does not enter human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2 does, the Chinese researchers reported in the journal Cell noting some of its limitations. The scientists said that like SARS-CoV-2, the bat virus HKU5-CoV-2 contains a feature known as the furin cleavage site that helps it to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. In lab experiments, HKU5-CoV-2 infected human cells with high ACE2 levels in test tubes and in models of human intestines and airways. In further experiments, the researchers identified monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs that target the bat virus. Bloomberg, which reported on the study earlier on Friday, said the paper identifying the bat virus had moved shares of COVID vaccine makers. Pfizer shares closed up 1.5 on Friday, Moderna climbed 5.3 and Novavax was up about 1 on a down day for the broader market. Asked about concerns raised by the report of another pandemic resulting from this new virus, Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, called the reaction to the study overblown. He said there is a lot of immunity in the population to similar SARS viruses compared with 2019, which may reduce the pandemic risk. The study itself noted that the virus has significantly less binding affinity to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, and other suboptimal factors for human adaptation suggest the risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.

The tunnel work started just four days ago. The SP said two rescue teams of the company which has undertaken the irrigation project have gone into the tunnel to assess the situation. We dont have clear information. The location is about 14 km inside the tunnel. Only after the rescue teams come out, will we know the gravity of the situation, he told the Indian Express. According to the company, 50 workers were present at the site during the incident and around 43 have come out safely, SP Gaikwad said, adding that the police received information about the collapse at around 10 am. In a statement, Minister for Roads and Buildings Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said, The accident occurred due to the slippage of the concrete segment covering the seepage at the 14th kilometre inlet (near Domalapenta) of the tunnel going from Srisailam to Devarakonda. Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy expressed shock over the incident. According to the Chief Ministers Office, he directed the district collector, fire department and irrigation department officials to immediately reach the spot and provide relief measures. Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy, advisor Adityanath Das and other irrigation department officials have left for the accident site in a special helicopter. KTR demands probe Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president and MLA K T Rama Rao blamed the state government for the tunnel cave-in and sought an inquiry into the incident. In a statement, Rao accused the government of compromising on quality standards and supervision due to collusion with contractors and the pursuit of commissions. BRS legislator Kalvakuntla Kavitha demanded that the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) respond to the SLBC tunnel incident. More than 9 km of tunnel is still to be dug. All precautions should be taken to prevent such accidents from happening in the future, she said. Source: The Indian Express --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing humiliating handovers of hostages",
        "date": "February 23, 2025 08:47 am",
        "content": "Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office came early Sunday as military vehicles that normally move in advance of the buses carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released on Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefires first phase. Israels announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authoritys commission for prisoners affairs confirmed the delay until further notice. Associated Press video in the West Bank showed prisoners families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. Five of the six hostages freed Saturday had been escorted by masked, armed militants in front of a crowd  a display that the U.N. and Red Cross have criticized as cruel after previous handovers. The Israeli statement cited ceremonies that demean the dignity of our hostages and the cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes. It was likely a reference to a Hamas video showing two hostages who have yet to be released watching a handover in Gaza on Saturday and speaking under duress. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire s first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefires second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Five were handed over in staged ceremonies. In one, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters. A beaming Shem Tov, acting under duress, kissed two militants on the head and blew kisses to the crowd. They wore fake army uniforms, though they were not soldiers when abducted. Cohens family and friends in Israel chanted Eliya! Eliya! Eliya! and cheered. Youre heroes, Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. You have no idea how much I dreamt of you. His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Beeri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israels military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Israels government didnt respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of deliberately stalling. The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of a Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for a cruel and malicious violation. Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over on Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Hamas denied the Israeli military claim, based on forensic evidence and unspecified intelligence, that its militants killed the children with their bare hands, calling it a lie aimed at justifying Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza. Difficult talks likely over the ceasefires next phase The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefires second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truces first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages  about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it wont release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trumps administration, says hes committed to destroying Hamas military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. An Israeli official had said Netanyahu would meet with security advisers on Saturday evening about the ceasefires future, focusing on the goal of returning all our hostages, alive and dead. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting had not been formally announced. Freed hostages bring relief and a sign of life Wenkert, Cohen, Shoham and Shem Tov had an extremely difficult period in captivity, the Beilinson hospital said, but it did not give details at the families request. Niva Wenkert, Omers mother, told Israels Channel 12 that on the surface, he looks OK, but theres no telling whats inside. This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together, Shohams family said, and called for a deal to free all hostages still held. Families and others rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv to pressure Netanyahus government for a deal. How is it possible that President Trump and special envoy (Steven) Witkoff are more committed to the return of Israeli hostages than you are? said Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased hostage Itay Svirsky. Netanyahu, these are your citizens who were abandoned on your watch! Hamas later released a video showing two hostages still held, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa Dallal, as they sat in a vehicle and spoke under duress at the handover for Shem Tov, Cohen and Wenkert. A group representing hostages families called the video sickening. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners The 620 Palestinian prisoners meant to be freed include 151 serving life or other sentences for attacks against Israelis. Almost 100 would be deported, according to the Palestinian prisoners media office. A Palestinian prisoner rights association said they include Nael Barghouti, who spent over 45 years in prison for an attack that killed an Israeli bus driver. Also meant to be released are 445 men, 23 children aged 15 to 19, and a woman, all seized by Israeli troops in Gaza without charge during the war. Israels military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which doesnt distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90 of Gazas population. The Oct. 7 attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "Pope Franciss condition continues to be critical after suffering a prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis earlier on Saturday, the Vatican has said. The pontiff is more unwell than yesterday and had received blood transfusions, the statement said. The Vatican said the 88-year-old was alert and in his armchair, but required a high flow of oxygen and his prognosis remains guarded. The Pope is being treated for pneumonia in both lungs at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome. The blood transfusions were deemed necessary due to a low platelet count, associated with anaemia, the Vatican said. The Holy Fathers condition remains critical, a statement said. The Pope is not out of danger. The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair even if he was suffering more than yesterday, the statement added. The Pope has asked for openness about his health, so the Vatican has begun releasing daily statements. The tone, and length, of the announcements has varied, sometimes leaving Pope-watchers to attempt to read between the lines. But this is by far the starkest assessment yet and it is unusually detailed. It declines to give any prognosis. It comes just a day after doctors treating the Pope said for the first time that he was responding to medication, although they were clear that his condition was complex. They said on Friday that the slightest change of circumstance would upset what was called a delicate balance. He is the Pope, as one of them put it. But he is also a man. The Pope was first admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing difficulties breathing for several days. He is especially prone to lung infections due to developing pleurisy - an inflammation around the lungs - as an adult and having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. During his 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic church, the Argentine has been hospitalised several times including in March 2023 when he spent three nights in hospital with bronchitis. The latest news will worry Catholics worldwide, who are following news of the Popes condition closely. It is a busy Jubilee year for the Catholic Church with huge numbers of visitors expected in Rome and a major schedule of events for the Pope. He is not known for enjoying being inactive. Even in hospital, his doctors say he went to pray in the chapel this week and had been reading in his chair. But even before the latest setback, the Vatican had said he would not appear in public to lead prayer with pilgrims on Sunday, meaning he will miss the event for the second week in a row. Well-wishers have been leaving candles, flowers and letters for the Pope outside Romes Gemelli hospital all week. There was no change outside St Peters Basilica in the Vatican on Saturday evening, however, with no crowd gathering. But people passing through the square said they were following the news. We feel very close to the Pope, here in Rome, one Italian man told the BBC. We saw the latest, and we are worried. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2025 12:14 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan Navy has arrested 32 fishermen from Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and fishing in Sri Lankan waters. The arrests were made during the early morning hours of Sunday. Five costly mechanised boats were also seized by the Sri Lankan authorities. The arrested fishermen, according to fishermen leaders of Rameswaram were taken to Jaffna in Sri Lanka for further questioning. It may be recalled that three days before on February 19 night, the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 10 fishermen from Rameswaram for allegedly trespassing into its territorial waters. Three mechanized fishing boats were also seized during the late-night operation on Wednesday. Tamil Nadu coastal Police officials confirmed that the fishermen were apprehended for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) while fishing in Sri Lankan waters. Following the arrests, the families of the detained fishermen, along with local fishing communities, have urged both the Central and state governments to take immediate action to secure their release. Fishermens association leaders have announced plans for large-scale protests in Rameswaram and other coastal areas condemning the continued arrests. The issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen being detained by the Sri Lankan Navy has become a recurring problem. Ten days ago, on February 9, Sri Lankan authorities arrested 14 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and seized their mechanized fishing boat. The fishermen, who had set out to sea from Rameswaram, were taken to Jaffna for questioning. A similar incident occurred on February 3, when 10 fishermen from Rameswaram were arrested for allegedly crossing the IMBL. The Sri Lankan Navy has arrested several Tamil Nadu fishermen in recent weeks. On January 26, a total of 34 fishermen from Rameswaram and Thangachimadam were arrested, and three fishing boats were seized while another 13 fishermen from Rameswaram were detained a week before and their mechanized boat was confiscated. Fishermens associations have strongly condemned these repeated arrests, calling them a major threat to their livelihood. Antony John, a fishermens association leader from Rameswaram, expressed deep concern over the escalating detentions. The Sri Lankan Navy is arresting our fishermen regularly. They have even fired at our men, injuring two of them. This has to stop, he said. He also highlighted the dangers of fishing in the Palk Bay, where fishermen risk losing their boats, equipment, and means of livelihood. Fishermens leaders have urged the Centre to take swift diplomatic action to secure the release of detained fishermen and recover impounded boats. They have also called for a permanent resolution through a bilateral agreement with Sri Lanka. Fishermens associations across Tamil Nadu have sent letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting urgent intervention to prevent further arrests and protect coastal communities. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had earlier written to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, urging diplomatic efforts to secure the release of detained fishermen. In his letter, CM Stalin emphasized the severe economic impact of repeated arrests and boat seizures. The recurring arrests and confiscations have severely affected the livelihoods of our fishermen. Swift diplomatic intervention is essential to safeguard their rights, he stated. According to reports, since June 16, 2024, the Sri Lankan Navy has arrested 425 Tamil Nadu fishermen and seized 58 fishing boats. These frequent arrests have triggered widespread protests, with fishermen accusing both the Union and state governments of failing to provide a lasting solution. Former Union Minister and PMK President Anbumani Ramadoss has called on the Indian government to take strong measures against Sri Lankas actions. He stressed the urgent need to resolve maritime boundary disputes to ensure the safety and security of Tamil Nadu fishermen. With more protests planned across coastal districts, fishermens associations continue to demand an immediate and lasting resolution through diplomatic efforts. Source: IANS --Agencies",

Expressing her views in a Facebook post, she added, I was not present in the chambers today, but I later learned about the use of unparliamentary language toward a female opposition MP during the speeches. As a woman who stands firmly for feminist principles, I cannot personally condone what took place in Parliament. We are here to build a political culture rooted in integrity, respect, and the values we have long fought for. My commitment to these principles remains stronger than ever, she further said. Deputy Minister Nalin Hewage had made a statement in Parliament yesterday (22), targeting Matale District MP Rohini Kaviratne alleging that a newspaper advertisement had been published in which she had changed her name to Rohini Lamaratna. In response to this, SJB MP Harsha De Silva strongly opposed the statement made by the Deputy Minister stating Did he say this out of responsibility, or with some other expectation that MP Rohini Kaviratne changed her name to Rohini Lamaratna? As far as I know, MP Rohini Kaviratne has not changed her name. He has no right to say that she changed her name. However, the MP in the chair at the time mentioned that if the statement needed to be removed from the Hansard, a decision would be made after consulting with the Speaker. Following this, a discussion took place between the MP in the chair and MP Harsha De Silva, after which Chief Government Whip, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, stood up and stated that steps should be taken to remove the relevant statement from the Hansard.",

She made this statement during a meeting held in Parliament on Saturday (22) with representatives from various institutions advocating for the disabled community to discuss strategies for enhancing educational opportunities for individuals with special needs, the PMs Media Division said. During the meeting, the representatives presented a comprehensive proposal developed in line with local and international standards. The proposal addressed several key areas, including strengthening the rights of people with special needs, improving the quality of education for children with disabilities, and introducing higher education opportunities focused to their needs. The delegation commended the current government for allocating funds in the 2025 Budget to improve education for children with autism and for establishing a social security system for orphans, the statemen said. Speaking at the meeting, Prime Minister Amarasuriya stated: People with special needs must be given the social acceptance required to live normal lives within society. We aim to incorporate this principle into broader initiatives, including the Clean Sri Lanka project. Our country has many policies, but the challenge lies in effective implementation. Allocating funds for policy execution is crucial, which is why the 2025 budget specifically earmarks resources for various initiatives. Under the Ministry of Educations supervision, we are determined to prioritize higher education for children with special needs and have appointed the necessary personnel to lead this effort. We are currently preparing for a comprehensive transformation of the education system. Relevant policies will be developed in 2025, with implementation set to begin in 2026. This long-term plan is designed to bring about systemic change, with special emphasis on the education of children with special needs. Our goal is to ensure that every child with special needs has access to inclusive education in mainstream schools. While this is a substantial process that cannot be completed overnight, we aim to achieve these goals gradually. As a starting point, we are working to make at least one school in each educational administrative zone equipped to accommodate children with special needs, she said.

        "title": "Germans start voting, polls suggest shift to right",
        "date": "February 23, 2025 04:08 pm",
        "content": "Germans were voting in a national election on Sunday that is expected to restore power to Friedrich Merzs conservatives while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is forecast to achieve its best result yet in Europes ailing economic powerhouse. Merzs CDUCSU bloc has consistently led polls but is unlikely to win a majority given Germanys fragmented political landscape, forcing it to sound out coalition partners. Those negotiations are expected to be tricky after a campaign that exposed sharp divisions over migration and how to deal with the AfD in a country where far-right politics carries a particularly strong stigma because of its Nazi past. That could leave unpopular Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive Europes largest economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals. It would also create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges, including U.S. President Donald Trumps threats of a trade war and attempts to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement. Germany, which has an export-oriented economy and has long relied on the U.S. for its security, is particularly vulnerable. Germans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008. The percentage who say their situation is improving dropped sharply from 42 in 2023 to 27 last year, according to pollster Gallup. Attitudes towards migration have also hardened in a profound shift in German public sentiment since its Refugees Welcome culture during Europes 2015 migrant crisis. Polls opened at 0800 local time (0700 GMT) and will close at 1800 (1700 GMT) when vote counting will start and exit polls will be released. About 60 million people in Germany are eligible to vote. Musk Weighs in Sundays election follows the collapse last November of Scholzs coalition of his centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) in a row over budget spending. The SPD is heading for its worst result since World War Two. The election campaign has been dominated by fierce exchanges over the perception that irregular immigration is out of control, fueled by a series of attacks in which the suspected perpetrators were of migrant origin. A Syrian refugee was arrested over the stabbing of a tourist at Berlins Holocaust memorial on Friday. Prosecutors said he had been planning to kill Jews. The campaign has also been overshadowed by the unusually forceful show of solidarity by members of the Trump administration - including Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk - for the anti-migrant AfD and broadsides against European leaders. The 12-year-old AfD is on track to take second place for the first time in a national election. Im completely disappointed in politics, so maybe an alternative would be better, said retired Berlin bookkeeper Ludmila Ballhorn. The 76 year old, who plans to vote AfD, said she was struggling to live on her pension of 800 euros. Rents and all other costs have soared, she added. The AfD, however, is unlikely to govern for now because all mainstream parties have ruled out working with the party, though some analysts believe it could pave the way for an AfD win in 2029. The strength of the AfD, along with a small but significant vote share for the far-left and the decline of Germanys big-tent parties, is increasingly complicating the formation of coalitions and governance. Coalition Options EU allies are cautiously hopeful the elections might deliver a more coherent government able to drive forward policy at home and in the bloc. Some also hope Merz will reform the debt brake constitutional mechanism that limits government borrowing and that critics say has strangled new investment. The most likely outcome of the election, say analysts, is a tie-up of Merzs conservative bloc of Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) with the SPD, which is polling in third place in another uneasy grand coalition. Polls, however, suggest another three-way coalition may be necessary if several small parties make the 5 threshold to enter parliament, complicating talks. A lot of my friends are likely going to vote for the conservatives because this government didnt work so well and Merzs international standing is quite good, said 26-year-old civil servant Mike Zeller. I just hope enough parties agree to a government so they can leave the AfD out. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The governments approval rating rose sharply after the election, from 24 in July 2024 to 62 in February 2025, when the latest round of the Gallup style Mood of the Nation poll was conducted by Verité Research. For the first time since the economic crisis, a majority of the population (55) feels that economic conditions in Sri Lanka are getting better. However, 47 still feel that the economy, as a whole, is in a poor condition. This is down from the 71 who thought that way in July 2024. Overall, from July 2024 to February 2025, the percentage of people who disapprove of the government declined from 60 to 16 (44 point reduction), and the percentage of people who think the economy is getting worse declined from 65 to 14 (51 point reduction).

Meanwhile, 47 said poor, a decline of 24 points from the 71 who said that previously. Survey Implementation This regularly conducted poll is part of the Syndicated Surveys instrument of Verité Research. The polling partner was Vanguard Survey (Pvt) Ltd. This instrument also allows other organisations to survey the sentiments of Sri Lankans. The latest poll was based on a nationally representative multi-stage randomised sample of 1,050 Sri Lankan adults from separate households, and was carried out from 31 January to 5 February 2025. This survey was designed to have a maximum sampling error margin of 3.0 at a 95 confidence level. Error margins can be further affected by lapses that could arise in the implementation process.

        "date": "February 24, 2025 06:38 am",
        "content": "Germanys conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz won a lackluster victory in a national election Sunday, while Alternative for Germany doubled its support in the strongest showing for a far-right party since World War II, projections showed. Chancellor Olaf Scholz conceded defeat for his center-left Social Democrats after what he called a bitter election result. Projections for ARD and ZDF public television showed his party finishing in third place with its worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election. Merz said he hopes to put a coalition government together by Easter. But thats likely to be challenging. The election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholzs unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates. The campaign was dominated by worries about the years-long stagnation of Europes biggest economy and pressure to curb migration  something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europes alliance with the United States. Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraines second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continents response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administrations confrontational foreign and trade policy. The projections, based on exit polls and partial counting, put support for Merzs Union bloc around 28.5 and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, about 20.5  roughly double its result from 2021. They put support for Scholzs Social Democrats at just over 16, far lower than in the last election and below their previous post-war low of 20.5 from 2017. The environmentalist Greens, their remaining partners in the outgoing government, were on about 12. Out of three smaller parties, one  the hard-left Left Party  strengthened its position, winning up to 9 of the vote after a remarkable comeback. The pro-business Free Democrats, who were the third party in the collapsed government, looked likely to lose their seats in parliament with about 4.5. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, or BSW, was hovering around the 5 threshold needed to win seats. A difficult task for the winner Whether Merz will have a majority to form a coalition with Scholzs Social Democrats or need a second partner too, which would realistically have to be the Greens, will depend on whether the BSW gets into parliament. The conservative leader said that the most important thing is to re-establish a viable government in Germany as quickly as possible. I am aware of the responsibility, Merz said. I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us. I approach it with the utmost respect, and I know that it will not be easy. The world out there isnt waiting for us, and it isnt waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations, he told cheering supporters. The Greens candidate for chancellor, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, said that Merz would do well to moderate his tone after a hard-fought campaign. We have seen the center is weakened overall, and everyone should look at themselves and ask whether they didnt contribute to that, said Habeck. Now he must see that he acts like a chancellor. The Greens were the party that suffered least from participating in Scholzs unpopular government. The Social Democrats general secretary, Matthias Miersch, suggested that their defeat was no surprise  this election wasnt lost in the last eight weeks. A delighted far-right party doesnt have a partner AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla told cheering supporters that we have achieved something historic today. We are now the political center and we have left the fringes behind us, he said. The partys strongest previous showing was 12.6 in 2017, when it first entered the national parliament. The partys candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, said it is open for coalition negotiations with Merzs party, and that otherwise, no change of policy is possible in Germany. Merz has repeatedly ruled out working with AfD, as have other mainstream parties  and did so again in a televised post-election exchange with Weidel and other leaders. Weidel suggested AfD wouldnt have to make many concessions to secure a theoretical coalition, arguing that the Union largely copied its program and deriding its Pyrrhic victory. It wont be able to implement it with left-wing parties, she said. If Merz ends up forming an alliance with the Social Democrats and Greens, it will be an unstable government that doesnt last four years, there will be an interim Chancellor Friedrich Merz and in the coming years we will overtake the Union. Merz dismissed the idea that voters wanted a coalition with AfD. We have fundamentally different views, for example on foreign policy, on security policy, in many other areas, regarding Europe, the euro, NATO, he said. You want the opposite of what we want, so there will be no cooperation, Merz added. Scholz decried AfDs success. He said that that must never be something that we will accept. I will not accept it and never will. More than 59 million people in the nation of 84 million were eligible to elect the 630 members of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, who will take their seats under the glass dome of Berlins landmark Reichstag building.

Speaking at an event in Ratnapura, the minister emphasized that the initiative would allow industrialists to address their concerns within their respective districts, eliminating the need to travel to Colombo. If industries are located in villages, and if the Ministry of Industries is a place that provides services to the people, then those services should be provided at the district level, Minister Handunnetti stated. Then the industrialists will not have to come to Colombo and struggle for it. After our future program is modernized and meets technology, we can solve problems right from the factory. We call it a method of solving problems from a single window. He also addressed the bureaucratic hurdles faced by entrepreneurs, noting that obtaining business approvals currently takes around one and a half years, often leading to bribery. It takes about one and a half years for someone to start a business to get permission. Otherwise, they have to give bribes, he said. Instead of bribes, the government has increased the salaries of government officials. Therefore, they should work without taking bribes and without corruption. Minister Handunnetti further announced plans to digitize all government payments to enhance transparency and efficiency. He urged entrepreneurs to avoid paying bribes, emphasizing that doing so fuels corruption. To improve this further, we have decided to digitize all government payments. Therefore, we request entrepreneurs not to pay bribes to make their work easier. They will accept bribes only if you give bribes, he remarked.",

        "content": "The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Sampath Thuyacontha, says he has issued an order for the immediate arrest of all deserters from the security forces. Responding to a journalists inquiry about reports that army soldiers with weapons training were involved in a significant number of recent crimes, the Defense Secretary highlighted the Ministrys concern over the issue. He explained, We have drawn attention to the recent incidents. Many military personnel have been arrested. As a solution to that, there is actually a social problem here. We have confirmed through investigation that military officers who have illegally deserted the military before completing their full service period have a high probability of getting involved with the underworld. He further emphasized that deserters who receive weapons training for a short period, like a year or two, and then leave the military, are more likely to engage in criminal activities. We gave an order a few days ago to take action to arrest such people. We have provided facilities for arresting them through the military police. We have come to that decision, he added. The Defense Secretary noted that a significant number of military personnel have already deserted in this manner, which has now become a social issue. He also assured that there is no political protection for underworld activities, adding that the necessary legal actions have been promptly taken. In addition, he revealed that an audit of firearms has been conducted, with a significant amount now under the control of the Ministry of Defence. Meanwhile, during a special press conference held at the Government Information Department on February 22, the Defence Secretary had also revealed that it has been observed that there is a tendency for armed forces personnel with weapons training to desert the Tri-Forces and engage in criminal activities or join underworld criminal gangs. He further stated that an order has been issued to arrest such individuals, emphasizing that both the military and the police are capable of tracking down and apprehending military deserters with weapons training within a short period. When inquired by a journalist as to whether active-duty military personnel are also involved with criminal groups, the Defence Secretary admitted that some soldiers have been found to have ties to criminals due to economic difficulties and drug addiction.

        "title": "Petitions against Deshabandus appointment as IGP fixed for trial",
        "date": "February 24, 2025 10:16 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has fixed for hearing the nine Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the Inspector General of Police (IGP). The petitions seek a ruling declaring that the manner in which Tennakoon, who previously served as the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province, was appointed as the IGP is unconstitutional. The case was taken up before a five-member Supreme Court bench today (24), consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Shiran Gunaratne, and Achala Vengappuli. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, representing Tennakoon, presented evidence to the court, highlighting that an interim injunction had been issued, preventing his client from performing duties as IGP. Therefore, he requested the court to expedite the hearing of this petition. After considering the facts presented before the court, the five-member bench fixed the hearing of the relevant petitions for May 06, 07, and 08. The petitioners include the Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Young Journalists Association, and other parties. They contend that the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council to appoint Tennakoon as IGP are unlawful. The petitions seek a ruling that the decision to appoint Tennakoon as IGP, based on those recommendations, is against the law.",

        "date": "February 24, 2025 10:58 am",
        "content": "Protesting the arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy and demanding their immediate release, fishermen in Rameswaram have launched an indefinite strike from Monday (February 24). As per a Daily Thanthi report, over 700 mechanised boat fishermen have stopped operations, keeping their boats docked along the shore. The strike is expected to result in a daily revenue loss of approximately Rs1 crore, affecting more than 10,000 fishing industry workers. A consultative meeting of all mechanised boat fishermens associations was held on Sunday (February 23) at the Rameswaram fishing harbour, where they unanimously decided to suspend fishing activities until the detained fishermen are released. The protesters have urged the Union government to take swift action against the repeated arrests and ensure the safety of Tamil Nadu fishermen. Reports indicate that since January 2025, Sri Lankan Navy has arrested 131 Tamil Nadu fishermen from Rameswaram and other coastal areas. Additionally, 18 of their boats have also been seized. The arrests of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy on allegations of crossing maritime boundaries have been ongoing for several years. In the latest incident, 32 fishermen from Rameswaram were arrested on February 23 on similar charges. Source: DT Next --Agencies",
