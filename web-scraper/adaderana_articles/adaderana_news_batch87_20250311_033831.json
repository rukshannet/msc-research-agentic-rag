        "date": "January 30, 2024 05:51 pm",
        "content": "Israeli forces have killed three militants inside a hospital in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank. CCTV footage showed members of an undercover unit disguised as medics and other civilians making their way through a corridor with rifles raised. The Israeli military said the militants were hiding in the hospital, and that one was about to carry out an attack. The Palestinian Authoritys ministry of health accused Israel of carrying out a new massacre inside hospitals. Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist group which is fighting a war with Israel in Gaza triggered by its unprecedented attacks on Israel on 7 October, said the Israeli forces had executed three fighters, including one of its members Another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said two of those killed were its members and were brothers. It added that one of them had been receiving treatment at the hospital. The security camera video from Ibn Sina hospital shows several members of the Israeli undercover unit - men and women - hurrying through a corridor, training their weapons left and right. One can be seen taking a piece of clothing of an unidentified person who is kneeling down with his hands behind his head, then covering his head with it. Tensions have soared in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with near daily Israeli arrest raids and clashes with Palestinians. Jenin, a militant stronghold, has been a focus of such raids for months. Since 7 October, Israeli forces have killed at least 357 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - in the West Bank, while Israeli settlers have killed at least eight, according to the United Nations. Palestinians from the West Bank have killed at least 10 Israelis in attacks in the West Bank and Israel in the same period. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hamas suspect who was killed had planned a raid attack inspired by the October 7th massacre. On that date, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel from Gaza, killed about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and took about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered Israels military campaign in Gaza, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 26,600 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive. The official Palestinian news agency in the West Bank, Wafa, said the three Palestinians in the hospital had been assassinated. According to its sources in the hospital, about 10 members of Israeli special forces dressed in civilian clothes went to the third floor, where they killed the men using weapons fitted with silencers. One of the PIJ members who was killed had been receiving treatment for an injury in the hospital since 25 October, it added. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "A court in the southern Indian state of Kerala has sentenced 15 men to death for the murder of a local leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Ranjith Sreenivasan was killed in front of his family members in 2021 in what was described as a tit-for-tat murder. Police said that the 15 convicts were affiliated with the Popular Front of India (PFI), a controversial Muslim group banned in 2022. The men can appeal against the sentences in a higher court. A sessions court in Keralas Alappuzha district had convicted the men on 20 January. On Tuesday, after the death penalty was awarded, Sreenivasans wife Lisha said that while their loss was irreparable, the verdict came as a relief. Sreenivasan was hacked to death at his home in Alappuzha on 19 December 2021 in front of his mother, wife and daughter. Police found during the investigation that eight of the 15 convicts were directly involved in the murder while others stood guard with weapons outside the house. Some of the men were members of the PFI while others belonged to its political unit, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). In 2022, the BJP-led federal government banned PFI for five years for alleged links with terror groups. Sreenivasans murder occurred hours after the killing of KS Shan, an SDPI leader in Alappuzha. An investigation report had said that Shan was murdered to avenge the killing of an activist from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the Hindu nationalist BJP. A police chargesheet filed a few months after Shans murder named 21 people. Police said they had arrested five RSS workers for the murder who later got bail. Trial in the case is scheduled to begin next month. The back-to-back murders of Sreenivasan and Shan had shocked the people of Kerala and made national headlines. Source - BBC - Agencies",

In a letter jointly addressed to the Speaker, the Media, Civil Society and Trade Union Collective to Rise against Oppressive Laws noted that the proposed legislation which completely endangers the freedom of expression should be rejected outright. Expressing its strong objections to the hasty passage of the Bill on January 24 in the parliament, sans discussion with any stakeholder, and ignoring the directives of the Supreme Court. MPs of the opposition parties have pointed out that the Bill was debated and passed in the parliament without proper inclusion of amendments and guidelines directed by the Supreme Court. Those amendments and guidelines were issued by the Supreme Court after taking into consideration a record of 45 fundamental rights petitions challenging the draft Bill. We believe, that if what the opposition MPs point out had occurred during the passage of the Bill, it clearly violates the Constitution, undermines the sovereignty of the people and has possibly caused contempt of court as well. Media and civil society groups vowed not to stop their fight against regulations that are stifling the right to freedom of expression, despite the Bill being as an Act by the Parliament. This letter is also out commitment to continue our fight against regulations that are going to be implemented despite our objections that not only impede our right to free expression but also cause possible harm to the economy. They said it was clear that the government is attempting to make the Online Safety Bill into law urgently to counter the opposition against the government ahead of the upcoming elections. Noting that it is the Speakers responsibility to ensure that parliamentary orders are followed, they urged him to guarantee that the Supreme Court-directed amendments are incorporated into the Online Safety Bill before putting his sign on it. Therefore, we as citizen activists and citizens who respect democracy, request you not to sigh your consent to the Bill until you are satisfied that the orders and guidelines sent to you by the Supreme Court are fully incorporated into the Bill.",

The two women, aged 23 and 33 who are residents of Boossa, were arrested following an operation carried out by a team of officers from the Hakmana Police Station in the Rathgama area on Monday morning (29). Investigations have uncovered that the two firearms used in the shooting incident had been transported from Karapitiya to Boossa in a motorcycle belonging to one of these suspects after the crime was committed. On Jan.22, a group of persons who had arrived in an SUV had opened fire at a white Defender near the Beliatta Interchange of the Southern Expressway. In the shooting, which took place between 8:30 a.m. and 8:40 a.m., four persons were killed at the scene. The other person who was inside the Defender was rushed to the Tangalle Hospital with critical gunshot wounds, however, he succumbed to injuries shortly after. Among the deceased was the leader of Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya (Our Power of People Party or OPPP) Saman Perera. The other four victims were identified as Sameera Madhusanka, Hasitha Chinsuka, Buddhika Rajapaksha, and Nalin Champika. Previously, a total of four suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident and this brings the total number of arrests in relation to the case to nine. One suspect was identified as the driver of the SUV used by the assailants. He is suspected to have been complicit in orchestrating the murders. The investigating officers also have found the SUV used by the assailants while parked near the Vidyaloka Pirivena in Galle.",

        "title": "Malaysia welcomes new king in unique rotating monarchy",
        "date": "January 31, 2024 10:19 am",
        "content": "Sultan Ibrahim, the wealthy and outspoken ruler of Malaysias southern Johor state, was sworn in as the countrys new king in a ceremony on Wednesday. Malaysia practices a unique rotational form of monarchy, in which the heads of the countrys nine royal families take turns to be king for a five-year reign. The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but has become more influential in recent years due to prolonged political instability during which the king has wielded rarely used discretionary powers. HOW IS THE KING INSTALLED? Nine of Malaysias 13 states are headed by a traditional ethnic Malay ruler, mostly known as the sultan, in one of the worlds largest monarchy systems. The constitutional monarchy was established after Malaysias independence from Britain. Every five years, the nine rulers elect one among themselves to be Malaysias king through a secret ballot. The order of rotation among the sultans was originally determined by seniority, based on how long they had been ruling. But that rule was dropped after all the royal families completed a term each and they now take turns based on the initial order. WHO IS MALAYSIAS NEW KING? Sultan Ibrahim, 65, hails from the southern state of Johor whose sultanate can be traced back to the 16th century. While the monarchy is largely seen as above politics, Sultan Ibrahim is known for his views on governance and has said he has a good relationship with the prime minister. He owns a large collection of luxury cars and motorbikes and has wide-ranging business interests from real estate to mining. A company he has a stake in has a joint venture with struggling Chinese property developer Country Garden (2007.HK), opens new tab to develop a 100-billion project called Forest City in Johor. The sultan has publicly advocated establishing a special economic zone between Johor and neighbouring Singapore to strengthen ties and last year said he planned to revive a stalled high-speed rail project between Malaysia and the city-state. Johor is also the only sultanate allowed to maintain its own private army, as part of a deal for the state to join the Federation of Malaya before the countrys independence in 1957. WHAT ARE THE KINGS POWERS? The monarch plays a largely ceremonial role and acts as custodian of Islam in the Muslim-majority country. The federal constitution requires the monarch to act upon the advice of the prime minister and cabinet with few exceptions. The king is allowed to appoint a prime minister who he believes has a parliamentary majority, a power never utilised until 2020 as the premier is typically picked through an election. But a series of political shocks in recent years has forced the monarchy to play a greater role, particularly during the reign of Sultan Ibrahims predecessor, Al-Sultan Abdullah from Pahang state. Al-Sultan Abdullah has appointed the last three prime ministers - the first two after successive governments collapsed and most recently, in 2022, when he chose Anwar to be premier after an election that saw a hung parliament. The king also has the power to pardon convicted people. In 2018, the then-monarch Sultan Muhammad V pardoned Anwar, who was imprisoned on sodomy and corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was jailed last year after a graft conviction linked to state fund 1MDB, has applied for a royal pardon. It is not known whether Najibs request will be reviewed by the new king. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

Addressing an all-party meeting chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi, Mr. Vaiko said China had constructed a port in Hambantota and the Indian government should realise that the threat to the country from China would emerge first from the south. A statement from the party said that he also drew Mr. Rajnath Singhs attention to the alleged attack on Tamil fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy, claiming that over 800 fishermen had been killed so far and there was no protection to their lives and belongings. He also used the occasion to launch an attack on Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi, accusing him of blabbering on one issue or another. When Mr. Vaiko said Mr. Ravi had remarked that the country attained Independence because of Subhas Chandra Bose, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahalad Joshi said that the Governor had clarified his comments. His comments have appeared in all newspapers and other media. Probably, the Minister has not read them, Mr Vaiko said. He further said that the Indian democracy was facing a major threat and would die if Hindutva forces succeeded in implementing one country, one election, one language and one religion.

        "date": "January 31, 2024 03:58 pm",
        "content": "Commenting on the recent aid extended by India to Sri Lanka at a crucial juncture during the countrys most severe and unprecedented economic crisis, Indias Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar has urged for all Indians to visit Sri Lanka, emphasising the strong ties between the two nations. My first advice would be, the next time you want to take a holiday, go to Sri Lanka, he said. Responding to questions from students at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Mumbai on Indias role in the global stage, Dr. Jaishankar provided a detailed account of the economic woes faced by Sri Lanka during this time, and the unwavering support extended by India. Mix with the normal person in Sri Lanka and ask them what do you think about India, and I can tell you, you will feel yourself grow with that answer, he said. Talking about the extreme fuel and food crises in the island which the Indian Foreign Minister said he himself witnessed during his visit to Sri Lanka at the time, Dr. S, Jaishankar highlighted that the country was unable to secure essential commodities, running out of food, and had petrol queues running for kilometres. At a time where the rest of the world turned its back on Sri Lanka, the only country which came forward, and not in a small way, Indias External Affairs Minister emphasised, adding that India had committed USD 4.5 billion to Sri Lanka. Emphasisng that monetary support to Sri Lanka should have ideally been extended by the International Money Fund (IMF), Dr. S. Jaishankar further highlighted that although this assistance was given later, it amounted to less than USD 3 billion. What we did immediately, quickly and efficiently, was 50 bigger than what the IMF did, and no other country came close, he stated. Responding to a question raised as to whether the shift in the geopolitical alignment of Indias longest standing regional partners, including Sri Lanka, towards China, was indicative of the perceived failure of Indias Neighborhood First Policy, the Minister said, I think this idea that somewhere, neighbours are turning against us and we are failing, we need to have more confidence. While admitting that China too, is a neighbouring country, Dr. S. Jaishankar stated that China, in many ways, as part of competitive politics, will inevitably influence surrounding countries. I dont think we should be scared, I think we should say okay, global politics is a competitive game, you do your best, I will do my best, Dr. Jaishankar said when asked about the way in which India could respond to Chinas strategic expansion within the Indian Ocean region. Today, China is a major economy, it will deploy resources, it will try and shape things in Chinas way, why should we expect otherwise, but the answer to that is not to complain that Chinas dong it, the answer is okay, if youre doing it, let me do it better than that, the Minister stated. Dr. S. Jaishankar also emphasised that the suggested notion that the countrys Neighbour First Policy is a failure is untrue, saying You are right there is competition, you are wrong that its a failure. I would say today, as India, we should not be scared of competition, we should welcome competition and say I have the ability to compete.",

The ED stated to the HC, She continues to withhold the truth even to this date. It is also a fact that Fernandez wiped out the entire data from her mobile phone after Chandrasekhars arrest, thereby tampering with the evidence. She also instructed her colleagues to destroy the evidence. The evidence conclusively proves that she knowingly participated in the possession and use of the proceeds of the crime committed by Chandrasekhar. In August 2022, the ED had highlighted the same in its supplementary chargesheet. The ED asserted that Fernandez initially denied that Chandrasekar had purchased cars for her parents living in Bahrain, but when confronted with evidence, she admitted to it, indicating her collusion with accused Sukesh Chandrasekar to conceal the use of the proceeds of the crime. Additionally, during her questioning, Fernandez attempted to cover up her conduct by repeatedly claiming to be a victim in the case. However, she failed to provide any substantial material to establish victimization by Sukesh. Her lawyer, on the other hand, maintained that Jacqueline is a victim of a larger conspiracy.

        "date": "January 31, 2024 04:13 pm",
        "content": "A Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musks record-breaking 56 billion Tesla (TSLA.O) pay package on Tuesday, calling the compensation granted by the EV makers board an unfathomable sum that was unfair to shareholders. Shares of Tesla dropped about 3 in extended trade, and some investors seized on the ruling in hopes it might prompt Tesla to overhaul its governance. The Tesla board has been criticized as failing to provide oversight of its combative, headline-making CEO, who has fought regulators and led several other companies at the same time. The ruling, which can be appealed, nullifies the largest pay package in corporate America. The judge found the share-based compensation was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk, currently ranked by Forbes magazine as the worlds richest person. Swept up by the rhetoric of all upside, or perhaps starry eyed by Musks superstar appeal, the board never asked the 55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals? wrote Kathaleen McCormick of Delawares Court of Chancery. McCormick directed the Tesla shareholder who challenged the pay plan to work with Musks legal team on an order implementing the decision. It can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court once the parties agree on a final order and on fees for the shareholders attorneys, which will be paid by Tesla. The decision comes as Tesla warns of slowing growth and the electric vehicle industry is re-evaluating demand. Tesla has become the worlds most valuable automaker under Musk, but much of that value is based on expectations of future breakthroughs, such as self-driving robotaxis. Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware, Musk said in a post on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022. Musks lawyer did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Good day for the good guys, said an email from Greg Varallo, an attorney for Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who brought the lawsuit in 2018. CEO COMPENSATION The incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum - seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make a good future for humanity, wrote McCormick in her 201-page opinion. Musk testified during the week-long compensation trial in November 2022 that the money would be used to finance interplanetary travel. Its a way to get humanity to Mars, he testified. So Tesla can assist in potentially achieving that. Teslas 10-year pay agreement with Musk reached in 2018 would be worth around 51 billion at Tuesdays closing price for Tesla stock, accounting for the cost to Musk to exercise the options. That would be about a quarter of his 210.6 billion fortune, as calculated by Forbes magazine, which currently ranks about 2 billion ahead of LVMH (LVMH.PA), CEO Bernard Arnault of France and his family. The ruling comes as Tesla is preparing another round of compensation negotiations with the CEO. Musk said in a post on X this month that he was uncomfortable leading Tesla unless he had 25 of the voting control. The billionaire owned around 13 of the company at the time and he said negotiations would not start until McCormick had ruled. Given the way she describes the board process - through the testimony of the directors - there is no way that his most recent demand for 25 can get approved, Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said. Its dead on arrival. McCormick wrote that many of the directors on Teslas board, including current members Kimbal Musk, Elon Musks brother, and James Murdoch, son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, lacked independence because of their close personal ties with the CEO. Two of Teslas other current directors, Robyn Denholm and Ira Ehrenpreis, showed a lack of independence in the pay decision, she said. The board currently has eight members including its CEO. Ross Gerber, president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth  Investment Management and a Tesla investor, told Reuters the ruling showed the company needed to replace at least three directors with independent board members before it can negotiate a new pay package for Musk. Essentially, the entire corporate structure of Tesla has been deemed, like not appropriate for a public company, Gerber said. Tesla directors argued during the trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the worlds most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric vehicle maker. Antonio Gracias, a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021, called the package a great deal for shareholders. Tornettas lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package. The plaintiffs legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects, like SpaceX and X. Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, described the board as beholden to Musk, a problem she said is common at other big technology companies. This is the bro-show, she said of the situation. The pay package granted stock option awards for approximately 304 million shares that Musk can buy at about 23.33 each, well below 191.59 where it closed on Tuesday. Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla hit escalating financial and operational goals. Musk has not exercised any of the options and once he does he is required to hold the shares for five years before selling, according to McCormick. He was not guaranteed any salary. Teslas value ballooned to briefly top 1 trillion in 2021 from 50 billion when the package was negotiated. Amit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm, estimated in 2022 that Musks package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021.

        "date": "January 31, 2024 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Maldives has sought Sri Lankas assistance in medical evacuation services  mainly to transport patients to Colombo in air ambulances  amid a persisting strain with India. Maldivian Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Mohamed Ameen met his Sri Lankan counterpart Nimal Siripala de Silva in Colombo on Tuesday, and said on social media platform X, that Sri Lanka has agreed to help the Maldives with medical evacuation. We have specifically agreed upon creating a framework for immediate approval process between Maldives and Sri Lanka on urgent requirements, specifically on med-evac flights, Mr. Ameen said in his post. They Maldives will use their air ambulances, this is to help keep this channel open and easy for any emergency medical treatment that Maldivians might need in Sri Lanka, Mr. de Silva told The Hindu Wednesday morning. Sri Lanka and India are among the Maldivess closest neighbours, and Maldivians have always had close ties in Colombo, a city they frequent. The development comes amid President Mohamed Muizzus apparent efforts to expand and diversify the island nations partnerships in medical evacuation. In December, he announced setting up an air ambulance service beginning March 2024, and said it could help patients travel as far as Thailand. The need for prompt medical evacuation came into sharp focus earlier in January, when a Maldivian teenager died, reportedly owing to a delay in evacuation for emergency treatment. Mr. Muizzus efforts also assume significance at a time when Male and New Delhi grapple with strained ties, following controversial remarks made by Maldivian Ministers targeting India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a Boycott Maldives social media campaign in India. Indias two naval choppers and a Dornier aircraft stationed in the Maldives have been involved in more than 600 medical evacuations  often from the atolls to capital Male , search and rescue operations in the last five years, according to official sources in Male. Mr. Muizzu has set a March 15 deadline for New Delhi to withdraw its nearly 80 soldiers stationed in the country. New Delhi has said they were posted there chiefly to operate and maintain the helicopters and the aircraft. Further, India is the most popular destination among Maldivians seeking medical care overseas. Aa Sandha, the governments universal health insurance scheme launched over a decade ago, has dozens of Indian hospitals empanelled, for Maldivians to access varied medical treatment.

        "date": "January 31, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "At least 72 health sector trade unions, excluding doctors unions, will launch an island-wide strike from 6.30 a.m. tomorrow (01 February), demanding the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance. Although the President had promised to hold talks with them regarding the allowances, soon after returning from his recent official overseas tour, the health workers said they have yet to meet with the Head of State for discussions. However, the All Ceylon Nurses Union has decided not to join the strike action to be launched jointly with over 72 health sector trade unions on Thursday. The members of the union stated this, after meeting the Chief Prelate (Mahanayake Thero) of the Malwathu Chapter regarding the current situation of the health sector. Commenting further regarding the matter, the All Ceylon Nurses Union alleged that this decision was taken since the planned strike action is a conspiracy by the government. They also mentioned that nevertheless, the authorities were informed regarding their demands and that the relevant authorities requested a period of one month to act on the relevant demands. The union further stated that they will resort to a trade union action if no response is received for their suggestions and demands. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the approval to President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Since then, the health sector employees trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the governments decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees. On January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. This prompted the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, it was later called off the planned trade union action, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.",

        "date": "January 31, 2024 06:51 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the foundation of a nations economy lies in fostering an enlightened and cultured society. He made these remarks during the inauguration of the new building complex at the Kelaniya University Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies this morning (31 Jan.). The President underscored Sri Lankas pivotal role as the heart of Theravada Buddhism, expressing the nations duty to delve deeper into the Dharma and share its wisdom globally. Highlighting plans for the future, he announced the intention to establish a research institute dedicated to Theravada Buddhism, recognizing the potential of such institutions to propagate the teachings and strengthen ties between Buddhist nations. In addressing the evolving technological landscape, President Ranil Wickremesinghe affirmed the commitment to enhance Sri Lankas education system in line with the demands of the digital age. He further revealed plans to introduce artificial intelligence courses across all universities. The President also said that he is ready to provide the land and government support to build a student hostel at the Post Graduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies as requested by the students. As a gesture of gratitude, President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented commemorative gifts to foreign donors who contributed to the construction of the new building complex. Expressing his views further President Wickremesinghe said, In 2019, I assumed the role of Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone for the construction of this building. Today, as the President I inaugurate this structure, in which its progress was hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ven. Ratanasara Theras initiative to establish the Pali and Buddhist Institute at Vidyalankara University is commendable, and Ven. Rahula Anunayake of Kotapitiya played a significant role in the buildings construction. The teachings of Buddha, crucial for navigating lifes challenges, hold immense importance. This institute has the potential to delve into these teachings deeply and disseminate them globally. Nearly fifty years have passed since the institutions inception, marking a milestone. Beyond benefiting Buddhist nations, this institute can contribute to fostering understanding of Theravada Buddhism in other countries, fostering stronger ties among Theravada nations. Excavations for the grand temple have commenced, led by the Maya Devi excavation team from Lumbini. Plans for a research institute to further study Buddhism are underway, with a comprehensive report expected by year-end. As a government, our efforts are focused on promoting Theravada Buddhism globally. This institution plays a crucial role in fostering relationships among international Buddhist nations. Furthermore, the upcoming free trade agreement with the Prime Minister of Thailand is anticipated to enhance the bonds between Sri Lanka and Thailand, both being Buddhist countries. In tandem with technological advancements, we aim to create an environment that allows technology to explore Buddhist teachings. Artificial intelligence plays a vital role in this endeavour. Collaborating with the Minister of Education, we are actively pursuing the introduction of artificial intelligence courses in every university. The rapid evolution of technology demands a responsive education system, and we aspire to fortify Sri Lankas educational landscape accordingly. Recognizing that the countrys progress is intricately linked to knowledge and a cultured society, we remain committed to strengthening the education system to meet the demands of the technology era, ultimately contributing to the bolstering of the nations economy. Ven. Senior Professor Medavachchiye Dhammajothi Thera  Director, Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya: President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during his tenure as the Minister of Education, made significant strides in the field by initiating the establishment of colleges. His economic vision, emphasizing the inflow of foreign funds, deserves commendation. The introduction of this post-graduate institution not only reinforces the program for attracting foreign investments to Sri Lanka but also hosts a substantial number of international students. Today marks a golden opportunity within this educational institution. Professor Miriswatte Wimalagnana Thera, Head of the Department of Buddhist Culture: The Post Graduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies stands as an outstanding educational institution in Sri Lanka. Today holds immense significance, marking a day of great joy. It can be rightfully proclaimed as the most pivotal day in the history of this institution. For over 50 years, the institute operated in various parts of Sri Lanka. However, today signifies a historic moment as, for the first time, it has found a permanent home with the support of foreign investors and the government. Notably, it boasts the highest number of foreign students and generates substantial foreign income from education. With the potential for significant future earnings, we express gratitude for the governments support, particularly from the President, in making this achievement possible. Venerable Raluwe Padmasiri Thera  Professor of the Department of Buddhist Thought: Its been 49 years since the inception of this this institution, serving as the sole government institute for Pali and Buddhist postgraduate studies. Through the support of the Sri Lankan government and foreign assistance, the institution proudly unveils a new four-storey building today. The President of the country extends blessings for the inauguration of this remarkable structure. It is emphasized that leaders and politicians should have the opportunity to pursue admission to a university, as universities are not confined spaces. The Buddhist and Pali Postgraduate Institute welcome individuals from all backgrounds, transcending party affiliations. This institution, like the teachings of Dharma, remains impartial. Its mission extends beyond borders, providing a profound understanding of Dharma to both Sri Lanka and the international community. Emeritus Professor K.L. Dhamma Jyoti Thera from Hong Kong: I am currently pursuing my studies overseas at this institution. Remarkable progress has occurred in this academic setting since our earlier years of study. While we used to engage in educational activities from various locations back then, there is now a dedicated campus that serves as a centralized hub for all educational endeavours and the propagation of Buddhism. The commitment of the doctors and professors has significantly contributed to the development of the Pali and Buddhist Postgraduate Institute, elevating it to a noteworthy platform for advancing Buddhist education on the international stage. Ven. Passaramulle Dayawansa Thera, Post Graduate Student of the Pali and Buddhist Postgraduate Institute: The inauguration of the Pali and Buddhist Postgraduate Institute marks a significant stride towards elevating Buddhist education to an international standard. This newly unveiled institution is poised to cater to the educational needs of both local and international students. Noteworthy is the Presidents commitment to constructing a dormitory for foreign students, a pledge that, if fulfilled, has the potential to transform Sri Lanka into a prominent educational hub for Theravada Buddhism. Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunge  Chairman of the University Grants Commission: The inauguration today holds a special significance for the nation. Among the 17 universities with 19 functioning institutes, nine are postgraduate institutes, including the Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies at Kelaniya University. The unveiling of this building complex, achieved through the dedication of a substantial team and considerable foreign investment, is a momentous occasion for our country, order, and the global community. Our aim is to disseminate the teachings of Theravada Buddhism worldwide. Despite recent tensions around the University of Kelaniya, todays atmosphere is remarkably peaceful. The execution of this endeavour has been exceptionally well-done. Notably, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is a product of our national university system, highlighting the significance of this achievement. Therefore, my gratitude extends to the University of Kelaniya and its students for their assistance in effortlessly conveying this message to the world. Dr. P.R.W. Priyadarshana  Professor, Department of Buddhist Culture: We are delighted that the foundation stone of the postgraduate institution building premises, was laid during President Wickremesinghes tenure as Prime Minister and he is inaugurating it today during his presidency. The institute is actively engaged in elevating Theravada Buddhism to an international level and serves as a valuable asset to the country. Open to individuals worldwide, this postgraduate institution holds the potential to disseminate the Dhamma message globally as a centre for Theravada teachings. Senior Assistant Registrar  Mr. L.A. Sumith Jayasekara: For nearly five decades, the Pali and Buddhist Postgraduate Institute has been dedicated to educating both local and international monks and laypeople. Within Buddhism lie numerous languages that offer solutions to diverse global issues, and this institution provides a significant platform for such exploration. Recognizing the importance of this endeavour, I express gratitude to the President, the head of the country, for gracing us with his presence and contributing to the progress of this independent institution. As a leader with a wealth of knowledge, he has consistently shown dedication to the education of the countrys children over the years. Despite initial concerns about his participation in todays event, we are thankful for his presence and encouragement. The occasion was graced by the presence of the Maha Sangha led by Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha Anunayake, Prof. Ven. Rahula Anunayake Thera of Kotapitiya and other esteemed attendees included Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha, Minister of State for Education Dr. Suresh Raghavan, Chairman of the University Grants Commission Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunga and the Vice Chancellor of the Kelaniya University Senior Professor Nilanthi De Silva and other distinguished professors.",

        "date": "January 31, 2024 07:03 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung says Sri Lankas adoption of the controversial Online Safety Bill sends a negative signal in Sri Lankas path towards reform and recovery, when major global tech companies characterize the bill as unworkable and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes. She also emphasised that in order improve Sri Lankas business climate, the government of Sri Lanka, while carrying out reforms, must also make its people aware of these reforms in a clear manner. Addressing the Amcham XO Forum 75 years and Beyond: U.S.  Sri Lankan Business Relations in 2024, Ambassador Chung highlighted that while it is imperative that the Sri Lankan government carries out reforms, its also important to explain those reforms to the people in a clear manner. She admitted that while this process inevitably makes for slower legislation, it results in good legislation and reforms. Taking the controversial Online Safety Bill as an example, Ambassador Chung revealed that according to A poll conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives earlier this month, over 70 Sri Lankans were unaware of the bill before its passage. When major global tech companies characterize the bill as unworkable and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes, frankly this sends a negative signal in Sri Lankas path towards reform and recovery. Previous bills, such as the Personal Data Protection Act, took much longer to craft, but did a better job of taking stakeholder feedback into account, she said in this regard. As such, the Ambassador emphasised that Sri Lanka needs to do better in the future in terms of working on legislation and reforms that are durable, enforceable and wise. This will be key to improving the business climate, Ambassador Chung highlighted. The Ambassador made these remarks while commenting on the commitments required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Sri Lanka, as part of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), stating that they call for government reform measures in both tax compliance and combatting corruption Ambassador Chung admitted that while Sri Lanka has taken difficult measures, that are hard and not always popular, to put the country on a long-term sustainable footing and comply with the IMF commitments, the people of Sri Lanka deserve and continue to demand openness, transparency, and accountability from their leaders as the process of reforms moves forward. Speaking on the recently increased Value Added Tax (VAT) in this vein, Ambassador Chung said, The new higher VAT rates have been a hit on the average Sri Lankan and your businesses. We understand that while there may be short term necessary pains, the public deserves to know that such measures are being taken looking at the wholeness of the problem and endemic issues that must be addressed in a structural, sustainable way, fair and transparent to all. She noted, however, that these measures should not solely include the raising of taxes, but should also instead include the elimination of tax loopholes and addressing government inefficiencies, particularly in state owned enterprises. It means digitalizing customs to raise revenue and reduce corruption. Creating predictable customs duties and streamlined processes would encourage importers, who want to import more to Sri Lanka but are worried about the uncertainty in the import process. Unpredictable customs fees discourage importers and limit the amount of customs revenue the Sri Lankan government can collect. This shifts the burden of tax revenue further onto the shoulders of the people, who cant bear much more, she said in this regard. Recalling a meeting she had had with the National Chamber of Exporters earlier this week, Ambassador Chung noted that red tape, regulatory challenges, and unpredictability were some of the key challenges that impacted their businesses. Meanwhile, commenting on Sri Lankas future in this regard, the Ambassador opinionated that the growth of both, the exports and private sectors, will be the engine of recovery. She noted, however, that they need the space and support to thrive. Exports and private sector growth will be the engine of recovery, but they need the space and support to thrive. As the largest export market for Sri Lanka, the United States can help be part of the solution, she commented.",

        "content": "The Pekoe Trail, a 300km trekking trail that travels through the central hills of Sri Lanka, has been profiled among the Top 20 Travel Experiences for 2024 as named by National Geographics Global Editorial Teams, as part of their picks for Best of the World 2024, the brands annual guide of the most exciting, meaningful, and one-of-a-kind travel experiences for 2024. The National Geographic recently announced their picks for BEST OF THE WORLD 2024, the brands annual guide of the most exciting, meaningful, and one-of-a-kind travel experiences for 2024, whereas the Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka was ranked number 16 in the Top 20 Travel Experiences category. BEST OF THE WORLD 2024 was created, researched, reported, and written in collaboration with National Geographics international editorial teams, which serve millions of readers through their magazines and websites around the world. This years travel guide celebrates not only must-see destinations but expands the franchise to include a complete and authoritative suite of must-do, must-stay, and must-consume recommendations for travelers to engage with these destinations more deeply and meaningfully. For the first time ever, Nat Geos BEST OF THE WORLD recommendations also include a selection of wellness retreats, hotels, cultural gems, and restaurants that National Geographics experts agree are worth building a trip around, as well as a list of the top 20 travel adventures for the year ahead. Also new for 2024 is a list of the top expert-approved travel products and a newly introduced set of change-makers who inspire National Geographics own global community of travel experts on where and how to travel. National Geographics editor-in-chief Nathan Lump said: At National Geographic, we know that travel has the power to move you. That the experiences you have can make you see the world  and yourself  in a new light. Our expanded BEST OF THE WORLD franchise is the ultimate guide to the exceptional experiences that we and our global community of experts are most excited about right now, whether thats hiking to the El Valle de Antón volcano in Panama or listening to live music in Kyoto or bear-watching in Alaska . Meanwhile, Chief of Staff to the President, Sagala Ratnayaka, emphasised the national significance of this ranking: Sri Lanka is set to attract a trending new international tourist segment with The Pekoe Trail that offers a world-class nature-based experience in our tea country. This recognition from Nat Geo validates the collaborative efforts of the Plantation companies, Sri Lanka Tourism, Dept. of Wildlife Conservation, Dept. of Forest Conservation, Sri Lanka Railways, the JEDB, the European Union and USAID in creating a world class walking trail. Commenting on this achievement the European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka H.E. Carmen Moreno said, We are thrilled that The Pekoe Trail continues to attract the global travel media limelight for Sri Lanka at a time when we need to maximize the momentum for tourism recovery. Funded by the European Union, The Pekoe Trail is a unique close-to-nature, wellness tourism experience for travelers, that also provides economic growth opportunities for communities along the Trail. The Pekoe Trail, a 300km, 22-stage discovery of Sri Lanka on foot, is creating international headlines for Sri Lanka as a destination for wellness and nature-based travel. It is a unique tourism experience that supports the long-term environmental sustainability of habitats as well as the social and commercial sustainability of the communities it passes through. Supported generously by the European Union (EU) with additional support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), The Pekoe Trail promises an immersive and enriching experience for those seeking to connect with the authentic essence of Sri Lanka and will be open to travellers in stages commencing November 2023. Furthermore, the Nat Geo states Sri Lanka is virtually synonymous with tea. The island nation is one of the worlds top producers of tea leaves. British colonists introduced the first bushes about 200 years ago. Now visitors can trace the footsteps of historic planters on the new, nearly 200-mile Pekoe Trail, the countrys first long-distance walking route. Starting just outside Kandy, the trail follows the 19th-century tracks upon which workers and horse-drawn carts transported freshly plucked leaves. Hikers pass through hill towns and tea estates and can stop to take a cooking class or savor a cup of aromatic Ceylon tea. National Geographic is synonymous with the best in travel, adventure, and exploration, and now our editors are sharing the full breadth of their insight across a variety of categories with our fans all over the world, said Courteney Monroe, president of National Geographic Content. Whether through the pages of National Geographic magazine, NatGeo on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, our BEST OF THE WORLD franchise has the power to ignite the explorer in everyone, from the professional traveler to the family looking for their next adventure.",

        "date": "January 31, 2024 10:33 pm",
        "content": "Judges at the top U.N. court on Wednesday found that Russia violated elements of a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty, but declined to rule on allegations brought by Kyiv that Moscow was responsible for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. In the same ruling, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty by failing to support Ukrainian language education in Crimea after its 2014 annexation of the peninsula. The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv. The court rejected Ukraines requests to order reparations for both violations and only ordered Russia to comply with the treaties. Ukraine had filed the lawsuit at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, in 2017, accusing Russia of violating an anti-terrorism treaty by funding pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. The courts judges said Moscow violated the U.N.s anti-terrorism treaty by not investigating plausible allegations that some funds were sent from Russia to Ukraine to possibly fund terrorist activities. The 16-judge panel ordered Russia to investigate any plausible allegations of terrorism financing but turned down a request by Kyiv for reparations. The court declined to rule on the downing of MH17, saying violations of funding terrorism only applied to monetary and financial support, not to supplying weapons or training alleged by Ukraine. Ukraine had argued that in the case of MH17, Russia supplied the missile system that shot down the aircraft, but it had not alleged financial support in that instance. In a hearing at the court in The Hague last June, Russia dismissed Ukraines allegations that it funded and controlled pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as fiction and blatant lies. In the case, which has taken almost seven years, Kyiv had accused Russia of equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including rebels who shot down MH17 in July 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. In November 2022, a Dutch court sentenced two Russians and a Ukrainian in absentia to life imprisonment for their role in the disaster. In Crimea, Ukraine had said Russia was trying to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians. The court dismissed all of the claims related to the Tatars but found Moscow did not do enough to support Ukrainian language education. The courts judgments are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Ukraine has accused Moscow of falsely applying the 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A total of 72 trade unions in the health sector have launched an island-wide one-day strike starting 6.30 a.m. today (Feb.01) urging the government to address their issues without delay, the National Movement of the Health Professionals said. It is understood that the doctors unions and the All Ceylon Nurses Union have decided not to join the strike action today. The nurses union said that this decision was taken since the planned strike action is a conspiracy by the government. They also mentioned that nevertheless, the authorities were informed regarding their demands and that the relevant authorities requested a period of one month to act on the relevant demands. The union further stated that they will resort to a trade union action if no response is received for their suggestions and demands. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers approved President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Since then, the trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the governments decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees. On January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. This prompted the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, the planned trade union action was later called off, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.",

        "title": "Tech CEOs told you have blood on your hands at US Senate child safety hearing",
        "date": "February 1, 2024 10:41 am",
        "content": "U.S. senators on Wednesday grilled leaders of the biggest social media companies and said Congress must quickly pass legislation, as one lawmaker accused the companies of having blood on their hands for failing to protect children from escalating threats of sexual predation on their platforms. The hearing marks the latest effort by lawmakers to address the concerns of parents and mental health experts that social media companies put profits over guardrails that would ensure their platforms do not harm children. Mr. Zuckerberg, you and the companies before us, I know you dont mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, referring to Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg. You have a product thats killing people. Zuckerberg testified along with X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Senator Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committees Democratic chairman, cited statistics from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children nonprofit group that showed skyrocketing growth in financial sextortion, in which a predator tricks a minor into sending explicit photos and videos. This disturbing growth in child sexual exploitation is driven by one thing: changes in technology, Durbin said during the hearing. As the hearing kicked off, the committee played a video in which children spoke about being victimized on social media. I was sexually exploited on Facebook, said one child in the video, who appeared in shadow. In the hearing room, dozens of parents held pictures of their children who they said had been harmed due to social media. Some parents jeered Zuckerberg, whose company owns Facebook and Instagram, during his opening statement and shouted comments at other points during the hearing. At one point, Senator Josh Hawley challenged Zuckerberg to apologize to them directly, and several people held the childrens photos aloft again as Zuckerberg turned around to address them. Zuckerberg expressed regret about what they had experienced and pledged to work to prevent it from happening to others, but stopped short of taking responsibility for facilitating the abuse, as Hawley suggested he should. In a tense exchange, the committee displayed copies of internal emails showing Zuckerberg rejecting a request by Metas top policy executive to hire between 45 and 84 engineers to work on safety improvements. Xs Yaccarino said the company supported the STOP CSAM Act, legislation introduced by Durbin that seeks to hold tech companies accountable for child sexual abuse material and would allow victims to sue tech platforms and app stores. The bill is one of several aimed at addressing child safety. None have become law. X, formerly Twitter, has come under heavy criticism since Elon Musk bought the service and loosened moderation policies. This week, it blocked searches for pop singer Taylor Swift after fake sexually explicit images of her spread on the platform. Wednesday also marked the first appearance by TikTok CEO Chew before U.S. lawmakers since March, when the Chinese-owned short video app company faced harsh questions, including some suggesting the app was damaging childrens mental health. Chew disclosed more than 170 million Americans used TikTok monthly, 20 million more than the company said last year. Under questioning by Graham, he said TikTok would spend more than 2 billion on trust and safety efforts, but declined to say how the figure compared to the companys overall revenue. Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg about warning screens on Instagram that alerted users an image might show child sexual abuse, but still allowed them to see the image. Mr. Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking? Cruz said. Zuckerberg responded that it can be helpful to redirect users to resources rather than blocking content, adding the company would follow up with more information about the notice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar questioned what she said was inaction in the tech industry, comparing it to the response shown when a panel blew out of a Boeing plane earlier this month. When a Boeing plane lost a door in flight several weeks ago, nobody questioned the decision to ground a fleet... So why arent we taking the same type of decisive action on the danger of these platforms when we know these kids are dying? Klobuchar said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 1, 2024 11:15 am",
        "content": "A Republican lawmaker has nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, citing his historic policy in the Middle East. New York representative Claudia Tenney said in a statement that she decided to nominate the former president for his role in the Abraham Accords treaty, which formally normalised relations between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Israel. Donald Trump was instrumental in facilitating the first new peace agreements in the Middle East in almost 30 years, she claimed in a statement posted on her website. For decades, bureaucrats, foreign policy professionals, and international organisations insisted that additional Middle East peace agreements were impossible without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Trump proved that to be false, she added. The valiant efforts by President Trump in creating the Abraham Accords were unprecedented and continue to go unrecognised by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, underscoring the need for his nomination today. Now more than ever, when Joe Bidens weak leadership on the international stage is threatening our countrys safety and security, we must recognise Trump for his strong leadership and his efforts to achieve world peace. I am honoured to nominate former president Donald Trump today and am eager for him to receive the recognition he deserves, the statement continued. Mr Trump has previously complained that he has not received enough recognition for his work on foreign policy. But while the Abraham Accords have been cited as a way to introduce and strengthen Israeli-Arab ties, the historic agreements have also been criticised for so far failing to produce meaningful solutions for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Abraham Accords without the Palestinians were a disaster, just like his deal with the Taliban without the Afghan government. On top of that, he bombed the Middle East more than Obama, one person posted on X, following news of Mr Trumps Nobel Prize nomination. Someone explain to me how she nominates him for a Nobel for a peace accord in the middle east WHILE the middle east is at war in Gaza! another person wrote. Despite such criticism of Mr Trumps foreign policy, the 77-year-old was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize several times during his presidency. However, he failed to win the prize. I would get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they give it out fairly, which they dont, the former president complained at a press conference in New York in 2019. Mr Trump was nominated for the prize in 2020 by far-right Norwegian politician Christian Tybring-Gjedde, citing his efforts to bring reconciliation to North and South Korea. But despite a period of improved relations between North and South Korea, the negotiations ultimately failed in making any clear progress towards denuclearizing the North. Swedish MP Magnus Jacobsson also nominated Mr Trump in 2020 for his role in brokering a deal to normalise relations between Serbia and Kosovo. The following year, Swedish nationalist MP Laura Huhtasaari and a group of Australian lawmakers then nominated him for his role in brokering the Abraham Accords. Mr Trump lost out that time to Filipino and Russian journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov, who received the prize for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace. The former president has routinely conflated his Nobel Peace Prize nominations  which the organisation does not record, release or consider to be endorsements  as an honorific. Speaking at an Iowa rally in 2020, he said: I get home, I turn home the television and they talked about your floods in Iowa. How is Iowa doing? The crops. How is this happening? How are they doing in Florida? Three or four stories, one after another. Where is my Nobel Peace Prize? They dont talk about it. I said, You know, darling. This news is a little tough to crack. Meanwhile, former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany previously described the nomination as a well-deserved honour for Mr Trump. The organisation stresses that receiving a nomination, which any one of thousands of people can make, is not an extended honour. While Mr Trump has never won the prize, his predecessor, former president Barack Obama, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. Mr Obama donated the 1.4m award to charity. His win is something that has irked Mr Trump, who previously suggested his predecessor had no idea why he was nominated for the prize just months into his presidency. When Obama got it he didnt even  he just said, What did I do? He had no idea what he did, Mr Trump said at a rally in 2020. And they made it a big story, he added. I did a great job. In 2013, Mr Trump tweeted calling for Mr Obamas award to be rescinded. The former director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad later said he regretted Mr Obamas selection. Even many of Obamas supporters believed that the prize was a mistake, he told the AP news agency. In that sense the committee didnt achieve what it had hoped for. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced in October. Source - The Independent - Agencies",

        "content": "The March 12 Movement, a collective of election watchdogs and the civil society, has issued a statement strongly denouncing the passage of the Online Safety Bill, emphasising that it poses a grave threat to the fundamental rights enshrined within the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The current governments adamant pursuit of this legislation is a clear indication of its intention to silence dissent and suppress civic activism during this critical time of economic reform and upcoming elections, the statement read. The March 12 Movement further accused the government of violating the constitutionally guaranteed right to pre-enactment judicial review of legislation, in addition to introducing the undemocratic law. They also revealed that the Supreme Courts recommendations in relation to amendments appropriate for the Bill were completely overlooked during its passage, adding that the although the relevant legislation was debated in Parliament using standing orders, its passage potentially undermines the established Westminster-model parliamentary tradition. While the citizens silently suffer amidst escalating cost of living and unmanageable hunger, it is crucial for the rulers to recognize that this silence does not equate to obedience, the statement further read, warning that such an assumption is the precursor to a major backlash against the governments coercive rule. Thus, the March 12 Movement urged the Speaker to ensure that the amendments outlined in the recommendations listed by the Supreme Court are fully incorporated into the Online Safety Bill, adding that following due process when passing laws, and respecting the judiciary and the sovereignty of citizens, is essential to promote clean politics and reinforce democracy in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "February 1, 2024 04:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka and Australia have signed two subsidiary arrangements aimed at collaborating on strengthening governance and expanding cooperation in market systems development. In a media release, the Australian High Commission in Colombo said a 10-year subsidiary arrangement that commits an initial AUD 30 million (LKR 6.3 billion) over five years to support improved governance in Sri Lanka. Through a suite of programs, the arrangement supports the Sri Lankan government, nonprofit institutions and civil society to improve evidence-based policy and decision-making, deliver better services for communities, and increase the voice and agency of marginalised groups, including women. Lead delivery partners include the World Bank, The Asia Foundation, and the International Foundation of Electoral Systems. The program will also support twinning arrangements between Australian and Sri Lankan institutions. This investment builds on a previous five-year arrangement valued at AUD 31 million (LKR 6.5 billion) over five years, according to the High Commission. Secretary of the Finance Ministry Mahinda Siriwardana noted that in line with the IMF Governance Diagnostic and program for Sri Lanka, supporting improved governance is necessary to deliver long-term economic growth and stability. Speaking in this regard, Australian High Commissioner Paul Stephens said Australia is pleased to continue its longstanding assistance. Strong governance systems are critical to support resilient and inclusive economic growth, and to ensure that all Sri Lankans stand to benefit from that growth. Additionally, the two countries have signed a five-year subsidiary arrangement committing to ongoing development cooperation in market systems development, focusing on economic diversification and generating foreign exchange, while also strengthening livelihoods and womens economic empowerment. The arrangement builds on the previous five years of investment in the Market Development Facility (MDF) program, with an additional investment of AUD 12.1 million (2.55 billion LKR). AUD 9.45 million (1.99 billion LKR) was provided in phase one of the program, another media release issued by the High Commission read. Since 2015, MDF has been a catalyst for economic development, working closely with the private sector and spearheading innovative solutions that support Sri Lankas tourism and agriculture sectors. Mr. Stephens said Australia was pleased to support sustainable development that increases profits and improves livelihoods. Through MDF, Australia looks forward to engaging with the private sector to build partnerships which will continue to drive prosperity and inclusivity for a resilient recovery. Finance Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said the partnership between Australia and Sri Lanka supported economic growth and development, particularly in key sectors of tourism and agriculture. The program partners with businesses of all scales to enhance competitiveness, generate foreign exchange and contribute to Sri Lankas economic recovery. In tourism, this includes a focus on sustainable, high-value tourism; in agriculture, MDF focuses on implementing commercially viable business models that improve agricultural productivity and quality, while promoting climate-resilient agriculture and affordable agricultural technology. Through MDF, Australia is a longstanding champion of Sri Lankas emerging speciality coffee sector, collaborating with partners to establish Sri Lanka as a global speciality coffee destination. The program is also looking to expand select agricultural value chains such as mango, cashew, mushroom and peanuts, which hold export potential but also engage significant numbers of smallholder farmers, including women. MDF is now looking to expand climate-focused investments to support greater energy efficiency and resilience in the face of environmental shocks, particularly for agribusinesses, the High Commission added.",

        "date": "February 1, 2024 07:27 pm",
        "content": "China has executed a couple for throwing two toddlers out of a high-rise apartment window, in a case that provoked nationwide outrage. The man and his girlfriend were found guilty of killing the children from his first marriage by staging an accidental fall from a residential tower in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, so that they could start a new family. The father, Zhang Bo, began an affair with Ye Chengchen and initially hid the fact that he was married with children, but Ye found out and Zhang divorced his wife, according to Chinas supreme court. Ye saw Zhangs two children as an obstacle to them getting married and a burden on their future life together, the court heard. She repeatedly urged Zhang to kill the toddlers and threatened to break up with him if he didnt. After conspiring with Ye, in November 2020, Zhang threw his two-year-old daughter and one-year-old son from his 15th floor apartment when they were playing next to the bedroom window, killing them both, according to the court. Zhang and Ye were sentenced to death in December 2021. The Supreme Peoples Court said the couples crime seriously challenged the legal and moral bottom line, calling their criminal motive extremely despicable and means particularly cruel, state news agency Xinhua reported. News of their execution drew hundreds of millions of views on Chinese social media site Weibo, where it became a top trending topic. They deserved the punishment, said a top comment with 27,000 likes. How very satisfying! said another with 31,000 likes. A study published in 2020 shows 68 of Chinese citizens are in favor of death penalty. But John Zhuang Liu, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who authored the paper, told CNN Thursday that online views might not accurately reflect Chinas public opinion. His study shows that Chinese people who express political views online tend to show greater support for the death penalty. We do not have a clear understanding of the general publics views on the death penalty in China, and we lack a rigorous data collection channel, he said. The 2020 paper was based on the last available nationwide data collected in 2013. We dont know whether public views have shifted since then, he said. China does not provide transparent information on the total number of executions, but the country is believed to be the worlds top executioner with thousands of people executed and sentenced to death each year, according to human rights group Amnesty International. Wednesdays execution also brought into focus the main method used in China to carry out the death penalty: lethal injection. Its basically euthanasia. They had it easy, said a comment on Weibo with 20,000 likes. Some drew attention to the recent execution of Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith by nitrogen gas, a new method that experts have said could lead to excessive pain or even torture. The execution was hailed by some Chinese social media users as a punishment that fits more serious crimes. Why do I think the 22-minute execution is very suitable for those who maliciously kill their wives, parents, children and the serial murderers? a top comment said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "February 1, 2024 09:06 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, has defended the Presidents recent foreign trips against criticism. He dismissed claims that the trips were unnecessary, emphasizing their importance in strengthening Sri Lankas foreign relations and securing new partnerships. Mr. Balasuriya stressed that Sri Lanka cannot afford to be isolated on the global stage. He argued that foreign relations are crucial for the countrys development, and that the Presidents visits are essential for building bridges and fostering cooperation with other nations. He dismissed criticisms of the trips as baseless, asserting that they play a vital role in Sri Lankas pursuit of progress. State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, speaking at a press briefing today (01) titled Collective Path to a Stable Country, held at the President Media Centre (PMC) highlighted recent efforts to attract investment and rebuild the nation. Sri Lankas recent diplomatic efforts have focused on economic recovery and international cooperation. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Wickremesinghe and the Foreign Minister engaged the business community in discussions on rebuilding the nation and attracting investment. This dialogue aimed to leverage Sri Lankas potential within the global market. Furthermore, the Presidents participation in the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Kampala addressed broader geopolitical concerns. Discussions centred on navigating the current power dynamics and Sri Lankas long-term economic trajectory within the context of the evolving global landscape by 2050. These engagements highlight Sri Lankas proactive approach to securing its future through international partnerships and strategic economic planning. President Wickremesinghes participation in the G77  China Summit addressed crucial issues like climate change and epidemic threats, particularly their impact on developing nations like Sri Lanka. Discussions included strategies for managing economies in the face of these challenges, and exploring the transition towards a green economy. The state minister defended the presidents foreign trips, emphasizing their importance for Sri Lankas development. He acknowledged criticisms but dismissed them as unfounded, highlighting the benefits of participation in international conferences. These events, he argued, provide opportunities to build new connections and strengthen existing relationships, which are crucial for a country seeking to avoid isolation and achieve progress. In his view, foreign official trips play a vital role in strengthening foreign relations and fostering development. The ability to engage directly with private sector leaders opens doors for political leaders to make development decisions tailored to specific needs and investments. This fosters collaboration and potentially accelerates progress. The recent visits served a dual purpose. Firstly, they solidified the offline policy, suggesting a renewed focus on domestic affairs. Secondly, discussions addressed the crucial issue of preventing regional spill over from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. By collaborating with regional leaders, the state minister expressed confidence in containing these conflicts. He further emphasized the contribution of these interactions to global peace, State Minister Tharaka explained. The state minister extending an invitation to foreign leaders to continue the dialogue on economic and social measures while suggesting a commitment to international cooperation and collective problem-solving.",

        "content": "President Joe Biden is expected to issue an executive order targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory, according to four people familiar with the matter. A senior administration official, who like the others was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the White House was expected to announce the order later Thursday. Biden has spoken out against retaliatory attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7. The president has pledged that those responsible for the violence will be held accountable. The executive order is expected to set the ground for imposing sanctions on individuals who have engaged in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Attacks by Israeli settlers have intensified since the war started, and some Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian authorities. Rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing evacuations to other areas. Bidens expected order was first reported by Politico. The new executive order comes as Biden was set to visit Michigan on Thursday to rally support from union members in a key presidential battleground state. The Democratic president has faced sharp criticism from Arab and Muslim leaders over his handling of the war with Hamas, and the shadow of the conflict has some Democrats worrying that it could have a major effect on the outcome in the November election. The State Department announced in December it would impose travel bans on extremist Jewish settlers implicated in a rash of recent attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The department did not announce individual visa bans. But officials said at the time the bans would cover dozens of settlers and their families, with more to come if the violence continued.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena requested the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to assist the governments initiative to introduce a dispute prevention and resolution mechanism to public service. He made this request when ILO Country Director Joni Simpson called on the Prime Minister at the Temple Trees today (01 Feb.), together with United Nations Resident Coordinator Marc-André Franche. The delegation thanked the Prime Minister for the initiative taken in this regard and obtaining the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for the proposal. They assured the Prime Minister their fullest support to implement the proposed mechanism, which would not only result in resolving disputes, but also the prevention of disputes in future through a system of tripartite dialogue. Prime Minister Gunawardena briefed them on the impact the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis had on the labour workforce, and the short-term and long-term steps taken by the government towards economic recovery while also aiding labourers, particularly those within the low-income range. He further stressed that the government was very keen to make the countrys labour workforce upwardly mobile and thus explained the multitude of training programmes launched for skill development. Increasing the quality and quantity of jobs is the surest way of moving people out of poverty, he said. He said Sri Lanka has implanted the ILO regulations on the labour work force and provided opportunities for both, men and women, to obtain productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake and UN Country Office Analyst Nethali Madawala also took part in the discussion.",

        "content": "General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) Udayanga Rathna Diwakara on Thursday (01 Feb.) filed a petition before the Court of Appeals, seeking a writ order annulling the Cabinet decision that SLIC be split into two institutions. A total of 56 persons, including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, the Cabinet of Ministers, the SLIC and its Board of Directors, were named as respondents in the petition which claims that such a decision cannot be made solely by the Cabinet in the absence of parliamentary approval. Diwakara further pointed out that the SLIC is not only a profit-making institution but also one that also brings large amounts of welfare benefits to the public. Apart from requesting the Appellate Court to issue an interim order against the relevant decision, in his petition Diwakara also sought an order against the SLICs Board of Directors, preventing the companys assets and properties from being split into two institutions. The Cabinet of Ministers, at its meeting on 13 March 2023, gave the nod to take necessary action to operate the life and general insurance businesses of the SLIC as separate legal entities. Cabinet approval had been given in compliance with the provisions of the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act No. 3 of 2011 under the state-owned enterprises (SEOs) restructuring. Later on 18 December, the Cabinet green-lighted a proposal tabled by the President to segregate the life and general insurance businesses of SLIC to the fully owned subsidiaries of the said corporation  Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited.",

        "date": "February 2, 2024 08:26 am",
        "content": "The island-wide strike action launched by the collective of health sector trade unions yesterday entered its second consecutive day today (Feb.02). President of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana said a final decision is expected to be taken on proceeding with the strike later today at the discussion planned to be convened with the participation of trade union representatives. Health workers decided to carry on the trade union action on account of not receiving a favourable response from the government with regard to their demands. A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector resorted to a one-day strike across the country last morning (Feb.01), urging the government to address the issues concerning allowances without delay. The doctors unions and the All Ceylon Nurses Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government. In response to the island-wide strike, tri-force personnel were deployed to the state hospitals across the country, depending on the requirements at each facility to ensure uninterrupted provision of essential medical services to the public. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers approved President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Since then, the trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the governments decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees. Later, on January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. This prompted the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, the planned trade union action was later called off, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back.",

        "date": "February 2, 2024 08:42 am",
        "content": "The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBCs US partner CBS News. The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched. It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack. That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Irans Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sundays strike. Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22. US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose. I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable, he said, adding that there is no set formula for doing this. There are ways to manage this so it doesnt spiral out of control. And thats been our focus throughout, Mr Austin continued. The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians. President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washingtons most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil. But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region. Thats not what Im looking for, Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week. The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran. Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies. A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region. US officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October. The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend. The three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. All three were part of an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, Georgia. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The former health minister was supposed to make an appearance before the CID on Wednesday (Jan.31), but he failed to do so on account of attending the proceedings of a case heard before the Colombo High Court, as well as a ministerial sub-committee meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat. Thus, Rambukwella had sought the CID, in writing, to fix another date for him to provide his statement. On Thursday (Feb.01), the Maligakanda Magistrate ordered the former health minister to appear before the CID to record a statement pertaining to his alleged involvement in the substandard medicines procurement. Additionally, the lawmaker was also slapped with a foreign travel ban. Meanwhile, a group of civil society activists engaged in a Satyagraha campaign in front of the CID premises on Wednesday demanding the immediate arrest of Rambukwella. Ten activists who were taken into police custody during the Satyagraha campaign were later granted bail on the orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. Against this backdrop, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Health Dr. Saman Ratnakaye was grilled by the CID officers for nearly 10 hours on Wednesday over the procurement of substandard medicines.",

The retired naval person in question was reportedly the leading gunman in this mass murder. Thus far, 11 suspects in total have been arrested over the shooting which took place on January 23 near the Beliatta interchange of the Southern Expressway. Among the arrestees is the driver of the vehicle in which the assailants had arrived. A group of assailants in an SUV had opened fire at a white Defender, killing four persons at the scene. The fifth person who was inside the Defender was rushed to the Tangalle Hospital with critical gunshot wounds, but he was pronounced dead shortly. Among the deceased was the leader of Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya (Our Power of People Party or OPPP) Saman Perera. The other four victims were identified as Sameera Madhusanka, Hasitha Chinsuka, Buddhika Rajapaksha, and Nalin Champika. The SUV was later found while parked near the Vidyaloka Pirivena in Galle. The 39-year-old wife of the aforementioned retired naval person and the 72-year-old father, who aided and abetted the mass shooting, were reportedly apprehended while in possession of 21g and 350mg of heroin in the Muddaragama area of Pathagama, Pallewela.

A lorry carrying gas exploded in Embakasi district around 23:30 (20:30 GMT), igniting a huge ball of fire, a government spokesperson said. Housing, businesses and cars were damaged with video showing a huge blaze raging close to blocks of flats. Earlier, the government had said the blast happened at a gas plant. The cause is still being established. Mr Mwaura said the fireball from the blast had spread widely, and a flying gas cylinder had hit a garments and textiles warehouse, burning it down. The blaze is also reported to have spread through several apartment complexes. Witnesses told local media they had felt tremors immediately after the blast. Many of the injured are said to have inhalation injuries and they include at least 25 children, the Standard newspaper reports. One of those hurt, Boniface Sifuna, described what had happened for Reuters news agency: I got burnt by an exploding gas canister as I was trying to escape, he said. It exploded right in front of me and the impact knocked me down and the flames engulfed me. I am lucky that I was strong enough to get away. An unnamed eyewitness speaking to the Nation newspaper spoke of huge explosions, huge fireballs, people screaming and running everywhere for fear of more explosions. A Nation journalist living in the area said everyone had left their houses after the blast. The Kenya Red Cross said on social media that crews had been tirelessly battling the flames. Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the blast scene had been secured and a command centre had been set up to help co-ordinate rescue operations.

        "date": "February 2, 2024 01:45 pm",
        "content": "TikTok has had music from the worlds biggest music company, Universal Music Group (UMG), removed from its platform after the two parties failed to agree on new contractual terms. It means that users videos can no longer be soundtracked by music from hundreds of artists ranging from megastars such as Taylor Swift, Abba and Harry Styles to emerging musicians, with fans quickly expressing dismay on social media. UMG artists who use TikTok to promote their work and interact with fans can no longer post their own music. Videos that once carried UMG music now trigger a variety of messages such as this sound isnt available or this music is currently unavailable. The content removal comes a day after UMG posted an open letter accusing TikTok of bullying and intimidation, and complaining of how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content. TikTok said UMG had chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent. The two companies have not made fresh statements since the content removal. In refusing a deal that it saw as not adequately compensating its artists, UMG will position itself as a protector of artist revenues  but there will also be fears that the decision will shut its artists out of an important cultural meeting place, and diminish their marketing power. Viral dance challenges on TikTok complete with a song soundtrack, for example, have helped to propel stars such as Megan Thee Stallion and Victoria Monét to wider fame. Noah Kahan, who is top of the UK singles chart with Stick Season, addressed the decision on TikTok, saying with a concerned expression: I wont be able to promote my music on TikTok any more  Ill probably be OK, right? Ill probably land on my feet, right? Right? But some artists have found engaging with TikTok a hindrance to their creativity, and an experience that negatively shapes approaches to songwriting. Metro Boomin, one of the leading producers in rap music, wrote on X following the publication of the UMG open letter: I love the creativity and appreciation the kids show for the music on TikTok but I dont like the forced pandering from artists and labels that results in these lifeless and soulless records.

        "date": "February 2, 2024 02:28 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday (Feb.02) concluded the hearing of petitions filed challenging the governments new Anti-Terrorism Bill following the lengthy proceedings that continued for six days in total. Accordingly, the determination of the Supreme Court is slated to be forwarded to the Speaker of Parliament soon. Thirty-one petitions had been put forward against the proposed legislation which seeks to replace the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Among the petitioners are His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ranjith Madduma Bandara, National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath, Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Socialist Youth Union (SYU), Duminda Nagamuwa of Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and the Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU). The Attorney General has been listed as the respondent of these petitions filed seeking a Supreme Court order mandating a parliamentary vote with a two-thirds majority and a referendum to pass the Bill, which was tabled in the parliament on January 10. They say the Bill, if passed in its current form, would grant unlimited powers to the Tri-Forces, the Police and the Coast Guard to make unwarranted arrests without reasonable suspicion, and this is a violation of the fundamental rights including the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution.",

        "date": "February 2, 2024 02:33 pm",
        "content": "The Online Safety Act has been published in the government gazette, bringing it into effect as the Online Safety Act, No. 9 of 2024. Accordingly, the Act will provide for the establishment of the Online Safety Commission, safety from prohibited statements made online and prevention of the use of online accounts and inauthentic online accounts for prohibited purposes. It is also expected to make provisions to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes in Sri Lanka and suppress the financing and other support of communication of prohibited statements and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech. Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena endorsed the Online Safety Bill on February 01, despite the calls urging him not to sign it without verifying whether the Supreme Courts directives are fully adhered to. The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects. A total of 45 petitions had been put forward by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National Peoples Power (NPP), journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara and many other parties, alleging that the relevant bill violates the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Later, the Supreme Court concluded the deliberation of petitions and communicated its determination on the constitutionality of the Bill and its provisions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament. Supreme Court had emphasized that pursuant to Article 84(2) of the Constitution, Clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 42, 45, 53, and 56 should be passed by a special majority in the parliament. However, if these clauses are amended during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in the parliament, the determination read further.

        "date": "February 2, 2024 02:47 pm",
        "content": "The Ambassador of the United States to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung has hailed Sri Lankas Pekoe Trail being profiled among the Top 20 Travel Experiences for 2024 as named by National Geographics Global Editorial Teams. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), the US envoy mentioned that the historic trail was further developed with funding support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the European Union (EU), adding that it is an example of how the US and Sri Lankan partnerships develop tourism entrepreneurism and encourage people from all over the world to Visit Sri Lanka. The National Geographic recently announced their picks for BEST OF THE WORLD 2024, the brands annual guide of the most exciting, meaningful, and one-of-a-kind travel experiences for 2024, whereas the Pekoe Trail, a 300km trekking trail that travels through the central hills of Sri Lanka, was ranked number 16 in the Top 20 Travel Experiences category. Furthermore, the Nat Geo states: Sri Lanka is virtually synonymous with tea. The island nation is one of the worlds top producers of tea leaves. British colonists introduced the first bushes about 200 years ago. Now visitors can trace the footsteps of historic planters on the new, nearly 200-mile Pekoe Trail, the countrys first long-distance walking route. Starting just outside Kandy, the trail follows the 19th-century tracks upon which workers and horse-drawn carts transported freshly plucked leaves. Hikers pass through hill towns and tea estates and can stop to take a cooking class or savor a cup of aromatic Ceylon tea. The Pekoe Trail, a 300km, 22-stage discovery of Sri Lanka on foot, is creating international headlines for Sri Lanka as a destination for wellness and nature-based travel. It is a unique tourism experience that supports the long-term environmental sustainability of habitats as well as the social and commercial sustainability of the communities it passes through. Commenting on this achievement the European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka Carmen Moreno said, We are thrilled that The Pekoe Trail continues to attract the global travel media limelight for Sri Lanka at a time when we need to maximize the momentum for tourism recovery. Funded by the European Union, The Pekoe Trail is a unique close-to-nature, wellness tourism experience for travelers, that also provides economic growth opportunities for communities along the Trail. Meanwhile, Chief of Staff to the President, Sagala Ratnayaka, emphasized the national significance of this ranking: Sri Lanka is set to attract a trending new international tourist segment with The Pekoe Trail that offers a world-class nature-based experience in our tea country. This recognition from Nat Geo validates the collaborative efforts of the Plantation companies, Sri Lanka Tourism, Dept. of Wildlife Conservation, Dept. of Forest Conservation, Sri Lanka Railways, the JEDB, the European Union and USAID in creating a world class walking trail.",

        "content": "LAUGFS Gas PLC has also decided not to revise the prices of domestic LP gas cylinders in the month of February, mirroring Litro Gas Lankas move. The current prices are as follows: 12.5kg cylinder - Rs. 4,740 5kg cylinder - Rs. 1,900 The announcement comes hours after Litro Gas Lanka revealed its decision to not amend the prices this month according to the pricing formula. Addressing a special media briefing this morning (Feb.02), Litro Chairman Muditha Peiris said the decision was reached after taking into account the financial difficulties facing the members of the public. Although the domestic gas cylinder prices should ideally be increased in line with the price hikes in the global market, Mr. Peiris said the company decided to bear the greater share of the loss incurred on account of non-revision of rates. After the price hike announced in January, Litros domestic gas prices now stand at the following rates: 12.5kg cylinder - Rs. 4,250 5kg cylinder - Rs. 1,707 2.3 kg cylinder - Rs. 795",

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has permitted to withdraw three petitions filed against the late State Minister Sanath Nishantha over contempt of court charges. The relevant petitions were taken up before the two-member judge bench consisting of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola today (Feb. 02). There, the attorneys-at-law who appeared on behalf of the petitioning parties told the court that the petitions are not required to be maintained since the defendant of the case, State Minister Sanath Nishantha has passed away, and therefore, requested permission to withdraw the relevant petitions. The Appeals Court, which accepted the request allowed the three petitions to be withdrawn. The petitions had been filed by the Sri Lanka Judicial Officers Association, Attorney-at-Law Priyalal Sirisena and Attorney-at-Law Vijitha Kumara, alleging that the late State Minister had tarnished the honour and the image of the judiciary by expressing critical views on the manner in which the magistrates acted in granting bail to the suspects involved in the Aragalaya protest movement while speaking during a media conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) headquarters on 23 August 2022.",
