He credited the Presidents foresight for recognizing the potential of digitization and AI in building the economy, noting that these methods have stabilized economies worldwide. To propel the country forward in line with the developing world, he stressed the need to provide more opportunities for digitalization and AI, aiming to increase the digital economys contribution from 3 to 20. The 2024 budget has allocated funds for this purpose, including financial incentives for new innovations.

        "date": "December 19, 2023 06:38 am",
        "content": "At least 111 people were killed and more than 230 injured after an earthquake hit the Gansu-Qinghai border region in China on Tuesday, according to reports by state media. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) had pegged the earthquake at magnitude 6.1. Chinese state media said the quake was registered at 6.2 magnitude. The quake occurred at a depth of 35 km (21.75 miles) with its epicentre 102 km west-southwest of Gansus provincial capital city, Lanzhou, EMSC said. Official reports have not stated whether there are any missing people in the quakes aftermath. The official Xinhua news agency said the epicentre was 5 km from the border between the two northwestern provinces, reporting that strong tremors were felt in many parts of Qinghai province. Chinas national commission for disaster prevention, reduction and relief and Ministry of Emergency Management have activated a level-IV disaster relief emergency, Xinhua reported. As the disaster area is in a high-altitude region where the weather is cold, rescue efforts are working to prevent secondary disasters caused by factors beyond the quake, Xinhua said. The temperature in Linxia, Gansu, near where the quake occurred, was about minus 14 degrees Celsius (6.8F) on Tuesday morning. Most of China is grappling with freezing temperatures as a cold wave that started last week continued to sweep through the country. Some water, electricity, transportation, communications and other infrastructure have been damaged but officials provided no further details. Rescue and relief work is under way and a working group was dispatched to assess the impact of the disaster and to provide guidance for local relief operations, state media said. Preliminary analysis shows that the quake was a thrust-type rupture, one of three above magnitude 6 to have struck within 200km of the epicentre since 1900, state television CCTV said. A total of nine aftershocks at magnitude 3.0 and above were recorded before dawn Tuesday, CCTV said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "One of the two suspects, who are believed to be complicit in the disappearance of a golden tray offered to the Ruhunu Kataragama Devalaya, has surrendered to the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD). The chief custodian and the custodian who was in charge of the storage room of the Kataragama Devalaya remained unaccounted for over the past few days. After submissions were presented to Tissamaharama Court regarding the incident, the Attorney General had directed the CCD to arrest the two custodians. However, when the CCD officers visited the houses of the two custodians, the family members told them that the duo had travelled to Colombo to seek medical treatment. In 2019, the wife of the notorious fugitive gangster Angoda Lokka, who was found dead in Coimbatore, India in 2020, had offered the 38-pound golden tray to the Kataragama Devalaya. Investigations revealed that the golden tray had subsequently been placed inside the room of the chief custodian, Somipala Ratnayake. After the Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya learned the disappearance of the item, a formal complaint was lodged in 2021. The investigations were subsequently handed over to the CCD on the directives of the Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. The CCD officers later sought the advice of the Attorney General in this regard. According to investigation officers, it was the custodian who was in charge of the storage room who surrendered to the police.",

        "title": "Rajiv case convict can only be repatriated to Sri Lanka, Madras High Court told",
        "date": "December 19, 2023 10:38 am",
        "content": "Former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict Murugan alias Sriharan can only be repatriated to Sri Lanka, that too if its Deputy High Commission in Chennai issues the necessary travel documents, and cannot be sent to the United Kingdom as sought by him, the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) told the Madras High Court on Monday. Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices D. Krishnakumar and P. Dhanabal, Additional Solicitor General AR.L. Sundaresan said sending the convict to the United Kingdom might set a bad precedent, and that other foreigners who enter the country without valid travel documents would also insist on deporting them to a country of their choice instead of their home country. On the other hand, the petitioners counsel V. Elangovan argued there were precedents of foreigners having been sent to a country of their choice and claimed that, in 2001, Ruban alias Sivaruban was allowed to fly to the United Kingdom. However, the senior judge in the Bench said it was too premature to decide that question in the present writ petition. The Bench said the convict, now lodged in a special camp in Tiruchi, had only sought a direction to the State government to provide escort for visiting the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai to obtain an all-country passport. The State government had, on its own accord, agreed to provide such an escort if he was called for an interview by the Deputy High Commission. Therefore, if he receives any intimation from the Commission for the interview, he could forward it to the Public Department Secretary and Tiruchi Collector for providing the escort, the judges ordered. Only after coming to know whether the Deputy High Commission chooses to issue a passport or just a one-time travel document, a further request could be made to the FRRO regarding deportation, they added. Filing an affidavit on behalf of the petitioner, his wife, S. Nalini, 58, said her husband was a Sri Lankan Tamil who, she claimed, had come to India on January 26, 1991, to pursue his studies because of the ethnic problem in the island nation. After Rajiv Gandhis assassination in May 1991, the couple was arrested along with many others by the Central Bureau of Investigation on July 14, 1991. Claiming both of them were innocent, the deponent of the affidavit said they were implicated on the basis of a false confession prepared by the investigators. However, a special court for Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act cases awarded death sentence to them on January 28, 1998. The sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court, too, on May 11, 1999. Though her sentence was commuted to life term in the year 2000, the Supreme Court commuted her husbands capital punishment to life sentence only on February 18, 2014, after a prolonged legal battle. Thereafter, on September 9, 2018, the State Cabinet passed a resolution to release all the seven convicts in the assassination case and, accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered their release on November 11, 2022. Despite being released on November 12, 2002, her husband was lodged in a special camp (foreigners detention centre), within the Tiruchi central prison, as he was a Sri Lankan national, she said. Further, stating that her husband cannot go to his home country due to the present situation there, she said, There is no safety in Sri Lanka to his life. Since their daughter, born in prison on January 21, 1992, was now residing in the United Kingdom, and her husbands five siblings were also residing in the same country, Ms. Nalini said she and her husband would prefer flying down to the United Kingdom directly from India, for which he required an all-country passport from the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai.

When Jabbari grabbed the device from his hands, Majors twisted her arm in a position that caused her excruciating pain and struck her in the head, Jabbari told jurors. Majors then took the phone back, got out of the vehicle and took off running through the streets of lower Manhattan as Jabbari chased behind him, street surveillance footage presented during the trial showed. The former couple met in 2021 on the set of Marvels Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which was released a month before Majors arrest. Jabbari was working as a movement coach and Majors was playing the time-travelling villain He Who Remains, AKA Kang the Conqueror. The film was meant to be the jump-off point for a new cinematic era for the studio and lead to more projects between the actor and Marvel, including both seasons of the Loki series and Avengers: The Kang Dynasty set to come out in May 2026, according to Deadline. The feature is still in the script phase and had not begun filming, said a report from the Hollywood Reporter. No director is currently attached. It remains unclear whether the character of Kang will be recast (a la Terrance Howard and Don Cheadle in the Captain America series) and remain in future films or if the studio will scrap future projects based around the character altogether and steer the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a new direction. Marvel did not respond to the Guardians request for comment on their relationship with Majors by the time of publication. Majors was once considered a rising star in Hollywood, rising to prominence in The Last Black Man in San Francisco and going on to blockbusters such as Devotion, Lovecraft Country, The Harder They Fall, Da 5 Bloods and Creed III. Magazine Dreams, where Majors starred as a troubled amateur bodybuilder, made a successful debut at the Sundance film festival in January and was slated to open in theaters this month. Ahead of the trial, Searchlight Pictures, a Disney-owned distributor, had pulled the film from its release calendar, according to the Associated Press. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Majors public relations firm, The Lede Company, has dropped the actor. He has also been dropped by his managers at Entertainment 360. Majors is set to be sentenced in February and faces up to a year in prison for the third degree assault charge. Source: The Guardian -Agencies",

        "date": "December 19, 2023 03:44 pm",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan sous chef has been charged with murder over the alleged stabbing death of a young female colleague in a kitchen storeroom at a Canberra zoo, Australian media reported today. Jude Wijesinghe, 29, was arrested on Monday night and taken to hospital under police guard with significant self-inflicted stab wounds. News.com.au confirmed that the victim is a 29-year-old Bhutanese national. ATC Policing confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that Wijesinghe had been charged with murder, the report said. ACT Policing homicide detectives have today charged a 29-year-old man with one count of murder during a bedside hearing following an incident at the National Zoo  Aquarium yesterday, an ACT Policing spokesperson confirmed. The man was refused bail, and will next appear in court on 4 April 2023. The woman, who has not yet been identified, was found at 12.50pm in a commercial kitchen at the National Zoo  Aquarium of Yarralumla. Police stormed Wijesinghes apartment in Oaks Estate around 2pm and spent hours inside, neighbours told Daily Mail Australia. Hes been here about one to two years, one resident told the publication. Before that, there was a group of guys living in there. I cant believe it, another said. Its all a bit of a shock. Wijesinghe was a chef at Jamala Wildlife Lodge, which is part of the National Zoo  Aquarium, and regularly shared snaps of his culinary creations to social media. Its understood he migrated to Australia from Sri Lanka. He studied in Adelaide before working in kitchens across the country. Metho Dema, First Secretary at the Royal Bhutanese Embassy in Canberra today told news.com.au the victim is from Bhutan. She added the close-knit Bhutanese community was deeply affected by the young womans death. The Embassy is in close contact with the bereaved family of the deceased as well as the Police and providing consular support, Ms Dema said. The close-knit Bhutanese community in Canberra is deeply affected by this tragic incident involving a member of our community and is rallying around the bereaved family during this very difficult period. On behalf of the family and our community, we request that the media respect their privacy and allow them space to grieve this extremely tragic and sad loss. ACT Policing Detective Superintendent of Criminal Investigations Hall OMeagher said witnesses heard loud screams around the kitchen area and responded to the disturbance. A homicide investigation has commenced and further inquiries will include an examination of the scene forensically, talking to witnesses and a post-mortem examination that will confirm the cause of death of this woman, he said. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim. The knife police allege was used in the stabbing was found at the scene. Photos from the scene show an extensive police response, with investigators interviewing people at the zoo. The incident was contained to the zoo and there is no further threat to the ACT community, the police said. The man is recovering in hospital under police guard, according to News.com.au. Police do not know if the pair were in a relationship and are investigating this line of inquiry. They added that the zoo would be closed for some time. The National Zoo  Aquarium is privately owned 19-hectare zoo and aquarium at the western end of Lake Burley Griffin next to the Scrivener Dam. The zoo is known for having the largest collection of big cats in Australia, including, until recently, the only tigon (a tiger, lion cross breed) in Australasia. Source: News.com.au --Agencies",

        "date": "December 19, 2023 03:56 pm",
        "content": "Pastor Jerome Fernando, who currently remains in remand custody over his controversial remarks on several religions, has been abusing the criminal justice system in the country by filing various cases, Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena alleged while speaking in court while appearing on behalf of a group of religious leaders. The Presidents Counsel stated this when a petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando, seeking a ruling to invalidate the order issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to remand him in custody, was taken up before the Court of Appeal today (19). The relevant petition was called before the Appeals Court Judge D.N. Samarakoon for the presenting of written submissions. The Presidents Counsel mentioned that the Pastor had initially filed a Fundamental Rights petition before the court, seeking an order preventing his arrest while naming the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID as the respondents of the petition. He alleged that Fernando, who submitted another writ petition before the Court of Appeal regarding the same matter, withdrew the petition when the court was ready to consider it, and then submitted another petition related to the same matter. The Presidents Counsel accused the petitioner of trying to circumvent the law by submitting petitions to various courts regarding the same matter, while also accused him of abusing the criminal justice process in the country. Furthermore, he mentioned that Pastor Jerome has not been given any special privilege before the law to act this way. The Attorney General had raised preliminary objections against Pastor Jeromes petition yesterday (19). However, the Court of Appeal announced that the decision pertaining to the relevant preliminary objections will be delivered on Wednesday (Dec. 20).",

        "title": "Iceland volcano erupts after weeks of intense seismic activity",
        "date": "December 19, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "A volcano has erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula of south-west Iceland after weeks of intense earthquake activity. About 4,000 people were earlier evacuated from the fishing town of Grindavik and the nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal spa was closed. The eruption started north of the town at 22:17 local time (22:17 GMT), the Icelandic Met Office said. It will not bring the same level of disruption as one in 2010, which halted European air travel, an expert said. The region around the capital Reykjavik has been experiencing an increase in earthquake activity since late October. The Met Office said that the eruption was located about 4km (2.5 miles) north-east of Grindavik and the seismic activity was moving towards the town. Images and videos posted on social media showed lava bursting from the volcano just an hour after an earthquake swarm, or seismic events, were detected. The eruption can be seen from Reykjavik, which is about 42km north-east of Grindavik. One eyewitness there told the BBC that half of the sky in the direction of the town was lit up in red from the eruption, and smoke could be seen billowing into the air. Police have warned people to stay away from the area. The length of the crack in the volcano is about 3.5km, with the lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second, the Met Office said. It added that this was many times more than in previous eruptions on the Reykjanes peninsula in recent years. A senior police officer at the Civil Defence told national broadcaster RUV that the eruption had happened quickly and appeared to be quite a large event. Vidir Reynisson said the lava appeared to be flowing in all directions from a large crack in the volcano. Icelands foreign minister, Bjarni Benediktsson said on X, formerly Twitter, that there are no disruptions to flights to and from Iceland, and international flight corridors remain open. The jets of lava are quite high, so it appears to be a powerful eruption at the beginning, he said. Hallgrimur Indrioason, a reporter for the state-owned Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV), said the eruption could be seen from Reykjavik - about 50km away - and described the view was quite spectacular. Iceland has been on high alert for a potential volcano eruption for several weeks, and last month authorities ordered people to leave Grindavík as a precaution. There were no reports of injuries. In April 2010, an ash cloud from the Eyjafjallajokull volcanic eruption caused the largest closure of European airspace since World War Two, with losses estimated at between 1.5bn and 2.5bn euros (1.3-2.2bn; 1.6-2.7bn). Volcanologist Dr Evgenia Ilyinskaya told the BBC that there would not be the same level of disruption as 2010, as these volcanoes in south-west Iceland are physically not able to generate the same ash clouds. The Eyjafjallajokul volcano, in south Iceland, is about 140km (87 miles) from the volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula. Speaking from Iceland, Dr Ilyinskaya, associate professor of volcanology at Leeds University, said local people had been both fearing and waiting for the volcano to erupt. There was a lot of uncertainty. It was a difficult period of time for local people, she said. She added that authorities were preparing for potential lava flows that could destroy homes and infrastructure, including the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination. At the moment it seems not to be threatening, although it remains to be seen, she said. Icelands Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said defences recently constructed would have a positive effect. She said her thoughts were with the local community and she was hoping for the best despite the significant event. President Gudni Johannesson said safeguarding lives was the main priority but that every effort would be made to protect structures too. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Indian Parliament winter session: opposition fury as 141 MPs suspended",
        "date": "December 19, 2023 05:36 pm",
        "content": "Indias parliament has witnessed heated protests after 49 more opposition MPs were suspended, taking the total number of barred lawmakers to 141. The MPs were protesting against last weeks security breach in parliament. On Monday, the opposition accused Prime Minister Narendra Modis government of attacking democracy after a record 78 MPs were suspended in one day. Most of the lawmakers have been barred for the rest of the winter session, which ends on Friday. But around two dozen of them may have to stay away for longer, depending on the decision of the parliaments privileges committee. Most of the suspended MPs are part of the INDIA alliance, a coalition of opposition parties that hopes to take on Mr Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in next years general election. The alliance has 142 MPs in the 543-member Lok Sabha - the lower house of parliament - of which 95 have now been suspended. It has 101 MPs in the 250-member upper house or Rajya Sabha (a few seats are vacant) - of these, 46 have been suspended. Unfortunately, we have to start writing obituaries for parliamentary democracy in India, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday after being suspended. The governing BJP has accused the opposition leaders of deliberately disrupting parliament proceedings. The developments are expected to worsen already frosty relations between the opposition and Mr Modis government. Many opposition MPs had been demanding a statement in parliament from either federal Home Minister Amit Shah or Mr Modi on last weeks security breach - two people entered parliament and set off coloured gas and shouted slogans, while two others protested outside parliament. Six people have been arrested so far in the case, with police charging the four protesters under a stringent anti-terror law. Police have not officially disclosed a motive, but media reports and the families of the accused have said the protesters were unemployed and wanted to express their frustration with the governments policies. The breach occurred on the 22nd anniversary of a deadly militant attack on the parliament. Opposition MPs have also asked for a discussion in parliament on the security lapse. Though Mr Modi did not speak in parliament on the issue, he told a Hindi newspaper that what happened is very serious. There is no need to debate this, there should be a detailed investigation into this, he told the Dainik Jagran newspaper. Mr Shah has also not spoken in parliament, but said at an event that a high-level enquiry had been ordered into the incident and accused the opposition of politicising the security breach. PM can give an interview to a newspaper, home minister can give interviews to TV channels, said Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition Congress party. But they have zero accountability left to parliament, which represents the people of India. Mr Kharge, a member of the Rajya Sabha, has not been suspended yet. Manoj Kumar Jha, an MP from the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal, called his suspension a badge of honour. Its a recognition that they are trying to suppress the questions we opposition are raising, he told reporters on Monday. Some opposition MPs including Mr Kharge have alleged that the government has deliberately suspended many opposition leaders to pass important bills without debate. But federal minister Piyush Goyal, who on Monday moved a motion to suspend 34 MPs in the upper house, called the oppositions protest a pre-planned strategy to disrupt the functioning of parliament and block important bills. He also accused opposition MPs of disrespecting the parliament and insulting the Lok Sabha speaker and Rajya Sabha chairman by refusing to heed their requests to not bring protest signs to the well of the house.

Oshada Jayasundera, aged 31, a mature student at Nottingham Trent University, was pronounced dead at the scene on Huntingdon Street on Wednesday. His family, who live in Sri Lanka, said their hearts were heavy with grief. Joshua Gregory, 27, is facing four charges, including causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by driving whilst uninsured. Mr Jayasundera, who was on an MSc project management course, was described as an engaged and committed student by the university. Unfortunate tragedy His family, who were calling for justice in a statement, said: It is with profound sorrow that we share the devastating news of the tragic passing of our beloved family member, Oshada Jayasundera, in a fatal accident. Our hearts are heavy with grief as we come to terms with this unfortunate incident. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Nottinghamshire Police staff, Nottingham Trent University staff members, Coroners Office, The High Commission of Sri Lanka in the UK, the Sri Lanka Foreign Ministry, Nottingham Shanthi Vihara and Meditation Centre as well as friends and colleagues. Their unwavering support and guidance has been a source of strength during these challenging times. We hope that no-one will have to endure such an unfortunate tragedy in the future. As we grieve deeply, we earnestly hope for justice to prevail in this matter in honour of Oshadas memory. Mr Gregory, of Westfield Road in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, has been charged with four offences. These include causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by driving whilst uninsured, failure to stop after a road accident, and failure to provide a specimen for analysis. He has been remanded into custody and will next appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 12 January. An IOPC spokesperson previously said it had started an investigation into the pursuit after being notified by the force. We sent our investigators to the police post-incident process and scene to begin gathering information, including initial accounts from the officers involved and other police witnesses, they said. We are also gathering police dashcam and body-worn video footage. We understand that the Focus initially came to the attention of police at about 03:10 GMT but officers lost sight of it. A pursuit began when officers in another vehicle spotted the Focus, which subsequently collided with a male pedestrian shortly after 03:20. Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic incident. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 19, 2023 06:34 pm",
        "content": "The European Union has opened an investigation into Elon Musks social media platform X under its Digital Services Act (DSA). European Commissioner Thierry Breton said the EU had opened a formal infringement proceeding against the platform formerly known as Twitter for suspected breach of obligations to counter illegal content and disinformation, suspected breach of transparency obligations, and suspected deceptive design of the user interface. The investigation marks one of the first big test cases of the DSA since it was announced earlier this year. The legislation is intended to prevent the spread of misinformation or violent content. X has faced increasing pressure to regulate its content following its multi-billion-dollar acquisition by Musk last year. In October, the EU ratcheted up pressure on the San Francisco-based company to provide information on its handling of hate speech, misinformation, and violent terrorist content related to the Israel-Hamas war. The social media platform says it is committed to complying with the Digital Services Act, and is cooperating with the regulatory process. It is important that this process remains free of political influence and follows the law. X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal, the company said in a statement. Musk has touted the platform as a place for free speech to thrive. But certain changes since he took over  such as cutting the number of content moderators and restoring the banned accounts of divisive public personalities  have turned off users and advertisers, who have fled in droves. The EUs investigation will look into whether X failed to do enough to curb the spread of illegal content  such as hate speech or incitement of terrorism  to its 112 million users in Europe. That includes the effectiveness of Xs tools for users to flag up illegal material in posts and ads so that it can be swiftly removed, as well as whether the company is following its policies on restricting sensitive content. The EU has called out X as the worst place online for fake news, and officials have exhorted Musk to do more to clean up the platform. A raft of big tech companies faced stricter scrutiny after the DSA took effect earlier this year, threatening penalties of up to 6 of their global revenue  which could amount to billions  or even a ban from the EU. Fines are considered a last-ditch resort, and Brussels could first use interim measures to force companies to comply. Source: Fox Business --Agencies",

        "date": "December 19, 2023 10:42 pm",
        "content": "Sagala Ratnayaka, the Senior Advisor on National Security to the President and Chief of Presidential Staff, has recommended extending the implementation of the Wolbachia special dengue control project. This initiative has demonstrated success in controlling dengue in the Colombo North Health Medical Officer Division and is proposed to be expanded to all Health Medical Officer Divisions in the Colombo and Gampaha districts. Accordingly, Ratnayaka has offered guidance to the relevant authorities in this regard, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. He emphasized the need to secure the support of the armed forces and the police and also suggested assigning responsibilities to the relevant government institutions to formally address dengue control in governmental bodies. Ratnayaka issued these directives during a progress review meeting on the current status of the program to control the spread of dengue held at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday (Dec.18). During this meeting, presided over by the State Minister for Health, Dr. Seetha Arambepola, and attended by the Chief of Presidential Staff, there was a comprehensive review of the implementation of decisions made during discussions with the National Dengue Control Unit on December 05 and their current progress. Further, the meeting delved extensively into the measures adopted in the past to control the spread of dengue, with a particular focus on health medical officer divisions that have witnessed a surge in dengue cases, especially in the Western Province. Emphasis was placed on the significant control achieved in the spread of dengue, attributed to various awareness and monitoring measures supported by the armed forces and the police. The meeting highlighted that the continued implementation of these programs in the upcoming weeks is expected to further enhance control. Central provincial health authorities, engaging in the meeting through Zoom technology, brought attention to a rise in dengue cases in government institutions, schools, religious places, public areas and private institutions. Recognizing a notable number of patients within the Kandy Municipal Council and Matale Municipal Council limits, Central Provincial Health Authorities have devised additional measures in collaboration with the Colombo Municipal Council to address and control the situation. Concerning the dengue control in the central province, a committee led by the central province governor and chief secretary oversees all monitoring activities across health and medical officer divisions in the province. The authorities further declared the ongoing and expanded implementation of active dengue control programs to mitigate the spread. Ratnayaka provided instructions that all schools should receive information about dengue control. He urged relevant education authorities to coordinate the cleaning of school premises with parental involvement and report progress with photos. Additionally, he suggested a review of these programs in the first week of January 2024. Participants in this event included Defence Ministry Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne (Retired), Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Acting Inspector General of Police Deshbandu Tennakoon, and officials representing the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and Colombo Municipal Council.",

        "title": "Vatican approves blessings for same-sex couples in landmark ruling",
        "date": "December 19, 2023 10:46 pm",
        "content": "The Vatican said on Monday in a landmark ruling approved by Pope Francis that Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular Church rituals or liturgies. A document from the Vaticans doctrinal office, which effectively reversed a declaration the same body had issued in 2021, said such blessings would not legitimise irregular situations but be a sign that God welcomes all. It should in no way be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage, it added. It said priests should decide on a case-by-case basis and should not prevent or prohibit the Churchs closeness to people in every situation in which they might seek Gods help through a simple blessing. The pope hinted that an official change was in the works in October in response to questions put forward by five conservative cardinals at the start of a synod of bishops at the Vatican. While the response in October was more nuanced, Mondays eight-page document, whose subtitle is On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings, spelled out specific situations. An 11-point section was titled Blessings of Couples in Irregular Situations and of Couples of the Same sex. The Church teaches that same-sex attraction is not sinful but homosexual acts are. Since his election in 2013, Francis has tried to make the more than 1.35-billion-member Church more welcoming to LGBT people without changing moral doctrine. Father James Martin, a prominent American Jesuit priest who ministers to the LGBT community, called the document a major step forward in the churchs ministry to them. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Martin said the document recognizes the deep desire in many Catholic same-sex couples for Gods presence in their loving relationships, adding that along with many priests, I will now be delighted to bless my friends in same-sex unions. Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a group that advocates for LGBT rights in the Church, said the documents importance cannot be overstated. He praised the documents wording that people seeking blessings should not be subjected to an exhaustive moral analysis. Martin Hardwick and Andrew Gibb of Manchester, England, who are married and have been together 41 years, said the move was long overdue. You know if Jesus said love was love, then love is love, isnt it? Hardwick said. Its about time, Gibb added. AN INVITATION TO SCHISM Mondays ruling is bound to be opposed by conservatives, who already criticised the pope when he made his initial comments on the subject in October. Ulrich L. Lehner, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame in the United States, said the new guidance from the doctrinal office invites misunderstanding and will sow confusion. Voicing concern that some bishops would use it as a pretext to do what is explicitly forbidden, the professor added, it is, and I hate to say it, an invitation to schism. The document, whose Latin title is Fiducia Supplicans (Supplicating Trust), said the form of the blessing should not be fixed ritually by ecclesial authorities to avoid producing confusion with the blessing proper to the Sacrament of Marriage. It said it can be applied to those who do not claim a legitimation of their own status, but who beg that all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives and their relationships be enriched, healed, and elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit. Ultimately, a blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God, it said, adding that it must be nurtured, not hindered. The document said the blessing should not be linked to or timed with a civil marriage ceremony and be performed with none of the clothing, gestures, or words that are proper to a wedding. Places for such blessings, it said, might be in other contexts, such as a visit to a shrine, a meeting with a priest, a prayer recited in a group, or during a pilgrimage. The ruling was signed by Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, the head of the head of the Vaticans Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by the pope in a private audience with Fernandez and another doctrinal office official on Monday.

        "date": "December 19, 2023 11:29 pm",
        "content": "Being part of the diaspora does not make someone an extremist or anti-Sri Lankan, says Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff, Sagala Ratnayaka. Speaking on the negative perception associated with the term diaspora in Sri Lanka, Ratnayake explained that any Sri Lankan living in another country, regardless of ethnicity or religion, is part of the diaspora. Ratnayake acknowledged historical events in Sri Lanka that have created distance between the country and its people, especially those living abroad. He highlighted the challenges faced by those in the diaspora who want to contribute to the countrys development but encounter bureaucratic obstacles. Addressing the International Migrant Day at the Presidents Office on Monday (Dec.18), Ratnayake emphasized the importance of engaging the diaspora and creating an environment that encourages their return and investment. During the event, the Chief of Presidential Staff inaugurated the official website, https:oosla.lk for the Office of Overseas Sri Lankan Affairs. The keynote address was delivered by Prof. Lakshman Samaranayake. In recognition of the exemplary services rendered by the Office of Sri Lankan Affairs Abroad, the Chief of Presidential Staff, along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, presented Prof. Samaranayake with a commemorative memento as a token of appreciation. Ratnayaka further said that the establishment of the Office for Overseas Sri Lankan Affairs (OOSLA) aligns with the broader economic reform process in Sri Lanka. While emphasizing the need for transparency, the Chief of Presidential Staff underscored the importance of offering a level playing field and attractiveness to make Sri Lanka an appealing place for investment opportunities, attracting Sri Lankans living abroad to invest in the country. The concept behind OOSLA was to create an overarching office that engages with the entire Sri Lankan diaspora. The aim is to assist Sri Lankans living abroad with issues like dual citizenship, passport renewals and obtaining information about their relations, with the broader goal of bringing together all Sri Lankans to contribute to the countrys development. Ratnayaka acknowledged the challenges faced by Sri Lanka, including economic difficulties, and expressed optimism about the future, anticipating rapid growth by the end of 2024 or early 2025. He emphasized the need for collective effort and clear communication to ensure citizens understand the governments commitment to improving their lives. Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, addressing the gathering, emphasized the significance of International Migrants Day, highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with migration. The Minister underscored the need for Sri Lanka to proactively engage with its diaspora, including both permanent migrants and temporary workers abroad. The Foreign Minister acknowledged Sri Lankas historical ties with migration, noting the shift from inward migration to the current trend of outward migration. He emphasized the challenges faced by those who have migrated and expressed the importance of creating conditions that encourage them to return to their homeland. Minister Sabry stressed the need to recognize the contributions of Sri Lankan migrants, both permanent residents and temporary workers. He highlighted the importance of providing them with respect, dignity, and a sense of belonging, in line with the principles outlined in the countrys constitution. He discussed the establishment of the Office of Overseas Sri Lankans (OOSLA) as a significant step towards addressing the concerns and needs of the diaspora. Minister Sabry announced the approval of a new law establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission with significant powers, including the ability to provide reparations, locate missing persons, and initiate prosecutions. He sees this as a positive step towards creating an environment conducive for fair living in the country. The lawmaker highlighted efforts to modernize services for expatriates, mentioning the aim to make all services, including immigration-related processes, accessible online. This move is intended to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and facilitate smoother interactions for Sri Lankans living abroad. Addressing the gathering Director General of the OOSLA, V. Krishnamurthy, highlighted that in accordance with the vision of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the office commenced its operations in January 2023. He emphasized that December 18 holds particular significance as it marks the opportune day to introduce the institution to the global Sri Lankan community. Krishnamurthy further noted that the diaspora, amounting to approximately 3 million in number, Sri Lankans who have relocated abroad for diverse reasons, has significantly influenced and contributed to the countrys economy. This acknowledgment underscores the profound impact and positive role played by this expatriate community during the preceding period. The event garnered participation from a distinguished assembly, including Ambassadors, High Commissioners, and Secretaries of Ministries representing foreign countries. Additionally, a substantial number of Sri Lankans residing abroad engaged in the proceedings through online technology. --PMD",

        "title": "Colorado Supreme Court disqualifies Trump from 2024 ballot",
        "date": "December 20, 2023 08:04 am",
        "content": "(AP)  A divided Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday declared former President Donald Trump ineligible for the White House under the U.S. Constitutions insurrection clause and removed him from the states presidential primary ballot, setting up a likely showdown in the nations highest court to decide whether the front-runner for the GOP nomination can remain in the race. The decision from a court whose justices were all appointed by Democratic governors marks the first time in history that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate. A majority of the court holds that Trump is disqualified from holding the office of president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the court wrote in its 4-3 decision. Colorados highest court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that the provision was intended to cover the presidency. The court stayed its decision until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by Jan. 5, the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots. We do not reach these conclusions lightly, wrote the courts majority. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach. Trumps attorneys had promised to appeal any disqualification immediately to the nations highest court, which has the final say about constitutional matters. Trumps legal spokeswoman Alina Habba said in a statement Tuesday night: This ruling, issued by the Colorado Supreme Court, attacks the very heart of this nations democracy. It will not stand, and we trust that the Supreme Court will reverse this unconstitutional order. Trump didnt mention the decision during a rally Tuesday evening in Waterloo, Iowa, but his campaign sent out a fundraising email citing what it called a tyrannical ruling. Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel labeled the decision Election interference and said the RNCs legal team intends to help Trump fight the ruling. Trump lost Colorado by 13 percentage points in 2020 and doesnt need the state to win next years presidential election. But the danger for the former president is that more courts and election officials will follow Colorados lead and exclude Trump from must-win states. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed nationally to disqualify Trump under Section 3, which was designed to keep former Confederates from returning to government after the Civil War. It bars from office anyone who swore an oath to support the Constitution and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against it, and has been used only a handful of times since the decade after the Civil War. I think it may embolden other state courts or secretaries to act now that the bandage has been ripped off, Derek Muller, a Notre Dame law professor who has closely followed the Section 3 cases, said after Tuesdays ruling. This is a major threat to Trumps candidacy. The Colorado case is the first where the plaintiffs succeeded. After a weeklong hearing in November, District Judge Sarah B. Wallace found that Trump indeed had engaged in insurrection by inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and her ruling that kept him on the ballot was a fairly technical one. Trumps attorneys convinced Wallace that, because the language in Section 3 refers to officers of the United States who take an oath to support the Constitution, it must not apply to the president, who is not included as an officer of the United States elsewhere in the document and whose oath is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The provision also says offices covered include senator, representative, electors of the president and vice president, and all others under the United States, but doesnt name the presidency. The states highest court didnt agree, siding with attorneys for six Colorado Republican and unaffiliated voters who argued that it was nonsensical to imagine that the framers of the amendment, fearful of former confederates returning to power, would bar them from low-level offices but not the highest one in the land. President Trump asks us to hold that Section 3 disqualifies every oathbreaking insurrectionist except the most powerful one and that it bars oath-breakers from virtually every office, both state and federal, except the highest one in the land, the courts majority opinion said. Both results are inconsistent with the plain language and history of Section 3. The left-leaning group that brought the Colorado case, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, hailed the ruling. Our Constitution clearly states that those who violate their oath by attacking our democracy are barred from serving in government, its president, Noah Bookbinder, said in a statement. Trumps attorneys also had urged the Colorado high court to reverse Wallaces ruling that Trump incited the Jan. 6 attack. His lawyers argued the then-president had simply been using his free speech rights and hadnt called for violence. Trump attorney Scott Gessler also argued the attack was more of a riot than an insurrection. That met skepticism from several of the justices. Why isnt it enough that a violent mob breached the Capitol when Congress was performing a core constitutional function? Justice William W. Hood III said during the Dec. 6 arguments. In some ways, that seems like a poster child for insurrection. In the ruling issued Tuesday, the courts majority dismissed the arguments that Trump wasnt responsible for his supporters violent attack, which was intended to halt Congress certification of the presidential vote: President Trump then gave a speech in which he literally exhorted his supporters to fight at the Capitol, they wrote. Colorado Supreme Court Justices Richard L. Gabriel, Melissa Hart, Monica Márquez and Hood ruled for the petitioners. Chief Justice Brian D. Boatright dissented, arguing the constitutional questions were too complex to be solved in a state hearing. Justices Maria E. Berkenkotter and Carlos Samour also dissented. Our government cannot deprive someone of the right to hold public office without due process of law, Samour wrote in his dissent. Even if we are convinced that a candidate committed horrible acts in the past  dare I say, engaged in insurrection  there must be procedural due process before we can declare that individual disqualified from holding public office. The Colorado ruling stands in contrast with the Minnesota Supreme Court, which last month decided that the state party can put anyone it wants on its primary ballot. It dismissed a Section 3 lawsuit but said the plaintiffs could try again during the general election. In another 14th Amendment case, a Michigan judge ruled that Congress, not the judiciary, should decide whether Trump can stay on the ballot. That ruling is being appealed. The liberal group behind those cases, Free Speech For People, also filed another lawsuit in Oregon seeking to bounce Trump from the ballot there. Both groups are financed by liberal donors who also support President Joe Biden. Trump has blamed the president for the lawsuits against him, even though Biden has no role in them, saying his rival is defacing the constitution to try to end his campaign. Trumps allies rushed to his defense, slamming the decision as un-American and insane and part of a politically-motivated effort to destroy his candidacy. Four partisan Democrat operatives on the Colorado Supreme Court think they get to decide for all Coloradans and Americans the next presidential election, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik said in a statement. ___ Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka on Tuesday (Dec.19) launched a state-of-the-art disaster early warning system, under the auspices of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is a collaborative effort involving the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and major telephone service providers including SLT Mobitel, Hutch, Dialog and Airtel, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. Additionally, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) formalizing this strategic initiative was also signed at the Presidents Office. DMCs Director General Major General (Retired) S. Ranasinghe and TRCSLs Director General Madhushanka Dissanayake, were the signatories to the MoU. Notable stakeholders, including Supun Weerasinghe, Group CEO of Dialog Axiata; Janaka R. Abeysinghe, Group CEO of SLT, Ashish Chandra, CEO of Bharti Airtel Lanka; Sudarshan Giganage, COO of Mobitel Pvt. Ltd.; and Samitra Gupta, Acting CEO of Hutchison Telecommunications Lanka Pvt. Ltd. were actively involved in the signing ceremony. The primary objective of this state-of-the-art disaster early warning system is to fortify the existing mechanism, ensuring the safety and well-being of Sri Lankan citizens amidst various disasters, including those caused by weather and climate changes. The system leverages cutting-edge technology to deliver more effective early warnings through telephone communication networks. Specifically focusing on tsunami disasters, the system targets nearly sixty thousand (60,000) mobile and landline numbers in 14 districts identified as high-risk areas. It is designed to promptly issue an immediate early warning in the form of a distinctive Ring Tone notification accompanied by a siren sound. This will establish a more robust early warning mechanism for the public, utilizing phone notifications featuring a siren sound, particularly effective during night-time hours. Scheduled for a public rollout on National Security Day on December 26, 2023, the systems scope is anticipated to expand in the future, evolving into a comprehensive multi-disaster early warning mechanism. This expansion aims to include landslides and floods, further enhancing its utility and impact. The high-profile event was attended by key dignitaries, including State Minister for Defence Mr. Pramita Bandara Thennakoon, Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Mr. Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary to the Defence Ministry General Kamal Gunaratne (Retired) and Directors of the Disaster Management Centre, Brigadier T.C.

        "content": "The World Bank has released the second tranche of the USD 500 million under the Sri Lanka Resilience, Stability and Economic Turnaround (RESET) Development Policy Operation (DPO), considering the continued satisfactory progress made by the government with the reform program. The RESET DPO, which provides budget support to the government, was approved on June 28, 2023. This is the first in a series that supports foundational reforms to restore macroeconomic stability, mitigate the impacts on the poor and vulnerable, and support an inclusive, private sector-led recovery. The World Bank says this support is contingent on prior actions or milestones that need to be completed before the funding is released. In a statement, the global financial institution said the second tranche is now being released after assessing that the government continues to make satisfactory progress in carrying out the broader reform program, the macroeconomic policy framework remains adequate, and the Banking (Special Provisions) Act  aimed at strengthening the deposit insurance and problem bank resolution framework  has been enacted. Continued momentum on economic and structural reforms is critical not only to stabilize the economy, but also to unleash its potential for private sector-led growth and transformation, said Faris H. Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The RESET DPO supports the government with these foundational reforms to bring the economy to full recovery, boost Sri Lankas competitiveness and growth potential, and encourage private sector investment and participation for inclusive and resilient growth and job creation. We have coordinated and sequenced all our support with the IMF, ADB, and other development partners, Mr. Hadad-Zervos added. The first tranche of the RESET DPO for USD 250 million was released in June 2023 upon the completion of seven reform prior actions across three pillars: economic governance; growth and competitiveness; and protecting the poor and vulnerable.",

        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has warned that unless the proposals and suggestions aimed at resolving the crises in the countrys health sector are promptly implemented, a stringent trade union action will be initiated on 01 January, 2024. The final decision on this matter is scheduled to be made by the GMOAs Central Committee on December 27. Expressing concerns, the GMOA highlighted that since the beginning of 2022, more than 1,700 doctors, including specialists, have left the country, and an additional 5,000 are likely to follow suit. This significant exodus has resulted in the closure of nearly 20 small hospitals, with over 400 hospitals and specialist medical units at risk of severe disruption due to the shortage of doctors.",

        "date": "December 20, 2023 03:05 pm",
        "content": "While there may be many cinematic universes littered around TV and film, it looks as though Disney is set to bring another one to our screens  and this time round, its one for the sci-fi fans. Disney is reported to be in the works of developing a new version of The X-Files, set to be produced by none other than Black Panther and Creed director, Ryan Coogler. The news was most recently reported by Bloomberg, who also shared the news that Netflix are producing a Peaky Blinders franchise. The original whisperings of a new X-Files series came earlier this year when Deadline revealed that the original series creator, Chris Carter, had confirmed speaking to Coogler about the upcoming project, though this is the first time it has been reported that Disney are involved. Carter had told CBC podcast On the Coast with Gloria Macarenko: I just spoke to a young man, Ryan Coogler, who is going to remount The X-Files with a diverse cast. So, hes got his work cut out for him because we covered so much territory. Carter also gave some further insight into what a new series could be about, adding: Were so steeped in conspiracies now. The X-Files dealt with a central conspiracy, but now the world is so full of conspiracies that I think that it would be a different show. The original series debuted in 1993 and ran until 2002, being followed by movies and additional series over the years. But will the shows iconic Scully and Mulder be making a return? Well, it looks unlikely. Gillian Anderson (who played Dana Scully) and David Duchovny (who played Fox Mulder) have both revealed more about their thoughts about a reboot, with Duchovny stating that he wouldnt want to be a part of it if Anderson wasnt. Duchovny told Comic Book TV last year: I dont know. Ive never really considered that. For me, it was always theres no show unless its Chris and Gillian, so I dont know. Again, I dont want to have to think about that, because its not something that I necessarily need in my life, to go do that. I think at this point, I mean, there might be another iteration of the actual show without either of us. Im not sure. Or there could be a cartoon. There are many ways to go about it. But personally, for me, the X-Files that Im involved in consists of Chris Carter, myself, and Gillian, so I havent spent time trying to think about a different version of that, and I dont know that I will. Anderson also revealed her thoughts on the matter back in 2022, underlining the fact that for her to return, shed appreciate a new group of series writers. She told Variety: It just feels like such an old idea. Ive done it, I did it for so many years, and it also ended on such an unfortunate note. In order to even begin to have that conversation about another season there would need to be a whole new set of writers and the baton would need to be handed on for it to feel like it was new and progressive. So yeah, its very much in the past. As for what Cooglers X-Files series could be about, well just have to wait and see, but were sure with Disney involved, itll be a big production with some exciting new characters.

        "date": "December 20, 2023 05:02 pm",
        "content": "The European Union reached agreement early on Wednesday on new rules designed to share out the cost and work of hosting migrants more evenly and to limit the numbers of people coming in. Representatives of the European Parliament and of EU governments reached an accord after all-night talks on EU laws collectively called the New Pact on Migration and Asylum that should take effect next year. The laws cover screening irregular migrants when they arrive in the European Union, procedures for handling asylum applications, rules on determining which EU country is responsible for handling applications and ways to handle crises. Migrant arrivals in the European Union are way down from the 2015 peak of more than 1 million, but have steadily crept up from a 2020 low to 255,000 in the year to November, with more than half crossing the Mediterranean from Africa to Italy or Malta. Previous efforts to share out the responsibility of hosting migrants have foundered because eastern EU members in particular were unwilling to take in people who had arrived in Greece, Italy and other countries. Under the new system, countries not at the border will have a choice between accepting refugees or paying into an EU fund. The screening system envisaged will seek to distinguish between those in need of international protection and others who are not. People whose asylum applications have a low chance of success, such as those from India, Tunisia or Turkey, can be prevented from entering the EU and detained at the border, as can people seen as representing a threat to security. Refugee rights groups have said it will create what amounts to prison camps at the EUs borders. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "December 20, 2023 06:12 pm",
        "content": "Former President and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader Mahinda Rajapaksa has urged all persons to pay special attention to tax policies and the economic practices of the political party they vote for during the upcoming elections, in a bid to ensure that the mistakes made in 2015 will not be repeated. Issuing a statement on Wednesday (20 Dec.), Rajapaksa said: Whatever decision the people make at the next elections should be based on rational thinking, proper facts and correct data. We are still living through the consequences of January 2015 and this country cannot afford another mistake like that again. He further stated that while the SLPP, led by him, is a part of the government, the incumbent Head of the Government and Head of State is the leader of a different political party with different policies. He noted that the new President successfully restored law and order to the country and that he is now directing government policy as the Executive President. In this vein, former President Rajapaksa emphasised that currently, it is the SLPPs primary duty to ensure a stable government until the next national elections. The relevant statement focused on reducing the existing tax burden faced by the people of the country, with the SLPP leader claiming that the revised Value Added Tax (VAT) rates included in the 2024 Budget is set to become a major political issue in 2024. The call to reduce taxes is based on solid economic principles. When taxes are low, both individuals and corporations have more money to spend and invest and this acts as a driver of the economy, he said in this regard, emphasising that the high tax burden has caused an exodus of educated and highly trained professionals from the country.

        "title": "Hamas leader visits Egypt amid intensive talks on new ceasefire",
        "date": "December 20, 2023 07:03 pm",
        "content": "The leader of Hamas made his first visit to Egypt for more than a month on Wednesday, a rare personal intervention in diplomacy amid what a source described as intensive talks on a new ceasefire to let aid reach Gaza and get hostages freed. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who normally resides in Qatar, typically intervenes in diplomacy publicly only when progress seems likely. He last travelled to Egypt in early November before the announcement of the only agreement on a ceasefire in the war so far, a week-long pause during which more than 100 hostages were released. A source briefed on negotiations said envoys were discussing which of the hostages still held by militants in Gaza could be freed under a new truce agreement, and what prisoners Israel might release in return. Israel was insisting that all remaining women and infirm men among hostages be released, the source said, declining to be identified. Palestinians convicted of serious offences could be on the list of prisoners to be freed. The source described the negotiations as intensive and said a breakthrough could be possible within days. A Palestinian official said Haniyeh was keen to listen to Egyptian officials for a possible new approach and noted that the official position of Hamas was to reject any new temporary ceasefire and demand a permanent halt to fighting. Hamass stance remains they dont have a desire for humanitarian pauses. Hamas wants a complete end to the Israeli war on Gaza, the Palestinian official said. Haniyeh and Hamas always appreciate the Egyptian effort. He is in Cairo today to listen to whether Israel has made new proposals or whether Cairo has some too. It is early to speak of expectations. A senior Israeli official repeated the government position that the war could end only with the release of all hostages and the destruction of Hamas: As the prime minister has said, the war will end with total victory. The negotiations come as Israel has faced increasing pressure from its international allies to curb a campaign in Gaza that has laid waste to much of the coastal enclave in retaliation for a Hamas killing spree on Oct. 7. Washington, Israels closest ally, has publicly called over the past week for it to scale down its all-out war into a more targeted campaign against Hamas leaders and end what U.S. President Joe Biden called indiscriminate bombing. UN VOTE DELAYED At the U.N. Security Council, where Washington has twice used its veto to shield Israel from international demands for a ceasefire, negotiators put off a vote on the latest resolution for another day in hope of reaching an agreed text. When asked if they were getting close to an agreement, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on Tuesday: Were trying, we really are. Since the last truce collapsed at the start of this month, the war has entered a more intensive phase, with ground combat previously confined to the northern half of the Gaza Strip now spread across the length of the coastal enclave. Israel has sworn to defeat Hamas, which rules Gaza, since its fighters killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 attacks. Gaza health officials say nearly 20,000 people have since been confirmed killed in Israeli strikes, with thousands more believed lost and buried under rubble. Israels government has faced domestic political pressure to reach a further agreement to free hostages, especially after acknowledging last week that troops mistakenly killed three of those taken. Israel believes 129 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 21 are feared to have died in captivity. In the north, where Israeli forces claimed to have achieved most of their military objectives last month, fighting has been more intense than ever. Huge orange balls of flame and towers of black smoke soared into the sky over the northern Gaza Strip as seen from across the fence in Israel, as Israeli warplanes pounded the area at dawn. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces had besieged its ambulance depot in Jabalia, a northern settlement that has been the site of some of the most intensive fighting. There are 127 people in the facility including workers, displaced people and wounded. In the south, where most of Gazas residents are now sheltering after fleeing other areas, there has been intense fighting around the centre of the main southern city Khan Younis, which Israeli forces have partly stormed. All the night bombing didnt stop. Their focus now is Khan Younis. People here have to deal with two wars all the time, bombing and hunger, said Samir Ali, 45, a father of five from Gaza City in the north now sheltering in Khan Younis. Israel says it is doing what it can to protect civilians, including warning them in advance of strikes, and blames Hamas for harm to them for operating in their midst, which Hamas denies. International aid organisations say the enclaves 2.3 million residents have been driven to the brink of catastrophe by destruction that has forced 90 of them from their homes and a blockade restricting access to food and medical supplies.",

In the meantime, Manusha Nanayakkara, the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment today stated that Ranil Wickremesinghes presidency is not based on a single party, adding that all politicians have united to solve the countrys problems. Personally, contesting as an independent presidential candidate rather than creating parties or alliances will help distinguish those who want to build the country from those who do not want to, Minister Nanayakkara said.

        "date": "December 20, 2023 10:30 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation and Irrigation says the government is planning to leverage modern technology in mitigating the human-elephant conflict. Pavithra Wanniarachchi, highlighting the ongoing pilot projects utilizing advanced tools such as high-intensity light currents, powerful sound waves and drones, said these initiatives have been launched in regions like Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Ampara, addressing prevalent human-elephant conflicts. The minister shared these insights during her participation in the news conference Collective Path to a stable country at the Presidential Media Centre today (20). Addressing her views further the minister said; The Forest Conservation Department is dedicated to safeguarding the nations forests. Since assuming office as the minister, Ive initiated a new program to enhance the departments operations. A key aspect of this initiative involves providing assistance to communities residing on the forest periphery to foster forest protection. The idea is that if these communities can improve their livelihoods through the forest, they will naturally become advocates for its preservation. There are valuable materials within the forest that can benefit those living on its fringes. Allowing them controlled access to these resources can contribute to forest conservation. Notably, green tourism projects hold significant potential, presenting an opportunity to generate substantial revenue for the country through environmental preservation. To shift our mind-set, we recognize that 29 of the countrys land area is forested. Efforts are underway to maximize the utilization of existing forests and to reforest areas that have been degraded. The ministry is keen on supporting forest undergrowth and plans are in place to provide plants essential for enhancing the countrys existing forests. Financial resources have been allocated for tree planting along roadsides and a government project providing saplings to boost peoples economies is already underway. The ministry has experienced a remarkable 135 increase in income compared to the previous year, achieving impressive revenue of Rs.1670 million in 2022 and Rs. 4700 million so far this year. The escalating human-elephant conflict is a significant concern. The population of both humans and elephants is rising and the cultivation activities of people are encroaching upon elephant habitats. Plans for the construction of a thousand kilometres of new fences next year aim to prevent elephants from entering human-populated areas. Additionally, 4000 workers from the Department of Multipurpose Development Task Force have been recruited as permanent employees to protect these areas, offering a potential solution to the conflict. Various projects are being implemented to protect the living environment of elephants, including providing alternative lands through the elephant corridor. Pilot projects involving high beam lights, high frequency sound waves and drones, with the support of the Navy and Air Force are underway to explore ways of deterring elephants from entering certain areas. --PMD--",

        "date": "December 21, 2023 09:11 am",
        "content": "Indias ban on the export of onions has driven up prices of the vegetable for Asian buyers, who are scrambling for cheaper alternatives, particularly as New Delhi is unlikely to lift the curbs before general elections next year. The worlds biggest exporter of onions banned shipments on Dec. 8 after domestic prices more than doubled in three months following a drop in production. Now retail shoppers from Kathmandu to Colombo are struggling with high prices, since traditional Asian buyers, such as Bangladesh, Malaysia and Nepal, and even the United Arab Emirates, rely on imports from India to bridge domestic gaps. Onions are needed for almost everything we cook, said Mousumi Akhtar, who works in the private sector in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. This sudden price hike is tough to swallow. Ive had to cut back on how much I buy. From the belacan shrimp paste of Malaysia and Bangladeshi biryani to chicken chillies in Nepal or Sri Lankan fish curry, Asian consumers have built up a serious dependence on Indian supplies of onions to lend spice to their favourite dishes. Traders estimate that India accounts for more than half of all imports of onions by Asian countries. Its shorter shipment times against those from rival exporters such as China or Egypt, are key to preserving the taste of the perishable commodity. India exported a record 2.5 million metric tons of onions in the financial year that ended on March 31, with 671,125 tons going to neighbouring Bangladesh, its biggest buyer of the vegetable. To overcome the shortage, Bangladesh is trying to source more from China, Egypt and Turkey, said commerce ministry official Tapan Kanti Ghosh. As general elections approach next month in Bangladesh, the government has begun selling onions at subsidised prices to the poor, hoping to offset a surge of more than 50 in prices after Indias ban. Even worse is the situation in landlocked Nepal, which imports most of its onions. Since the ban by India, we have monitored the supply situation at different places. There are no onions on sale, said Tirtharaj Chiluwal, an official of the Himalayan nations commerce ministry. Nepal is considering imports from China and may ask India to make an exception and allow exports, said ministry spokesperson Gajendra Kumar Thakur. LIMITED OPTIONS Importing nations have to contend with more expensive supplies from China, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, which have all hiked prices since India is out of the market, said Ajit Shah, an Indian exporter. All would run out of supplies if Indias ban lasted for an extended period, said one exporter based in Mumbai, the financial capital. Within a week after the ban, onions became 20 cheaper in India as supplies from the new seasons crop came in, traders said. Now, with domestic supplies more than adequate to satisfy demand at home, Shah, the exporter, said India should allow exports to maintain its global market position. But the curbs are unlikely to go before next years general elections, as the priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is to hold down food prices, the Mumbai-based exporter said. New Delhi has also reined in exports of rice, sugar and wheat. Since Indias ban, onion prices have nearly doubled in Sri Lanka, which is slowly emerging from its worst financial crisis in nearly seven decades. Malaysia, like other importers, is also trying to secure supplies from China and Pakistan, said Seri Mohamad Sabu, its agriculture minister. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Hamas says estimated 20,000 people were killed in Gaza",
        "date": "December 21, 2023 11:02 am",
        "content": "At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the enclave more than 10 weeks ago, according to Palestinian officials. At least 8,000 children and 6,200 women are among those killed, Gazas Government Media Office said on Wednesday. The grim milestone was passed as the United Nations Security Council postponed a key vote on a bid to boost humanitarian aid for Gaza for the third time to avoid a veto from the United States, which traditionally shields its ally Israel from UN action. Since a seven-day truce collapsed on December 1, the war has entered a more intensive phase with ground combat previously confined to the northern half of the territory now spread across its length. When asked about the ever-growing casualty count, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it is clear that the conflict will move and needs to move to a lower intensity phase. We expect to see and want to see a shift to more targeted Israeli operations with a smaller number of forces thats really focused in on dealing with the leadership of Hamas, the tunnel network and a few other critical things, he said. And as that happens, I think youll see as well the harm done to civilians also decrease significantly. Air strikes continued across Gaza on Wednesday with at least 46 people killed and dozens wounded in Israeli attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the enclaves Ministry of Health. In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousand of people have been pushed since early December by Israels continued onslaught, air strikes hit a building near a hospital close to an Al Jazeera crew reporting live on air, killing at least 10 people. More air strikes are conducted, more victims fall due to the expansion of the Israeli military operations in the areas that are supposed to be safe zones where the majority of Gazans have been urged to flee, Al Jazeeras Tareq Abu Azzoum said in reporting from Rafah. The air strike took place in an area considered to be very densely populated, and its a miracle that no more than this number of people were killed, he added. Key Security Council vote postponed The UN Security Council vote on a bid to boost aid to the Gaza Strip and ask the UN to monitor humanitarian aid deliveries there has been delayed at the request of the US, diplomats said. According to the United Arab Emirates envoy to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, the vote will take place on Thursday. Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and is implementable on the ground, and there are some discussions going on on how to make that possible, Nusseibeh, whose country drafted the resolution, told reporters in New York. The text aims to dilute Israels control over all humanitarian aid deliveries to the 2.3 million people of Gaza. The initial text has been reportedly modified to soften calls to end the fighting in Gaza to avoid yet another veto from the US. We want to make sure that the resolution  doesnt do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, make it more complicated. Thats what were focused on, Blinken told reporters on Wednesday. I hope we can get to a good place. Currently, Israel monitors the limited humanitarian aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt and the Israel-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom in Hebrew. On Wednesday, the first aid convoy entered Gaza directly from Jordan with 750 metric tonnes of food. The World Food Programme said half of Gazas population is starving and only 10 percent of the food required has entered Gaza since the war began on October 7. The US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would benefit only Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and allow the release of captives taken by Hamas. Hamas leader in rare visit to Egypt Separately on Wednesday, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh paid his first visit to Egypt for more than a month in a rare personal intervention in diplomacy amid hopes that the Palestinian group and Israel could agree terms for another truce. Haniyeh arrived in the Egyptian capital to meet with Cairos spy chief and other Egyptian officials who are acting as key mediators. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have indicated in talks with US and Qatari representatives that they could be open to a truce. The Hamas leader last travelled to Egypt in early November before the announcement of the only pause in the fighting so far, a weeklong truce that saw the release of about 110 of 240 captives taken by Hamas into Gaza on October 7. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed group that is also holding captives in Gaza, said its leader would also visit Egypt in the coming days to discuss a possible end to the war. A source briefed on the negotiations said envoys were discussing which of the captives still held by Palestinian groups could be freed in a new truce and what prisoners Israel might release in return, the Reuters news agency reported. But there remains a huge gulf between the two sides publicly stated positions on any halt to the fighting. Hamas rejects any further temporary pause and says it will discuss only a permanent ceasefire. Israel has ruled that out and says it will agree only limited humanitarian pauses until Hamas is defeated. US President Joe Biden said he did not expect an Israel-Hamas deal for the release of captives held in Gaza to be struck soon. Were pushing, Biden told reporters during a trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Source: Al Jazeera and News Agencies",

        "date": "December 21, 2023 12:36 pm",
        "content": "An Oklahoma judge has exonerated a man who spent nearly 50 years in prison for murder, the longest serving inmate to be declared innocent of a crime. Glynn Simmons, 71, who was released in July after prosecutors agreed that key evidence in his case was not turned over to his defense lawyers, was ruled innocent Tuesday. This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offense for which Mr. Simmons was convicted, sentenced and imprisoned... was not committed by Mr. Simmons, according to the ruling by Oklahoma County District Judge Amy Palumbo. Simmons served 48 years, one month and 18 days since his conviction, making him the longest imprisoned U.S. inmate to be exonerated, according to data kept by The National Registry of Exonerations. Simmons said afterward that he feels vindicated after his time in prison that included initially being sentenced to death row. Its a lesson in resilience and tenacity, Simmons said during a brief news conference following the ruling. Dont let nobody tell you that it (exoneration) cant happen, because it really can. Simmons has maintained his innocence, saying he was in Louisiana at the time of the 1974 slaying of Carolyn Sue Rogers inside an Edmond liquor store. He and co-defendant Don Roberts were both convicted in 1975 of the murder and initially sentenced to death. Their sentences were reduced to life in prison in 1977 after U.S. Supreme Court rulings related to capital punishment. Roberts was released on parole in 2008. Palumbo in July ordered a new trial for Simmons after District Attorney Vicki Behenna said prosecutors had failed to turn over evidence in the case, including a police report that showed an eyewitness might have identified other suspects in the case. Behenna in September said there is no longer physical evidence in the case against Simmons and announced she would not retry him, though she opposed declaring him actually innocent. A spokesperson for Behenna declined immediate comment on Wednesday. The ruling makes Simmons eligible for up to 175,000 in compensation from the state for wrongful conviction and opens the door for a federal lawsuit against Oklahoma City and law enforcement involved in Simmons arrest and conviction, defense attorney Joe Norwood said Wednesday. Compensation, though, is likely years away, Norwood said and Simmons is currently living on donations while undergoing treatment for cancer that was detected after his release from prison. Glynn is having to live off of GoFundMe, thats literally how the man is surviving right now, paying rent, buying food, Norwood said. Getting him compensation, and getting compensation is not for sure, is in the future and he has to sustain himself now. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "December 21, 2023 04:44 pm",
        "content": "Though its current evaluation of the global public health risk is low, the UN health agency cautioned that with the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the new variant could increase the burden of respiratory infections in many countries, noting other diseases such as RSV, influenza and childhood pneumonia that are already on the rise. Rapidly increasing spread The classification of JN.1 as a separate variant of interest (VOI) is down to its rapidly increasing spread around the globe, WHO said in an advisory issued on Tuesday. JN.1 has been found in many countries, including India, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Previously JN.1 was classified and tracked as part of its parent BA.2.86 lineage, which itself is a descendant of the Omicron or B.1.1.529 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 disease. In comparison with its parent lineage BA.2.86, JN.1 has an additional mutation (the L455S mutation) in the spike protein. Risk evaluated as low WHO said that based on the currently available data, the additional global public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low. Despite this, with the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, JN.1 could increase the burden of respiratory infections in many countries, it added. WHO also highlighted that current vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and death from JN.1 and other circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. Other respiratory diseases COVID-19 is not the only respiratory disease in play. Influenza, RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and common childhood pneumonia are on the rise, according to WHO. It advised people to take measures to prevent infections and severe disease using all available tools, including wearing a mask when in crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated areas, and keeping a safe distance from others. It also urged everyone to put safety first by covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning ones hands regularly; and staying up to date with vaccinations against COVID-19 and influenza, especially if you are at a high risk of severe disease. Additionally, people should stay home if they are sick, and to get tested if they have symptoms, or if they might have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or influenza. Global vaccine initiative winds down Also on Tuesday, WHO announced that COVAX, the landmark multilateral mechanism for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, launched in 2020, will end on 31 December 2023, as COVID-19 vaccinations shift to regular immunization programmes. Since its launch in 2020, COVAX delivered nearly two billion doses of vaccines to 146 economies and averted an estimated 2.7 million deaths in lower-income economies. Low- and lower middle-income economies will continue to receive COVID-19 vaccines and delivery support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in 2024 and 2025, with 83 million doses so far requested for 2024 from 58 economies, WHO said in a statement. COVAX was the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, the ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI); WHO; and the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF). Unprecedented emergency response With the rallying cry no one is safe until everyone is safe, COVAX partners urged the world to place vaccine equity at the heart of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for every country to have at least enough doses to protect those most at risk. The joint efforts of all partners to ensure an equitable response to the pandemic helped protect the futures of millions of children in vulnerable communities, said Catherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF. This huge and historic undertaking is something we can be collectively proud of and build on. UNICEF will continue to deliver vaccines to the worlds youngest to stop the spread of all preventable diseases and build strong health systems for the future. --United Nations--",

        "date": "December 21, 2023 04:52 pm",
        "content": "Kuwaits new emir, Sheikh Mishal al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has been formally sworn in before parliament to begin his rule over the wealthy Gulf monarchy. The new emir, who took over after the passing of his half-brother, Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, on Saturday, took the oath of office during a special session of the National Assembly on Wednesday morning. In his inaugural address, Sheikh Mishal pledged to safeguard the country and its people, adhere to constitutional principles and fight corruption. I swear by Almighty Allah to respect the constitution and the laws of the state, to defend the liberties, interests and properties of the people and to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of the country, he declared. The 83-year-old Sheikh Mishal is Kuwaits third ruler in just over three years. He has already been de facto leader since 2021 when the frail Sheikh Nawaf handed over most of his duties. Sheikh Mishal previously served as deputy chief of the National Guard from 2004 to 2020 and head of State Security for 13 years after joining the Ministry of Interior in the 1960s. As he takes the helm of the OPEC oil producer, he is expected to preserve key Kuwaiti foreign policies, including support for Gulf Arab unity and Western alliances. Good relations with Saudi Arabia are seen as one of his top priorities. The new emir may also look to expand ties to China as Beijing seeks a bigger role in the region. Political analyst Hussain Jamal told Al Jazeera that Kuwaits foreign policy would likely remain as it is under the new emir. Zero enemies and a lot of friends  regionally and internationally. As leader, Sheikh Mishal will also have to grapple with long-running strains between the ruling family and its critics in the perpetually deadlocked and fractious parliament. Critics complain that the friction has hindered fiscal and economic reform. In 2022, Sheikh Mishal intervened in a protracted dispute between the government and parliament. He dissolved parliament, decreed new elections and replaced the prime minister, but declared no intention to interfere in the vote or the selection of parliament speaker. After being sworn in, Sheikh Mishal castigated authorities for having previously appointed people to positions that are not consistent with the simplest rules of justice and fairness. He also stressed the importance of follow-up, responsible oversight, and objective accountability within the framework of the constitution and the law for negligence, dereliction and tampering with the interests of citizens. Abdulaziz Mohammed Al-Anjeri, of the Kuwaiti think tank Reconnaissance Research, told Al Jazeera, Sheikh Mishal was likely to rule as a reformist. He is someone who does not allow nepotism or favourtism to impact his decisions, Al-Anjeri said. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

Accordingly, Sri Lankas intelligence officers held discussions on Thursday (Dec.21) on held a comprehensive discussion with the representatives of the Embassy of Thailand in Colombo and the parents of five Sri Lankans who have fallen victim to the scam. It was revealed that a Sri Lankan in Dubai, who had connected with the victims online, had directed them to work in Myanmar. Meanwhile, the Human Trafficking, Smuggling and Maritime Crimes Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has initiated probes to arrest a Sri Lankan who was allegedly in contact with the said Burmese terror group. The group of about 50-60 Sri Lankans had illegally entered Myanmar through its border with Thailand. As per reports, they are forcibly detained in a terrorist camp in Myaweddi city, which is currently under the grip of the ethnic armed group and considered as an area infested with cybercrimes. The Sri Lankans detained at the terrorist camp in Myaweddi are reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams. Before the incident was brought to light, there were reports on how several Indian nationals were subjected to similar conditions by the same Burmese terrorist group. Recently, a series of photographs were released, showing how the Sri Lankans were tortured at the Myaweddi terror camp. The Sri Lankans who have fallen victim to this scam have said that they were initially unaware of the cybercrime camp. Despite initially being told that they were supposed to do jobs such as data entry, these Sri Lankans have been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, in order to steal their money. In the event, they refuse to do as they are told, the captives are subjected to acts of torture, which they said include electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving.",

        "date": "December 22, 2023 11:32 am",
        "content": "Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles declared an unwavering commitment to continuing the operation to suppress drug trafficking and underworld activities in the country, regardless of external pressures. Addressing a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (Dec.21), the lawmaker emphasized that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has wholeheartedly endorsed the operation, ensuring that it will persist despite any potential impacts. Minister Alles underscored the significance of public support, drawing parallels between the backing received to end the thirty-year war and the current necessity for a united front against drugs and underworld activities. He expressed the vision of creating an environment where future generations can live free from fear or doubt. The resolute stance articulated by Minister Tiran Alles signals the governments dedication to combating these issues for the betterment of the nations security and stability. The Public Security Minister further commented: The special operation known as Yukthiya (Justice), implemented throughout the island, has become the subject of widespread discussion within the country. Despite ongoing issues with drugs and underworld activities, it was imperative to take decisive action to curb these activities. Thus, the Yukthiya operation was initiated with the primary goal of putting an end to drug trafficking and underworld activities in the country. Special responsibilities have been assigned to community police committees in this regard. The success of this operation hinges on the support of the people, particularly the media. Just as there was collective support for the security forces during the war, a similar unity is crucial now. While the Three Decades War was confined to the North and East, the current situation has spread throughout the entire country. Public support serves as a formidable strength for the police and therefore, it is requested that the public provides necessary support and accurate information for the success of this operation. With such support, it is believed that drug trafficking and underworld activities can be eradicated from the country by June of next year. The Navy has initiated a special operation to prevent the smuggling of drugs into the country through the sea routes. The operation focuses on disrupting the distribution network, stopping underworld activities associated with drug trafficking, and paying special attention to drug users. Instructions have been given to the Inspector General of Police to concentrate on apprehending drug dealers rather than drug addicts. Intelligence reports indicate the involvement of 4,665 individuals in drug trafficking and the underworld. Orders have been given to arrest all these individuals, resulting in the arrest of 731 people in the last four days alone, including those not initially mentioned in intelligence reports. Additionally, 8,451 others have been arrested, with 346 in detention, 61 undergoing asset investigations and 697 referred for rehabilitation. During these operations, the police have successfully seized a substantial quantity of drugs, including marijuana, hashish, heroin and Ice valued at Rs. 431 million within the past four days. When considering assets such as vehicles, houses and properties belonging to the suspects as liabilities, their total value amounts to around Rs. 162 million. All confiscated items will undergo legal proceedings for forfeiture. Prior to commencing this operation, discussions were held with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who shares the stance that drug trafficking and underworld activities must be eradicated from the country. With the Presidents blessings, this operation will persist despite any external influence. The commitment is to create an environment where drugs and underworld activities can be eliminated, ensuring that future generations can live without fear or doubt. Moreover, concerns have been raised about the abuse of children and women. To address these issues, instructions have been given to introduce a special hotline, similar to the police emergency number, from the first week of January. Women police officers will operate under this dedicated phone number, recognizing that women may hesitate to share their problems with male police officers. Furthermore, plans are underway to introduce a new hotline specifically for submitting complaints in Tamil. --PMD",

        "date": "December 22, 2023 11:51 am",
        "content": "Australia opener Usman Khawaja has been charged by the International Cricket Council for wearing a black armband in support of civilians in Gaza during the first Test against Pakistan. Khawaja, 37, did not wear shoes bearing the words all lives are equal and freedom is a human right in Perth, as he had in training. The ICC deemed him in breach of its clothing and equipment regulations. Khawaja is free to play in the second Test, starting on 26 December. However, he faces further sanctions if he wears an armband again or makes an on-field statement in support of Palestinians without the permission of the ICC and Cricket Australia. At least 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory in the wake of Hamas 7 October attacks, according to Gazas Hamas-run health ministry. Under ICC regulations, players cannot display messages of political, religious or racial causes during international matches. Khawaja, who is Muslim, has said his message is a humanitarian appeal and not a political statement. Usman displayed a personal message during the first Test match against Pakistan without seeking the prior approval of Cricket Australia and the ICC to display it, as required in the regulations for personal messages, said an ICC spokesperson. This is a breach under the category of an other breach and the sanction for a first offence is a reprimand. Khawaja said he would fight the decision when he was told not to wear the shoes, which featured writing in red, green and black - the colours of the Palestinian flag. He posted a video message on social media in which he reiterated his support for civilians in Gaza. The ICC have told me that I cant wear my shoes on-field because they believe its a political statement under their guidelines. I dont believe it is, he said. I will respect their view and decision but I will fight it and seek to gain approval. Cricket Australia previously said it supported the right of our players to express personal opinions but that it expected them to uphold the ICC rules. In 2014 England all-rounder Moeen Ali was warned to stop wearing wristbands showing support for Gaza during a Test against India. Khawaja is set to speak to the media in Melbourne on Friday. Australia lead the three-match series 1-0 before the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "December 22, 2023 12:47 pm",
        "content": "US actor Vin Diesels former personal assistant is suing the Fast  Furious star, accusing him of sexual assault during the 2010 filming of Fast Five. A lawyer for the actor, real name Mark Sinclair, said his client denies this claim in its entirety. Asta Jonasson claims in the lawsuit that the actor pinned her to a wall as he performed a sex act on himself. She is further suing for wrongful termination, claiming his company fired her hours after the alleged attack. Ms Jonassons lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles on Thursday, alleges that the sexual battery took place in Atlantas St Regis hotel during the filming of Fast Five. She says in the lawsuit that Mr Sinclair, 56, physically overpowered her in his hotel suite and ignored Ms Jonassons clear statements of non-consent as he groped her. The lawsuit alleges that after she screamed and ran towards the nearby bathroom, the film star pinned her against the wall with his body and performed a sex act on himself. Mere hours after the incident, the lawsuit says that she was contacted by the actors sister Samantha Vincent - who runs his production company One Race Films - and was fired. She is also suing the actors sister and his production company. Ms Vincent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was clear to her that she was being fired because she was no longer useful - Vin Diesel had used her to fulfil his sexual desires, the suit alleges. It adds: Ms Jonasson felt helpless, her self esteem was demolished, and she questioned her own skills and whether a successful career would require her to trade her body for advancement. The former assistant also claims that another executive from the company propositioned her in the same hotel a few days before the incident with Mr Sinclair. In addition to sexual battery, her lawsuit includes claims of gender discrimination, illegal retaliation, emotional distress and wrongful termination. Bryan Freedman, a lawyer for Mr Sinclair, said in a written statement to CNN on Thursday: Vin Diesel categorically denies this claim in its entirety. This is the first he has ever heard about this more than 13 year old claim made by a purportedly 9 day employee. A lawyer for Ms Jonasson said in a statement to BBC News that her client seeks to hold Vin Diesel and those who allowed and covered up his sexual assault accountable for their egregious actions. We hope her courageous decision to come forward helps create lasting change and empowers other survivors, said lawyer Claire-Lise Kutlay. In addition to the Fast  Furious franchise, Vin Diesel is known for films including Guardians of the Galaxy, XXX and Riddick. Mr Sinclair is also a producer for the Fast  Furious series and is one of the highest-grossing actors in Hollywood. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Ambassador of Russia, Levan Dzhagaryan says it is up to the Sri Lankan government to decide if it wants to collaborate with the Russian state-owned nuclear giant Rosatom. Responding to a question raised during a media briefing on Thursday (Dec.21), the envoy spoke of the current status of the bilateral talks on nuclear power cooperation between Sri Lanka and Russia. Ambassador Dzhagaryan mooted the establishment of a 110-megawatt small nuclear power plant, either floating or land-based, in Sri Lanka. He said Sri Lanka needs alternative sources of power, and to stop relying heavily on coal and renewable energy which is susceptible to climate change. Speaking further, Ambassador Dzhagaryan emphasized Russias fruitful nuclear cooperation with Sri Lankas neighbouring countries, such as Bangladesh, India and Myanmar as well as Turkiye and Iran. When asked about the status of the talks on the joint venture on Mattala International Airport, Ambassador Dzhagaryan mentioned that their proposal is still under consideration. He also highlighted the increasing number of Russians visiting the island nation as a key factor for his countrys interest in the Mattala Airport, and said at least 200,000 Russian tourists are expected to arrive in Sri Lanka by February 2024.",

        "date": "December 22, 2023 02:11 pm",
        "content": "A student opened fire Thursday at a university in Prague, killing at least 14 people, officials said, and injuring more than 20 in the Czech Republics worst mass shooting. The bloodshed took place in the philosophy department building of Charles University, where the shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said. The gunman also died, authorities said. His name has not been released. Vondrasek said in the evening that 14 people had died and 25 were injured, after earlier reporting that 15 had died and 24 were hurt. He didnt explain the change. Authorities warned that the death toll could rise. Police gave no details about the victims or a possible motive for the shooting at the building located near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said investigators do not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups. Vondrasek said police believe the gunman killed his father earlier Thursday in his hometown of Hostoun, just west of Prague, and that he had also been planning to kill himself. He didnt elaborate. Later Thursday, Vondrasek said that based on a search of his home, the gunman was also suspected in the killing of another man and his 2-month-old daughter Dec. 15, in Prague. The chief described the shooter as an excellent student with no criminal record, but didnt provide any other information. The gunman suffered devastating injuries but it wasnt clear if he killed himself or was shot to death in an exchange of gunfire with officers, Vondrasek said, adding that there was nothing to suggest that he had an accomplice. The shooter legally owned several guns  police said he was heavily armed Thursday and was carrying a lot of ammunition  and that what he did was well thought out, a horrible act, Vondrasek said. University authorities said they would tighten security in university buildings with immediate effect. We mourn the loss of life of members of our university community, express our deepest condolences to all the bereaved and our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy, Charles University said in a statement. The building where the shooting took place is in Jan Palach Square, a busy tourist area in Pragues Old Town. It is just a few minutes walk from the picturesque Old Town Square, a major tourist attraction where a popular Christmas market attracts thousands of visitors. The government quickly sought to quell concerns that the massacre was back by foreign interests. Theres no indication that it has anything to do with international terrorism, Rakusan said. Its a horrible crime, something the Czech Republic has never experienced, he said. Pavel Nedoma, the director of the nearby Rudolfinum Gallery, said he watched from a window as a person standing on a balcony of the building fired a gun. Authorities evacuated everyone from the building and police said they were still searching the area, including the balcony, for explosives. The building forms part of the square and faces a bridge across the river with a view of Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. President Petr Pavel said he was shocked by what happened and offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims, as did leaders of Germany, France and Slovakia, the European Union and Israel. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sent a message of condolence. The president and the first lady are praying for the families who lost loved ones and everyone else who has been affected by this senseless act of violence, Jean-Pierre said. On behalf of the United States, we send our condolences and also wish the survivors of this tragic event a speedy recovery. The Czech government declared Saturday a national day of mourning to honor the shooting victims, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. Previously, the nations worst mass shooting was in 2015, when a gunman opened fire in the southeastern town of Uhersky Brod, killing eight before fatally shooting himself. On Thursday, where tourists, students and others would normally be enjoying the view of the iconic monument, chaos and terror instead took hold. Police vehicles and ambulances sped across the bridge with their sirens wailing. Officers sealed off the empty square. Some video footage showed people being evacuated from the building and others trying to hide behind a wall. Ivo Havranek, a diving instructor, said he was near the building when he heard a shot ring out, but he didnt quite believe that was what he had heard. Only at the moment when I saw the fully equipped riot police with bulletproof vests and shields, it looked to me that I had found myself in a movie, Havranek said. But it was obvious that nobody was shooting a movie. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Professor Chandima Jeewandara, the Director of the Allergy, Immunology, and Cell Biology Unit at Sri Jayewardenepura University, has issued a cautionary statement, suggesting that the novel JN.1 virus may already be present in Sri Lanka. Despite the low testing rate for the substrain of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 virus in the country, with the figure being close to zero, Prof. Jeewandara emphasized that this does not necessarily imply the viruss absence. He highlighted the likelihood of the JN.1 subvariant emerging, possibly already present in the community, citing increased cases of Influenza-like Illnesses (ILIs) in Sri Lanka. Drawing parallels with India, where 30 of patients with ILIs tested positive for COVID-19 within 24 hours, he suggested a similar situation in Sri Lanka due to the elevated number of reported ILIs. Despite this concern, Prof. Jeewandara reassured that Sri Lankas healthcare system is well-prepared, having successfully managed previous waves. He recommended wearing masks, especially for the elderly or those with weakened immunity, and those in poorly ventilated, enclosed, and crowded environments. Symptoms of JN.1 include fever, cough, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Prof. Jeewandara advised seeking medical advice for persistent high fever, breathing difficulties, fatigue, inability to eat, and vomiting  the warning signs observed in other parts of the world. He also urged individuals at risk to consider getting booster shots.",
