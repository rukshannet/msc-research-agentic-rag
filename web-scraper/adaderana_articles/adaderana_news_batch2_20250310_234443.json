        "content": "The death toll from a catastrophic earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria climbed above 35,000 on February 13, with search and rescue teams starting to wind down their work. Officials and medics said 31,643 people had died in Turkey and 3,581 in Syria from last Mondays 7.8-magnitude tremor, bringing the confirmed total to 35,224. A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southeast Turkey and Syria on February 6, toppling buildings and sending panicked residents pouring outside in a cold winter night. The quakes focus was 18 km deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicentre was about 33 km from Gaziantep. The area has many buildings constructed of brittle concrete (which makes them prone to cracking, spalling, loss of strength, or steel corrosion), making them extremely vulnerable to earthquake shaking, according to the USGS. Turkey is frequently shaken by earthquakes. In 2020 itself, it recorded almost 33,000 earthquakes in the region, according to Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). Out of these, 332 earthquakes were of magnitudes 4.0 and higher. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 13, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "The All Ceylon Medical Officers Association (ACMOA) says that a serious shortage of equipment used for medical services has emerged in the country despite the fact that a proper solution has still not been provided for the prevailing acute shortage of drugs. The association pointed out that there are only limited stocks of certain medicine available in the Ministry of Healths stores and also within regional drug stores. Health professionals including the medical officers stressed throughout the last period that the drug shortage in all government hospitals have worsened by the day and there is also a shortage of medical equipment. Although there are about 1,300 types of medicines available, there is a shortage of between 140 to 150 types of essential medicines so far, according to the All Ceylon Medical Officers Association. The association further points out that there is a severe shortage of Insulin given to diabetic patients, Aspirin given to heart patients, Metformin, several types of syrups given to small children, basic antibiotics, painkillers, anaesthetics, cancer drugs and drugs given to kidney patients. Dr. Nishantha Samaraweera of the ACMOA expressed that a large number of drugs are running out of stock during this month, adding that the governments intervention to restore these drug stocks is very low. There is a serious shortage of drugs starting from emergency medication to cancer drugs. Nasal tubes, urinary tubes, cannulae, and needles used to draw blood, all these types of medical equipment stocks are limited, he said. There is a lack of equipment required for surgeries related to fractures and spinal cord related surgeries. Therefore, most of the surgeries related to the spinal cord have been halted at hospitals. The patients can die due to the lack of sufficient stocks of necessary medicines, Dr. Samaraweera added. It is useless for the Ministry of Health to state that they have allocated Rs. 322 billion in numbers. Dr. Samaraweera also urged the Health Ministry to allocate the relevant funds and to at least send the medicines that are required to sustain lives at this critical moment.",

        "content": "A Japanese court has released a video showing the final days of a Sri Lankan woman who died in detention. Wishma Sandamali passed away at a detention center in Nagoya City in March 2021, after she complained that she felt ill. The five-hour clip that is available for viewing is part of a 295-hour video. The footage was captured by a security camera mounted on the ceiling of the solitary cell in which she was detained. It was taken between February 22 and March 6, when she died. The video shows Wishma lying on a bed, and she can be heard moaning. Conversations that she had with immigration guards and nurses can also be heard. Last December, in response to the courts request, the Japanese government submitted as evidence five hours of video footage showing Wishma at the center. The video can be watched at the court by anyone who completes the steps required to view official records from civil court cases. The 33-year-old was being held for overstaying her visa. Her family members filed a damages suit at the Nagoya district court. They are seeking compensation from the Japanese government. The bereaved family members say that the immigration authorities illegally held Wishma at the detention center and failed to provide her with adequate medical care, even though her condition became worse. The government has argued that the actions taken by the authorities were not illegal. Source - NHK -Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2023 07:36 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Officials from China, India, Saudi Arabia and Group of Seven nations will participate in a first virtual meeting of a new sovereign debt roundtable on Friday, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. The roundtable will also include officials from countries that have requested debt treatments under the Group of 20 common framework - Ethiopia, Zambia and Ghana - as well as middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka, Suriname and Ecuador, which have faced their own debt crises, three sources had earlier said. The meeting will be co-chaired by the IMF, the World Bank and India, the current leader of the Group of 20, and comes a week before G20 finance officials are due to gather in Bengaluru, India, from Feb. 23-25. An in-person meeting of the roundtable expected on Feb. 25 and a formal launch is planned at the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in April. Brazil, which will lead the G20 next year, is also taking part, one of the sources said. An IMF spokesperson confirmed the first roundtable meeting would take place on Friday, and said more details would be released in the near future. The objective is to bring together key stakeholders involved in sovereign debt restructuring, from traditional creditors from advanced economies, to new creditors like China, Saudi Arabia, India, as well as the private sector and debt countries to address the current shortcomings, they said. The roundtable will include the Paris Club of official creditors and private sector participants - the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the International Capital Markets Association and two private-sector financial institutions that have asked not to be identified, one of the sources said. Creation of the body comes amid growing frustration about the slow pace of discussions on debt relief for Zambia, which first requested help two years ago. Organizers say the roundtable could help resolve issues in principle and will not focus on Zambia or other individual cases. Officials hope to resolve Chinas concerns about cutoff dates to protect new financing from debt restructuring by the end of the year, one of the sources said. G7, International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials have long pushed for faster and broader efforts to deliver debt relief to heavily indebted nations to avoid cuts in social services that they fear could tip off social unrest. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other G7 officials see China, now the worlds largest sovereign creditor, as the main stumbling block for quicker work on debt treatments. They are also pushing for agreement by G20 members on expanding the common framework to include middle-income countries. Eric LeCompte, executive director of the Jubilee USA Network, a coalition of religious, development and advocacy groups, said support for the matter was growing among other countries. But Chinas opposition - and that of Russia - remained significant a stumbling block, he said. The majority of countries support expanding these policies to middle-income countries, but China is the biggest challenge, LeCompte said, adding that Europe had gone through a similar period of reluctance on debt relief in the 1990s, but eventually came around. Also on the agenda will be Chinas repeated calls for World Bank and other multilateral development banks to participate in debt reductions - a proposal firmly rejected by U.S. officials, who argue that those lenders already offer highly concessional loans and grants to countries in crisis.

        "content": "A youth has been arrested for locking up a magistrate at his residence in Madapatha, Piliyandala on Saturday (Feb. 11) and stealing his car. The 27-year-old was taken into custody in the area of Oliyamulla in Wattala, according to police spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa. Chief Inspector Gamage Nilantha of Mt. Lavinia Police, posing as the brother of the magistrate had contacted the suspect, who had demanded a ransom, and tricked him into meeting up with him. A team of police officers clad in civilian clothing managed to arrest the suspect when he arrived at the location set up for the meeting. The police also found two air rifles, four knives, a poisonous liquid and a bag containing chilli powder from a housing unit in Homagama where the suspect was temporarily residing. It was reported that the suspect had visited the magistrates house feigning an interest in renting out the two-storied establishment. Previously, the magistrate had published an advertisement on a website to rent his two-storied house in Madapatha area. While the magistrate was showing him around the house, the suspect had locked him up in an upstairs room before fleeing with his car. Later, the magistrate, who jumped out of the window of the room where he was locked up, had filed a complaint with the police. During preliminary investigations, the police uncovered that the suspect had arrived in a hired three-wheeler. Investigations into the incident are being carried out by the officers of Piliyandala Police and Mount Lavinia Crimes Unit, together with the Western Province (South) Crimes Division.",

        "title": "New Zealand declares state of emergency over Cyclone Gabrielle",
        "date": "February 14, 2023 08:59 am",
        "content": "New Zealand has declared a state of emergency due to Cyclone Gabrielle, the third such alert in its history. The Minister for Emergency Management, Kieran McAnulty, signed the national declaration into place Tuesday morning. It will apply to the Northland, Auckland, Tairawhiti, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Hawkes Bay regions and streamline the governments response to the disaster. At least 38,000 homes were without power on Tuesday morning. In New Zealands largest city, Auckland, authorities earlier evacuated people from 50 homes around a 30m-high tower that was in danger of collapse, local media reported. Dozens of evacuation centres have also been set up in the city. Mr McAnulty described the storm as an unprecedented weather event. He said the state of emergency will allow for federal co-ordination of a clean- up response and would provide additional resources to those who are affected. It also gives the government more power to respond to dangerous situations, including restricting travel. New Zealands Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced a NZ11.5m (6m; US7.3m) aid package on Monday. Cyclone Gabrielle is hitting New Zealands north, just weeks after Auckland and surrounding areas endured record rainfall and flooding which killed four people. One firefighter is missing and another critically injured after a landslide took place at Aucklands west coast beach settlement Muriwai. The search for the second firefighter had to be called off because conditions were too dangerous. New Zealands meteorological agency, Metservice, said 100 to 260mm had fallen in the Hawke Bay region in the past 24 hours. Metservice on Wednesday said the cyclone would continue to bring severe weather to northern and central parts of New Zealand as it moved southeast. And red weather warnings which indicate significant flooding and widespread damage from strong winds were in place across much of the north island. Meanwhile, some 10,000 international Air New Zealand customers were disrupted by the cancellation of at least 509 flights. The Auckland airport said on Tuesday morning that international and domestic flights were expected to restart, but if weather conditions deteriorated, that could change. Source: BBC -Agencies",

Amarasinghe was produced before the Colobmo Magistrates Court this morning (Feb. 14). The YouTuber was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on January 05, after making several controversial statements about the much-venerated Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy. Amarasinghes claims led to a chaotic uproar amongst Sri Lankas predominantly Buddhist society, officials of the CID highlighted, while the Director General of Department of Archaeology also asserted that the slanderous statements in question were a grave wrongdoing. Against this backdrop, the chief prelates of Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters, Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thero and Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thero wrote to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, raising concerns about the offensive statements made by Amarasinghe, and urged the government to take necessary measures to nip the matter in the bud.

        "title": "Sri Lanka rejects Indian politicians claims on Prabhakaran being alive",
        "date": "February 14, 2023 10:44 am",
        "content": "The Ministry of Defence has vehemently denied a statement made by an Indian politician claiming that banned terror group LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is in fact alive and that he is expected to make a public appearance soon. Media Director of the Ministry of Defence Colonel Nalin Herath dismissed the relevant statement as ridiculous. In wake of fourteen years after the Sri Lankan government declared the LTTE leader Prabhakaran was dead, former politician in Tamil Nadu Pazha Nedumaran yesterday (Feb. 13) claimed that he is alive and healthy, and he will soon make a public appearance. Nedumaran, the president of the World Confederation of Tamils made this statement while speaking to the media in Thanjavur, India. LTTE leader Prabhakaran is alive and will appear soon. We are happy to announce this to the world. He will announce his plans for Tamil Eelam, he said. Explaining the timing of this announcement, he said, The fall of the Rajapaksa government after the Sinhala uprising in Sri Lanka has created a conducive situation. This is the right time for Prabhakarans appearance. However, Nedumaran has made claims of Prabhakaran being alive earlier too. In 2018, he had told The Indian Express, an Indian news agency, that he has reliable information that Prabhakaran is still alive. He was never captured he fled, Nedumaran had said. Following the Sri Lankan governments announcement of Prabhakarans death in 2009, several photographs and videos of his body were widely shared. Many had then claimed these were doctored. Others had alleged that the LTTE leader was shot dead in violation of international conventions when he came to surrender under a pact. Prabhakaran was 54 at the time. However, Pazha Nedumaran has not shared any details regarding the LTTE leaders present location. Nevertheless, the Media Director of the Ministry of Defence in Sri Lanka emphasized that the relevant statement is devoid of truth, highlighting it was confirmed through DNA testing that Prabhakaran was dead. Furthermore, he mentioned that Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman and also Daya Master, who were former members of the LTTE organization, confirmed that the LTTE leader Prabhakaran is dead, after observing his body. Prabhakaran was a prime accused in the assassination of Indias former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in a suicide bombing at Sriperumbudur, India in 1991 after which he was declared a proclaimed offender. He was also charged in some other assassination cases in the country, and LTTE was declared a banned terror organisation. What began as a liberation movement with few other groups opposing decades of discrimination against Tamils in Sri Lanka, LTTE leader Prabhakaran had later switched to armed struggle, known for its guerrilla warfare and suicide attacks. The LTTE became the first terror group to have an air force. -With agencies inputs",

        "date": "February 14, 2023 11:56 am",
        "content": "A gunman opened fire on Monday night at Michigan State Universitys main campus, killing three people and injuring five, some severely, before he was found dead hours later, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said. Few official details about the gun violence were immediately available, but Chris Rozman, interim deputy chief of the university police, said shots were fired in two locations - at an academic building called Berkey Hall and the Michigan State University (MSU) Union building. Police responding to the shooting, which began shortly after 8 p.m. (0100 GMT), found victims at both locations, Rozman told reporters at a televised briefing about three hours later. Rozman said investigators had no information about the motive. He also said the university was not aware of any threats made to the campus before Mondays bloodshed. Rozman said three victims were killed and five were taken to hospital, some of them with life-threatening injuries. Two of the dead were at Berkey Hall and the other at the MSU Union. Rozman said the suspect was contacted by law enforcement off campus at some point, adding, that scene is being investigated as a crime scene. The gunman was confirmed dead, from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot roughly four hours after the violence began, Rozman said. There is no longer a threat to campus. We believe there to be only one suspect in this incident, he said. Students, faculty and residents in surrounding off-campus neighborhoods of East Lansing, about 90 miles northwest of Detroit, had been told by authorities to shelter in place while the manhunt was on. About three hours after the shooting erupted, MSU police released two still images of the suspect, taken by a surveillance camera, that showed him walking into a building, then mounting a short flight of stairs, wearing a jacket, jeans, a baseball cap and a black mask over his lower face. MSU police said Monday night that all classes and school activities would be canceled for 48 hours at the universitys flagship East Lansing campus, a sprawling public academic center with some 50,000 students, mostly undergraduates. The violence came roughly 14 months after a deadly mass shooting on Nov. 30, 2021, at Oxford High School in Oakland County, Michigan, about 80 miles east of East Lansing, in which a 15-year-old student opened fire with a semi-automatic pistol. Four classmates were killed and six students and a teacher were wounded in that attack, the deadliest U.S. school shooting that year. Authorities said the teenage suspect in the 2021 shooting, who has pleaded not guilty to murder charges, used a gun his parents bought him as a Christmas present despite signs that he was emotionally disturbed. Both parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case. Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on Twitter that she was being briefed on the East Lansing shooting. Alexis Dinkins, an MSU sophomore who was inside Akers Hall, a dormitory on campus, told the Detroit News she heard people barricading doors and shouting, Go, go, go as the incident unfolded. As she and other fled the dorm, they encountered police who told them to go to a nearby bus stop. We dont feel safe anywhere, the Detroit News quoted Dinkins as saying as she stood with a group of students on a campus sidewalk after leaving Akers. She described the situation as terrifying.

        "title": "Treasury issues circular on paddy purchasing",
        "date": "February 14, 2023 12:41 pm",
        "content": "The Treasury has released a circular on the governments program for purchasing and distribution of paddy, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. The circular, signed by Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana, was issued on the directives of President Ranil Wickremesinghe given under his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies. The PMD says the objective of the paddy purchase and disbursement program is to offer farmers a fair price for their paddy harvest of 20222023 Maha Season, procure any surplus paddy stocks and to provide help to low-income households affected by the ongoing economic challenges. Accordingly, District Secretaries have been instructed to purchase only Nadu paddy from small- and medium-scale paddy owners and cooperative societies through 20222023 season paddy purchase program. Under this program, the cost of 1kg of good quality paddy with a minimum moisture content of 14 and a maximum spoil paddy content of 9 will be Rs. 100, the PMD said further, adding that 1kf of paddy with a moisture content over 14 and a maximum spoil paddy content of 22 or lower will cost Rs. 88. District and Divisional Secretaries are in charge of inventory management, storage, upkeep, and documentation related to the paddy procurement process. According to the PMD, as the acquired paddy stock will be milled and distributed in March and April 2023, the program will consider the milling capacity of small- and medium-scale mill owners and cooperative societies, and allocate funds accordingly. Mill owners and cooperative societies will be given preference. Under the program, a maximum of 2,000kg of paddy can be purchased from a single farmer with up to one acre of land, 4,000 kg for 1-2 acres, and 5,000 kg for over 2 acres, the PMD mentioned further. District Secretaries are required to inform the Development Finance Department of the General Treasury to obtain the necessary funds for the governments paddy purchase program, which will be executed via small- and medium-scale paddy mill owners and cooperative societies. Upon receiving notification, the Development Finance Department will direct District Secretaries to the National Budget Department to assign Treasury funds, and to the Treasury Operations Department to release the funds. The National Budget Department will allocate budget funds directly to the respective District Secretaries, and the Treasury Operations Department will release liquid cash to them for the purchase of paddy. Funds for the paddy purchase program will be released by the Treasury periodically as required. All District Secretaries are required to ensure that paddy is purchased only from farmers in their district and that the Bank of Ceylon issues a payment certificate in the name of the concerned farmer. When submitted to the appropriate Peoples Bank or Regional Development Bank branch, the required amount is immediately credited to the farmers bank account. To provide relief to the identified low-income families, 10kg of paddy per month per family will be distributed for a two-month period, and instructions regarding this will be issued by the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment. The district secretaries have been instructed on the necessary steps to ensure the success of the paddy purchase program, including the deployment of Civil Security Department (CSD) officers to ensure the security of the paddy stocks in the warehouses, as well as the appointment of a staff officer in each district to oversee the implementation of the program. It is expected that the entire public service will be dedicated and work exemplarily during the harvest period, in order to reduce government expenses. Other operational costs of the paddy purchase program will be subject to financial regulations, circulars, and other necessary government approvals. -PMD",

        "date": "February 14, 2023 03:56 pm",
        "content": "Australian officials said Tuesday dozens of Chinese-made security cameras would be ripped out of politicians offices, days after the countrys defence minister announced his department would remove the devices from its buildings due to security concerns. At least 913 Chinese-made security cameras have been installed across more than 250 Australian government buildings, including the Department of Defences facilities, according to figures released last week. Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles told national broadcaster ABC last week that all these cameras within his departments buildings would be removed, saying it was to make sure that our facilities are completely secure. Officials from the Department of Finance on Tuesday confirmed a further 65 closed-circuit television systems had been installed within offices used by Australian politicians. While the department had been gradually replacing the cameras as part of a broader security upgrade, at least 40 systems still needed to be stripped out, the department said, adding that they would be replaced by April. The CCTV cameras were not connected to the internet, and were being removed as a precaution, the department said. Similar moves have been made in the United States and Britain, which have taken measures to stop government departments installing Chinese-made cameras at sensitive sites. Both countries have expressed fears that Chinese companies could be forced to share intelligence collected by the cameras with Beijings security services. The cameras were made by companies Hikvision and Dahua, which have been blacklisted in the United States for allegedly helping the Chinese government carry out a campaign of repression. According to the US Department of Commerce, Hikvision and Dahua have been implicated in the high-technology surveillance of the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region. The US banned imports of surveillance equipment made by the two companies in November last year, saying it posed an unacceptable risk to national security. Hikvision has said it was categorically false to paint the company as a threat to national security. After Marles statements last week about removing Chinese-made cameras, Beijing accused Australia of misusing national might to discriminate against and suppress Chinese enterprises. We hope Australia will provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory environment for the normal operations of Chinese enterprises, Chinas foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.

        "date": "February 14, 2023 04:30 pm",
        "content": "The Walt Disney Company is planning to add an Avatar experience to Disneyland and explore other opportunities at its theme parks as it looks for more ways to appeal to its guests. While Disney announced last week that it is cutting about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and strategic reorganization, the company is pleased with the performance of its domestic theme parks and is actively looking for ways to grow the business. In Disneys most recent quarter, sales at its parks, experiences and products segment grew 21 to 8.74 billion, from 7.23 billion a year earlier. CEO Bob Iger said during the companys first-quarter earnings call that the success of the latest Avatar film is spurring the creation of an Avatar experience at Disneyland in California. The movie, Avatar: The Way of Water, is currently the fourth biggest film of all time globally with close to 2.2 billion earned at the box office to date. While it is unclear what type of Avatar experience will be created at Disneyland, Iger said that when Pandora - The World of Avatar was launched at Walt Disney World in Florida, it prompted more people to visit Animal Kingdom, the park where Pandora is located. Pandora includes two rides, Avatar - Flight of Passage and Navi River Journey. We have learned that when we invest in increasing capacity, the Star Wars lands would be a good example of that, Pandora was a great example of that, we can grow our business. In fact, if you look at the results, when we put Pandora in Animal Kingdom, from year to year, they were stunning in terms of how many more people visited Animal Kingdom, Iger explained. Iger, who returned as CEO in November following a challenging two-year tenure by his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek, said that he has spoken with Josh DAmaro, chairman of Disney parks, experiences and products, to look at all of the companys franchises to see where Disney can invest in them in its theme parks to increase capacity while preserving guest satisfaction. In another effort to keep guests happy, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the call that Disney managed to achieve significant revenue and operating income growth in the quarter despite purposefully lowering capacity at its domestic theme parks during select peak holiday periods by approximately 20 versus pre-pandemic levels in order to prioritize the guest experience. Quarter-to-date, park attendance at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are pacing above prior year, and based on reservation bookings, we expect to see this trend continue, she said. While Disneys theme parks business has been performing well, many visitors over the past two years have been highly critical of increased prices and other moves that the company made, including the end of the Magical Express bus service from the airport in Orlando, Florida to Walt Disney World resorts, the implementation of the Genie planning and ride reservation system and its theme park reservation system. Listening to guests concerns, Disney said last month that it was making several changes at its domestic theme parks, including some easier reservations. Among the changes: it will cease charging for overnight self-parking at its Walt Disney World resorts; Walt Disney World annual passholders will be able to visit the theme parks after 2 p.m. without needing a park reservation (except on Saturdays and Sundays at Magic Kingdom) and individuals buying its Genie service will receive digital downloads of their ride photos taken in the park on the day of their purchase for no additional charge.

        "content": "Burial of the Sri Lankan woman who died in the massive earthquake that rocked Turkey has been held in line with regulations imposed by the health authorities, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today in a press release. The ministry stated that the identity of the deceased Sri Lankan is withheld at the request of the family. A massive earthquake of a magnitude of 7.8 struck southern Turkey and northwest of Syria in the early hours of Monday (Feb. 06) while freezing cold weather added to the plights of the victims. It was followed by a multitude of aftershocks and a second powerful quake of a magnitude of 7.5. The death toll from the earthquake on both sides of the border in Turkey and Syria is now nearing 40,000 while over 86,000 have been evacuated from the earthquake area. The southeastern region of Turkey, following the destructive earthquake, has been experiencing many aftershocks and tremors, numbering over 2,000 and the death toll has soared past 29,600 and caused injuries to some 80,200 persons. President Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and informed that Sri Lanka has been ready to extend all possible assistance to the people of Turkey at this hour of insurmountable grief. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Ankara had been working to ascertain the welfare of the sixteen Sri Lankans who were living in the area affected by the earthquake and tremors, in coordination with the Turkey authorities. It has been confirmed that 15 of them, contacted by the Embassy are safe, while a Sri Lankan female who was living in HatayAntakya Province in Turkey, was reported missing. The Embassy was able to confirm the fate of the Sri Lankan concerned, according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.",

        "date": "February 14, 2023 06:00 pm",
        "content": "A collective of election monitoring organisations have written to the Ministry of Finance, urging to release the funds required by the Election Commission to hold the 2023 Local Government (LG) election. In a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the group highlighted that as per the previous requests made by the Commission, the Parliament has already allocated money for the 2023 LG election. Accordingly, they requested that the necessary funds, which have already been approved by the Parliament through the 2023 Budget, be released to the commission immediately, enabling them to proceed with the due process. The group noted that while the commission is statutorily bound to conduct the election as per Article 104b of the Constitution, it is also the duty of all state institutions and government officials to comply with the directives of the commission in this regard, as per Article 104b (2). Moreover, it was noted that as per Article 104GG (1) of the Constitution, any public officer who refuses or fails to cooperate with the commission pertaining to the enforcement of any law with regards to the holding of the election, without any reasonable cause, shall be guilty of an offence. Thus, the collective, comprising of the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), the Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES), Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE), Mothers and Daughters of Lakbima (MDL) and the National Polls Observation Centre (NPOC), urged the Ministry of Finance to release the relevant funds, stating that the elections were fundamental element of the peoples sovereignty.",

        "title": "President ensures all those in need will be included in paddy-purchase programme",
        "date": "February 14, 2023 06:56 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed officials to ensure no one in need is overlooked in providing rice to low-income families. Accordingly, the Head of State instructed all relevant officials to purchase rice for 2.85 million families, subject to maximum of Rs. 20 billion by way of a transparent mechanism. Speaking at a discussion held at the Ministry of Defence this afternoon (14 Feb.) pertaining to the purchase of paddy, Wickremesinghe further instructed that the paddy be purchased, milled and the rice be distributed among low-income earners through a transparent mechanism. Previously, it was decided to allocate Rs. 10,000 million to purchase 61,600 metric tons of paddy under the program of providing 2 million low-income families with 10 kg of rice each per month over a period of two months, free of charge. However, it was revealed during this discussion that 2.85 million families have been identified as being in need of this assistance, following which the aforementioned directive was issued. Below is an extract of the Presidents speech at the meeting; The Government is set to purchase rice worth Rs. 20 billion to distribute to 2,850,000 low-income families as part of its food security program. The government will protect the rice price by providing a guaranteed price. District and Divisional Secretaries have been delegated the task of purchasing paddy stocks. The government will not sell rice, and a full-time team will be deployed to take this program forward. A formal mechanism for distributing rice to eligible people in all 25 districts will be developed. The government is taking measures to prevent large-scale paddy mill owners from exerting unnecessary influence in purchasing paddy. The government aims to label the grant given to low-income families as relief rice to prevent its resale. Members of Parliament are being consulted, and discussions are on-going with the District Secretaries. However, this necessitates the deployment of a full-time team. The agreement was expressed during the discussion with the security forces to release a group of officials from Ministry of Defence for this purpose. Obtaining accurate data is crucial for the programs progress. If government officials are uncooperative at the village level, a contracted team should be recruited to expedite data collection. They should receive priority for future vacancies, and retired officials may also provide assistance. All activities must be completed within a designated timeframe. Meanwhile, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Presidents Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake said; We are currently in the process of establishing a social welfare safety net with support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, we are not satisfied with the progress of our data collection efforts thus far. As such, we plan to meet with the District Secretaries to discuss this matter and move forward with the necessary work. Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake also spoke at the discussion, asserting that the establishment of the social welfare safety net must not be sabotaged. The completion of these activities should be achieved by March 31, he said in this regard.",

The relevant petition claimed that the nomination paper in question had been rejected by way of a letter issued by the relevant Returning Officer, without giving any reason. Thus, the SLMC requested the court that a writ be issued, invalidating the decision made by the Returning Officer. Accordingly, the implementation of the letter in question was prevented by way of an interim order, effective until 21 February",

        "title": "Scammers profit from Turkey-Syria earthquake",
        "date": "February 14, 2023 07:36 pm",
        "content": "Scammers are using the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria to try to trick people into donating to fake causes, security experts have warned. These scams claim to raise money for survivors, left without heat or water following the disasters that have killed more than 35,000 people. But instead of helping those in need, scammers are channelling donations away from real charities, and into their own PayPal accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. Weve identified some of the main methods used by scammers, and tools you can use to double check before donating. On TikTok Live, content creators can make money by receiving digital gifts. Now, TikTok accounts are posting photos of devastation, looped footage and recordings of TVs showing rescue efforts, whilst asking for donations. Captions include phrases like Lets help Turkey, Pray for Turkey and Donate for earthquake victims. One account, which was live for over three hours, showed a pixelated aerial image of destroyed buildings, accompanied by sound effects of explosions. Off-camera, a male voice laughs and speaks in Chinese. The videos caption is Lets help Turkey. Donation. Another video shows a picture of a distressed child running from an explosion. The livestream hosts message is Please help achieve this goal- an apparent plea for TikTok gifts. But the photo of the child is not from last weeks earthquakes. A reverse image search found the same image had been posted on Twitter in 2018 with the caption Stop Afrin Genocide, referring to a city in north-western Syria where Turkish forces and their allies in the Syrian opposition ousted a Kurdish militia in that year. Another word of caution about gifting on TikTok: a BBC investigation found TikTok takes up to 70 of the proceeds of digital gifts, although TikTok says it takes less than that. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: We are deeply saddened by the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria and are contributing to aid earthquake relief efforts. Were also actively working to prevent people from scamming and misleading community members who want to help. On Twitter, people are sharing emotive images alongside links to cryptocurrency wallets asking for donations. One account posted the same appeal eight times in 12 hours, with an image of a firefighter holding a small child amid collapsed buildings. The picture used, however, is not real. Greek newspaper OEMA reports that it was created by the Major General of the Aegean fire brigade Panagiotis Kotridis using Artificial Intelligence software Midjourney. AI image generators often make mistakes, and Twitter users were quick to spot that this firefighter has six digits on his right hand. To verify this further, we asked colleagues from the BBCs tech research hub the Blue Room (part of BBC Research  Development) to try to generate similar images using the same software. They asked the software for an image of firefighter in aftermath of an earthquake rescuing young child and wearing helmet with Greek flag, and were given a series of options to choose from. Furthermore, one of the crypto wallet addresses had been used in scam and spam tweets from 2018. The other address had been posted on Russian social media website VK alongside pornographic content. When the BBC contacted the person tweeting the appeal, they denied it was a scam. They said they had poor connectivity, but answered our questions on Twitter using Google Translate. My aim is to be able to help people affected by the earthquake if I manage to raise funds, they said. Now people are cold in the disaster area, and especially babies do not have food. I can prove this process with receipts. However, they have not yet sent us receipts or proof of their identity. Elsewhere on Twitter, scammers create fake fundraising accounts and post links to PayPal. Ax Sharma, cyber security expert at Sonatype, says these accounts retweet news articles and reply to tweets by celebrities and businesses to gain visibility. They create fake disaster relief accounts that appear to be legitimate organisations or news outlets, but then drive funds to their own PayPal addresses, he told the BBC. One example is TurkeyRelief, which joined Twitter in January, has just 31 followers, and touts for donations via PayPal. The PayPal account has so far received US900 in donations. But that includes 500 from the creator of the page, who donated to their own cause. Mr Sharma says this is to make the fundraiser appear authentic. Its one of more than 100 fundraisers launched on PayPal in recent days asking for donations to support those affected by the earthquakes, some of which are fake. Mr Sharma says donors should be especially wary of accounts that say they are in Turkey, because PayPal has not been operating in Turkey since 2016. There are real charities outside of Turkey using PayPal, but when these fundraisers say theyre in Turkey, thats a red flag, he says. Other things to be vigilant of are anonymous donations and appeals that have raised small amounts. You would expect real charities to have significant funds according to Mr Sharma, yet many of the PayPal fundraisers have less than 100. PayPal has suspended the fraudulent account. A PayPal spokesperson told the BBC: While the vast majority of people using PayPal to accept donations have the best intentions, there are inevitably some who attempt to prey on the charitable nature and generosity of others. PayPal teams are always working diligently to scrutinise and ban accounts, particularly in the wake of events like the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, so that donations go to intended causes. Twitter has also suspended TurkeyRelief, but the company did not reply to requests for comment. Source - BBC - Agencies",

India provided economic assistance worth almost 4 billion, including a currency swap and lines of credit for emergency purchases of food, medicines and fuel to Sri Lanka during last years unprecedented economic crisis. New Delhi also took the lead in providing guarantees to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Colombo access a 2.9 billion bailout package. Moragoda has been meeting key Indian ministers for discussions on Sri Lankas economic recovery. During his meeting with Goyal, the two sides focused on a range of issues related to bilateral trade and commerce, particularly aimed at the island countrys economic recovery, the Sri Lankan high commission said in a statement. In this context, the two sides looked at ways to establish and promote rupee trade as a means of economic recovery in Sri Lanka, mechanisms for expanding bilateral trade, and the possibility of bilateral integration in the textiles and garment sector, the statement said.

        "title": "Gabon, Jamaica and Sri Lanka unite to fight hazardous skin lightening products",
        "date": "February 15, 2023 12:18 pm",
        "content": "The governments of Gabon, Jamaica and Sri Lanka have joined forces to fight back against damaging beauty practices, launching a joint 14-million project to eliminate the use of mercury in skin lightening products. Using cosmetics to inhibit the bodys production of melanin, leading the skin to appear lighter, is a centuries-old practice in many parts of the world that continues to take a toxic toll today. Both men and women use skin lightening products, not only to lighten their skin but to fade freckles, blemishes, age spots and treat acne. However, consumers are often unaware that many of these products contain harmful chemicals including mercury, a toxic substance which poses risks to human health and contaminates the environment. Skin lightening products can cause skin rashes and discolouration; scarring; nervous, digestive and immune system damage, as well as anxiety and depression. The Minamata Convention on Mercury has set a limit of 1mg1kg (1ppm) for mercury in skin lightening products. However, a 2018 Zero Mercury Working Group and Biodiversity Research Institute test of over 300 products from 22 countries found that approximately 10 per cent of skin lightening creams exceeded this limit, with many containing as much as 100 times the authorised amount. Led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and executed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI), the Eliminating mercury skin lightening products project will work to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury-added skin lightening products, raising awareness of the health risks associated with their use, developing model regulations to reduce their circulation, and halting production, trade and distribution across domestic and international markets. Mercury is a hidden and toxic ingredient in the skin lightening creams that many people are using daily, often without an understanding of just how dangerous this is, GEF CEO and Chairperson Carlos Manuel Rodriguez said. This initiative is significant as it focuses not only on substitutions for harmful ingredients, but on awareness building that can help change behaviours that are damaging to individual health as well as the planet. Skin lightening products dont just pose a risk to the user  children can be exposed through breastmilk, and food chains can become contaminated when cosmetics are washed off into wastewater. In addition, the compound can travel far from its point of dispersal, accumulating in the earth, water and soil without breaking down in the environment. With demand for skin lightening products projected to grow to 11.8-billion by 2026, fuelled by a growing middle class in the Asia-Pacific region and changing demographics in Africa and the Caribbean, the use of harmful ingredients in skin lightening products is a global issue. UNEP Industry and Economy Division Director Sheila Aggarwal-Khan said the use of mercury in skin lightening products was a serious public health issue in need of urgent attention. While Governments have agreed limitations on mercury use through the Minamata Convention, companies continue to manufacture, trade and sell toxic products to consumers, she said. UNEP is proud to work with these three countries, as well as a passionate set of co-financing partners to transform the industry. WHO calls for urgent action on mercury as one of the top chemicals of public health concern. The health impacts of mercury have been known for centuries but more people should become aware now, said Dr Annette Pruss, Acting Director, WHO Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. Countries should urgently act to take legal action against harmful practices so that this dangerous element is eliminated from skin lightening products that people use every day. The three-year project will bring the countries together to align their policies on the cosmetic sector with best practice, creating an enabling environment to phase out mercury and attempting to shift broader cultural norms on skin complexion through engaging organisations, healthcare professionals and influencers working in the field. Sema Jonsson, founder of project co-financier the Pantheon of Women Who Inspire, said the organisation wanted people to admire and be proud of their natural skin tone. We are all beautiful, Jonsson said. Not in spite of our skin but because of it. We need a new ideal to follow, one which is equated with humanity and not the fairness of ones skin. --United Nations Environmental Programme--",

Addressing an event in Colombo organized by the Sri Lanka Technology Campus (SLTC) Research University this morning (Feb 15), the Head of State said Sri Lanka is now at the stage of economic stabilization. In order to go ahead with the debt restructuring process, the country also needs to have political stability and social innovation, President Wickremesinghe noted. Sri Lanka has reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF on a USD 2.9 billion extended fund facility (EFF) program, provided that the island manages to secure assurances on debt restructuring from its creditors including China, India and the Paris Club, a grouping of major creditor nations.",

        "content": "A group of people reportedly attacked the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) party office in Dematagoda early this morning (Feb. 15). Member of the SJB, Mujibur Rahman said that several individuals have broken into the party office and caused severe damage to the billboards which were inside the office. Furthermore, Rahman alleged that the President has created a new culture of deploying gangs to destroy party offices by intimidating the candidates who vie for the upcoming Local Government (LG) election representing the SJB. Meanwhile, an SJB candidate of the upcoming LG election has been called to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the incident of torching President Rail Wickremesinghes private residence, he claimed. It is clear that invisible forces are acting out with the blessings of the President to prevent the victory of the SJB. Therefore, we must remember that especially in the city of Colombo, there has never been any incident of violence in history. No one has been harassed while engaging in politics when other governments were in power, he added. After Mr. Wickremesinghe became the President, the former ministers of Colombo have formed gangs and try to stop the movement of SJB.",

        "date": "February 15, 2023 12:56 pm",
        "content": "Various new details have reportedly been revealed pertaining to the recent death of businessman Onesh Subasinghe, who was found dead in an apartment in Jakarta, Indonesia. Amidst suspicions of foul play, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) confirmed that Subasinghe, who was the Managing Director at Opex Holdings, was murdered in order to obtain his life insurance worth USD 1.5 million, and his other properties worth billions of Rupees. Subasinghes Brazilian wife and her assistant, also of Brazilian nationality, are believed to be the main suspects, after it was revealed that both individuals had fled to Brazil after the murder with Subasinghes credit cards, mobile phone, his wristwatch, worth millions, and other valuables. While investigations are being carried out by both, the CID and a special Police unit in Indonesia, it is suspected that the deceaseds wife, identified as Rosa Silva, had brought her Brazilian friend to Sri Lanka, under the guise of her assistant, in order to plan out the murder. The couple were residing in a luxury apartment complex in Ward Place, Colombo, with their four-year-old daughter, where Silvas friend also came and stayed with them prior to their holiday to Indonesia. Police suspect that the trip to Indonesia was a part of the premeditated plan to murder Subasinghe, as it was easier to carry out the offence in a foreign country and then flee. The family of three and Silvas assistant departed for Indonesia on 20 January. Subsequently, suspicions arose amongst Subasinghes colleagues after they were unable to reach him from 31 January. Later, employees of the apartment also grew suspicious as the apartment in which the group were staying in had remained closed for a few days. Upon opening the door to the apartment, the apartment staff found Subasinghes body, and informed his private secretary of the incident on 03 February, while CCTV footage showed the deceaseds wife leaving the room on 31 January with her assistant and daughter, after placing the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.",

Speaking on his experience in Sri Lanka thus far, President and Co-Founder of Raid Amazones Alexandra Debanne said - My experience in Sri Lanka with the 20th Raid Amazones and the excellent feedback received by the participants last year convinced me to hold the 21st edition of Raid Amazones back-to-back in beautiful Sri Lanka. This would not have been possible without SriLankan Airlines and other partners. I made a promise to come back to Sri Lanka again, as I felt this is the best time to show the world how safe and authentic Sri Lanka is. The anticipated media coverage will especially help create more awareness of Sri Lanka as an adventure travel hotspot in France and the rest of Europe, where Raid Amazones is sought-after, and attract adventure-seekers.

        "date": "February 15, 2023 05:11 pm",
        "content": "Duangpetch Promthep, one of the 12 boys who was rescued from a Thai cave in 2018, has died in the UK. The 17-year-old was found unconscious in his dorm in Leicestershire on Sunday and taken to hospital, where he died on Tuesday, the BBC has been told. He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year. He was captain of the Thai boys football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. His emaciated but grinning face caught in the light of a diver, after the boys were found in the cave, was one of the most memorable images from the rescue. In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Promthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Market Harborough. Today my dream has come true, he wrote. Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. May Doms soul rest in peace, said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks. Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it, wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Promthep in 2018. When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together. Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream... if the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom. In a tweet, British Ambassador to Thailand Mark Gooding passed on his condolences to all his friends and family. Leicestershire Police said his death is not being treated as suspicious. Reports in Thailand said he suffered a head injury. Promthep studied in Vachiralai Bee School in Chiang Mai before he went to the UK. A diehard football fan, he had been a member of a youth team in Chiang Mai. His Instagram account is filled with posts on the sport, often accompanied with the hashtag footballismylife. One of his last posts in January shows a sketch of his dream teams football kit - jersey, shorts, socks and shoes with blue and pink stripes. What happened in 2018? After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Promthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave on their bicycles. It was one of the teams favourite haunts. But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave system to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. Promthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25. The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue. They were eventually brought out after being sedated with the drug ketamine. The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year.

        "date": "February 15, 2023 05:32 pm",
        "content": "The majority of Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) members have approved an increase in electricity tariffs by 66 effective from February 15, notwithstanding the objections raised by the commissions chairman Janaka Ratnayake. The electricity tariff hike proposal was passed as it was green-lighted by three PUCSL members, with Ratnayake vehemently opposing it. On January 02, the PUCSL received a Cabinet-approved proposal from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), seeking to increase electricity tariffs by 66 in order to secure additional revenue of LKR 287 billion for the utility to avoid losses. However, as the electricity tariff hike proposal became embroiled in heated debates, the PUCSL chairman and its members continuously failed to reach a consensus on the matter. Against this backdrop, two PUCSL members stepped down from their positions. Accordingly, on two occasions, new members were appointed to the commission to fill the vacant positions, with whom the commissions chairman took into account the tariff revision proposals yesterday. The electricity tariff revision proposal compiled by the PUCSLs tariff division, to generate revenue of LKR 142 billion by increasing the tariffs by 36, was tabled at the meeting of the commissions members yesterday. Three PUCSL members  Attorney-at-Law Chathurika Wijesinghe, Douglas Nanayakkara and S.G. Senaratne  opposed the proposed tariff revision, despite the go-ahead given by the PUCSL chairman. The trio had, however, green-lighted the electricity tariff hike proposal of the CEB, which seeks to increase the tariffs by a staggering 66. Although PUCSL chairman opposed this proposal, it was passed by the majority votes of the commissions members. Amidst the controversy, PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnayake, speaking on the matter, said the CEBs electricity tariff hike proposal is against the Electricity Act and the PUCSL Act, alleging that the commissions members have been pressurized by politicians, CEB officials and Power  Energy Ministry officials. According to him, the charges for those who consume less than 90 units in the domestic category will be increased by 250 as per the CEBs tariff revision proposal.",

Dr. Gunasekera further noted that the hospital has a separate division to overlook and accept donations. Speaking on the severity of the number of people diagnosed with cancer on a yearly basis in Sri Lanka, Dr. Suraj Perera raised concerns that there is an evident increase in the number of child cases being reported. He noted that at least 900 children are being diagnosed with cancer within a period of one year, of which nearly 250 succumb to the illness.

Under the circumstances, the IMF can either give loan on arrears and then wait for China to come on board by IMF spring meeting or later this year. Sri Lanka owes nearly USD 7.8 billion dollars to China which includes both bilateral lending from EXIM bank and commercial lending from Chinese development Bank. Over the years, the Rajapaksas with present President Ranil Wickremesinghe in cahoots, used these loans for sponsoring white elephant projects like Hambantota port, Mattala airport, Norocholai power plant and Colombo port city as a result of which Beijing was given long term tax concessions and a free run of the Island nation. While China was the favourite destination of the Sri Lankan political leadership since the present millennium, Colombo chose to stay away from India under pressure from Beijing and has still not said yes to the Indian proposal to develop the Trincomalee port. It is another matter that India provided some four billion dollars worth of aid including food, petrol and medicine, to Sri Lanka last year to tide over its raging economic crisis. With Chinese EXIM bank only willing to extend a two year debt moratorium to Colombo as of now, the Sri Lankan economy will hit the rock bottom soon or else IMF will have to give loan on arrears with further stringent conditions. This not only means further political instability in the Island nation and the obvious beneficiary of this ferment will be the Communist parties of Sri Lanka like the JVP. The political climate of Sri Lanka will remain uncertain but the first indicator of the extent of ferment will be the local elections next month. Unless the mainstream parties are able to recover from the hit, President Wickremesinghe, who is the lone MP from his party, may not be eager to announce the general elections. With USD at an all-time high against Sri Lankan rupee and food inflation into double digits, things will get much worse for Sri Lanka before they turn for the better. And this could take at least a decade. Source - Hindustan Times -Agencies",

        "date": "February 16, 2023 08:30 am",
        "content": "(CNN) World Bank President David Malpass plans to step down a year before his term is set to end, the organization announced Wednesday. Malpass will leave his position on June 30, the end of the World Banks fiscal year, after serving more than four years in the role. It has been an enormous honor and privilege to serve as President of the worlds premier development institution, Malpass said in a statement. With developing countries facing unprecedented crises, Im proud that the Bank Group has responded with speed, scale, innovation, and impact. The World Bank, a group of 187 nations, lends money to developing countries to help reduce poverty. Former US President Donald Trump appointed Malpass as World Bank chief in 2019 for a five-year period. As the largest shareholder, the United States traditionally appoints its president. During Malpass tenure, the organization responded to multiple crises, including a global pandemic and Russias war in Ukraine. The World Bank said Malpass implemented record surges in finances in response to both. He also focused on policies to increase economic growth, reduce government debt burdens, and help reduce poverty. But his tenure has been controversial. Malpass faced criticism from climate activists in September after he refused to confirm during a climate panel whether he accepted the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels were dangerously warming the planet. After an outpouring of criticism, many opponents called for his resignation. He later clarified to CNN that he was a not a a denier, and that fossil fuel emissions are clearly contributing to global warming. The World Bank also noted on Wednesday that it more than doubled its climate financing in 2022 to a record 32 billion. Malpass said he has decided to pursue new challenges and that this is an opportunity for a smooth leadership transition at the Bank Group. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday thanked Malpass for his service, saying in a statement: The world has benefited from his strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russias illegal and unprovoked invasion, his vital work to assist the Afghan people, and his commitment to helping low-income countries achieve debt sustainability through debt reduction. And while we all must continue to raise our collective ambitions in the fight against climate change, during President Malpass tenure the World Bank has made important recent advances in this area, she said. Yellen also noted his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and said the United States is looking forward to a transparent, merit-based and swift nomination for the next World Bank president. The opening also provides an opportunity for President Joe Biden to nominate an official who can implement the administrations green energy vision and help combat climate change while lowering energy costs for families.

        "date": "February 16, 2023 09:50 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) officials to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity to customers once the latest tariff revision is implemented. The Head of State also gave instructions to provide concessions to low-income families and solar rooftop systems to religious places, government and educational institutions, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The Ceylon electricity board as the licensee made a request for the revision of electricity tariff on the 05th of January under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act 2009 which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday (15). However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a directive to the Minister of Power and Energy and the relevant CEB officials this morning (16) to implement the tariff revision ensuring the uninterrupted power supply for the electricity customers, provide concessions for low-income families and provide solar rooftop systems for religious places and government education institutions, the PMD reported. The directives came a day after the CEB announced that the Public Utilities Commission green-lighted its proposal seeking a 66 increase in electricity tariffs to generate additional revenue of LKR 287 billion to avoid losses. On January 05, the CEB, as the licensee, made a request for the revision of electricity tariffs under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act 2009. Three of the commissions members Attorney-at-Law Chathurika Wijesinghe, Douglas Nanayakkara and S.G. Senaratne gave the nod to the CEBs tariff hike proposal while rejecting the PUCSLs tariff divisions proposal seeking a tariff increase of 36. However, the electricity sector regulators chairman Janaka Ratnayake vehemently opposed the CEBs tariff hike proposal, stressing that it is against the Electricity Act and the PUCSL Act. He also alleged that the commissions members had been pressurized by politicians, CEB officials and Power  Energy Ministry officials. As per the new electricity tariff revision, the rate charged per one unit of electricity for the first 30 units in the domestic category, is increased to Rs. 30 from the previous rate of Rs. 08. It has also been proposed to increase the Rs. 10 charged per unit for the units consumed between 31-60 up to Rs. 37 and for the consumption block of 61-90 units to Rs. 42 from Rs. 16.",

        "date": "February 16, 2023 10:40 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lanka and India will sign a pact to link their power grids and start negotiations on an upgraded trade agreement within two months, a Sri Lankan diplomat said on Wednesday, as the island nation seeks a way out of its worst economic crisis in decades. India has provided some 4 billion in assistance to its southern neighbour since the crisis hit early last year, but Sri Lanka is now seeking to enhance trade and investments as it moves to close a 2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the countrys envoy to New Delhi told Reuters. We have to have growth, otherwise basically the economy will shrink, Milinda Moragoda said. As far as growth is concerned, India offers that prospect. So we will have to move on that. Tourism from India, investment from India, integration with India. Thats what we have to do. A key part of Sri Lankas economic recovery plan rests on developing its renewable energy resources in the islands north, from where power can be transported into southern India through a cross-border transmission cable. The two countries resumed talks on linking their electricity grids last year, and Moragoda said a memorandum of understanding on the project would be signed within two months, which will be followed by a feasibility study. First proposed more than a decade ago, the project has made little progress so far. But Moragoda said Sri Lanka hoped to get the transmission line in place within two to three years so that renewable power produced on the island can be sold to India. We need to have more sources of foreign exchange and electricity will be ideal, he said. The neighbours will also start negotiations within weeks on enhancing an existing free trade agreement, Moragoda said, as part of a push by Sri Lanka to seal deals with key trading partners, including China and Thailand. On our side, we are just about to nominate the (negotiations) team, he said, adding that the focus would be on enhancing trade in sectors including textiles and garments, a major foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. India is Sri Lankas biggest trading partner accounting for about 5 billion each in bilateral trade in 2021. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 16, 2023 11:22 am",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says an uninterrupted power supply will be provided from today (Feb. 16) onwards as the new power tariff revision has been implemented. Speaking during a special press conference regarding the electricity tariff revision this morning, Minister Wijesekera mentioned that the President has also directed him to provide an uninterrupted power supply to the people. Furthermore, he stated that the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) has agreed to provide an additional loan of Rs. 22 billion for the purchase of coal, with the approval being granted for the electricity tariff revision. Accordingly, the new electricity tariff revision will be implemented from today (Feb. 16), the Minister said. If the proposal we brought in January was implemented in January, it would have been easier for us. However, I think we can ensure uninterrupted power supply from today, in spite of any delay. The Minister, who pointed out that several individuals had attempted to spread rumours that the tariff revision is done in order to cover the previous losses of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), emphasized that this new system has been proposed only to cover the cost of generating electricity from today. The main reason for implementing this new tariff revision is that during the debt restructuring, there was one condition of the IMF that the funds cannot be provided for the public institutions such as CEB, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and SriLankan Airlines from the Treasury or the Central Bank hereon, he added. Commenting further, the Minister also explained that the CEB did not have a system of charging the tariff to meet the cost bared in providing electricity, but under various governments, the treasury filled the gap between the cost and the imposed tariff. I do not believe that there will be any other hike in the electricity tariff in the near future. By implementing this system, our government hopes to continue an uninterrupted electricity supply, Minister Wijesekara asserted. Furthermore, he stated that the burden on people will be reduced through the next revisions and the electricity bill will be reduced for the people.

        "date": "February 17, 2023 01:46 pm",
        "content": "Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya has given orders to appoint a five-member committee of experts to prepare a report on the death of prominent businessman Dinesh Schaffter. To this end, the additional magistrate called for a list of senior Judicial Medical Officers (JMOs) from the Director-General of Health Services. Meanwhile, University Grants Commission (UGC) was ordered to submit a list of senior university lecturers who specialized in forensic medicine. Upon receiving the two lists, an experts committee will be appointed to probe the matter as contradictions have been observed in the post-mortem reports. The additional magistrate later fixed the case to be taken up for hearing again on February 20. Earlier this week, the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court ordered the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) and the Government Analyst to preserve the body specimens of the 52-year-old if any such specimens have been obtained for testing or investigative purposes. The Janashakthi PLC Director was found tied up in the driving seat of his car at the Borella cemetery on December 15, 2022, and was rushed to the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo. He passed away while undergoing treatment. Investigations had revealed that Schaffter had left home at Flower Road in Cinnamon Garden at around 2.00 p.m. on December 15, informing his wife and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of one of his companies that he was going to meet an individual who owes him a large sum of money. At around 2.48 p.m. on the same day, Schaffter had shared his live location with his wife and the CEO. The live location ended from the General Cemetery in Borella and the calls made by his wife had gone unanswered. Due to growing suspicions, Schaffters wife had asked the relevant CEO to check on Schaffter. Subsequently, the CEO had driven to the cemetery in search of Schaffter. At around 3.00 p.m., the CEO found Schaffters car parked inside the cemetery. Schaffter had been tied with zip ties and a wire around his neck at the time he was found by the CEO, who later freed Schaffter with the assistance of a cemetery labourer and admitted him to the National Hospital in Colombo at around 3.15 p.m. Schaffter, who was in critical condition, died at around 10.30 p.m. while receiving treatment at the hospitals ICU. The police have also found an electrical code inside Schaffters car. Subsequently, the Homicide and Organised Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had launched an investigation in collaboration with the Borella police. The CID investigations had also revealed that the cemetery labourer had witnessed an unknown individual walking away from Schaffters car. Meanwhile, the remains of the deceased were produced before the chief medical officer at the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. The post-mortem had revealed that the death had occurred due to strangulation. However, it was later revealed that Schaffters death had been the result of cyanide ingestion. Further, the post-mortem report had also concluded that the injuries caused by strangulation were not fatal. Statements have been recorded from more than 20 people with regard to the incident. Among them were Schaffters wife and former English cricket commentator Brian Thomas, his wife and family members.",
