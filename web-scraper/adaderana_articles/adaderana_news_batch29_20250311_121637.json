        "title": "Conclave triumphs at SAG Awards and Timothée Chalamet wins best actor, upending Oscar predictions",
        "date": "February 24, 2025 11:26 am",
        "content": "The papal thriller Conclave won best ensemble and Timothée Chalamet took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable awards season. In winning the guilds top award, Edward Bergers Vatican-set drama triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic respiratory crisis. Conclave dramatizes the fictional election of a new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the casts best wishes for Pope Francis. All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Bakers Anora, which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds. Now, with Conclave winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what will nab best picture in a weeks time at the Academy Awards is, again, anyones guess. Wow, said Conclave star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. Ive not been elected to speak. Ive been designated to speak on behalf of our conclave, our ensemble. That wasnt the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamets best actor win upset The Brutalist star Adrien Brody and put the 29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award. Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the A Complete Unknown star spoke with composure and confidence. The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life, said Chalamet. I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing him. He then added: The truth is, Im really in pursuit of greatness. I know people dont usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. The other Oscar favorites  Demi Moore, Zoe Saldaña and Kieran Culkin  all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their picks dont always align exactly with those of the film academy, but they often nearly do. The last three best ensemble winners  Oppenheimer, Everything Everywhere All at Once and CODA  all went on to win best picture at the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone, who won SAGs award for female actor last year for Killers of the Flower Moon, but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for Poor Things.) Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her Golden Globe win for her performance in The Substance. Moore, whose campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a popcorn actress, has traded awards with Anora breakthrough Mikey Madison. What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think, said Moore. The saying, Ill believe it when I see it  the reality is when I believe it, I will see it. The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell introduced attending firefighters as the most attractive tables among a sea of stars. Jane Fonda, 87, given the guilds Life Achievement Award, provided the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trumps administration. We are in our documentary moment, said Fonda. This is it. And its not a rehearsal. Fonda added that woke just means you give a damn about other people. A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by whats happening, by whats coming our way, said Fonda. We are going to need a big tent to resist whats coming at us. Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for Hacks. Smart didnt attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her character, Deborah Vance. Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen White to win best male actor in a comedy series for Only Murders in the Building. The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble. Wait, we never win. This is so weird, said Selena Gomez. Marty and Steve (Martin) arent here because, you know, they dont really care. Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in The Penguin and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee Curtis, as the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes. Farrell bounded to the stage and promptly responded, Guilty as charged, before blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him. The nights first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category for A Real Pain. Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference. It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors, said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me. Netflixs Emilia Pérez, which has seen its awards hopes largely dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascón, took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite Saldaña. For Netflixs second time around streaming the awards, it inserted ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fondas speech. After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, Shōgun kept up its dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer ode The Fall Guy. Source: AP --Agencies",

The suspects, a 30-year-old man and his 33-year-old wife from Delgoda, were apprehended during an operation in the Wisakam Mawatha area of Hokandara based on a tip-off received, the police said. According to police, officers signaled the suspects vehicle to stop, but the driver attempted to flee by reversing the car at high speed.

        "date": "February 24, 2025 12:20 pm",
        "content": "A tragic train collision that killed seven wild elephants in the Gal Oya area on February 20 has reignited concerns over railway safety and conservation efforts. The Wildlife Conservation Society alleges that the driver of the Meenagaya train which was involved in a tragic train collision that killed seven wild elephants in the Gal Oya area on February 20 was a 67-year-old whose certification from the Public Service Commission as a train driver had expired on January 15. The Secretary of the Wildlife Conservation Society Nayanaka Ranwella said that despite lacking proper authorization, the driver was allegedly permitted to operate the train under the directive of a superior officer. The driver who was at the controls did not have a valid recommendation from the Public Service Commission. His authorization period ended over a month ago. We believe that at least 19 train drivers in the Railway Department are in a similar situation. The responsible officials, including Minister Bimal Ratnayake, must immediately look into this issue, Ranwella stated. The incident has once again highlighted the longstanding problem of wild elephants being struck by trains, an issue that authorities have yet to resolve effectively. Conservationists and railway unions have repeatedly urged for improved safety measures. Indika Dodangoda, convener of the Trade Union Alliance for the Development of Railways, emphasized the urgent need for a reliable communication system to prevent such collisions. The equipment installed in train engines to detect elephants is either malfunctioning or entirely non-functional, despite full payments being made to the relevant companies. Furthermore, an adequate number of devices were never purchased for installation across the railway network, even though the project has already cost 17 million, Dodangoda explained. Dodangoda stressed the necessity of an integrated warning system, stating, A communication mechanism should be in place to send alerts about elephant movements near railway tracks. Without such technology, these tragedies will continue.",

The accident had taken place in the Nanu Oya area on the Talawakelle - Nuwara Eliya main road.

At the time of the incident, the truck was transporting three cubes of sand, the police said. Police have advised drivers to exercise caution when traveling through the area, as the large amount of sand spilled on the road has made it slippery.

        "date": "February 24, 2025 02:28 pm",
        "content": "The gunman responsible for the murder of the notorious criminal and drug trafficker known as Ganemulla Sanjeewa was recruited by criminals through Facebook, according to Police Media Spokesperson, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Buddhika Manathunga. Speaking on Ada Deranas current affairs program Big Focus today (24), SSP Manathunga revealed that the suspect, a former military personnel, was approached via social media with messages such as, You have no job, right? Are you just staying idle? Lets do a little business? These interactions ultimately led to the suspects involvement in the killing, he added. Based on past experiences, we can clearly see that the majority of those engaged in such crimes are former members of the armed forces or police. The Defense Secretary has instructed that they be arrested. If military personnel desert without legally discharge, it is considered an offense under the law, and provisions exist to apprehend them, SSP Manathunga stated.  He further explained that the criminals behind the murder of Ganemulla Sanjeewa specifically targeted the shooter when he was unemployed and no longer in military service. Using social media as a tool, they manipulated him into committing the crime. In particular, they ensured he was out of the military before luring him in through Facebook. They initiated contact and gradually influenced him, he added. Defense authorities have now intensified their monitoring of police and military deserters, pledging to take stringent action against those engaging in criminal activities. We will track down and arrest these individuals in the near future, SSP Manathunga affirmed.",

        "title": "Foreign leaders visit Ukraine to show their support on wars third anniversary",
        "date": "February 24, 2025 02:58 pm",
        "content": "A dozen leaders from Europe and Canada visited Ukraines capital Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russias invasion in a show of support for Kyiv by some of the nation at wars most important backers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among the visitors greeted at the train station by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and the presidents chief of staff Andrii Yermak. In a post on X, von der Leyen wrote that Europe was in Kyiv because Ukraine is in Europe. In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. Its Europes destiny, she wrote. The guests, also including European Council President Antonio Costa as well as the prime ministers of Northern European countries and Spain, were set to attend events dedicated to the anniversary and discuss supporting Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid a recent U.S. policy shift under President Donald Trump. In the latest sign of Europes efforts to rework its strategy on Ukraine to respond to Trumps actions, Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security, Costa said in a post on social media. The three-year mark of the war in Ukraine came at a sensitive moment for Kyiv as Zelenskyy navigates a rapidly changing international environment upended by Trumps changes to the U.S. approach to the war. The U.S. leader has sought to follow through on his campaign promises to end the war quickly, though his methods for doing so have alarmed many in Ukraine and Europe who believe that his approach is too conciliatory toward Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Russias foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. And on Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state TASS news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week, adding that quite a lot of contact was ongoing between the Russian and American sides. Leaders across the EU, fearing both that Trumps approach to Ukraine would lead to an unfavorable settlement for Kyiv and that they  among Ukraines most important supporters  would be sidelined in negotiation for peace, have rushed to assert their own response to the rapidly shifting environment. The EUs top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted on Monday that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal, Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she is chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Asked whether the U.S. administration is acting in the interests of Russia or Ukraines Western backers, she said: If you look at the messages that come from the United States, then its clear that the Russian narrative is there very strongly represented. Kallas rejected Trumps earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, Russia hasnt had elections in 25 years. Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted there will be elections and people will make their choice. Coming off a victory in Sundays German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz  also a staunch backer of Ukraine  posted on X Monday: More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength. For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations, Merz wrote. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a video message, parts of which were being aired on Ukrainian television, that peace and freedom in Europe demand of us that we support Ukraine resolutely, and said Germany would not ease up on its humanitarian and military support for Kyiv for as long as this illegal war lasts. The U.K. was expected to announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday, having earlier described them as the biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Sunday said the measures would be aimed at eroding Russias military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defenses downed 113 drones launched by Russia at 12 regions overnight with another 71 lost according to the daily air force report. The report said that as a result of the attack, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Kyiv, and Khmelnytskyi regions suffered, but did not provide further details. On Sunday, the eve of the wars three-year anniversary, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 267 drones into Ukraine overnight, more than in any other single attack of the war. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) revealed that it has received a significant number of complaints against police officers regarding allegations of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment and inaction with respect to complaints. The Human Rights Commission raised these concerns during a recent dialogue to discuss critical human rights concerns related to the Sri Lanka Police. The HRCSL expressed concern over the increasing number of complaints received against police officers, regarding allegations of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment, and inaction with respect to complaints. The commission acknowledged that efforts are being made to address these issues under the new police administration. The police, meanwhile, underscored their target to significantly reduce rights violations within the next year. Specific attention was drawn to the role of the Special Investigation Unit of Sri Lanka Police, particularly in terms of investigating law enforcement officers allegedly involved in torture and enforced disappearance. The HRCSL raised concerns with respect to the low levels of prosecution and convictions in this regard. The Commission also raised concerns with respect to the rights of human rights defenders to engage in the advocacy of human rights, including the right to stage peaceful protests against government policies. The HRCSL also raised concerns regarding the lack of representation of female police officers and the presence of Tamil-speaking officers in specific regions, and Sri Lanka Police noted that it will be addressed in upcoming recruitment efforts. The Human Rights Commission stressed the need for better training for officers, especially for those who handle women, children, online gender-based violence, and LGBTQI-related cases. Acting Inspector General of the Police, Priyanthya Weerasooriya, noted that Sri Lanka Police has initiated proceedings under the Torture Act of 1994 in response to allegations of torture and agreed to issue advisory notes on protecting human rights defenders, preventing custodial deaths, and ensuring transgender rights. The Acting IGP also agreed to raise awareness among officers about HRCSL Act provisions protecting commission officials from legal action.",

        "date": "February 24, 2025 09:59 pm",
        "content": "Welcoming the latest budget in Sri Lanka, the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) recently expressed serious concern over the potential impact of a premature removal of the simplified value-added tax (SVAT) without a clear, well-tested alternative. Ensuring a smooth and transparent transition from SVAT is crucial to maintaining the apparel industrys competitiveness and sustaining investor confidence, JAAF said. Timely VAT refunds and a robust mechanism to prevent delays will be key to safeguarding liquidity for exporters, it stressed. The Forum was among those who had advocated a digitally-driven VAT refund solution with minimal human intervention, ensuring efficiency and transparency. A poorly managed transition could create cash flow constraints for exporters, disrupt operations, and damage Sri Lankas reputation as a stable sourcing destination, especially at a time when global brands prioritise supply chain reliability, it said in a statement. The apparel sector contributes over 40 per cent to total merchandise exports of the country. JAAF requested the government to work closely with industry stakeholders to ensure a seamless VAT transition, incorporating efficient digital refund processing mechanisms to prevent disruptions. The proposed private sector wage increases should be coupled with the removal of the two Budgetary Relief Allowance Acts so that the National Minimum Wage becomes a consolidated value, including all allowances, it suggested. Clarity on tax administration, timely execution of trade facilitation measures, and continued focus on export competitiveness will be critical to meet the ambitious export targets, it was quoted as saying by domestic media reports.

        "date": "February 24, 2025 10:19 pm",
        "content": "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose soulful voice and intimate style defined the 1970s, has passed away at the age of 88. She died at home, surrounded by family, her publicist confirmed. In 2022, Flack revealed she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which left her unable to sing. Flacks rise to stardom came unexpectedly in her early 30s, with Clint Eastwoods 1971 film Play Misty for Me using her rendition of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face for a memorable love scene. The ballad topped the charts in 1972 and won a Grammy for Record of the Year. In 1973, she followed this success with Killing Me Softly with His Song, becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for Best Record. Discovered by jazz musician Les McCann in the late 1960s, Flack was praised for her emotive voice, which McCann said touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion Ive ever known. Born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia, Flack was a classically trained pianist who received a full scholarship to Howard University at just 15. She was a powerful figure both musically and socially, with deep ties to the civil rights movement. Her circle included figures like Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, for whom Flack notably visited in prison. Flack also performed at Jackie Robinsons funeral and contributed to the groundbreaking childrens project Free to Be...You and Me. Flacks other iconic hits from the 1970s included the smooth Feel Like Makin Love and two memorable duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate, Donny Hathaway: Where Is the Love and The Closer I Get to You. Their collaboration, however, ended in tragedy. In 1979, while working on a duet album, Hathaway suffered a breakdown during recording and tragically fell to his death from his Manhattan hotel room that same night. We were deeply connected creatively, Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway album. He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) Id had before or since. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 25, 2025 09:06 am",
        "content": "North Korean hackers have stolen 1.5 billion in cryptocurrency in a single heist, making it the largest crypto hack on record, security experts told CNN. The hack hit Bybit, which describes itself as the worlds second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, with over 40 million users. In a matter of minutes on Friday, the hackers stole a significant portion of North Koreas reported annual gross domestic product. And over the weekend, the hackers were already laundering about 160 million of the stolen loot through a series of accounts connected to North Korean operatives, according to crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs. In a single hack, the North Koreans have nearly doubled what they stole in crypto last year, the firm said. Its an early test for how the Trump administration will address the steep challenge of trying to prevent North Korea from funding its nuclear and missile programs through hacking. Weve never seen anything on this scale before. The ability of these illicit financial networks to absorb such huge amounts of money so quickly is deeply concerning, said Nick Carlsen, a former FBI intelligence analyst focused on North Korea who now works at TRM Labs. North Koreas formidable hacking corps is an essential source of revenue for the nuclear-armed, sanctions-battered dictatorship, according to current and former US and South Korean officials. North Korean hackers have stolen billions of dollars from banks and cryptocurrency firms in the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. About half of North Koreas missile program has been funded by such digital heists, a White House official said in 2023. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has told users that the firm is solvent and can cover the loss of the 1.5 billion, the firm said in a statement. Bybit worked closely with regulators and law enforcement agencies to address the hack, the statement said. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no comment on the Bybit heist. CNN has requested comment from the North Korean embassy in London. Once a big crypto heist is carried out, North Korean operatives have to get the money back to Pyongyang. The laundering process usually involves a series of swaps through different types of digital currency, before eventually being converted to US dollars or Chinese yuan. US and South Korean law enforcement agents monitoring the laundering process usually have mere minutes to pounce and seize some of the stolen loot. CNN previously reported on one such sting operation that clawed back 1 million out of 100 million the North Koreans had allegedly stolen from a California-based cryptocurrency firm. Investigators are currently trying to intercept some of the 1.5 billion stolen from Bybit. One group of crypto security experts said they helped recover about 43 million in stolen funds so far. Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, another crypto-tracing firm, said that an additional 243,000 of the stolen money had been seized: A drop in the ocean, but a start. Bybit said it would give 10 of any recovered funds to security experts who played a role in retrieving the stolen money. Carlsen, the former FBI analyst, said the US and others need to be more aggressive in trying to intercept the North Koreans stolen crypto hauls. The current strategy from governments and industry clearly isnt working, Carlsen said. People should be going back through drawing board right now on how to deter and punish North Korea for these hacks. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners",
        "date": "February 25, 2025 09:11 am",
        "content": "Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including humiliating handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to grave danger and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deals first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was precarious and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the dignified release of all remaining hostages. On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deals first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages families condemned the video as a sickening display of cruelty. There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibass body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfirs captors killed the boys with their bare hands, contradicting Hamass claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime ministers office said the release would be postponed in light of Hamass repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes. It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies. Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israels decision as a blatant violation of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released, Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that all options are on the table. Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step will happen, he added. Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians? Naim said Hamas had discussed Israels complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israels decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an appropriate response to what it called the barbaric treatment of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trumps Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting an extension of phase one. Were hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released, he told CNN on Sunday. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deals first phase. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefires second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gazas population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70 of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

        "date": "February 25, 2025 09:57 am",
        "content": "The Director of the Astronomy and Space Sciences Unit at the University of Colombos Department of Physics, Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, says that a rare celestial phenomenon is currently taking place, allowing Sri Lankans the observation of seven planets of the solar system aligned in a row. According to Professor Jayaratne, this remarkable event will be visible from Sri Lanka after sunset from today (25) until February 28. He further explained that all planets of the solar system, except Earth, can be seen following a common path during this period. The phenomenon, known as an alignment, will allow Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn to be visible without any optical assistance, according to NASA. To catch Neptune and Uranus, youll need the help of a telescope. Combinations of neighboring seven planets have been visible throughout January and February as well. This spectacular display will not occur again until 2040, said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne. Best Viewing Tips: To observe this rare spectacle, it is recommended to go to a location with a reasonable horizon, preferably on top of a tall building or a hilltop with no street lights. Since all the planets follow the same general path across the sky, they can be spotted by looking along an imaginary line drawn from west to east. Although they appear in an arc, they are not actually arranged in a straight line in space, said Prof. Jayaratne.  Just after sunset, start by looking west, above the spot where the Sun has set. Venus will be the brightest in the western sky, with Saturn and Mercury just below it.  Draw a line between the two planets, Saturn and Venus, then follow that line upwards to find Jupiter high overhead.  Continuing along this line, Mars will be visible glowing red to the east.  The other two planets are not visible to the naked eye. With a telescope and some practice, you can spot Neptune glowing blue between the Mercury and Venus, then Uranus just to the west of Jupiter In August 2025, another alignment will occur when four planets will be visible at once before sunrise.",

        "title": "Pope Francis shows slight improvement and resumes some work, while still critical, Vatican says",
        "date": "February 25, 2025 10:56 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis remained in critical condition Monday but showed slight improvement in laboratory tests and resumed some work, the Vatican said, including calling a parish in Gaza City that he has kept in touch with since the war there began. The Vaticans evening bulletin was more upbeat than in recent days, as the 88-year-old Francis battles pneumonia in both lungs at Romes Gemelli hospital. It was issued shortly before the Vaticans No. 2 led the faithful in a somber night-time recitation of the Rosary prayer in St. Peters Square that evoked the vigils when St. John Paul II was dying. For 2,000 years the Christian people have prayed for the pope when he was in danger or sick, Cardinal Pietro Parolin told the rain-dappled piazza. Standing on the same stage where Francis usually presides, Parolin said ever since Francis had been hospitalized, a chorus of prayers for his recovery had swelled up from around the world. Starting this evening, we want to unite ourselves publicly to this prayer here, in his house, Parolin said, praying that Francis in this moment of illness and trial would recover quickly. The Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. But in Mondays update, they said he hadnt had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, and the supplemental oxygen he is using continued but with a slightly reduced oxygen flow and concentrations. The slight kidney insufficiency detected on Sunday was not causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded. Francis received the Eucharist Monday morning and resumed working in the afternoon. In the evening he called the parish priest of the Gaza parish to express his fatherly closeness, the statement said. For over a year, Francis has checked in daily via videocall with the Argentine priest, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, who leads the Catholic community at the church, which during Israels war had served as a shelter for Palestinians. Romanelli had reported hearing from Francis soon after he was hospitalized, but not since. He had sent Francis a video, and the pope called to thank him, the Vatican said. Francis was in good spirits, was not in pain and was not receiving artificial nutrition, the Vatican said. The work he was doing included reading and signing documents, and indeed the Vaticans daily noon bulletin has included new bishop nominations nearly every day, even though most were decided in advance. At the Gemelli hospital, the mood was nevertheless grim. Bishop Claudio Giuliodori presided over an emotional, standing-room-only Mass in the chapel named for John Paul, who was hospitalized there many times. Some of the estimated 200 people who attended were in white doctors coats or green surgical scrubs; some knelt in prayer. We are very sorry. Pope Francis is a good pope, lets hope that he makes it. Let us hope, said a choked-up Filomena Ferraro, who was visiting a relative at Gemelli on Monday. We are joining him with our prayers but what else can we do? Doctors have warned that the main threat facing Francis is sepsis, a serious infection that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. To date there has been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican. At 10 full days, this hospitalization now stands as Francis longest as pope. He spent 10 days at Romes Gemelli hospital in 2021 after he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka continues its upward trajectory in the Global Soft Power Index 2025",
        "date": "February 25, 2025 11:03 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka rose one spot to rank 97th globally among 193 nations, with a score of 33.6 out of 100 in the Brand Finance Global Soft Power Index 2025, according to a new report from Brand Finance, the worlds leading brand valuation consultancy. The rise can be attributed to the nations ongoing development and growing influence on the global stage, where it has demonstrated gradual improvements in lifestyle appeal, sustainability, and inclusivity. Sri Lanka ranks 79th globally in the Culture  Heritage pillar, experiencing a slight dip of one position from 2024. Despite this, the country maintains a strong presence, securing 55th place for rich heritage, and making an impressive 15-place leap in an appealing lifestyle, advancing from 135th to 120th globally, underscoring its enduring cultural legacy and global respect. Although there has been a minor regression in some areas, including a two-place drop to 76th for a great place to visit and a slip to 60th for leaders in sports, these changes do little to diminish Sri Lankas broad international appeal. The rankings continue to highlight the nations deep cultural richness, vibrant tourism sector, and growing influence in global sports. In the People  Values pillar, Sri Lanka demonstrated notable progress, particularly for the fun attribute, where its rank has risen to 93rd, a positive shift of 3 places. Most remarkable is Sri Lankas substantial improvement in the tolerant and inclusive attribute, where it has surged to 78th from 111th in the previous year (up 33 places). This significant leap highlights the increasing global recognition of the countrys efforts to foster inclusivity and tolerance, further reinforcing Sri Lankas reputation as a culturally rich and welcoming nation. Ruchi Gunewardene, Chairman, Brand Finance Sri Lanka, commented: Sri Lankas continued progress across key areasarts and entertainment, inclusivity, and sustainabilityunderscores its growing global influence. From maintaining its esteemed position for rich heritage fostering a more tolerant and inclusive society, Sri Lanka is proving itself as a nation of resilience and commitment. These achievements reflect the nations ongoing journey of development and its expanding role in shaping a more sustainable and inclusive world. Sri Lanka has demonstrated notable progress in the Sustainability pillar, maintaining its overall rank of 109th from 2024. The countrys advancements are particularly evident in key attributes, such as invests in green energy and technologies, where it has moved up 14 places to 103rd, reflecting a stronger commitment to sustainable energy initiatives. In environmental protection, Sri Lanka has improved by 17 spots, rising to 87th for acts to protect the environment, highlighting its dedication to preserving natural resources. Additionally, the nation has made strides in global climate action, climbing 18 places to 109th for supporting global efforts to counter climate change. These gains underscore Sri Lankas growing role in sustainability, positioning it as an emerging contributor to global environmental solutions. Brand Finance publishes the Global Soft Power Index based on responses from over 170,000 global participants across more than 100 countries. This comprehensive research assesses perceptions of all 193 United Nations member states across 55 metrics, delivering a detailed view of how nations influence preferences and behaviours on the global stage through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion. The Global Soft Power Index offers invaluable insights into the evolving dynamics of soft power as nations navigate complex global challenges, providing a comprehensive benchmark for assessing a nations influence and appeal on the world stage. Global Insights: U.S. Leads Global Soft Power, China Rises to Second Spot The United States maintains its position at the top of the ranking with an all-time highest Global Soft Power Index score of 79.5 out of 100. Once again, it leads in the Familiarity and Influence Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), three out of eight Soft Power pillars, and ranks highest in 12 out of the 35 nation brand attributes. For the first time, China has surpassed the UK to rank 2nd with a score of 72.8 out of 100 - its highest ever position. Since 2024, China has recorded statistically significant growth across six of the eight Soft Power pillars, and in two-thirds of measured attributes, stemming from strategic efforts including Belt and Road projects, an increased focus on sustainability, stronger domestic brands, and post-pandemic reopening to visitors. At the same time, the United Kingdoms drop to third place behind China reflects a period of stagnation in its nation brand perceptions. While scores remain relatively stable, a lack of progress across key pillars  especially Business  Trade, down to 6th, and Governance, down to 3rd, are an argument that the UK should bolster its Soft Power strategy. El Salvador is 2025s fastest-rising nation, climbing 35 spots to 82nd with a 3.2-point increase in its Soft Power score. El Salvador has significantly reduced gang violence and homicides, with improving views of El Salvador as safe and secure and politically stable and well governed. El Salvador has also advanced in Business  Trade - its 2021 decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, though controversial, has attracted significant attention. --Brand Finance--",

        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed grave concern over the recent spate of incidents related to the killings of suspects in custody of law enforcement authorities and inside a courtroom, which they claim pose a serious threat to the rule of law. Issuing a statement in this regard, the BASL stressed that it is imperative that the law enforcement agencies, namely the Police and Prison Authorities, exercise great caution and act with utmost responsibility to prevent such incidents, as such would tend to erode public trust in the legal system. The BASL further stated that it regrets to note that similar encounter killings have occurred in the past without proper investigation, and no meaningful action has been taken to bring the culprits to justice. This inaction on the part of the law enforcement authorities has led to allegations of a climate of impunity on the part of the State. Such failures have resulted in the administration of justice being called into question and a significant loss of public confidence in its efficacy, the statement added. Extrajudicial killings can never be a solution in confronting and increase in criminal activity, the BASL said, highlighting that crime can best be curbed when there is adherence to the rule of law by the State. Furthermore, the BASL called upon the Acting Inspector General of Police to launch an immediate impartial inquiry to investigate how two persons were killed at the hands of the Police and to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such serious incidents of encounter killings and custodial deaths.",

        "date": "February 25, 2025 02:42 pm",
        "content": "More than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album on Tuesday in protest at the UK governments planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence. Under the new proposals, AI developers will be able to use creators content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to opt out. The artists hope the album, entitled Is This What We Want?, will draw attention to the potential impact on livelihoods and the UK music industry. All profits will be donated to the charity Help Musicians. In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard? Kate Bush said in a statement. A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday. The album - also backed by the likes of Billy Ocean, Ed OBrien of Radiohead and Bastilles Dan Smith, as well as The Clash, Mystery Jets and Jamiroquai - features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, demonstrating what the artists fear is the potential impact of the proposed law change. The track listing for the record simply spells out the message: The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies. The government is currently consulting on proposals that would allow AI companies to use material that is available online without respecting copyright if they are using it for text or data mining. Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. The proposals would give artists or creators a so-called rights reservation  the ability to opt out. But critics of the plan believe it is not possible for an individual writer or artist to notify thousands of different AI service providers that they do not want their content used in that way, or to monitor what has happened to their work across the whole internet. A spokesman for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said in a statement on Tuesday that the UKs current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue. Thats why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and right holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive. We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so. They added that no decisions have been taken and no moves will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives. Disastrous for musicians Imogen Heap, Yusuf aka Cat Stevens and Riz Ahmed have also backed the silent album release as well as Tori Amos and Hans Zimmer. Composer Max Richter, another of the artists involved in the album, noted how the plans not only have an impact on musicians but impoverish creators across the board, from writers to visual artists and beyond. In 2023, UK music contributed a record 7.6 billion to the economy. Organiser of the silent record, Ed Newton-Rex, said the proposals were not only disastrous for musicians in the UK but also totally unnecessary, as the country can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus. He said the new record showed that however the government tries to justify it, musicians themselves are united in their thorough condemnation of this ill-thought-through plan. Singer-songwriter Naomi Kimpenu added: We cannot be abandoned by the government and have our work stolen for the profit of big tech. She said the plans would shatter the prospects of so many emerging artists in the UK. In January, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the proposed changes to copyright law could allow rip off technology that might make it impossible for musicians and artists to make a living. In a letter to The Times, published on Monday, signatories including Sir Paul, Lord Lloyd Webber and Sir Stephen Fry said that changes to the law will allow big tech to raid the creative sectors. They were joined by the likes of Bush, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting in opposing plans to change copyright laws. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "While Cabinet approval has been granted to offer foreign employment opportunities in South Korea under the E-8 visa category, these opportunities will be managed exclusively by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), says its Chairman, Kosala Wickramasinghe. He further emphasized that no other individual or foreign employment agency is authorized to offer employment opportunities under the E-8 visa category and therefore urged the public to refrain from providing money to such individuals or agencies. He made these remarks while attending an event held at the Bureau today (25) to present air tickets to a group of youths who have been granted employment opportunities in South Korea under the E-9 visa category. Speaking further on this matter, he stated, The newest visa category introduced for jobs opportunities in South Korea is the E-8 visa. However, this category is not open to everyone. We only send qualified individuals with proper agricultural knowledge. Young people are selected for jobs under the E-8 visa category solely through the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE). He also added, No permission has been granted for any third party or foreign employment agency to charge any fees. Only the Foreign Employment Bureau is authorized to send workers under this visa category. Therefore, do not fall victim to intermediaries. Do not give money to anyone. The SLBFE chairman further emphasized that the government intends to offer job opportunities in South Korea with minimal fees, similar to other South Korean job programs. He warned that if private agencies were allowed to intervene, they would charge excessively high fees from job seekers. He continued, We had to halt this program in the past due to malpractice and money laundering. However, we are working to reactivate it by following the proper procedures. We hope that Sri Lankan youth will soon benefit from these job opportunities. These are our countrys children who travel abroad to earn a living and secure a better future for their families. The SLBFE chairman also reiterated the governments commitment to protecting the foreign employment sector. Additionally, the SLBFE chief stated that guidelines for recruitment under this visa category will be prepared in the future and that job seekers will be informed through the media about the recruitment process and the qualifications required.",

As a nation on the trajectory towards people-led and people-centric national transformation and as a responsible member of the international community, Sri Lanka will continue to work in a constructive spirit of dialogue and cooperation with the members of the United Nations including the UNHRC within the countrys national legal framework, he said in conclusion. Minister Heraths Full Speech: Mr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your election as the President of this Council. At the Presidential and Parliamentary elections held a few months ago, the people of Sri Lanka took a progressive decision to elect a new government with a strong mandate to direct the country towards economic, social and political transformation. The results of these elections held in November 2024 bears special significance on several fronts. It reflected a collective and unified voice from people of all regions of the country  North, South, East, West  and of all ethnicities and religions, in support of change and positive transformation. The current Parliament which was formed after the election is one of the most inclusive in our history, with a record number of women, representatives of different communities including two women from the Malayaga community and a visually impaired person being part of the Legislature of the country. This inclusivity represents Sri Lankas new path focused on upholding the rights of all its people irrespective of differences based on gender, ethnicity or other grounds. I would like to quote from the speech delivered by our President, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, at the inauguration of the first session of the Tenth Parliament: Elections create a contract between the people and us. This bond is formed when we present our policy statements and ideas, outlining how the countrys future should be shaped. People who place their trust in these ideas cast their votes for us. With their votes, the people have fulfilled their part in this relationship by granting us the mandate to govern. Now, it is our turn to fulfil our part by serving the people. In 2022, Sri Lanka went through its deepest and most complex social, economic and political crisis since independence. As you know, the impact of the economic crisis gave rise to a humanitarian situation affecting all segments of the population, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable segments of the society. The Government led by President Anura Kumara Disanayake has emerged successful in stabilizing the economy, and we are currently in the process of laying the foundation toward economic transformation and greater economic democratization through fair distribution of opportunities. We are acutely aware of the continuing impact of the economic challenges on our people, particularly the most vulnerable, and the government continues to take decisive steps to advance the economic and social rights of the people. In the National Budget for 2025 presented to the Parliament last week, we have committed to take series of measures to extend much needed relief and empowerment to the people including increased allocation for social welfare and security. Significantly, the budget proposals have also made historic allocations for health and education and provide for a series of empowerment measures to vulnerable groups such as women, children including orphaned, disabled or autistic children, estate sector population, students, persons with disabilities and people living in conflict affected or under-developed areas of the country. Special attention has been paid to improving the socio-economic conditions and address critical needs such as resettlement, housing, compensation and infrastructure development in the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces. The Government has been actively working to develop infrastructure, support livelihoods and promote industries in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, aiming to enhance connectivity and support regional development. With the launch of the Clean Sri Lanka project by H.E. the President on 01 January 2025, the Government has taken steps to introduce a new political culture and commitment to moral and ethical governance. The Clean Sri Lanka programme is a holistic undertaking aimed at nation-wide efforts of environmental, social, and governance initiatives to bring about change, integration, and collaboration, in environment, social and governance structures. In line with the mandate given by the people, the Government will prioritize integrity and addressing issues of mismanagement and corruption that were at the root of the economic collapse, in taking our country towards sustainable development. Through digital transformation of government structures at all levels, we hope to ensure that inefficiency and corruption will be minimized. The Government led by President Anura Kumara Disanayaka is firmly and sincerely committed to working towards a unified Sri Lanka that respects and celebrates the diversity of its people with no division or discrimination based on race, religion, class and caste. We will not leave room for a resurgence of divisive racism or religious extremism in our country. The fundamental and longstanding principles of democracy and freedom enshrined in our Constitution will be fully respected and safeguarded while protecting the human rights of all citizens. Every citizen should feel free to practice their religion, speak their language, and live according to their cultural values without fear or discrimination. No one should feel that their beliefs, culture, or political affiliations will make them targets of undue pressure or prejudice. Administrative, political and electoral processes will be activated towards this end. The Government has pledged to take tangible steps in the interest of further advancing national unity and reconciliation. The President has proposed to declare a Sri Lanka Day, in line with our vision for a reconciled Sri Lanka and commitment to bridging gaps between communities. We will ensure that the domestic mechanisms and processes established to address challenges emanating from the conflict will continue their work in an independent and credible manner within the Constitutional framework. Domestic institutions such as the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), Office for Reparations, and Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) will be strengthened. The contours of a truth and reconciliation framework, will be further discussed with the broadest possible cross section of stakeholders, before operationalization to ensure a process that has the trust of all Sri Lankans. Our aim is to make the domestic mechanisms credible and sound within the constitutional framework. This will include strengthening the work towards a truth and reconciliation commission empowered to investigate acts of violence caused by racism and religious extremism that give rise to tensions within Sri Lankan society. A number of confidence building measures have also been taken in the last few months towards reconciliation. In November 2024, a number of roads in the Northern Province including the Palali- Achchuveli main road were opened for public use after several decades. The President, during his visit to the North in January this year, made an open invitation to Tamil-speaking youth to be part of Sri Lankas police service. The 2025 budget includes significant allocations to upgrade the libraries throughout the country, including the historical Jaffna library which is a symbol of education and enlightenment for the Tamil community. The Government is fully cognizant of the responsibility that accompanies the peoples mandate, including the people of the Northern and Eastern provinces, to fulfill their aspirations for a just, fair and prosperous society for all our citizens. As we move forward on our path towards national unity and reconciliation and inclusive development, the continued encouragement and support of the international community will be important. Sri Lanka is an active member of the United Nations since 1955. We are a State Party to all the 09 core UN human rights instruments and engage with Treaty Bodies and regular mechanisms of this Council on a regular basis. In the past few years, we have received over 10 Special Procedures and engaged productively with Treaty Bodies, most recently with the CEDAW Committee, ICCPR and the Universal Periodic Review process. We are committed to genuine dialogue and cooperation in human rights through continuous and constructive engagement. Conflict, inequality, and extreme climatic conditions are driving millions into poverty daily, while countless men, women, and children continue to suffer or perish in wars across the globe. Addressing these critical challenges is essential to protect human rights and safeguard our planet for future generations. Sri Lanka stands ready to support the Human Rights Council in addressing these pressing global challenges in a balanced and holistic manner in line with its founding principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. We believe that States must be encouraged and empowered to address their challenges through robust national human rights frameworks, supplemented by assistance upon request. . As a nation on the trajectory towards people-led and people-centric national transformation and as a responsible member of the international community, Sri Lanka will continue to work in a constructive spirit of dialogue and cooperation with the members of the United Nations including this Council within our national legal framework. Thank you.",

Accoridngly, the original enforcement date, set for 18th March 2025, as per Extraordinary Gazette No. 236608 issued on 8th January 2024 would be amended to grant additional time for enforcement of this Act. After due consideration, the Cabinet has proposed an extension of six (06) months to the enforcement date, allowing more time to fully integrate the proposed amendments and ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and well-prepared. The proposed amendments to the PDPA approved by the Cabinet of Ministers would enable a change to the date of operation of the enforcement provisions in the Act. Other amendments, including Sections 17, 19, 20, 24, 26, 27, 53, and 56, drafted by the Ministry of Digital Economy in consultation with DPA and the Legal Draftsmans Department, were also approved by the Cabinet, the Ministry of Digital Economy said. The government is now in the process of submitting these amendments to Parliament for approval and the Ministry of Digital Economy will publish the Amendments on its website in the near future, a statement said today. The statement further reads: Recognizing the importance of having a future ready enforcement regime, which will equally support both public and private sector adoption of digital strategies, and considering the necessity to support the establishment of a fully-fledged Regulator with capacity to meaningfully address the rights of data subjects, before the Personal Data Protection Act is brought into operation, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a Memorandum from the President, as the Minister of Digital Economy, on 19th February 2025, to amend the Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022. As the first-ever legislation of its kind in South Asia, the Act is a pivotal step in safeguarding citizens rights while being an enabler to facilitate growth and innovation in the digital economy. The amendments are designed to strengthen this landmark law, ensuring that it can be fully operationalized and embraced with greater technology choices, across all sectors of society. The proposed amendments incorporate concerns as well as valuable feedback from Government sector, private sector, and other key stakeholders in response to the Draft Rules, Draft Regulations, Draft Directives and Draft Guideline published by the Data Protection Authority (DPA). Many stakeholders, especially from the public sector, have expressed the need for additional time to enhance their human and technical infrastructure, enabling them to fully comply with the enforcement provisions of the Act. Some public sector institutions have suggested amendments to the Act, particularly to provide the public sector with more flexibility in making technology choices, similar to the private sector, to enable the adoption of AI Systems etc. Considering that this law would be applicable to Central Government as well as Provincial Councils, Local Authorities, Divisional Secretariats and Grama Niladhari level alike, the Government is cognizant of the need to create more capacity and therefore the need to provide additional time to ensure compliance. Therefore, the original enforcement date, set for 18th March 2025, as per Extraordinary Gazette No. 236608 issued on 8th January 2024 would be required to be amended to grant additional time for enforcement of this Act. After due consideration, the Cabinet has proposed an extension of six (06) months to the enforcement date, allowing more time to fully integrate the proposed amendments and ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and well-prepared. The proposed amendments to the PDPA approved by the Cabinet of Ministers would enable a change to the date of operation of the enforcement provisions in the Act.

        "content": "The first batch of vehicles imported for private use arrived at the Colombo Port on Tuesday (25), following the Sri Lankan governments decision to ease import restrictions after a five-year hiatus. The move marks a significant milestone in the countrys automotive industry, which had been severely impacted by the prolonged import ban imposed in 2020 due to economic constraints. According to the Vehicle Importers Association, an SUV imported under the new regulations is expected to be priced between Rs. 24.5 million and Rs. 26 million in the local market. The Sri Lankan government officially lifted the temporary suspension on vehicle imports, which had been in effect since early 2020, through Gazette Extraordinary Notification No. 242144, dated January 31, 2025. The then government of Sri Lanka had decided to suspend vehicle imports in 2021 due to the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. As the severe economic crisis continued to persist, authorities decided to further continue with the restrictions on vehicle imports. Meanwhile, in June 2024, the Ministry of Finance had announced a plan to gradually lift the restrictions by 2025. The new regulations, effective from February 1, 2025, permit the importation of various types of vehicles, including: Cars and vans for personal use Buses for public passenger transport Goods transport vehicles Special purpose vehicles Three-wheelers, bicycles, and other non-motorized vehicles",

        "content": "A shallow 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit near the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Wednesday (February 26, 2025), the United States Geological Survey said, forcing residents to flee outside but with no damage or casualties reported. The tremor hit at 6:55 a.m. local time (22:55 GMT) at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) with the epicentre offshore near North Sulawesi province, according to the USGS. The countrys meteorological agency gave a lower magnitude of 6.0 and said there was no potential for a tsunami. Locals in North Sulawesi described the panic when the quake struck. I had just woken up when I realised it was an earthquake. It was strong, swaying from side to side, Gita Waloni, a 25-year-old guest at a hotel in North Minahasa district in the province told AFP. Objects inside my rooms rattled. I decided to get out. I was so scared there would be an aftershock while I was inside the lift. All other guests had also fled, she said. The vast archipelago nation experiences frequent earthquakes due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of intense seismic activity where tectonic plates collide that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. A magnitude-6.2 quake that shook Sulawesi in January 2021 killed more than 100 people and left thousands homeless. In 2018, a magnitude-7.5 quake and subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi killed more than 2,200 people. And in 2004, a magnitude-9.1 quake struck Aceh province, causing a tsunami and killing more than 170,000 people in Indonesia. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 26, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of millions of Hindu devotees have bathed in sacred waters, despite concerns over overcrowding and water pollution, as the worlds largest religious gathering wrapped up Wednesday in Indias northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Over the last 45 days, more than 620 million people  nearly a third of Indias roughly 1.4 billion population - have attended the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj, in a spectacle of color and expression of faith. Followers have come to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers  the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati  to purify their sins and take another step closer to spiritual liberation. Every 12 years the festival carries the prefix Maha, which means great, as its the largest gathering of the Kumbh Mela thats held every three years in one of four cities. It is a unique, once in a lifetime experience, said Sushovan Sircar, 36, who works as an independent consultant in Delhi. People from all over India are here, as I saw number plates of cars from almost every state. Though this years festivities have been marred by two separate, deadly crowd crushes, millions have turned out for the festival despite concerns of overcrowding and reports of unsafe levels of contamination in key bathing sites. A report from the Central Pollution and Control Board (CPCB), part of Indias Environment Ministry, last month found high levels of coliform faecal bacteria in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, despite the government touting sustainable initiatives and sanitation efforts. Uttar Pradeshs Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath denied the accuracy of the government report, insisting that the water was not just safe for bathing, but also for the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing. Attendees often submerge themselves fully, sometimes drinking or collecting the sacred water in containers. My sins are cleansed, but not my body Sircar, the independent consultant from Delhi, said he bathed in the water at Sangam point  the confluence of the three rivers considered to be the most auspicious place to bathe and where most people take their dip  twice last week. There is a concern because there is nothing I can do about the contamination in the water. In your mind you tell yourself, this part looks clean, spend a few minutes in, recite prayers and come out, said Sircar. I took a shower for sins and then another shower for the contamination, he laughed. So you need a bath after the bath My sins are cleansed, but not (my) body. Before the festival began, Indias top environmental court directed the state and federal pollution boards to ensure the river water was clean enough to drink and bathe in. It called for increasing monitoring and sample collecting of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and ensuring that no untreated sewage or solid waste would be discharged. But a report submitted by the federal pollution board on February 3 stated that faecal coliform levels, a key indicator of untreated sewage and faecal matter in water, were far above the safe limit set by the board of 2,500 units per 100 millilitres. At various parts of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers around Prayagraj levels were more than 1,000 over the safe limit, according to the report. Adityanath said his government was continually monitoring the water levels to ensure its quality. Kumbh Mela organizers also told CNN that an exhaustive survey of all 81 drains that release water in the rivers was carried out ahead of the festival. We have ensured that the water quality has been maintained, said Kumbh Mela officer Vivek Chaturvedi. Aishwary Sharma, 31, a finance professional in Delhi, said he took a dip in the rivers despite knowing it could be polluted. I think it is quite evident that the Ganga and Yamuna are not clean rivers, he said. (But) there are many things that are bad for you The air we breathe is so toxic for our health It is just another thing that is polluted that could have a harmful impact on my health. For others, their faith and participating in the sacred festival was more important than their concerns. What (most people) are interested in is their devotion and religion and that they want to take that holy dip, said Sunny Parasher, 34, from Panchkula in Haryana state. Where there is devotion, where there is religion, there is no question, he said. Kalpana Mishra, 55, a housewife from Prayagraj, said she would not take another holy dip after reading the pollution boards report. What does being a literate person mean if you hear all this and still decide to go? she asked. Exposure to faecal contamination can cause water borne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea, cholera, gastroenteritis, E-coli, skin disease and vomiting, health experts warn. Push to clean the rivers Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made cleaning the Ganges, Indias holiest river, a priority since first taking office in 2014  with billions of dollars spent or pledged on sewage treatment, cleaning surface waste and afforestation in the decade since. The Ganges, a lifeline for 400 million people who live and work along it, runs through 50 Indian cities that pump out about 3 billion liters of sewage every day  only a fraction of which is treated before it reaches the river, according to the World Bank. The Yamuna, a tributary of the Ganges, has also for decades been plagued by the dumping of toxic chemicals and untreated sewage. Ahead of the festival, Indian authorities touted this years gathering as a Green Kumbh, with sustainable initiatives such as a ban on single-use plastics, eco-friendly toilets, electric rickshaws and an army of 15,000 sanitation workers hired to clean up after major bathing days. The Ministry of Culture said in January that the festival had been meticulously planned to uphold hygiene and ecological balance and would set an example for future large-scale events worldwide in environmental responsibility. Protecting and cleaning the river was even a major theme at a conference held on the sidelines of the festival with religious and environmental leaders coming together for the first time on how religious institutions can address the climate crisis. If there is no water in the rivers, there is no Kumbh. We dont consider it water, we consider it nectar, said Indian spiritual leader Swami Chidanand Saraswati at the meeting. If we all do not make efforts to protect it, then the next (Kumbh Mela) will be on mere sand. But complicating the green efforts was the enormous crowd size at this years Kumbh Mela, which saw 250 million more people than originally expected, according to one expert. Authorities had planned for about 400 million people to attend over the six-week gathering, with about 9 million people per day, but about 620 million people attended in total, according to government figures. It is a mammoth task to take care of such a crowd, said Dr Nupur Bahadur, an associate director with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a research institute that looks at wastewater management, established by the Indian government. River contamination could be better managed by adopting better on-site prevention and disinfection methods, Bahadur said. One of them could be halting the dip after every 12 hours for one hour and letting fresh water run through the bathing areas before the dips can be restarted, she said. Bahadur said that while the festivals massive increase in footfall strained its infrastructure, it has still been the best human effort possible in such a situation. Prayagraj resident Mishra said she will be happy when her city gets back to normal. My eyes are constantly burning and there is so much dust, she said. I want the festival to end so I can get back to my life. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday floated the idea of replacing a visa program for foreign investors with a so-called gold card that could be bought for 5 million as a route to American citizenship. Trump told reporters he will replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, which allows foreign investors of large sums of money that create or preserve U.S. jobs to become permanent residents, with a so-called gold card. The EB-5 program grants green cards to foreigners promising to invest in U.S. businesses. We are going to be selling a gold card, Trump said. We are going to be putting a price on that card of about 5 million, he added. Its going to give you green card privileges plus its going to be a route to (American) citizenship, and wealthy people would be coming into our country by buying this card, Trump said, adding that details about the scheme will come out in two weeks. Trump added it is possible Russian oligarchs could qualify for the gold cards, when asked by a journalist if those people would be eligible. Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people, he said. The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was created by Congress in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors, according to the USCIS website. The EB-5 program ... it was full of nonsense, make believe and fraud, and it was a way to get a green card that was low price. So the president said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, were going to end the EB-5 program. Were going to replace it with the Trump gold card, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Tuesday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

President of the association Tania Abeysundara emphasized that businesses require time to recover from financial hardships before implementing salary hikes. What we expect from you is not some data to put in a budget, but some actionable program. Government employees have been given a salary increase. That is a really good thing. Just think about it when you ask the private sector to do the same. When you increase our salary of Rs. 21,000 to Rs. 27,000, there is a difference of Rs. 6,000 right there. There are OTs for 50-60 hours. Then we pay Rs. 210 per hour. For that alone, we pay about Rs. 10,000. At the same time, when you add up the ETF, ETF, and salary, it increases by about Rs. 15,000. When that increases from the basic salary, it is very difficult for us as entrepreneurs, she said. Meanwhile, the Inter-University Trade Union Federation has raised concerns that the recent salary increase for public sector employees has inadvertently resulted in salary reductions for certain workers.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Police have successfully thwarted an attempt to assassinate the parents of the wife of underworld figure infamously known as Kehelbaddara Padme in an apparent act of retaliation for the murder of notorious underworld figure Ganemulla Sanjeewa. According to police, two young men suspected to have been involved in the murder plot were apprehended while allegedly surveilling the house of Kehelbaddara Padmes wife in Pannala. At the time of their arrest, her mother, father, and younger brother were inside the residence. Police had received intelligence regarding a potential attack on the household and, upon arriving at the scene, discovered the two individuals recording video footage of the premises. The suspects, aged 21 and 24, revealed during interrogation that they had been acting on instructions from a criminal figure known as Dubai Sameera, police said. According to their statements, Dubai Sameera had directed them to record the approach route to the house and transfer the footage to him. They have also admitted that he had occasionally provided them with money to purchase drugs. During the investigation, law enforcement officers have uncovered a hidden firearm in the Koswatta area of Pannala, further solidifying suspicions that the arrested individuals were preparing for an attack. The suspects will remain in custody for further questioning and are scheduled to be presented before the court tomorrow, police added. Meanwhile, the Prisons Department has recorded statements from 16 individuals as part of the ongoing investigation into the murder of Ganemulla Sanjeewa. Among those questioned are officers who were responsible for escorting him to court on the day of his assassination. Prisons Department sources confirmed that statements are yet to be recorded from approximately 15 more individuals. According to official records, Sanjeewa was brought before Court No. 9 in Aluthkade as per a court order, before being produced in Court No. 5 for a separate case on the same day. In a significant development, police have discovered a mobile phone on the premises opposite the cell where Ganemulla Sanjeewa was detained at Boossa Prison the day before his murder. Prisons Media Spokesperson Gamini Dissanayake stated that the device has been handed over to the relevant authorities for further forensic examination.",

        "content": "Measures have been taken to implement a special security program in all prisons across the country. As part of this initiative, prison authorities plan to install advanced jamming devices designed to disrupt connections between mobile devices from within the prison premises and their signal sources. The decision to enhance prison security with modern technology follows the recent assassination of the notorious underworld figure Ganemulla Sanjeewa, who was shot dead inside a courtroom. Meanwhile, prison officials revealed that although jammers have already been installed in some facilities, they have not been entirely effective in blocking telephone connections due to structural challenges within the buildings. In response, the Ministry of Defence has instructed the Department of Prisons to strengthen security measures, including upgrading the existing jamming technology. According to sources from the Prisons Department, the inefficiency of the existing jammers has enabled inmates to maintain contact with external parties via mobile phones. As a result, many detainees have continued to operate drug networks and orchestrate crimes while behind bars. There have been frequent reports of mobile phones being discovered in prisons, particularly in high-security facilities like Boossa, where high-profile suspects are held. This has allowed organized criminals to manage their illicit activities with ease. The country currently operates 28 prisons, including 10 open-air detention centres.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa has left the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a short while ago, after providing a statement regarding investigations into an Airbus deal of SriLankan Airlines. He left the CID premises after recording a statement for over 4 hours pertaining to the matter, Ada Derana reporter said. Allegations had recently surfaced regarding an improper financial transaction between Airbus and SriLankan Airlines in connection with the national carriers 2013 purchase of six Airbus A330 and eight A350 aircraft. These allegations emerged through documents submitted to a foreign court related to a trial concerning the Airbus company. According to the documents, Airbus had allegedly paid a bribe to Mrs. Neomali Wijenayake, the wife of former SriLankan Airlines CEO Kapila Chandrasena, in relation to the aircraft deal. It was revealed that Airbus had discussed soliciting a bribe of USD 16 million to Chandrasenas wife before the transaction, with at least USD 2 million reportedly transferred to a company established in Brunei. Following these revelations, the CID launched an investigation into the allegations. On February 6, 2020, Kapila Chandrasena and Neomali Wijenayake were arrested and subsequently remanded after being presented before the Fort Magistrates Court. They were later released on bail, and legal proceedings have since been ongoing. Against this backdrop, MP Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, was summoned by the CID today to provide a statement regarding the controversial Airbus deal.",

        "content": "The prevailing dry weather conditions across the island has led to disruptions in the water supply in several parts of the island. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) stated that water supply disruptions have affected parts of Colombo, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Matara, and Kandy. It has been reported that water levels in reservoirs and other water sources are dropping rapidly due to the prevailing dry weather conditions. With increased water consumption and a limited supply, the NWSDB has urged the public to use water sparingly and limit usage of water for non-essential activities such as washing vehicles and gardening. Additionally, the NWSDB stated that it is currently distributing water via bowser trucks to certain consumers in the worst affected areas. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has reported a rise in electricity generation costs due to the prevailing dry weather conditions. CEB Media Spokesperson Dhammika Wimalaratne stated that, as a result, more thermal and fuel oil power plants have been brought into operation. He further noted that steps have been taken to operate the Norochcholai Power Plant at its maximum capacity of 900 megawatts, while the Kelanitissa Naphtha Power Station and the Sapugaskanda Power Station have also been activated. According to the spokesman, hydroelectric power plants currently contribute 20 of the total electricity generation during the day and 40 at night. He also noted that solar power plants provide an additional opportunity for electricity generation during the daytime.",

She made these comments today (26) while participating in a scholarly discussion organized by the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) on constitutional reform that strengthens democratic values in accordance with national aspirations. How we are going to that in this present situation where political parties are irresponsible, they do not think of the national interest, they think of what they can do at the next election, whether they can win or not. Even if they sabotage a very good program of an incumbent government they dont care, she said. The ex-president said she believes that first and foremost the political ethos has to change. Of course the Aragalaya changed that. The message of the Aragalaya, the very powerful message of the Aragalaya, it seems that the traditional political parties havent still understood it, they dont want to listen or they dont understand, is that they are sick and disgusted with the existing systems. Not the constitution but with the existing systems. She further said that they tried to do away with the executive presidency, but those attempts were futile. There was one whole separate chapter on it, the abolition of the executive presidency but all that was thrown out in parliament. So, I think first before anything else, well while doing, there are so many constitutional drafts. It will be very easy to put them together and draft something which is suitable to the present day. We will have to change the political ambiance, the political attitudes of the leaders. If not it wont get passed in parliament. We will have to change the whole nature of parliament. The majority of people in parliament today refused the constitution or at least their party did. So, how they are going to do it now I dont know, the former president said.",

Speaking at a press conference today (26), he emphasized the need for amendments to election laws to support this. He pointed out that the countrys current electoral system does not include a system for a recall election, highlighting the necessity of such reforms. Further commenting on the matter, Saman Sri Ratnayake noted that the tradition in the country is that once a political party is elected, the public spends few years criticizing it until the next election, and the cycle repeats. He added that the people believe their responsibilities end once the party is elected. That is not the case. As citizens, we have an absolute responsibility to ensure that the representatives we elect fulfill the duties. If they fail to do so, we have the right to hold them accountable. In our country, questioning elected representatives is usually limited to the period until a new election. To change this, election laws must be amended. Currently, there is no recall mechanism in our electoral system, which is an issue that needs reform. Such changes should be introduced in the new election law amendments, Ratnayake said. The Commissioner General further commented that in the country, people act more as consumers than as voters.",

        "date": "February 26, 2025 08:21 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser tasked with radically downsizing the U.S. government, will attend President Donald Trumps first cabinet meeting on Wednesday as turmoil continues to swirl around his plans to fire federal workers. The meeting comes amid a tug-of-war between Musk and Trump, and officials in the U.S. government in what has become an early test of Musks authority. Musk is not a cabinet officer, but no one in the presidents circle has wielded more influence in Trumps early weeks. Musks email directive that all federal workers detail their accomplishments or face losing their jobs plunged the government into chaos after some agencies told their employees to comply with his demand and others said they could ignore it. Even after the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the agency that oversees the federal bureaucracy, told workers they need not respond to Musks email, Trump and his allies seemed to suggest workers may be better off if they complied with Musks wishes. Musk on Saturday said federal workers must list five things they did during the week or risk termination and gave them a 48-hour deadline to respond via email. On Tuesday, Musk continued to press on social media for workers to respond. He was seemingly aided in that effort by Trump, who told reporters on Tuesday that the email request was somewhat voluntary, but its also if you dont answer, I guess you get fired. When asked on Tuesday whether Musks threat would be carried out, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would defer to cabinet secretaries guidance for their individual workforces. Some cabinet officers such as Kelly Loeffler, the head of the Small Business Administration, backed Musks demand. We just want to know: Are there people there doing their jobs? And again, the bar is so low its laughable, Loeffler told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday. But others, including Trump loyalists such as Kash Patel, the new FBI chief, told their employees to hold off on replying. Doubting Doge As the back-and-forth played out, 21 workers resigned from Musks so-called Department of Government Efficiency in protest on Tuesday. We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services, the employees wrote in a resignation posted online. Musks downsizing initiative has laid off more than 20,000 workers, with another 75,000 accepting buyouts, and the effort continued to accelerate on Tuesday. There are about 2.3 million civilian federal employees. The vast majority of fired workers were in their jobs for less than a year, making them easier to lay off under civil service rules. But there were signs that DOGE was turning its attention to long-term career staff. Internal Revenue Service executives have been told to brace for another round of job cuts beyond the nearly 12,000 employees already slated to be terminated, two people familiar with the matter said, referring to the roughly 7,000 probationary employees set to be fired and 5,000 employees taking a buyout. The cuts so far amount to more than 10 of the services workforce. The Interior Department on Tuesday received a directive from OPM saying that bureaus such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs should prepare plans for reductions in their workforce ranging from 10 to 40, an Interior source told Reuters. Musk spent much of Tuesday railing against federal judges who have stepped in to block his team from accessing sensitive systems and data at the Treasury Department, Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management and to order the administration to release frozen foreign-aid funds. The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges, Musk wrote on X. No one is above the law, including judges. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 27, 2025 06:48 am",
        "content": "The Trump administration said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 90 of the U.S. Agency for International Developments foreign aid contracts and 60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world. The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration. The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday. Wednesdays disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administrations retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances. President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money. Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight. The funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, as the administration and Musks Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings. In the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musks teams terminating USAIDs contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say. There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up! lawyers for the nonprofits wrote, quoting an email sent by a USAID official to staff on Monday. The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations. In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of 54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of 4.4 billion. The Washington Free Beacon was the first to report on the memo. The memo described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administrations monthlong block on foreign aid funding. In response, State and USAID moved rapidly, targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said. The nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, call the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily. Trump administration officials  after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case  also said Wednesday they had finally begun paying USAID bills again after the monthlong halt on payments, freeing for delivery a few millions of billions of dollars owed.

        "date": "February 27, 2025 08:33 am",
        "content": "Hamas handed over the bodies of four Israeli hostages while it waited for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel in return, in an overnight exchange marking the final swap as part of a fragile truce in Gaza. The ceasefire came into effect on January 19 and has largely held, despite numerous setbacks. But its first phase is due to end this week and the fate of its next phase, which aims to end the war, remains unclear. Hamas said on Thursday that it was ready to start talks on the second phase, and that the only way remaining hostages would be freed is through commitment to the ceasefire. After days of impasse, Egyptian mediators on Wednesday secured the handover of the bodies of the final four hostages in the deals first phase, for 620 Palestinians either detained by Israeli forces in Gaza or jailed in Israel. Israel had refused to release prisoners on Saturday after Hamas handed over six hostages in a staged ceremony. Hamas had been displaying living hostages and coffins carrying hostage remains on stage in front of a crowd in Gaza before handing them over, to sharp criticism including from the United Nations. The final handover did not include such a ceremony. Israel received coffins carrying the remains of the four hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said in the early hours of Thursday. Hamas had previously identified the bodies as those of Tsachi Idan, Itzhak Elgarat, Ohad Yahalomi and Shlomo Mantzur, all of whom were abducted during the October 7, 2023 attack from their kibbutz homes near Gaza. The bodies were undergoing initial identification in Israeli territory and official notice would be given to the hostages families once the process is complete, Netanyahus office said in a statement. The handover agreement had also been held up previously after Hamas handed over the remains of an unidentified Palestinian woman instead of Shiri Bibas, before delivering the correct body the next day. The unidentified womans body was sent back to a Gaza hospital on Thursday, medics said. A full forensic examination to determine cause of death for the final four bodies returned to Israel will come later, according to the Israeli health ministry. Freed Palestinian Detainees The Palestinian detainees due to be released include 445 men and 24 women and minors arrested in Gaza, as well as 151 prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis, according to a Hamas source. A bus carrying a handful of the released Palestinian prisoners left Israels Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and arrived in the Palestinian city of Ramallah shortly after, live footage showed. The group got off the bus to cheers from hundreds congregated outside, with some of the released men - clad in green jackets and keffiyehs - hoisted aloft by the crowd. Released prisoner Bilal Yassin, 42, told Reuters he had been in Israeli detention for 20 years. The West Bank native said he had faced oppression and poor conditions the entire time. Our sacrifices and imprisonment were not in vain, Yassin said. We had confidence in the (Palestinian) resistance. Nearly 100 more Palestinian prisoners were handed over to Egypt, where they will stay until another country accepts them, according to a Hamas source and Egyptian media. Ambulances later arrived at the European Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, early on Thursday transporting freed Palestinians, who are set to undergo medical examination. In total, 580 prisoners and detainees will be freed in Gaza, according to Hamas. Buses escorted by the Red Cross are expected to arrive in coming hours. The first phase of the ceasefire included the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages in total for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some positions in Gaza as well as an influx of aid. But with the 42-day truce due to expire on Saturday, it remains unclear whether an extension that could see more of the 59 remaining hostages go free will happen or whether negotiations can begin on a second stage of the deal.

        "date": "February 27, 2025 08:50 am",
        "content": "Actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who rose to fame as a child star in the 1990s and 2000s, has died aged 39. Police in Manhattan said they responded to an emergency call on Wednesday morning, and found Trachtenberg unconscious and unresponsive. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The American actress was best known for playing Buffy the Vampire Slayers younger sister Dawn Summers, and later took on the role of manipulative socialite Georgina Sparks in Gossip Girl - which ran from 2007 to 2012 - as an adult. Trachtenberg made her film debut in Harriet the Spy in 1996, and she appeared in several Nickelodeon productions. Her familys representatives confirmed her death in a statement. It is with great sadness to confirm that Michelle Trachtenberg has passed away. The family requests privacy for their loss, it said. Authorities said her death was not being treated as suspicious. Criminality is not suspected. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. The investigation remains ongoing, the NYPD said in a statement. Trachtenberg got her start in acting at age nine on the Nickelodeon television series The Adventures of Pete  Pete. In the early 2000s, she was nominated for several acting awards - including a Daytime Emmy Award - for her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also starred in films including EuroTrip, Ice Princess, Killing Kennedy, and Sister Cities. Blake Lively, a Gossip Girl co-star, said Trachtenberg did everything... 200. She laughed the fullest at someones joke... she cared deeply about her work, she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself, she said. To paraphrase, the real tragedies in life are the ones that blindside you on an idle Tuesday. Hold those you love and have loved dear. US comedian Rosie ODonnell, who starred alongside Trachtenberg in her Harriet the Spy debut, said her death was heart-breaking. I loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped. Former castmates on her most popular shows have also paid tribute. English actor Ed Westwick, who played the character Chuck Bass on Gossip Girl, posted on Instagram a picture of Trachtenberg as her character in the show, Georgina Sparks. So sad to hear of the passing of Michelle Trachtenberg. Sending prayers, he wrote. Former Buffy the Vampire Slayer castmate David Boreanaz wrote on Instagram: So very sad. Horrible news. In a social media tribute to Trachtenberg, another Buffy castmate James Marsters said the actress was fiercely intelligent, howlingly funny, and a very talented person. She died much too young, and leaves behind scores of people who knew and loved her, Marsters said. Trachtenberg first appeared in Gossip Girl in 2008. She returned to the role for two episodes of the second season of HBO Maxs reboot in 2023. Her last major acting role was in 2021 as the host of a true-crime docuseries Meet, Marry, Murder, which appeared on digital streamer Tubi. In 2021, Trachtenberg accused Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon of inappropriate behaviour on set, after her co-star Charisma Carpenter said she had been left traumatised due to the treatment she received from Whedon.

        "title": "Worlds first mobile renewable energy prepares to set sail",
        "date": "February 27, 2025 10:16 am",
        "content": "Wind power has been rising significantly in recent years, and now accounts for about 8 of the worlds energy production. By the end of the decade, it will be the second-largest renewable source after solar, having surpassed hydropower, according to the International Energy Agency. Wind turbines are more efficient than solar panels  they harness, on average, about 50 of the energy that goes through them compared to about 20 for solar  but are more dependent on location. Offshore turbines benefit from stronger winds and are more efficient than those on land, but they are also more expensive to build and maintain. In the UK, where wind power generation in 2024 was the largest energy source for the first time, a startup called Drift is looking to extract even more power from offshore wind by effectively chasing after it  in a racing yacht. We make renewable energy in the ocean using sailboats, and deliver that energy to ports across the globe, says Drifts founder and CEO Ben Medland. Drift has built two prototypes, just over 17 feet (5 meters) in length and first demonstrated them in 2022 at the Sail GP sailing league in Plymouth harbor in the UK. The high-performance catamarans are equipped with hydrofoils that lift them out of the water as well as an underwater turbine, which looks like a propeller but works in the opposite way, by capturing energy as the vessel sails through the water. That renewable energy is fed to a device called an electrolyzer, which converts seawater into hydrogen gas and stores it aboard, ready to be offloaded. It can then be used as a clean fuel to power industrial processes or for cars, planes and ships. This is a first-ever class of mobile renewable energy, Medland continues. It doesnt need grid infrastructure. It doesnt need cables under the ocean. It doesnt need foundations or anchors or anything like that. These are, if you will, free range wind turbines. A 24-million yacht Humans have used wind to propel ships for millennia, and wind-powered vessels are having a renaissance as a method to decarbonize global shipping. Drift aims to go one step further: Our companys philosophy is very simple  why cant a ship produce renewable energy rather than using energy to move through the water? One key component in Drifts technology is an algorithm that hunts for what Medland calls Goldilock conditions  wind that is strong enough to generate energy without being dangerous: The Goldilocks algorithm sails 6 million virtual miles in 0.02 seconds to choose the next mile of optimized route  that kind of data wasnt available just 10, 15 years ago, he says. When you add all of that together (with the onboard technology), youve got whats effectively a fishing boat for energy. For now, the prototypes only produce a few kilowatts of power, comparable to a small urban wind turbine. Drift is working on a new design in the 1.5-megawatt range, comparable to a larger wind turbine about 300 feet (91 meters) in height, which will be in the water in the next two years and from which commercial models will derive. These ships will be 190 feet (58 meters) long and produce up to 330,000 pounds (150,000 kilograms) of hydrogen gas per year. That capacity would still be lower than the average of newly installed turbines, which in the US was 3.2 megawatts in 2022. But Medland says that the ships will have a higher efficiency compared to wind turbines, meaning their potential would be more equivalent to a three or a four-megawatt turbine or a seven-megawatt solar park. The cost of that first ship will be prohibitively high, around 20 million (about 24 million), due to the amount of research and development that will go into it. At scale, that will decrease to single digit millions, Medland says, adding that he estimates Drift could get initial orders for more than 40 vessels. Drift will sail in international waters, in locations such as the North Atlantic and the Caribbean. The ships will bear a country flag and meet maritime standards. Initially they will be crewed, but the aim is to make them autonomous. The ships will have six crew, and will need to offload the hydrogen at port once a week on average, or up to every 10 days if optimal weather is further away from shore. They will be operated on behalf of Drifts clients, which Medland says are likely to be mainly heavy industries, island nations wanting to increase their power output, and maritime transport companies, including cargo or cruise ship operators looking for alternative fuels. He says that the first commercial fleet will make hydrogen more cheaply than if you were to connect an electrolysis unit to the grid in the UK, and that parity with the cheapest hydrogen, made from fossil fuels, will be achieved by 2030. Drift says that the vessels wouldnt be limited to making hydrogen, but could also be modified to produce green ammonia or green methanol. They could also power on-board data centers or carbon capture, and even help with ocean exploration: Our ships move around a little bit like a butterfly in a garden, says Medand. It looks random, but its actually just very efficient, which means they could also generate and gathering data from parts of the ocean that are rarely accessed, helping with weather models and mapping marine life. Lateral thinking Academics in the field of renewable energy and transport who are not involved with Drift expressed cautious optimism about the technology when approached by CNN for comment. Making hydrogen generation mobile instead of static is impressive lateral thinking, according to Tristan Smith, professor of Energy and Transport at University College London, who says that the lack of availability of this new energy commodity is a real problem that needs creative and innovative solutions. The challenge and key question, Smith adds, is whether Drifts solution can compete in terms of cost at the point of consumption relative to other ways of producing and transporting hydrogen, or other fuels made with it, such as ammonia. Autonomous energy harvesting vessels have been suggested in the past, says Alasdair McDonald, a professor at the School of Engineering of the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland. He points at designs proposed in the past by Scottish engineer Stephen Salter, which were meant to harvest energy at sea to artificially brighten clouds and combat climate change, or currently by French firm Farwind, which makes rotor sails to add wind propulsion to cargo ships but has also developed a design meant to store the wind energy onboard as hydrogen. The general principle of extracting wind energy from the far offshore is reasonably sensible, McDonald says: Wind speeds get higher as you go further from shore, but water depths become more challenging for existing wind turbine designs, and distance for cables means cost and losses. So autonomous energy harvesting vessels become the route to accessing this energy source. However, according to Simon Hogg, a professor at the Department of Engineering at Durham University in England, any new technology of this type needs to be sold on its advantage over other offshore renewable energy technologies, which could prove challenging because modern wind farms consist of hundreds of turbines in the 8-to-15-megawatt range with ever-increasing efficiency. Drifts value is also dependent upon hydrogen becoming a major energy source, he adds, which is not yet certain. He says that the challenges around scaling up the technology and integration with shipping and other sea users means it is best suited to very specialized applications, such as hydrogen generation for remote locations.

        "date": "February 27, 2025 11:43 am",
        "content": "Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando addressed concerns regarding the taxation of individuals earning foreign revenue through digital services. The Minister emphasized that recent amendments to the Inland Revenue Act have been misinterpreted, leading to misconceptions in society. Prof. Fernando clarified that the taxation system applies to all income earned within Sri Lanka, whether the source is domestic or international. However, he highlighted that relief measures have been introduced for those earning from digital services compared to other sectors. There has been debate about a 15 tax on service exports, with some believing it is an entirely new tax. In reality, under the Income Tax Act, everyone is subject to income tax. However, individuals earning less than Rs. 150,000 per month will be fully exempt from income tax starting in April, regardless of their industry, he explained. For those earning above this threshold, a progressive tax system applies. Prof. Fernando provided an example: - If an individual earns Rs. 200,000 per month from providing digital services for abroad, the first Rs. 150,000 is tax-free. - The remaining Rs. 50,000 falls within the Rs. 85,000 tax bracket, taxed at 6, amounting to just Rs. 3,000. He further pointed out that while ordinary taxpayers face income tax rates of up to 36, those in the digital services sector are capped at a maximum of 15. This, he argued, provides a relative advantage rather than imposing an additional burden. Prof. Fernando urged the public to avoid misinformation, stating that the new tax structure is not an unfair imposition but rather a step toward a more balanced taxation system.",
