        "date": "July 14, 2023 04:10 pm",
        "content": "India is bidding to become only the fourth country to execute a controlled landing on the moon with the successful launch Friday of its Chandrayaan-3 mission. Chandrayaan, which means moon vehicle in Sanskrit, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center at Sriharikota in southern Andhra Pradesh state at just after 2:30 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET). Crowds gathered at the space center to watch the history-making launch and more than 1 million people tuned in to watch on YouTube. Its Indias second attempt at a soft landing, after its previous effort with the Chandrayaan-2 in 2019 failed. Its first lunar probe, the Chandrayaan-1, orbited the moon and was then deliberately crash-landed onto the lunar surface in 2008. Developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Chandrayaan-3 is comprised of a lander, propulsion module and rover. Its aim is to safely land on the lunar surface, collect data and conduct a series of scientific experiments to learn more about the moons composition. Only three other countries have achieved the complicated feat of soft-landing a spacecraft on the moons surface  the United States, Russia and China. Indian engineers have been working on the launch for years. They are aiming to land Chandrayaan-3 near the challenging terrain of the moons unexplored South Pole. Indias maiden lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, discovered water molecules on the moons surface. Eleven years later, the Chandrayaan-2 successfully entered lunar orbit but its rover crash-landed on the moons surface. It too was supposed to explore the moons South Pole. At the time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the engineers behind the mission despite the failure, promising to keep working on Indias space program and ambitions. Just before Fridays launch, Modi said the day will always be etched in golden letters as far as Indias space sector is concerned. This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation, he said in a Twitter post. India has since spent about 75 million on its Chandrayaan-3 mission. Modi said the rocket will cover more than 300,000 kilometers (186,411 miles) and reach the moon in the coming weeks. Decades in the making Indias space program dates back more than six decades, to when it was a newly independent republic and a deeply poor country reeling from a bloody partition. When it launched its first rocket into space in 1963, the country was no match for the ambitions of the US and the former Soviet Union, which were way ahead in the space race. Now, India is the worlds most populous nation and its fifth-largest economy. It boasts a burgeoning young population and is home to a growing hub of innovation and technology. And Indias space ambitions have been playing catch up under Modi. For the leader, who swept to power in 2014 on a ticket of nationalism and future greatness, Indias space program is a symbol of the countrys rising prominence on the global stage. In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to reach Mars, when it put the Mangalyaan probe into orbit around the Red Planet, for 74 million  less than the 100 million Hollywood spent making space thriller Gravity. Three years later, India launched a record 104 satellites in one mission. In 2019, Modi announced in a rare televised address that India had shot down one of its own satellites, in what it claimed was an anti-satellite test, making it one of only four countries to do so. That same year ISROs former chairman Kailasavadivoo Sivan said India was planning to set up an independent space station by 2030. Currently, the only space stations available for expedition crews are the International Space Station (a joint project between several countries) and Chinas Tiangong Space Station. The rapid development and innovation has made space tech one of Indias hottest sectors for investors  and world leaders appear to have taken notice. Last month, when Modi met US President Joe Biden in Washington on a state visit, the White House said both leaders sought more collaboration in the space economy. And Indias space ambitions do not stop at the moon or Mars. ISRO has also proposed sending an orbiter to Venus. Source: CNN -Agencies",

The deceased has subsequently been transferred to the Panadura Base Hospital, where doctors had tried to transfer him again, in light of the fact that he was a heart patient.

        "date": "July 14, 2023 10:33 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his interest to expose Sri Lanka to the world for economic development as promptly as possible and to implement related legal reforms. Participating as the Chief Guest at the Indian CEO Forum held at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo on Thursday (13 July), the Head of State asserted that Sri Lanka is not destined for a Greek tragedy, despite its recent crises. As our economy recovers, we must prioritize economic restructuring, he said. Expressing his views at the event, Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay also reassured Indias continued support towards the development of the island. It is recalled here that the Indian government and business community will support Sri Lankas economic and physical development. It is an Indian promise, he said in this regard. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented: Trade between Sri Lanka and India began 700 years ago. We have a remarkable history of Kerala merchants venturing to Sri Lanka and establishing businesses, ultimately integrating into our local system. This cultural amalgamation is evident in landmarks like the Pattini Devalaya in Navagamuwa, which reflects the influence of Kerala on Sri Lankan culture. By the late 19th century, India accounted for only 1 of the worlds GDP. However, with the shift of economic power towards Asia, India has once again risen to prominence. Just as East Asia, including countries like Japan, Korea, and China, witnessed significant growth 75 years ago, it is now Indias turn, along with the Indian Ocean region. Its important to note that India is not the sole nation rising in this context; the oil countries in West Asia are also on the ascent. Positioned strategically in the middle, Sri Lanka benefits from its proximity to India, coupled with a rich history, cultural heritage, and longstanding trading relationships spanning 2,500 years. The world is evolving, and India is undergoing rapid development, particularly under Prime Minister Modis leadership. We, too, have experienced our own economic challenges, but we are a resilient nation, not destined for a Greek tragedy. As our economy recovers, we must prioritize economic restructuring. We initially made progress, but our pace has slowed. Once we complete the debt restructuring process, our focus will shift towards a comprehensive growth agenda. This entails a massive overhaul of our economy, legal framework, and systems, aligning our path with that of India. Our goal is to establish a highly competitive economy that can stand on par with the rest of the world, encompassing green and digital sectors. India and Sri Lanka should embark on this transformative journey together, as we have for the past 2,500 years. Regardless of political dynamics, our cultural and economic ties have remained steadfast. During my visit to India, my primary objective will be to explore connectivity, as High Commissioner Gopal Bagley aptly stated. We need to determine our long-term objectives and aspirations for the next 10 to 15 years. This marks the beginning of a new era, and we must forge ahead together. Its essential to remember that development doesnt halt in India. In the next 50 years, it will extend to Africa and beyond. Therefore, the vision we discussed with Prime Minister Modi should guide our immediate actions. Ultimately, its crucial to recognize that the relationship between our countries is not solely driven by governments but by our people, who are moving forward at a rapid pace. We must adapt to the changing world, avoiding the pitfalls that come with government intransigence. Hence, we must foster a long-term relationship between our two nations, transcending individual leaders or political parties. Together, India and Sri Lanka possess immense potential, and it is our path forward. Responding to a point addressed by Mr. T. S. Prakash, President of the Indian CEO Forum, on the circulation of Indian currency in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe stated that the Sri Lankan government would want to see the Indian rupee used as much as the dollar. It makes no difference to us if India becomes a common currency. Well have to figure out how to go about it. So that is what we must do. We must become more open to the outside world. We must be competitive not just for Sri Lanka, but also for the rest of Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Australia. We must negotiate a more comprehensive trade agreement with the EU. If you want to, you can dominate the entire world. You will fail if you do not want to accomplish it. Meanwhile The High Commissioner of India in Sri Lanka, Gopal Bagle said: For a long time, Indians have conducted business in Sri Lanka. We were able to build a bridge of friendship between the two countries by launching this business. I feel it will have a positive impact on the people of Sri Lanka. When the people of this country were oppressed, India stood by them. During last years financial crisis, India and the Indian business community helped Sri Lankas economy recover. Sri Lanka is now recuperating from the financial crisis, it should be noted. The Government of India and the Indian business community both supported it in this regard. Even during the initial crisis, Indian businessmen began doing business in Sri Lanka to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the countrys financial status is stable. For the past 40 years, the leaders of this country have promoted Indian businesspeople doing business in Sri Lanka. Id want to point to you that the present President, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, has also expressed his support. It is recalled here that the Indian government and business community will support Sri Lankas economic and physical development. It is an Indian promise. A commemorative gift was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe by the Indian business community, and the President also took a group photo with the business community. Madam Maithree Wickramasinghe, Minister of Ports and Maritime Affairs Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Housing and Urban Development Prasanna Ranatunga, Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, State Ministers Shehan Semasinghe, Dilum Amunugama, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Governor of the Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman Chief of Staff of the Tri-Forces General Shavendra Silva, Members of the Indian Business community and other dignitaries were present on this occasion.",

        "title": "UNDP calls for debt repayment breaks as poverty rates rise",
        "date": "July 15, 2023 09:35 am",
        "content": "A United Nations agency urged global finance ministers to give poor countries debt repayment breaks, estimating the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent surge in inflation and borrowing costs had pushed an extra 165 million people into poverty. The U.N. Development Programme said the jump meant more than 20 of the worlds population - around 1.65 billion people - were now living on less than 3.65 a day and struggling to put food on the table. Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in India next week will discuss tackling poverty, along with reforming the worlds top multilateral institutions and the international debt architecture. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, called the surge in poverty alarming. What this means is a government that can no longer pay its teachers; a government that can no longer employ doctors and nurses in hospitals, that cannot provide the medicines for rural health centers, he told journalists. All of the additional 165 million people in poverty were in low or lower-middle income countries, UNDP said. Poverty levels had been gradually dropping until the pandemic but have since risen. Interest rate rises meant poorer nations now spend twice or three times the share of their revenues on servicing debt compared to wealthier ones, and about 2.3 times more on interest payments than on social assistance. Steiner said the UNDP was calling for a Debt-Poverty Pause so that those countries facing the most acute problems can focus their resources on critical social expenditure. It would be similar to the since-ended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) the G20 set up to help poorer countries during COVID-19. The UNDP estimates 25 low-income countries spent over 20 of their revenues on debt servicing last year. It was highest number crossing that threshold since 2000 and could rise further if global interest rates continue to rise. Particularly for low income countries ...the debt burden has become unsustainable, Steiner said. Eliminating poverty is one of a series U.N. goals aimed at tackling some of humanitys most entrenched problems by 2030. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for sweeping reform of the international financial system to allow for a more equitable distribution of resources. A report this week showed almost 30 of the 92 trillion of government debt in the world is owed by developing countries. We need new mechanisms to anticipate and absorb shocks, Steiner said, adding that mitigating the recent impact on the worlds poor would cost just over 107 billion, or 0.065 percent of global GDP.

        "title": "IATA urges Sri Lanka to develop blueprint to support aviation industry",
        "date": "July 15, 2023 10:35 am",
        "content": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has urged Sri Lanka to develop an aviation blueprint so as to generate greater economic growth and prosperity through having a stronger aviation industry. IATAs Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, Philip Goh pointed out that aviation connectivity can play a much bigger role in Sri Lankas economic development and social advancement. But this will not happen by chance. He called for the Sri Lankan governments support, which he deemed critical to grow a strong airline sector and develop Colombo as an aviation hub. Assuring that IATA stands ready to support through its expertise and sharing of industry best practices, Goh urged the Sri Lankan government and all industry stakeholders to collaborate on developing an aviation blueprint to strengthen the aviation industrys competitiveness and bring greater prosperity to the island nation. Aviation has a role to play in 15 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Trade and tourism rely on aviation, and this helps to create jobs, alleviate poverty and generate prosperity. In a 2018 IATA study, Sri Lankas aviation sector supported some 700,000 jobs and contributed 8 billion to the GDP. The association says this has the potential to increase to over 1 million jobs contributing nearly 30 billion to the GDP by 2038. In his keynote remarks at Aviation Day Sri Lanka, organized by IATA and the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL), Goh suggested three areas to consider in the aviation blueprint: facilitating sustainable growth, safety, and sustainability. With regard to facilitating Sustainable Growth, Goh said: Sri Lankas aviation blueprint needs to facilitate the sustainable growth of the industry and having an updated airport masterplan is the first step. I urge the government to engage in a consultative approach involving airlines to ensure that industry input is factored in. Goh urged Sri Lanka to digitize processes for passenger and cargo facilitation. Many of the countrys passenger and cargo processes continue to be paper based. As traffic grows, digitization will be key to addressing capacity constraints, increase efficiency and improve the travel experience. IATAs One ID and One Record initiatives can help support this, said Goh. Goh also highlighted the need to keep costs low, in particular jet fuel. Airlines pay more for jet fuel in Sri Lanka than at other major airports in Asia. He recognized much has been done in recent months to lower the cost of jet fuel. He encouraged the government to review and consider placing limits or capping the amount that CEYPETCO can mark up for supplying fuel at the airport. Speaking on safety, Goh said: It is important for Sri Lankas aviation sector to grow sustainably in a safe manner, and IATA is doing our part to support the countrys efforts. Utilizing the International Airlines Training Fund, IATA will support the aviation industry in Sri Lanka by conducting safety-related training in August for CAASL and Sri Lankan Airlines. Goh encouraged the government to explore how the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) can be used to contribute to greater aviation safety in Sri Lanka. Speaking on sustainability, Goh said: I am delighted that net zero carbon from aviation by 2050 is one of the stated policy goals of Sri Lankas sustainable aviation environment policy, including the need to ensure the availability of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in the country. Sustainable aviation fuels are expected to abate more than 60 of aviation carbon emissions by 2050. Goh called on the Sri Lankan government to adopt a comprehensive consultation process involving airlines and other aviation stakeholders as the government develops sustainability policies.",

        "content": "The government aims to create a critical Sri Lankan who is a global citizen in a bid to find answers to the modern and futuristic problems, State Minister of Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan says. Internationalization of the countrys higher education is a top priority of the government, the lawmaker said further, addressing a press conference in Colombo on Friday (July 14). The event themed Collective Path to a Stable Country had been organized by the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). He said the government wants to infuse international standards into local universities in order to make them respected higher education institutions in the region, if not in the world, at least by 2030. In addition, the government also mulls promoting the engagement of overseas Sri Lankan academics in the countrys higher education by allowing them to engage in university lecturing in state universities while on vacation or sabbatical as a measure to encourage their involvement in higher education, the state minister added. In this method, we are creating a mechanism so that at least ten Diaspora members will engage in teaching in the 17 government universities in Sri Lanka, which will inculcate their professionalism and experience with our government universities. Meanwhile discussions are underway with three prominent international universities to open their branches in Sri Lanka, the state minister added. Sri Lanka has always poised to be one of the best hubs for education. South Indian market alone; Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is going to have 350 million populations by 2030 and their economy is growing. Where will they go to fulfill their educational needs? It is easy for them to come to Colombo than go to Delhi. We need to look at that market. Dr. Raghavan said. Further, the government has held non-regulatory discussions with tuition teachers requesting them to provide their set of recommendations and guidelines to regularize the quality of private tuition education and the safety of students attending these classes, according to the state minister. The Advanced Level tuition market is 65 billion. Tuition teachers, parents AL students are all citizens of this country. So this is a citizen-to-citizen understanding they have to do. Why should the government get involved? the State Minister said. Dr. Raghavan also emphasized the importance of understanding the 21st centurys human rights and added that it is the responsibility of the state to provide higher education to every student who wants to pursue higher education.",

        "date": "July 15, 2023 01:58 pm",
        "content": "An architect has been charged in the deaths of three out of up to 11 victims in the long-unsolved Gilgo Beach murders in New York state. Rex Heuermann, 59, is charged with killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello in 2010. He is suspected in a fourth womans death. On Friday the married Long Island father pleaded not guilty. Detectives say they matched DNA from pizza that the suspect ate to genetic material found on the womens remains. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison told a news conference on Friday: Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us - a predator that ruined families. The suspect, who was arrested at his home on Thursday night, is facing three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the three womens deaths. The judge in the case ordered that he remain in custody, citing the extreme depravity of the crimes. After a plea was entered on his behalf in court, Mr Heuermann reportedly broke down in tears, telling his attorney: I didnt do this. The lawyer, Michael Brown, said his client was distraught and called the evidence extremely circumstantial. Were looking forward to fighting this case in a court of law, not the court of public opinion, Mr Brown said. Ms Barthelemy, Ms Waterman and Ms Costello were found dead in 2010 near a fourth victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. The women have been dubbed the Gilgo Beach Four. All were sex workers, according to prosecutors. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told Fridays news conference that each of the four victims were found similarly positioned, bound in a similar fashion by either belts or tape, with three of the victims found wrapped in a burlap-type material. The local prosecutor said the case against Mr Heuermann was built on mobile phone records linking him to the victims, as well as to a pick-up truck that was seen near one of the victims homes. He allegedly communicated with the victims using burner phones, which he later disposed of. Phone records also allowed investigators to determine that the deaths had taken place when Mr Heuermanns wife and children were out of town. Hair found on a piece of burlap used to wrap one of the victims was linked to Mr Heuermann via a sample from a pizza box he discarded in a rubbish bin in Manhattan in January 2023, according to authorities. Investigators say he was also snared by taunting calls that a person claiming to be the murderer made to one of Ms Barthelemys family members using her mobile phone. Ms Barthelemy was abducted in 2009. Ms Waterman and Ms Costello both went missing in 2010. Mr Heuermann is also a prime suspect in the death of Ms Brainard-Barnes, who was abducted in 2007, although he has so far not been charged with her death. In 2010, police were searching for one missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, when they discovered the remains of four others. Altogether, 11 sets of human remains were found on the same stretch of Gilgo Beach between 2010-11, linked to nine women, one man and a toddler. The identities of four, including the toddler, her mother and the man, remain unidentified. Ms Gilberts remains were eventually found, and an official post-mortem examination was inconclusive. Her family believes she may have been murdered - a theory supported by an independent autopsy that they commissioned. A new task force to investigate the Gilgo Beach murders was formed in February 2022. Mr Heuermann became the focus of the investigation within a month, Mr Tierney said. More than 300 subpoenas and search warrants were issued by investigators on the case. Since the task force was formed, Mr Heuermann allegedly also used a burner phone to conduct more than 200 searches about topics related to serial killers and the Long Island investigation. This included a search for why hasnt the Long Island serial killer been caught and mapping the Long Island murder victims, court documents show. Mr Tierney added that torture porn and depictions of women being abused and being killed were found on Mr Heuermanns computer. The investigation into the other victims is ongoing. Mr Heuermann is the owner of RH Consultants and Associates, a Manhattan architecture firm that describes itself as New York Citys premier architectural firm. The Associated Press has reported that he has a daughter and a stepson. A neighbour described the 6ft 4in suspect going to work every morning, dressed in a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase. Mr Tierney said that Mr Heuermann had licences for 92 guns and a very large safe in which firearms were kept. In a YouTube interview for a real estate-focused channel last year, he said he had been working in the heart of New York City since 1987, describing himself as a trouble shooter. He added that his work helped teach him to understand people. People who lived near his home in Long Islands Massapequa Park expressed surprise at his arrest. The guys been quiet, never really bothers anybody, neighbour Etienne DeVilliers told CBS, the BBCs US partner. Were shocked. Because this is a very, very quiet neighbourhood. Everybody knows each other, all of our neighbours, were all friendly. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Amnesty International has urged Sri Lanka to ensure access to adequate nutrition for all pregnant and breastfeeding women amidst the ongoing economic crisis in the country. At a research briefing, the right group noted that falling incomes, loss of livelihoods and inflation have reduced womens purchasing power while government-funded programs aimed at increasing maternal nutrition have also been affected by the crisis. The research briefing, Foregoing Meals to Make-Do, examined the impact of economic crisis on access to nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, with a particular focus on women living below the poverty line in Colombo. Speaking on the matter, Amnesty Internationals Deputy Regional Director for South Asia, Dinushika Dissanayake said health and nutrition have taken a back seat due to the severity of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, adding that the situation has taken a grave toll on the health and well-being of pregnant and breastfeeding women. These individuals have also been disproportionately impacted by the crisis, which has seen poverty rates double in the space of a year due to the crisis, Dissanayake said further. Amnesty International said it interviewed 45 people for this research briefing, including healthcare workers, members of civil society, and pregnant and breastfeeding women from a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds, all of whom live in informal settlements and tenement blocks in Colombo. The women interviewed by the rights group have raised concerns about the unaffordability of food, the inconsistent supply of Thriposha food supplements, and the inability to redeem food vouchers offered through government programs. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have told Amnesty International that they aimed to fill their stomach rather than consume recommended daily amounts of variety of nutrients due to the high cost of food. In order to have three meals a day, many have opted to limit portion sizes, while some reduced their number of daily meals to two, the Amnesty International said in its briefing.",

Chanaka, Vijitha Herath, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Eran Wickramaratne, Ashok Abeysinghe, Jayantha Ketagoda, Harshana Rajakaruna, Major Pradeep Undugoda, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam and Prof. Ranjith Bandara. Premadasa accused the government of selecting the same people who were responsible for the economic crime in the country and bankruptcy of the country to investigate the causes which led to this situation. It is very clear that the main objective of appointing this Select Committee is to acquit the people responsible for bankrupting the country, the opposition leader said adding that it is futile to work with such a committee which he deemed a waste of time and an act of betrayal of the countrys citizens who were affected by the economic collapse. The SJB leader said the committee, to be appointed by the opposition, would take steps to formally look into all parties responsible for the economic collapse and to report to the parliament. Any Member of Parliament may contribute and support in good faith for the functioning of this committee. Premadasa said the oppositions committee intends to identify those who are responsible for the economic crisis with full transparency, accountability and responsibility.",

        "date": "July 15, 2023 11:03 pm",
        "content": "Debt restructuring is making progress in countries outside of the G20 common framework, such as Sri Lanka, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says. Addressing a press briefing on Thursday, the global lenders Director of Strategic Communications, Julie Kozack said creditor coordination, too, has seen promising progress in these countries. According to Kozack, the G20s common framework has been delivering on debt restructuring cases as well, such as Chad, Ghana, and Zambia. The IMF official acknowledged that the debt restructuring process needs to accelerate, be predictable and timely, adding that it also needs to provide breathing space to debtor countries through debt suspension during negotiations. To help accelerate the debt restructuring process, Kozack said the IMF, along with the World Bank and India as G20 Chair, have initiated the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR). We had a first meeting in February that brought together, for the first time, traditional Paris Club creditors, non-Paris Club official creditors, such as China, India, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the private sector creditors, and, very importantly, debtor countries. Later, the meeting of the GSDR on April 22 resulted in some tangible progress as it aims to solve procedural and process-related issues, Kozack said noting that the focus of GSDR on issues of process, not specific country cases. Specific country cases are being dealt with in the official creditor committees and in the negotiations between creditor and debtor, she explained.",

Addressing the Democracy and National Unity Day Commemoration Ceremony in Colombo on Saturday (July 15), Ambassador Demet Şekercioğlu said Türkiye continues to engage with the Sri Lankan authorities with enhanced intelligence sharing to build a strong, vigilant and comprehensive response to terrorism. On July 15, 2016, the government of Türkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan defeated an attempted coup détat by FETÖ members, which claimed the lives of 251 citizens and left thousands of others injured. The day is commemorated as the Democracy and National Unity Day in Türkiye. The ambassador said the tragic events that unfolded on July 15t were not merely acts of terror;, but a blatant affront to the founding principles that define the Republic of Türkiye and its people  the principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. She said the malicious acts witnessed on July 15, 2016 were not results of an overnight attempt., but the climax of many years of meticulous planning and covert operations by the FETÖ led by Fetullah Gülen. Şekercioğlu highlighted that Türkiyes fight against FETO has been unwavering, and combating these elements of terror has been one of its top priorities both within and outside of the country. Meanwhile, Türkiye Foreign Minister has thanked the countrys Asian partners for their support in the fight against FETO. Addressing a news conference at the ASEAN-Türkiye Sectoral Dialogue Partnership Trilateral Meeting held in Jakarta, Indonesia, Minister Hakan Fidan recognized and appreciated the cooperation of Türkiyes friends from the Asian region in the fight against FETO.",

        "date": "July 16, 2023 11:09 am",
        "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said China must build a solid security barrier around its internet under the supervision of the ruling Communist Party, in his latest call to safeguard online data and information. China must persist in managing, operating and ensuring access to the internet in accordance with the law, Xi said in instructions delivered to officials attending a two-day cybersecurity meeting in Beijing that ended on Saturday. We must adhere to the Partys management of the internet and adhere to (the principle of) making the internet work for the people, state-run Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying. In the past decade, Xi has made preserving security a priority, with his concept of security covering everything from politics and the economy to the environment and cyberspace. In 2015, China passed a national security law with a broader scope to include its cyberspace. A year later, a law was passed that contained requirements for security reviews and for data to be stored on servers in China. In 2021, China rolled out regulations around so-called critical information infrastructure. This year, lawmakers updated anti-espionage legislation to ban the transfer of information related to national security and broaden the definition of spying. Navigating Chinas dense network of rules and laws on online data and information is not without risk for companies. In April, U.S. consultancy firm Bain  Co said police visited its office in Shanghai and questioned some staff. The Financial Times, citing people briefed on the surprise visit, reported that the police also took away computers and phones. Last year, regulators told Chinas biggest financial data provider Wind Information Co to stop providing offshore users with certain data, sources told Reuters at the time. In 2021, authorities launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global two days after it went public in the United States. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

There is no tsunami threat for other Pacific coasts in the US and Canada, the advisory said.

        "date": "July 16, 2023 01:50 pm",
        "content": "Redoubling support for war-stricken Ukraine is the single best way to aid the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday, along with boosting emerging economies and tackling debt distress. Yellen also said on the sidelines of a G20 finance ministers summit in India she would push back on criticism there was a tradeoff between aid to Ukraine and developing nations. Ending this war is first and foremost a moral imperative, she told reporters in Gandhinagar, which is hosting a wider G20 summit. But its also the single best thing we can do for the global economy. Yellen also pointed to efforts to tackle debt distress faced by struggling economies, bank reform and a global tax deal, and warned it was premature to talk of lifting tariffs on China. Russias invasion of Ukraine, both global breadbaskets that together exported almost a quarter of the worlds wheat supply, triggered shockwaves in economies worldwide by sending prices for food and fuel shooting up. G7 leaders promised at a summit in Lithuania on Wednesday to support Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russias invasion. Any discussion on Ukraine is awkward for G20 host India, which has not condemned Russias invasion but is also part of the Quad grouping alongside Australia, the United States and Japan. - Deep mistrust  Yellen also cited debt restructuring progress in Zambia, which she discussed with Chinese officials last week on a visit to Beijing, and said she expected Ghana and Sri Lanka debt treatments would be finalised soon. She said it was still too soon to lift restrictions placed on China during a trade war launched by former US president Donald Trump. Tariffs were put in place because we had concerns with unfair trade practices on Chinas side, and our concerns with those practices remain, they really havent been addressed, Yellen said. Perhaps over time this is an area where we could make progress but Id say it is premature to use this as an area for de-escalation. Yellen pointed to other work tackling debt distress and the reform of multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and other regional lenders, in efforts she said could unlock 200 billion over the next decade. More than half of all low-income countries are near or in debt distress, double the case in 2015, she said. G20 finance chiefs and central bank heads are due to meet on Monday and Tuesday and World Bank chief Ajay Banga warned of a deep mistrust... quietly pulling the Global North and South apart at a time when we need to be uniting. The climate change crisis, post-pandemic recovery efforts, the war in Ukraine and a lack of progress in the fight against poverty were creating divisions, Banga said. Prison of poverty The Global Souths frustration is understandable, Banga said in an op-ed. The International Monetary Fund said finding common efforts to tackle the weak global economy would be crucial. The world will be looking for joint action to address rising economic fragmentation, slowing growth, and high inflation, the IMF said in a statement last week. The G20 will also discuss cryptocurrency regulations, as well as making access to financing to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change easier for developing nations. In the Global North, climate change means emissions reductions, Banga said. But in the Global South, it is a matter of survival, because hurricanes are stronger, heat-resistant seeds are in short supply, drought is destroying farms and towns, and floods are washing away decades of progress. A newly agreed first step on a fairer distribution of tax revenues from multinational firms reached by 138 countries on Wednesday is also set to be delivered during the G20 talks. Multinationals, especially tech firms, are currently able to shift profits easily to countries with low tax rates even though they carry out only a small part of their activities there.

Further, the Minister said that by the end of 2023, the loss of the Postal Department will be reduced by Rs. 4,000 million. When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assigned me this ministry he entrusted me with the challenge of converting the Postal Department into a profit-generating institution. The postal services income in 2022 was Rs. 7,000 million while the expenditure was Rs. 14,000 million. The state minister said he has had discussions with the respective officials and taken steps to reduce the gap between the income and the expenditure of the Postal Department from Rs. 7,000 million to Rs. 4,000 million. It is planned to resolve the gap between income and expenditure by the year 2024. Bandara said that in 2025, the governments goal is to create a Postal Department that no longer depends on the Treasury. The Postal Department, which is one of the oldest departments in this country, still has an Ordinance brought during the time of the Queen, the state minister pointed out, noting that it has been amended only once thus far. We have identified the Post Office Ordinance as a major obstacle to the modernization process of the Postal Department and other relevant activities. Therefore steps are being taken to amend it urgently and its work has already been completed by 80 percent, he added. We hope to create new revenue generation channels through digitization of postal service, the state minister continued noting that at present, Rs. 4,000 million, Rs. 668 million and Rs. 200 million have been earned annually through the sale of stamps, postage of stamps and Cash on Delivery (COD) service respectively. In the future, it is planned to increase the revenue by popularizing the COD method, he explained. During the modernization of postal service, 1,000 three-wheelers will be deployed all over the country replacing the traditional bicycles that were used in field for a long time. We also hope to provide an official uniform. By doing so, our ultimate goal is to create a strong postal service in the country, the state minister continued.",

        "date": "July 16, 2023 08:59 pm",
        "content": "The bodies of eight people trapped in a tunnel submerged by heavy rain in central South Korea were pulled out on Sunday, taking the death toll from days of torrential rain that have pounded the country to 37. Mr Seo Jeong-il, a fire station chief, said about 15 vehicles, including a bus, were submerged in the underpass in Cheongju city shortly after a levee of a nearby river was destroyed by the downpour on Saturday. Closed-circuit television footage aired on local broadcaster MBC showed muddy water rushing into the tunnel as vehicles drove past with their wheels submerged. We are focusing on the search operation as there are likely more people there, Mr Seo told reporters. We are doing our best to wrap it up today. The death toll in the tunnel stands at nine, including one body retrieved on Saturday, South Koreas Yonhap news agency reported. The Ministry of the Interior and Safety earlier said 10 people were still missing early on Sunday morning, as the heavy rain caused landslides and floods, with evacuation covering 7,886 people. The casualties from the flooded tunnel were not included in the ministrys data as it was not immediately clear how many people and cars were trapped underwater. The latest disaster took place despite South Koreas vow to step up preparedness against torrential rain after Seoul was hit in 2022 with floods caused by the heaviest downpour in 115 years, inundating basement flats in low-lying neighbourhoods, including in the largely affluent Gangnam district. One survivor from the submerged tunnel said the government should have restricted access to the underpass when flooding was expected, Yonhap reported. A North Chungcheong province official said the levee unexpectedly collapsed before the precipitation reached the level required for restricting access to the tunnel. President Yoon Suk-yeol, now on an overseas trip, ordered Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to mobilise all available resources to minimise the casualties, his office said, as more heavy rain is expected on Sunday. The Korea Meteorological Administration said the central and southern parts of South Korea could receive as much as 300mm of additional rain by Tuesday. While South Korea often experiences heavy rain in the summer, it has witnessed a sharp increase in torrential rain in recent years. Korea Railroad Corporation has halted all slow trains and some bullet trains since Saturday due to safety concerns over landslides, track flooding and falling rocks. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Although his relatives of the patient had suspicions about his death, they had not been able to file complaints about the matter. According to the relatives, the patient was suffering from an armpit lump, and he had not been in a critical condition to pass away in this manner. He has been administered a drug to produce loss of consciousness. However, he has not regained consciousness and was pronounced dead shortly afterward.

        "date": "July 16, 2023 10:39 pm",
        "content": "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa on Sunday (July 16) hit out at the government for the hefty electricity bill sent to Sri Dalada Maligawa, deploring the move as unprincipled and rude. In a media release, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegayas leader said this unprecedented act is atrocious and a disgrace to Buddhism and the entire Buddhist community. Premadasa said sending such a hefty bill to Sri Dalada Maligawa, which is deemed the pinnacle of Buddhist reverence with the annual Esala Perahera close at hand, is totally unacceptable. However, when inquired by Ada Derana about the matter, Diyawadana Nilame (chief custodian) of Sri Dalada Maligawa Pradeep Nilanga Dela mentioned that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been sending an estimated bill every year right before the Esala Perahera, adding that it is a usual procedure. He explained that before the commencement of the annual Esala Perahera, the estimated bill sent by the CEB is usually discussed with the Four Dewala and the Kandy Municipal Council before the payment is made. In previous years, the relevant payments were made after the conclusion of Esala Perahera, however, this year, the CEB has requested Sri Dalada Maligawa to make the payment before the commencement of the procession. The Diyawadana Nilame said they have no issue with the CEB making such a request. According to the letter, Rs. 13,299,010.99 has been estimated as the total cost to provide electricity for the annual Esala Perahera. Rs. 3,412,479.29 is estimated for Sri Dalada Maligawa, Rs. 1,122,145.69 for Sri Natha Dewalaya, Rs.1,368,385,69 for Sri Vishnu Dewalaya, Rs. 1,102,705.69 for Sri Kataragama Dewalaya, Rs. 1,102,705.69 for Sri Paththini Dewalaya, Rs. 4,441,373,85 for Perahera street lights and Rs. 479,215.10 for electricity generators. The first Kumbal Perahera of the annual Esala Perahera is scheduled to parade the streets on August 21 while the final Randoli Perahera is planned for August 30.",

        "title": "US Treasury Secretary hopes debt treatments for Sri Lanka could be finalised quickly",
        "date": "July 17, 2023 07:44 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was eager to work with China on areas of mutual interest, including debt restructurings for poorer countries, and that multilateral development banks needed reforms before capital increases could be considered. At a press conference before a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in India, Yellen said her visit to Beijing last week helped put the U.S.-China relationship on surer footing and that the worlds two biggest economies had an obligation to the world to cooperate on areas of mutual concern. There is much more work to do. But I believe this trip was an important start, Yellen said. I am eager to build on the groundwork that we laid in Beijing to mobilise further action. Concerns remain about Chinas unfair trade practices, which prompted Washington to impose tariffs on Beijing. They really have not been addressed, she said. U.S. corporations want to see an environment where they could invest and thrive in China, Yellen said. Washington will continue to cut off Russias access to military equipment and technologies that Moscow needs in the invasion of Ukraine, Yellen said. One of our core goals this year is to combat Russias efforts to evade our sanctions. Our coalition is building on the actions weve taken in recent months to crack down on these efforts, she added. India, which chairs the G20 this year, has sought a largely neutral stance on the war, generally declining to blame Russia for the invasion Moscow launched in February last year, urging a diplomatic solution and sharply boosting its purchases of Russian oil even as Western nations seek to squeeze Moscow. Yellen said she would continue to push hard at the G20 meeting, in Gandhinagar in the northwestern Indian state of Gujarat, for full and timely participation of all bilateral official creditors on pending debt restructurings. She said she discussed Zambias restructuring with her Chinese counterparts and, although it took too long to negotiate, differences were overcome. We should apply the common principles we agreed to in Zambias case in other cases  rather than starting at zero every time. And we must go faster, Yellen said, adding she hoped debt treatments for Sri Lanka and Ghana could be finalised quickly so the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could move forward with initial loan programme reviews this fall. She said a debt restructuring user guide was needed for borrowing countries and other stakeholders to provide clarity about the process. Yellen said the IMFs Poverty Reduction and Growth trust, which provides zero-interest loans to the worlds poorest countries, needed to be put on sounder financial footing. The U.S. Treasury is ready to assist the IMF to consider options for this, including using internal fund resources, she said. BETTER BANKS Yellen also laid out a number of next steps for the evolution of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, but said that any exploration of capital increases for the institutions can only be considered after implementing reforms aimed at expanding their role beyond poverty reduction to tackle global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. We should build better banks, not just bigger banks, Yellen said. She repeated her estimate that multilateral development banks could collectively boost lending by 200 billion over a decade from internal resources through balance sheet reforms now being implemented or considered. They could boost this further by implementing recommendations from last years G20 Capital Adequacy Framework report, she said. Among other World Bank reform steps, Yellen said she was pushing for a new set of principles that would allow the targeted use of the banks concessional financing for global challenges, including climate change and measures to boost such resources. She said she would like the World Bank to explore options for lending to sub-sovereign and supra-sovereign borrowers like the COVAX vaccine initiative. Yellen said the United States was committed to implementing a global corporate minimum tax deal reached in 2021 despite the lack of action by the U.S. Congress to do so. She said negotiations on technical details of the deals Pillar 1 - reallocation of taxing rights on large multinationals including big technology firms - were very close to completion.

        "content": "Heavy downpours lashed South Korea a ninth day on Monday as rescue workers struggled to search for survivors in landslides, buckled homes and swamped vehicles in the most destructive storm to hit the country this year. At least 40 people have died, 34 others are injured and more than 10,000 people have had to evacuate from their homes since July 9, when heavy rain started pounding the country. The severest damage has been concentrated in South Koreas central and southern regions. In the central city of Cheongju, hundreds of rescue workers, including divers, continued to search for survivors in a muddy tunnel where about 15 vehicles, including a bus, got trapped in a flash flood that may have filled up the passageway within minutes Saturday evening. The government has deployed nearly 900 rescue workers to the tunnel, who have so far pulled up 13 bodies and rescued nine people who were treated for injuries. It wasnt immediately clear how many people were in the submerged cars. As of Monday afternoon, rescue workers had pumped out most of the water from the tunnel and were searching the site on foot, a day after they used rubber boats to move and transport bodies on stretchers. Hundreds of emergency workers, soldiers and police were also looking for any survivors in the southeastern town of Yechon, where at least nine people were dead and eight others listed as missing after landslides destroyed homes and buckled roads, the county office said. Photos from the scene showed fire and police officers using search dogs while waddling through knee-high mud and debris from destroyed homes. Nearly 200 homes and around 150 roads were damaged or destroyed across the country, while 28,607 people were without electricity over the past several days, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said in a report. The Korea Meteorological Administration maintained heavy rain warnings across large swaths of the country. Torrential rains were dumping up to 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) per hour in some southern areas. The office said the central and southern regions could still get as much as 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) of additional rain through Tuesday. Returning from a trip to Europe and Ukraine, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held an emergency government meeting. He called for officials to designate the areas hit hardest as special disaster zones to help funnel more financial and logistical assistance into relief efforts.

        "title": "Mission: Impossible debuts with 80M over five days, igniting box office but missing expectations",
        "date": "July 17, 2023 12:35 pm",
        "content": "After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, Mission: Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part One launched with a franchise-best 80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a 56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates. The Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of 155 million from 70 markets. But while a 235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, Dead Reckoning couldnt approach the high-speed velocity of last summers top film, Top Gun: Maverick. Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, Fallout, which opened with 61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the 57.8 million Mission: Impossible II debuted with in 2000. That puts the films opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disneys Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with 82 million over five days and 60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of Dead Reckoning, which cost 290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses. Those costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. Dead Reckoning, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets  albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way. Still, Dead Reckoning was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96 fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an A CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest Mission: Impossible film. Though the coming competition of Barbenheimer  the much-anticipated debuts of Barbie and Oppenheimer  looms, Mission: Impossible should play well for weeks to come. This is a global franchise. Its going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end, said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. Dead Reckoning, Aronson said, met or exceeded the studios expectations. In international markets, in like-for-like markets, were 15 ahead of Fallout, and thats taking China out, added Aronson. Domestically, were over 3 ahead of Fallout for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment. Cruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office thats been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening. Dead Reckoning hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. Mission: Impossible launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year. Though Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie director Greta Gerwig and Oppenheimer filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support. However that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office. These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. I think its going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with Mission leading into Barbenheimer. No other new wide release challenged Mission: Impossible over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom which increased 37 in its second with 27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama. Last weeks top film,  Insidious: The Red Door  slid to third with 13 million in its second weekend. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is dropping quickly with 12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of 145.4 million. In limited release, the Searchlight Pictures mockumentary Theater Camp opened to 270,000 from six theatres in New York and Los Angeles. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Mission: Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part One, 56.2 million. 2. Sound of Freedom, 27 million. 3. Insidious: The Red Door, 13 million. 4. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, 12 million. 5. Elemental, 8.7 million. 6. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, 6.1 million. 7. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, 3.4 million. 8. No Hard Feelings, 3.3 million. 9. Joy Ride, 2.6 million. 10.

        "date": "July 17, 2023 04:31 pm",
        "content": "Russia said on Monday, July 17, it has halted an unprecedented wartime deal that allows grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where hunger is a growing threat and high food prices have pushed more people into poverty. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced halting the deal in a conference call with reporters, adding that Russia will return to the deal after its demands are met. When the part of the Black Sea deal related to Russia is implemented, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal, Peskov said. Its the end of a breakthrough accord that the United Nations and Turkey brokered last summer to allow food to leave the Black Sea region after Russia invaded its neighbor nearly a year and a half ago. A separate agreement facilitated the movement of Russian food and fertilizer amid Western sanctions. The warring nations are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products that developing nations rely on. Russia has complained that restrictions on shipping and insurance have hampered its exports of food and fertilizer  also critical to the global food chain. But analysts and export data say Russia has been shipping record amounts of wheat and its fertilizers also have been flowing. The agreement was renewed for 60 days in May amid Moscows pushback. In recent months, the amount of food shipped and number of vessels departing Ukraine have plunged, with Russia accused of limiting additional ships able to participate. The Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed three Ukrainian ports to export 32.9 million metric tons of grain and other food to the world, more than half of that to developing nations, according to the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul. But the deal has faced setbacks since it was brokered by the UN and Turkey: Russia pulled out briefly in November before rejoining and extending the deal. In March and May, Russia would only extend the deal for 60 days, instead of the usual 120. The amount of grain shipped per month fell from a peak of 4.2 million metric tons in October to 1.3 million metric tons in May, the lowest volume since the deal began. Exports expanded in June to a bit over 2 million metric tons, thanks to larger ships able to carry more cargo. Ukraine has accused Russia of preventing new ships from joining the work since the end of June, with 29 waiting in the waters off Turkey to join the initiative. Joint inspections meant to ensure vessels only carry grain and not weapons that could help either side also have slowed considerably. Average daily inspections have steadily dropped from a peak of 11 in October to about 2.3 in June. Ukrainian and US officials have blamed Russia for the slowdowns.

        "date": "July 17, 2023 05:47 pm",
        "content": "In a significant development, Alliance Air has commenced daily commercial flights between Chennai and Sri Lankas Jaffna city, taking travel and trade between the two countries to new heights. The increased frequency of flights comes as a welcome move, aiming to bolster connectivity between Chennai and the Tamil-dominated Jaffna city. Union Minister of Civil Aviation, Jyotiraditya Scindia, announced this exciting development during the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) annual convention held in Colombo earlier this month. Starting from Sunday, the Jaffna International Airport (JIA) welcomed the inaugural flight from Chennai, marking the beginning of daily flights on this route. Confirming this milestone, Chief Airport Manager Aruna Rajapaksa stated that the first flight arrived in Jaffna at 11:30 am. This increased frequency will provide passengers with greater convenience and flexibility for their travel plans. Initially, Alliance Air will be operating with their ATR72 aircraft, which can comfortably carry 70 passengers. The flights have been carefully scheduled to ensure timely arrivals and departures for passengers. Arrivals are expected at 11:30 am, with departures to Chennai scheduled for 12:30 pm, providing seamless travel options for both Indian and Sri Lankan travelers. JIA, which was developed with Indian assistance, has been steadily expanding its flight services for domestic and international travelers. It serves as Sri Lankas third international airport and has witnessed a growing number of scheduled flights. The resumption of flight services between Chennai and Jaffna in December 2022, after a three-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a positive step towards reviving tourism and boosting Sri Lankas economy. Tourism is a vital source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, and the pandemic had severely impacted the sector, contributing to economic challenges. With daily flights between Chennai and Jaffna, travelers can look forward to more convenient and frequent travel options, promoting tourism, trade, and cultural exchanges between India and Sri Lanka. The new flight services offer a promising future for both nations as they recover and strive for economic growth in the post-pandemic era. -Agencies-",

        "date": "July 17, 2023 08:06 pm",
        "content": "As a result of the new fertilizer policy of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, 512,000 hectares of paddy fields were cultivated in the Yala season after 10 years, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said. The minister added that 80 of the nations agricultural production is expected to be produced by 2025 as part of President Ranil Wickremesinghes strategy to modernize the agricultural industry, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The use of contemporary technologies in agriculture can improve production of fruits and vegetables intended for export and reduce the amount of agricultural crops that are imported, Minister Amaraweera added. He expressed these views today (17) during a press conference themed One Year of Progress held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), it added. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera further commented; Within a year of taking office, President Ranil Wickremesinghe promptly fixed the farmers issues and tried to get them back to farming. Without a doubt, the countrys circumstances were dire when President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed office and I took over the Ministry of Agriculture. Farmers protested on the roads demanding fertilizer. The youths of the farming families left the farms and moved to other areas. Some young people even left the country. The biggest issue in this case was guiding them back to the farmland. The public had no confidence in the Ministers. Even at the meetings on this problem, the farmers stayed away. If they wish to return to the fields, they demand to be provided fertilizer. Although 275 000 hectares were supposed to be cultivated in that Yala season only 212, 000 hectares were cultivated. At that time, President Ranil Wickremesinghe negotiated with the Indian Government and arranged to provide 6,500 metric tons of fertilizer under the Indian loan scheme. However, the Indian loan arrangement does not allow for the provision of fertilizers. The fertilizer was imported from Oman. Only after learning that a ship carrying fertilizer was approaching the Port did the farmers venture back to their fields. This allowed for the cultivation of 512 000 hectares. It is now the most cultivated hectares in the Yala season after ten years. The farmers arrived back at the farmland in this manner. A global food crisis was anticipated at the time, according to the warnings. Despite considerable success during the Yala season, 800,000 metric tons of rice had to be imported due to the fertilizer issue. The amount of rice that the government had to import was 300 million USD. For animal feed, another 100 million USD was invested. The farmers received fuel and financial aid to carry out the required farming tasks. Additionally, steps were taken to give small-scale farmers a supplementary urea fertilizer subsidy. Money was deposited to farmers accounts so they could also purchase organic fertilizers. The Yala season has now begun. After three seasons, measures were taken to make mud fertilizer available without charge. The newly imported urea fertilizer is offered for Rs. 9000. A voucher of Rs.2000 is issued per one hectare to purchase Bundi fertilizer. The farmers have now received an unexpected subsidy. They did not request for free fertilizer. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is of the opinion that more help should be given to improve the status quo. There is a chance to advance the level of our nations agriculture on a global scale. Modern technology is being introduced to agriculture through many means. There may be several difficulties here. However, every effort is made to develop agriculture using contemporary technologies. Numerous individuals, both inside and outside of the political sphere, have criticized these actions. They have alleged that imported fertilizers to be substandard and the harvest to be poor. There are still plenty of initiatives to dissuade farmers. Despite what they claim, the farmers have returned to their farms. The Agricultural Services Act is currently being amended. In addition to the current subsidies, steps are being taken to provide subsidies in the cultivation of other crops. There are several areas where paddy agriculture is not profitable. The government is ready to help them grow other crops. They have the potential to earn more income by switching to other crops. The farmers in this country would not only have abandoned their fields if the President had not come into power, but many of them might have also taken their own lives. And we could have become a weak nation due to scarcity of food. When the President assumed office a year ago, food inflation was nearly 90. So far, food inflation has decreased to 4.1. All the farmers of this country deserve the respect and praise of the citizens for being committed to create a renaissance in the countrys agriculture and creating food security in the country. Also, the country has saved 400 USD as the farmers have resumed cultivation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe gave instructions to establish an Agricultural Modernization Secretariat for the modernization of the agricultural sector in the Presidential Secretariat in parallel to accelerate the countrys sustainable economic growth. The main responsibility of the Agricultural Modernization Secretariat is to solve problems related to various dimensions of modernization, including specific problems affecting various sub-sectors. It envisages preparation of roadmaps for each sub-sector to modernize agriculture with time-bound measures and performance benchmarks. In order to formally implement this responsibility, the Agricultural Modernization Secretariat has been established by involving all ministries, private sector and universities related to the subject of agriculture. This Agricultural Modernization Secretariat has been operating since May 31 this year based on improving the production and productivity of the agricultural, livestock and animal products sectors using modern technology, increasing the farmers income, and increasing the export income. A national policy framework is currently being prepared under the leadership of Professor Gamini Senanayake of University of Ruhuna as per the instructions of the President in order to get the agricultural sectors assistance in creating a Developed Sri Lanka by the year 2048 through sustainable agricultural development, production of export-oriented agricultural products, assurance of local food security and the transformation of the youth group into Agribusiness Entrepreneurs associated with new technology. The goal is to have this policy framework completed by the end of August 2023. The average yield of paddy in this country is about 3.7 metric tons per hectare. A set of farmers from Hambantota have been able to obtain 10.25 metric tons of paddy per hectare by following good agricultural practices and using quality seed materials. Therefore, the primary goal is to double the current average annual yield for paddy by six seasons from 3.7 metric tons to 7.4. metric tons. Average maize yield in Sri Lanka is about 3.7 metric tons per hectare. By the end of 2026, it is expected to increase it up to 60 metric tons. Steps will be taken to construct high-tech model cultivation plots as pilot projects for both crops and livestock in each province, with the help of the Provincial Council, the line Ministry, the Central Government, private sector and universities. Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture Gunadasa Samarasinghe, Director General of Agriculture P. Malathi, Agricultural Services Commissioner General A. H. M. L. Abeyratne, Chairman of Fertilizer Corporation Dr. Jagath Perera, Director of National Fertilizer Secretariat Chandana Lokuhewage were also present, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "July 17, 2023 10:02 pm",
        "content": "Britain has added a number of construction roles to its shortage occupation list, allowing the building industry to bring in staff from abroad more easily to help employers struggling to fill positions. Bricklayers, masons, roofers, roof tilers, slaters, carpenters, joiners and plasterers will benefit from cheaper visas and more relaxed employment criteria under the changes. Britain is suffering from acute labour shortages in some sectors meaning employers are keen to recruit workers from abroad. But, doing so causes a political headache for Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks governing Conservative Party, which has been promising to cut net migration for the last decade. The interior ministry said in a statement on Monday that adding the new roles would aid the delivery of key national infrastructure and stimulate growth for related industries The independent Migration Advisory Committee recommended in March that the construction jobs be added to the shortage occupation list. The list already includes care workers, civil engineers and laboratory technicians, plus healthcare roles. Net migration to Britain reached a record high of 606,000 last year, data published in May showed, drawing fresh promises from Sunak to reduce arrivals. Critics of Brexit say the UKs exit from the European Union has exacerbated labour shortages as EU citizens can no longer travel without visas to work in Britain as they could before. Those working in a shortage occupation can be paid 80 of the jobs usual rate and still qualify for a visa, the government statement said. Applicants need a job offer from an employer and must meet an English language requirement. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Ahead of his first official visit to India this week, Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe will hold talks with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Tuesday in Parliament in a bid to settle the long-standing Tamil minority demand for political autonomy, sources said on Monday. The TNA-Wickremesinghe parley is to take place on Tuesday afternoon in Parliament, PTI reported quoting sources. Wickremesinghe leaves for New Delhi on July 20 and on July 21, the President will meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, officials in the foreign office said. Since December, Wickremesinghe had opened dialogue with the TNA in a bid to settle the long-standing Tamil minority demand for political autonomy. Wickremesinghe mooted the idea for full implementation of the India-backed 13th Amendment which came to be opposed by the powerful Buddhist clergy in a case of history repeating itself. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The Tamil side insisted on resolving the immediate issues of concern such as the release of private lands held for military purposes, the release of Tamil political prisoners and conflict reparations. Although some of the lands came to be released and a few prisoners were also released but the Tamil side remain largely dissatisfied. A few former militant Tamil parties who are not part of the TNA have also written to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to pressure Wickremesinghe into full implementation of the 13th Amendment. They demand that land and police powers retained by the central government be granted to the northern provincial council including holding of the election postponed since 2018. Meanwhile, the state minister of fisheries Piyal Nishantha said the thorny issue of illegal fishing in the Sri Lankan waters by Indian fishermen would be discussed during the visit to New Delhi.

        "date": "July 18, 2023 08:44 am",
        "content": "Australias state of Victoria will not host the 2026 Commonwealth Games due to projected cost overruns, placing the future of the quadrennial multi-sport gathering in doubt. Victoria state Premier Dan Andrews said the cost of the Games, which were to have been held in four regional hubs, could blow out to more than A7 billion (4.8 billion) from a budgeted A2.6 billion if they went ahead. Frankly A6-A7 billion for a 12-day sporting event, were not doing that, Andrews said at a media conference. I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to fund an event that is three times the cost as estimated and budgeted for last year. Andrews said Victoria had already informed the global governing body Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) in amicable meetings but the cost of breaking the 2026 contract was yet to be decided. The CGF and local governing body Commonwealth Games Australia did not provide immediate comment. The sporting event for mostly former British colonies has struggled to remain relevant, with four of the last five editions held in Australia or Britain. English city Birmingham stepped in to host the 2022 Games after South Africa were stripped of them in 2017 over a lack of progress in preparations. Victoria stepped in to bid for the 2026 Games when no other countries showed interest. Officials had talked up the legacy benefits from new infrastructure in the regional hubs of Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Gippsland, and an economic boost of more than A3 billion from tourism and thousands of new jobs. As a state, of course we were willing to help out, but of course not at any price and only if there were lasting benefits for Victorian communities and benefit for the whole state, Andrews said. The government would instead spend more than A2 billion on a regional package which would include building all permanent sporting facilities intended for the Games, along with A1 billion earmarked for social and affordable housing. Soon after the announcement, Australian sport officials were touting the countrys largest state of New South Wales as an alternative host for 2026. NSW state capital Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics. Theres no question weve got the venues ... and March would be a good time to host it, John Coates, an International Olympic Committee Vice-President and former Australian Olympic Committee boss, said in comments published by Sydneys Daily Telegraph.

        "date": "July 18, 2023 11:05 am",
        "content": "A group of religious leaders, educationists, and professionals from Sri Lankas Tamil-majority north and east have written to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to persuade President Ranil Wickremesinghe to call for provincial council elections, without further delay. The civil society members handed over their letter at the Indian Consulate in the northern city of Jaffna, days before President Ranil Wickremesinghes scheduled visit to New Delhi. Sri Lankas provincial councils have been defunct for about five years now, with all nine provinces under Governors rule since the elected councils terms expired in 2018 and 2019. Authorities have also postponed local body elections this year, citing the island nations persisting economic strain. Meanwhile, Mr. Wickremesinghe has called for a meeting with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest grouping representing the Tamils in the legislature, on Tuesday. It is the Presidents latest attempt to speak to Tamil parties after talks on power devolution ended in a virtual deadlock this May. The TNA MPs who took part in earlier discussions  some other parties boycotted the talks terming the Presidents outreach insincere  called it a time-wasting tactic. No agreement was reached. Divisions within Tamil polity It is unfortunate that our Tamil political leadership is disunited merely for political reasons, and it continues without having any meaningful working programme to attain the aspiration of Tamil people. However, a majority of the people desperately need a Tamil administration at the provincial level, the civil society members said in their letter, titled Peoples petition. Although few in the Tamil polity see the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which followed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, as an adequate solution, they hold varied positions on it being a useful starting point. The TNA, which currently has 10 seats in the 225-member Parliament, has said the Sri Lankan government must build upon what was envisaged in the 13th Amendment. The TNA also took part in an exercise to draft a new Constitution when the Maithripala Sirisena  Ranil Wickremesinghe administration was in power from 2015 to 2019. But the exercise was abandoned before completion. Even the TNA is divided on how to move forward, with constituents voicing different, often conflicting, views. The Alliances rival Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF), which has two seats in Parliament, maintains that the 13th Amendment is no meaningful starting point, as the legislative assurance of some power devolution is still situated within the framework of Sri Lankas unitary Constitution, and is far from their demand for a federal set up. Meanwhile, ordinary Tamils continue to face a host of challenges on the ground, ranging from a neglected economy, growing joblessness, household indebtedness, enduring militarisation, and frequent threats to land owned by Tamils, often in the form of archaeological interventions, or conservation efforts. Further, their demands for accountability and justice for alleged human rights violations during and after the civil war remain, with little relief. It is fourteen years since the war ended but the social and economic conditions of our people have not progressed as expected. In addition to the hardships all Sri Lankan people are facing due to the bad management of the economy, Tamil people are facing additional difficulties, said the letter, pointing to education standards falling rapidly in the Tamil areas. About 80 signatories, including well-known names from academia and art, endorsed the letter. Observing that a vast majority of the people feel the need for an approachable Tamil administration at the provincial level to plan and manage all sectors efficiently, the civil society members said having an elected provincial government is the only feasible option. We are fully aware that the Government of India has been consistently calling for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment We earnestly appeal to you to reiterate that position and use this opportunity to persuade the visiting President to call for early Provincial Council elections in Sri Lanka, they said in the letter.

        "date": "July 18, 2023 11:48 am",
        "content": "An experimental drug from Eli Lilly (LLY.N) works best if Alzheimers patients are treated as early as possible, ideally before they develop symptoms of the brain-wasting disease, researchers said on Monday, in the latest promising development for treating the most common form of dementia. The drug, donanemab, has been shown to slow progression of memory and thinking problems by about a third, but that rate doubles to 60 if the drug is started when patients are only mildly impaired, according to new trial data presented at the Alzheimers Association International Conference in Amsterdam. The full analysis from the study involving more than 1,700 patients showed that results were less robust for older, later-stage patients as well as those with higher levels of a protein called tau that has been linked to Alzheimers disease progression. The findings underscore that earlier detection and diagnosis can really change the trajectory of this disease, said Anne White, president of neuroscience at Lilly. Lilly expects the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to decide by the end of this year whether to approve donanemab. It said submissions to other global regulators are underway, and most will be completed by year end. Donanemab, like the recently approved Leqembi from Eisai (4523.T) and Biogen (BIIB.O), is an intravenous antibody designed to remove deposits of a protein called beta amyloid from the brains of Alzheimers patients. Referring to Lillys data released on Monday, Dr. Susan Kohlhaas, executive director of research  partnerships at Alzheimers Research UK, said, These results provide further confirmation that removing amyloid from the brain can change the course of Alzheimers, and may help people affected by this devastating disease if theyre treated at the right time. SIDE EFFECTS Lillys study showed that brain swelling, a known side effect of amyloid-clearing antibodies, occurred in more than 40 of patients with a genetic predisposition to develop Alzheimers. The company had previously reported that 24 of the overall donanemab treatment group had brain swelling. Brain bleeding occurred in 31 of the donanemab group and about 14 of the placebo group. The deaths of three trial patients were linked to the treatment, researchers reported. These side effects should not be taken lightly, but most cases were manageable by monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or stopping the drug, said study investigator Dr. Liana Apostolova, professor in Alzheimers Disease research at Indiana University School of Medicine. Doctors are likely to use very stringent MRI safety screening while we treat these patients, she said. Lilly said donanemabs treatment effect continued to increase relative to placebo over the course of the 18-month trial, even for participants who had been taken off the drug after their levels of amyloid deposits fell significantly. At the end of the trial, the average patient had been without drug for seven months and yet they continued to benefit, White said. She said the findings support the idea that donanemab can be stopped once amyloid is cleared from the brain. Some patients did not worsen significantly during the trial and on average progression of disease was slowed 4.4-7.5 months over 18 months, said Dr. Liz Coulthard, associate professor in dementia neurology at the University of Bristol. Lilly said in May that the study had met all of its goals, showing that donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 29 compared to a placebo in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia whose brains had deposits of two key Alzheimers proteins, beta amyloid and tau. For high tau patients, donanemab was shown to slow disease progression by about 17, while the benefit was 35 for those with low-to-intermediate tau levels. The full study results were also published in JAMA. Whether the harms of these drugs are balanced by their modest clinical benefits will ultimately require more data, an editorial in JAMA alongside the study said. The FDA this month granted standard approval to Leqembi, the first Alzheimers disease-modifying treatment to achieve that goal, clearing the way for wider insurance coverage of the drug. Both medications are also being studied in large trials to see if they have an impact on delaying onset of Alzheimers disease symptoms. The latest study gives me great hope for the outcomes of those prevention trials, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, who directs the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. More than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimers, according to the Alzheimers Association. More than 55 million people worldwide have Alzheimers or other forms of dementia, according to the U.N. World Health Organization. Shares of Lilly, which reached an all-time high near 469 in June, were nearly unchanged at 449.98 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

        "content": "A joint commission established to strengthen bilateral connectivity has held productive discussions on the resumption of ferry services between India and Sri Lanka to boost regional trade and tourism and promote stronger people-to-people ties. India-Sri Lanka Joint Committee established under MOU on Passenger Transportation by Sea held a virtual meeting last week. The productive discussions focused on the resumption of ferry services between the two countries connecting mutually agreed points, the Indian High Commission here said in a statement on Monday. Both sides agreed that the resumption of ferry services will boost regional trade and tourism and promote stronger people-to-people ties, it said. The meeting took place ahead of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes planned visit to India later this week. The two sides were led respectively by Rajesh Kumar Sinha, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways of the Government of India and K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, Secretary, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation of the Government of Sri Lanka. The Joint Committee identified a number of areas for mutual cooperation for the operationalisation of ferry services in the near future and desired to take further steps based on mutual understanding, the statement said. The Joint Committee was recently reconstituted by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka as per the provisions of the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Passenger Transportation by Sea, signed in 2011. The ferry services were suspended in the 80s. The two sides were to start a boast service in April which was later delayed as India changed the port it had chosen for the service.

        "date": "July 18, 2023 06:52 pm",
        "content": "The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) faced critical challenges, and the increase in water tariff was necessary to solve those challenges and ensure that all Sri Lankans would continue to have access to clean drinking water, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman said. He mentioned that the increase was driven by several factors, including the surge in electricity tariffs, which contribute significantly to the cost of water production, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Additionally, the burden of debt (due to past capital expenditure to expand water infrastructure), compounded by currency depreciation and interest rate hikes, together with the exponential increase in the cost of raw materials required to treat water, added to the financial strain on the NWSDB, he said. These circumstances resulted in substantial monthly losses of nearly Rs. 2.8 billion and an annual loss of Rs. 34 billion, hindering the Boards ability to meet operational expenses, service debts, and maintain the quality of water supply services, the Minister added. He expressed these views today (18) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), according to the PMD. Meanwhile, the Minister said that a Cabinet Paper has been passed to commemorate 200 years since upcountry Tamil workers migrated to Sri Lanka from India and who have been contributing to the national economy in various ways since then. On the first week of November, an event will be held in lieu with governments vision, and it will highlight the community as a whole, he added. A Presidential Task Force will be formed soon to deal with injustice that happen to the upcountry community. Young individuals comprising of professionals representing different fields, who have been a part of the system have been selected for this Task Force, the Minister further said. Minister Jeevan Thondaman further commented; I understand the concerns and anxieties that may arise regarding the impact of this increase on already struggling families. I would like to provide clarity on the reasons behind this decision and assure you of my commitment to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. I want to assure you that while the tariff increase is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our water sector, I remain committed to protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. Samurdhi and Tenement consumers, representing the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds, will not see any tariff increases and will therefore continue to receive the necessary subsidies, alleviating any additional financial burden. Moreover, it is important to note that the proposed tariff increase includes provisions to subsidise low water consumers, schools, hospitals and religious establishments. This measure aims to support those who consume less water, come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and provide essential social services. The monthly water bills of low water consumers will remain below Rs. 1000 (Rs. 33 a day). I acknowledge the hardships faced by our citizens, and I empathise with the challenges posed by this tariff increase. However, it is crucial to understand that this decision was made after careful consideration and evaluation of the long-term sustainability of our water sector. Rest assured, we are committed to reviewing the water tariffs in the coming months, introducing a new tariff formula and policy in line with the governments commitment to our development partners. I will take all necessary steps to bring tariffs down in the next revision, while ensuring the financial viability of the NWSDB. I want to emphasise that we are actively exploring cost-saving measures within the NWSDB, such as reducing extra workers and adopting advanced technologies to optimise efficiency and streamline operations. Our aim is to deliver efficient and effective water services to everyone while keeping in mind the economic challenges faced by our people.",

They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign. However, they were both reappointed to the same ministerial portfolios by President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he appointed a new Cabinet on July 22, 2022.",

Speaking during Ada Deranas Big Focus programme with regards to the importation of drugs, Dr. Wijewickrama made a shocking claim that certain unregistered drugs are also being imported to the country. When inquired as to who made these decisions, Dr. Wijewickrama stated that the said decisions are made by the Board of Directors of the NMRA, albeit in the absence of the approval of the expert committee, whose purpose is to grant the said emergency approval of certain drugs. They import drugs that are being rejected by the expert committee. The chairman of the Board of Directors claims that approval for these drugs needs to be given if the Health Ministry has made the decision, he stated in this regard.",
