        "title": "Israel orders evacuation of 1.1 million people from northern Gaza: UN",
        "date": "October 13, 2023 10:21 am",
        "content": "Israels military on Friday directed the evacuation of northern Gaza, a region that is home to 1.1 million people  about half of the territorys population  within 24 hours, a U.N. spokesman said. This could signal an impending ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such an appeal. On Thursday it said that while it was preparing, a decision has not yet been made. The order, delivered to the U.N., comes as Israel presses an offensive against Hamas militants. U.N. spokesman St√©phane Dujarric called the order impossible without devastating humanitarian consequences. Earlier, the Israeli military pulverized the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, prepared for a possible ground invasion and said its complete siege of the territory  which has left Palestinians desperate for food, fuel and medicine  would remain in place until Hamas militants free some 150 hostages taken during a grisly weekend incursion. A visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, along with shipments of U.S. weapons, offered a powerful green light to Israel to drive ahead with its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas deadly attack on civilians and soldiers, even as international aid groups warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gazas 2.3 million people and prevented entry of supplies from Egypt. Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home, Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces are preparing for a ground maneuver should political leaders order one. A ground offensive in Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas and where the population is densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Hamas assault Saturday and smaller attacks since have killed more than 1,300 people in Israel, including 247 soldiers  a toll unseen in Israel for decades  and the ensuing Israeli bombardment has killed more than 1,530 people in Gaza, according to authorities on both sides. Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead in Gaza are Hamas members. Thousands have been wounded on both sides. As Israel pounds Gaza from the air, Hamas militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Amid concerns that the fighting could spread in the region, Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes on Thursday put two Syrian international airports out of service. The relentless barrage on Gaza  which the military said has so far involved 6,000 munitions  left Palestinians running through streets, carrying their belongings and looking for safety A strike Thursday afternoon in the Jabaliya refugee camp took down a residential building on families sheltering inside, killing at least 45 people, Gazas Interior Ministry said. At least 23 of the dead were under the age of 18, including a month-old child, according to a list of the casualties. The home belonging to the al-Shihab family was packed with relatives who had fled bombing in other areas. Neighbors said a second house was hit at the same time, but the toll was not immediately known. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We cant flee because anywhere you go, you are bombed, one neighbor, Khalil Abu Yahia, said. You need a miracle to survive here. The number of people forced from their homes by the airstrikes soared 25 in a day, reaching 423,000 out of a population of 2.3 million, the U.N. said Thursday. Most crowded into U.N.-run schools. Families were cutting down to one meal a day, said Rami Swailem, a 34-year-old lecturer at al-Azhar University, who had 32 relatives sheltering in his home. Water stopped coming to the building two days ago, and they have rationed whats left in a tank on the roof. Alaa Younis Abuel-Omrain has been staying in a U.N. school after a strike on her home killed eight members of her family  her mother, aunt, a sister, a brother and his wife and their three children. Most bakeries stopped producing bread for lack of electricity. Even if there is food in some areas, we cant get to it because of strikes, she said. On Wednesday, Gazas only power station ran out of fuel and shut down, leaving only lights powered by scattered private generators. Hospitals, overwhelmed by a constant stream of wounded and running out of supplies, have only a few days worth of fuel before their power cuts off, aid officials say. Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues, said Fabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Newborn incubators, kidney dialysis machines, X-ray equipment and more, are all dependent on power, he said. Ambulance crews carrying bodies to the morgue at Gazas biggest hospital, Shifa, found no space left. Dozens of full body bags were lined up in the hospital parking lot. Fourteen health facilities have been damaged in strikes, health officials said Thursday. With Israel sealing off the territory, the only way in or out is through the crossing with Egypt at Rafah, but Egypts Foreign Ministry said Thursday that airstrikes on Rafah have prevented it from operating. Egypt has been trying to convince Israel and the United States to allow aid and fuel through the crossing. Israel is employing a new tactic of leveling whole neighborhoods, rather than just individual buildings. Hecht, the military spokesman, said targeting decisions were based on intelligence on locations being used by Hamas and that civilians were warned. Right now, we are focused on taking out their senior leadership, Hecht said. The military said strikes have hit Hamas elite Nukhba forces, including command centers used by the fighters in Saturdays attack, and the home of a senior Hamas naval operative used to store weapons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to crush Hamas after the militants stormed into the countrys south on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people, including killings of children in their homes and young people at a music festival. Netanyahu said Hamas atrocities included beheading soldiers and raping women, descriptions that could not immediately be independently confirmed. Amid grief and demands for vengeance among the Israeli public, the government is under intense pressure to topple Hamas rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza. In a video released Thursday, civilian Hamas figures defended the groups rampage and decried the civilian deaths in Gaza from six days of Israeli airstrikes. The solemn video lacked the bravado of a recording aired Saturday by Hamass military wing that hailed the greatest battle as the massacres were still taking place. Basem Naim, a former Hamas government minister, said that in the swift collapse of the Israeli military on Saturday, chaos prevailed and civilians found themselves in the middle of the confrontation. The claim is contradicted by countless videos and survivor accounts of Hamas militants deliberately targeting and killing civilians in Israel. Naim added that there would be no action to free the 150 captives taken back into Gaza while Israels operation continued. Israel was a nation in mourning. At a funeral for a 25-year-old woman killed with at least 260 other people at a desert rave, and at another service for a slain Israeli soldier, mourners sat cross-legged on the ground next to caskets, wailing or quietly weeping. In Gaza, too, mourners buried families together in shrouds. At one funeral, they placed the battered body of a little girl in the arms of her slain father. Brewing anger over Israeli military and intelligence failures in the surprise attack is being directed at Netanyahus far-right government, which for months advanced a contentious legal overhaul that divided the country and affected the military. In what appeared to be a first admission of fault from a government member, Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch told Israeli news outlet Ynet: We are responsible. I, as a member of the government, am responsible. We were dealing with nonsense. Israels public diplomacy minister quit, the first fissure in Netanyahus government since the onslaught. Four previous conflicts ended with Hamas still firmly in control of the territory it has ruled since 2007. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. A new war Cabinet, which includes a longtime opposition politician, was sworn in Thursday to direct the fight. A high-ranking Hamas official, Saleh Al-Arouri, warned Thursday that any Israeli invasion of Gaza will turn into a disaster for its army, saying the group was prepared to respond. Blinkens visit underscored American backing for Israels retaliation. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists, you will never have to, Blinken said after meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Blinken said he told Netanyahu that it was so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. Blinken will also meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to parts of the occupied West Bank, and Jordans King Abdullah II. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin planned to visit Israel on Friday. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

As such, Sri Lankans in the aforementioned northern cities have been advised to keep daily necessities including medicines and food in stock. However, the Israeli government has deployed troops and beefed up the security in these areas, the embassy said further.

        "date": "October 13, 2023 03:28 pm",
        "content": "Chamari Athapaththu has been crowned the ICC Womens Player of the Month for September 2023 after inspiring Sri Lanka to a historic series triumph over England. Athapaththu beat out South Africa pair Laura Wolvaardt and Nadine de Klerk to earn the award after an outstanding month that included leading Sri Lanka to a stunning series victory. The Sri Lanka Womens captain starred as her side claimed their first-ever series win over England in any format when coming out on top in two of their three Womens T20I clashes. Athapaththu was named player of the series for compiling 114 runs and taking five wickets as Sri Lanka started the month with the two critical Womens T20I wins against England. The all-rounder was pivotal to the pair of victories with scores of 55 and 44 against England, along with bowling figures of 111 and 321. Athapaththu was also among the runs at the Womens Asia Cup later in September as Sri Lanka faced Thailand, Pakistan and India. In total the 33-year-old amassed 208 runs at an average of 26 across five WT20I innings and three WODIs in September. The off-spinner also took five wickets for the month at an average of 26.6 across the white-ball formats. The left-handed batter is currently No.3 in the MRF Tyres ICC Womens ODI Batting Rankings, and No.7 in the Womens T20I Batting Rankings. Meanwhile, Indias rising star Shubman Gill is the ICC Mens Player of the Month for September 2023 after dominating a stretch of ODIs ahead of the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup. Gill held off teammate Mohammed Siraj and England opener Dawid Malan to claim the award after compiling 480 ODI runs at an average of 80 during September. The opener made the most runs at the Asia Cup with 302 at an average of 75.5, including an unbeaten 27 as India crushed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final. Gill backed up his strong tournament form with 178 runs in two innings against Australia as India fine-tuned for the Cricket World Cup on home soil. The right-hander smashed a century against Australia (104) in the second of those ODIs, after reaching three figures against Bangladesh (121) during the Asia Cup for two tons in September. Gill also scored three half-centuries last month and was only dismissed for less than fifty on two occasions from eight innings in that time. The 24-year-old has an incredible record in ODIs with 1917 runs in 35 matches at an average of 66.1 and at a strike rate of 102.84, and is No.2 in the MRF Tyres ICC Mens ODI Batting Rankings. Gill has missed Indias opening matches of the Cricket World Cup due to illness but looms as pivotal to the hosts chances of lifting the trophy for the first time since 2011. --ICC",

        "date": "October 13, 2023 06:43 pm",
        "content": "Israel has used white phosphorus in its continuing military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, putting civilians at serious risk, Human Rights Watch has said, following an analysis of video of the conflict. Human Rights Watch said it verified footage taken in Lebanon and Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, showing multiple uses of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border. Human Rights Watch also interviewed two people who described an attack in Gaza, the rights group said. HRW said the use of white phosphorus in densely populated areas violates Israels obligation under international law to take all feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians. Any time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering, Lama Fakih, HRWs director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on Wednesday. White phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians. Israel should ban all use of airburst white phosphorus munitions in populated areas without exception, the rights group said, noting the availability of non-lethal alternatives. White phosphorus, which can cause bone-deep burns resulting in death or lifelong injuries, can be used to generate smokescreens, mark targets and incinerate enemy targets. While the use of the substance in warzones is not banned outright under international law, use near civilians is prohibited under the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons, to which Israel is not a signatory. Israels defence ministry did not immediately respond to Al Jazeeras request for comment. But Israels military was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying it was currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza. Officials did not provide comment on the alleged use of the chemical in Lebanon, Reuters said. Israel used white phosphorus extensively during its bombardment of Gaza in 2009, drawing widespread condemnation. In 2013, the Israeli military said it would no longer use white phosphorus in populated areas except in exceptional circumstances, following a petition to Israels High Court. Israel has pledged to eradicate Hamas from Gaza following the armed groups deadliest attack inside the country in decades over the weekend. Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed more than 1,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 6,600 others, according to officials in the enclave. More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured in Hamass multi-pronged attack on southern Israeli towns on Saturday, according to Israeli officials. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

Addressing the event further, President Wickremesinghe said the private sector should take over the basic digital infrastructure, given the present economic crisis and limited government resources, adding that the government should step in where it is not feasible for the private sector to do so. With regard to the need for availability of capital in the financial sector, President Wickremesinghe said this is the reason the government is going ahead with the restructuring of banks to ensure there is an adequate capital supply. He added that Sri Lanka requires a diverse financial sector different from what it has today. The president also highlighted the importance of digital inclusion to bridge the digital divide between the rich and the poor. NITC-2023, under the leadership of the Head of State, will span two days with the central theme Towards a Sustainable Digital Society  2030 Digital Economy. It brings together both local and international IT scholars and experts. In alignment with the goal of transforming Sri Lanka into a fully digital economy by 2030, a comprehensive Digital Roadmap and Policy Framework for Sri Lanka was developed by experts and scholars from six sectors within the IT field. The presentation of this roadmap to the President was conducted by State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath. Meanwhile, Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera presented the Enhanced Digital Agriculture Transformation report, a collaborative effort of agricultural and technology experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Technology, aimed at modernizing Sri Lankas agriculture. Additionally, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recognized and awarded innovative achievements in the field of information technology at various educational levels, including schools, universities, post-graduate institutions, businesses and professorial contributions. Speaking at the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: I didnt anticipate having to make a speech here. I had already spoken my share when I attended the SLASSCOM exhibition in the morning. Weve covered the entire spectrum of human development. Secondly, thats how we plan to tackle the issue of human capital formation that we require. Now, you have presented two reports that we will certainly read and discuss with you before proceeding. One of the other issues that has been concerning me is the digital infrastructure. How do we provide the necessary digital infrastructure? Given the present economic crisis and limited government resources, my thinking and the governments thinking, is that the private sector should take over the basic digital infrastructure. The government should step in where it is not feasible for the private sector to do so. Therefore, our digital infrastructure policy will be based on this approach. This means that the emphasis will have to be on cities and the western province, especially in most parts of Gampaha, Colombo and Kalutara districts. Then, we will extend to areas with population centers and towns where access is needed. The second phase will be to expand further. By that time, the providers will be in a better position for longer investments and the government will also have sufficient resources to proceed with the investment. So, no matter what, we have to provide the digital infrastructure and we will have to rely on private investments for the first part. This will enable about 40 to 50 of the population to have that infrastructure. It wont take us long to reach about 60. However, from there onwards, we will have to gradually work on it. So, these are the key issues we are considering. Another important aspect is the availability of capital in the financial sector. This is why we are going ahead with the restructuring of banks to ensure there is an adequate capital supply. This money should be available and channelled into this sector. We require a diverse financial sector different from what we have today. The other crucial aspect is digital inclusion. Digital inclusion is necessary to bridge the digital divide between the rich and the poor. How do we achieve that? These are the three main issues that we have to address immediately. There are other issues like the legal system and cyber security. Some can be addressed by the government, while others can be handled by the private sector. However, these three are the most critical areas: digital infrastructure, capital financing and addressing the digital divide. These are the initial areas the government will focus on in your digital initiative. I dont want to speak at length. I think I have been speaking too long on this subject and I am not a specialist. So I thank you for inviting me and wish you all the best in your deliberations.",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 07:56 am",
        "content": "A major project to plant 10 million trees was launched this morning (Oct. 14) in celebration of the 18th anniversary of Sri Lankas premium television channel TV Derana. The project, themed Magen Gasak Mavu Deranata (A tree for Mother Earth from Me), is carried out by Manusath Derana, the CSR arm of TV Derana. The live broadcast of the program commenced at 7:30 a.m. TV Derana, in celebration of its previous anniversaries, had implemented a number of CSR projects including One Million Trees project, the Little Hearts program, Derana Daruwo scholarship program and the Manusath Derana initiative to create awareness of and raise funds for those who are affected by kidney diseases. The massive tree-planting campaign One Million Trees project was set in motion under several phases in 2018 in celebration of the 13th anniversary of TV Derana. The project was completed on a successful note with the millionth tree being planted by Sindu the elephant at the Ridi Viharaya in Kurunegala on March 15, 2019. Now, as the second phase of this tree-planting campaign, TV Derana has kicked off the Ten Million Trees project countrywide. Marking the launch of the project, the chairman of Derana Media Network Dilith Jayaweera, joined by State Minister Sisira Jayakody, planted a tree near the Kadawatha Interchange of the Outer Circular Highway. Concurrently, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, much venerated Maha Sangha and other religious leaders, Sri Lanka Army and schoolchildren joined hands with TV Derana by planting trees. Wherever in the world you may be, as a Sri Lankan who loves the environment, you too can become a proud partner of this effort by sending us a photo of you planting a tree of your choice via WhatsApp on 0784 848484. On October 11, 2005, TV Derana stepped into the world of media with the promise of bringing innovative television to Sri Lankan viewers while staying true to its brand credo of protecting indigenous values while protecting our future. Confined to the Western Province back then, TV Derana today is a complete network consisting of FM Derana, Ada Derana Web and Manusath Derana. TV Derana has so far introduced many talents to the country via its reality shows Little Star, Derana Dream Star, Derana 60 Plus and Derana City of Dance. Not only did TV Derana produce many artists, but through Derana Music Video Awards and Derana Film Awards, it also recognized the contribution of such artists in the field of arts. TV Derana also hosts the Sri Lankan of the Year Awards to acknowledge personalities who have made an invaluable contribution to the country in various fields. A great many awards won by TV Deranas news brand Ada Derana also bear witness to the credibility of the news provided as well as the love showered upon it by the people in the country. Further, TV Deranas YouTube channel also made history recently by becoming the first and only TV channel in the country to reach 4 million subscribers, which is a testament how well the channel has been embraced by the countrys audiences. TV Deranas humanitarian arm Manusath Derana is known for the social service it provides to the people of the country when they need it the most.",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 08:44 am",
        "content": "President Wickremesinghe convened a meeting with Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) members at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday (Oct. 13). According to the Presidents Media Division (PMD), the primary focus of this meeting was to address the pressing issue of increasing research allowances for university lecturers and seeking exemption from taxation upon earning this allowance. Additionally, key issues concerning the future of Sri Lankas university system were discussed. The President has acknowledged the challenging economic conditions facing the nation and affirmed the governments commitment to promptly address these issues, providing relief to the public. Recognizing that the current allowances were insufficient to support the research efforts of the teaching staff, he stressed the importance of revising these allowances to promote quality research within Sri Lankas higher education institutions. The president has encouraged officials to explore the feasibility of issuing a new circular that would exempt the allowance from existing tax policies if necessary to rectify the situation. Hehe urged FUTA members to collaborate with the Education Ministry and the Attorney Generals office to find viable solutions and requested a comprehensive report within a three-week timeframe. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe revealed the governments intention to conduct a thorough study regarding the potential abolition of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and a comprehensive restructuring of the entire university system in Sri Lanka, aligning it with models employed by reputable international institutions such as Deakin University and the University of California systems to enhance the quality of higher education. The PMD said this move is expected to bring about substantial changes and improvements in Sri Lankas university system, promising a more competitive and globally recognized educational framework. The Presidents willingness to explore all available options was met with appreciation by FUTA representatives. The gathering included Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Presidents Senior Adviser on Economic Affairs R.H.S. Samaratunga, former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, President of the University Teachers Association Prof. Barana Jayawardana, Secretary of the Association Dr. Athulasiri Samarakoon and other prominent members.",

        "title": "Thousands of Palestinians flee northern Gaza as Israel prepares ground offensive",
        "date": "October 14, 2023 08:54 am",
        "content": "More than 1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza faced an Israeli deadline on Saturday to flee south, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had only just begun to retaliate for last weeks Hamas rampage across southern Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden said consultations were under way with regional governments on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as trapped Palestinians endured a power blackout and shortages of food and water amid fierce Israeli bombing. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas for the attack a week ago in which its fighters killed 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and seized scores of hostages. Israel has since put the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes. Gaza authorities say 1,900 people have died. More than one million residents of northern Gaza on Friday received 24 hours notice from Israel to flee south before an expected ground offensive. Hamas vowed to fight to the last drop of blood and told residents to stay. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said tank-backed troops had mounted raids to hit Palestinian rocket crews and gather information on the location of hostages, the first official account of ground troops in Gaza since the crisis began. We are striking our enemies with unprecedented might, Netanyahu said in a rare statement televised on Friday after the Jewish Sabbath began. I emphasise that this is only the beginning. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were estimated to have headed south from northern Gaza following the Israeli order, according to the United Nations, which said more than 400,000 Palestinians had been internally displaced due to hostilities prior to the directive. Many others, however, said they would stay. Death is better than leaving, said Mohammad, 20, outside a building smashed by an Israeli air strike near the centre of Gaza. Mosques broadcast the message: Hold on to your homes. Hold on to your land. The United Nations and other organisations warned of a disaster if so many people were forced to flee, and said the siege should be lifted to let in aid. We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need. Even wars have rules, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Friday. Biden, in a speech at a Philadelphia shipping terminal, said addressing the humanitarian crisis was a top priority. U.S. teams in the region, he said, were working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan, other Arab governments and the United Nations. The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas appalling attacks, he said. And theyre suffering as a result as well. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it was impossible for Gazans to heed Israels order to move south without devastating humanitarian consequences, prompting a rebuke from Israel that the U.N. should condemn Hamas and support Israels right to self-defence. The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated war zone in less than 24 hours? U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths wrote on social media. DISTANCE YOURSELVES FROM HAMAS Mahmoud Abbas, president of Hamas rival Palestinian Authority, told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan that the forced displacement would constitute a repeat of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from what is now Israel. Most Gazans are descendants of such refugees. Gaza is one of the most crowded places on earth, and for now there is no way out. In addition to Israels blockade, Egypt has resisted calls to open its border with Gaza. U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday met Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Austin said military aid was flowing into Israel but that this was the time for resolve and not revenge. The path will be long, but ultimately I promise you we will win, Gallant said. Blinken met King Abdullah in Jordan on Friday as well as Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. Blinken later flew to Qatar, a U.S. ally with influence among Islamist groups. In the West Bank, demonstrators supporting Gaza fought gun battles with Israeli security forces. Palestinian officials said 16 people were shot dead. There have also been fears of hostilities spreading, including to Israels northern border with Lebanon, where clashes this week have already been the deadliest since 2006. Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah was killed on Friday while working in southern Lebanon by missiles fired from the direction of Israel, according to another Reuters videographer on the scene. Six other journalists were injured. Lebanese Prime Minister Najob Mikati and a Hezbollah lawmaker blamed the incident on Israel. Israels U.N. envoy said it would investigate what had happened in the area following the journalists death. We always try to mitigate and avoid civilian casualties. Obviously, we would never want to hit or kill or shoot any journalist that is doing its job, Gilad Erdan said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 10:26 am",
        "content": "The Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders of Sri Lanka says it has taken note of the progress Sri Lanka has made with its official sector creditors towards reaching an agreement in principle on a debt treatment within the framework of its IMF Programme. Consistent with the Groups February 3, 2023 statement of financing assurances, and in line with the objectives which have been expressed by official and private sector participants in the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable to facilitate more efficient and equitable sovereign debt restructuring processes, the Group says it remains committed to working with the Sri Lankan authorities as quickly as possible to find a sustainable solution to Sri Lankas debt challenges as they relate to its international bond debt. To that end, the Group, acting through its Steering Committee, recently proactively submitted its own restructuring proposal relating to Sri Lankas outstanding international bonds. The proposal, which provides upfront debt relief, includes a menu of new securities that would be offered to the holders of the existing bonds, including a Macro-Linked Bond (MLB). The MLB is an innovative new instrument that is designed to be liquid and index-eligible and whose payouts are linked to the evolution of Sri Lankas gross domestic product, the statement said. This design seeks to ensure both that the instrument is acceptable to bond market participants and that its cash flows will at all times comply with the Debt Sustainability Analysis targets embedded in Sri Lankas IMF Programme in a range of future macroeconomic scenarios, it said. The Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders of Sri Lanka believes that its proposal, including the MLB, will contribute to restoring Sri Lankas debt sustainability and, at the same time, will command broad support from existing holders of Sri Lankas international bonds. The Group is advised by Rothschild  Co and White  Case LLP, as financial and legal advisors, respectively.",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 11:43 am",
        "content": "Maligakanda Magistrates Court has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the officials who were responsible for importing and distributing substandard antibodies using forged documents and distributing them to state hospitals. Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama had further directed the CID officers to produce the suspects before the court before November 16. The order was delivered when a complaint filed by Purwesi Balaya and other civil organizations before the CID was taken up before the court on Friday (Oct. 13). Earlier this month, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) had said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure was suspended from use. In a media release, NMRA chairman Prof. S. D. Jayaratne had said forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which later failed the quality tests. The product, manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. The NMRA had said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients under treatment at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. As doubts were cast about the quality of the drug, the NMRA had received several reports that sounded the alarm. It was uncovered that the relevant vials containing human IVIG, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, had not been registered with the NMRA prior to being imported. Additionally, it had been observed that not only the due procedure had not been followed when the batch of vials was brought into the country, but the Waiver of Registration (WOR) was also not obtained. The NMRA has found that the document submitted as the WOR had been forged using NMRA letterhead and the signature of a senior official. When contacted, the India-based manufacturer has told the NMRA that it no longer produces this drug. The medicines regulator asserted that this drug had been imported and used in the country without its approval. On Wednesday (Oct. 12), it was revealed that measures were taken to suspend and cancel all medicine supplying orders given to Isolez Biotech Pharma, as per a directive from Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Sir Michael Caine has confirmed he has retired from acting, following the release of his latest film. The 90-year-old screen legend stars in The Great Escaper opposite Glenda Jackson, who completed the film months before her death in June. Sir Michael has previously indicated his intention to retire but has often been tempted back. But he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I keep saying Im going to retire. Well I am now. He added: Ive figured, Ive had a picture where Ive played the lead and had incredible reviews... What am I going to do that will beat this? The Great Escaper sees Sir Michael portray Bernie Jordan, a real-life World War Two veteran who made headlines in 2014 when he escaped from his care home to attend D-Day anniversary celebrations in France. The Guardians review said Sir Michael delivers a gruffly heart-breaking performance in the film, while the Radio Times added he plays his role with complete dignity. But Sir Michael said the likelihood of fewer parts being offered to him in old age has ultimately prompted his decision to retire. The only parts Im liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85, he joked to presenter Martha Kearney. Theyre not going to be the lead. You dont have leading men at 90, youre going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this. The star acknowledged he turned down his last film three times before finally saying yes, because he already considered himself retired. Sir Michael, whose credits include Harry Brown, Educating Rita, The Italian Job and Hannah and Her Sisters, recalled a particular role he considered after working on The Great Escaper. I was sent a script actually, and I looked at it, and then I did something Ive never done before. I counted how many pages I had, compared to the number of pages in the script, he explained. And it was 15 pages of dialogue in a script which was 99 pages. And I thought, I think that counts as a small part, Im not doing it. So I retired. He added: I thought, Im ahead here, I may do a little part and get a bad review... so I thought, why not leave now? So Ive left. Sir Michael and Jackson, who was also a Labour MP for many years, previously worked together nearly five decades ago, on the 1975 film The Romantic Englishwoman. But, he explained, the pair did not socialise outside of working together due to being of different political persuasions. She is a very left-wing politician, Sir Michael said. And shed like me, but she wouldnt want to mix with me socially. Because I was obviously wealthy and everything, and not a spitting socialist. He did, however, note that he had voted for former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who was in office for a decade from 1997. I voted for Tony Blair, because after all Im working class, and I thought hell get something done for the working class, Sir Michael said. The actor is also due to publish a novel next month, a thriller titled Deadly Game. Asked how he is finding old age, he replied: Im still grabbing every second even though Im 90.

        "content": "Nearly four decades after India and Sri Lanka stopped a passenger ferry service, a high-speed passenger ferry service was launched on Saturday (14 Oct.), once again connecting the two neighbouring countries. Accordingly, the Cheriyapani ferry service links Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu with Kankesanthurai in the northern province of Sri Lanka. At 08:15 a.m. on Saturday, Cheriyapani departed Nagapattinam port towards Kankesanthurai with 50 passengers and 12 crew members under Captain Biju George. The ferry reached Kankesanthurai at 12:30 p.m. this afternoon, and headed back to Nagapattinam at 02:00 p.m. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed gratitude after the passenger ferry service was resumed. In a video address, he said, We are embarking on a new chapter in the diplomatic and economic relations between India and Sri Lanka. The launch of a ferry service between Nagapattinam and Kankesanturai is an important milestone in strengthening our relations. The ferry service initially planned to commence on 10 October, underwent some administrative issues and had to be rescheduled for 12 October and later 14 October. The project, under the India-Sri Lanka Joint Committee, is aimed at revitalising regional trade and tourism and fostering stronger people-to-people relations. The initiative renews historical sea ties that existed between the two countries since the early 1900s. Decades ago, the Indo-Ceylon Express that operated between the port city of Thoothukudi and Colombo through Chennai stopped operating after the Sri Lankan civil war in 1982. The reintroduction of ferry services comes two years after the two countries signed a passenger transportation Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).",

        "content": "Australia on Saturday decisively rejected a proposal to recognise Indigenous people in the constitution, in a major setback to the countrys efforts for reconciliation with its First Peoples. Nationwide, with 45 of the vote counted, the No vote led Yes by 57.35 to 42.65. Australian broadcaster ABC and other TV networks have projected that at least four states - New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia - would vote against altering the 122-year-old constitution. A successful referendum requires at least four of the six states to vote in favour, along with a national majority. Because of Australias time zones, voting in Western Australia was still under way as it became clear the referendum was lost. Australians had to write Yes or No on a ballot paper that asked whether they agree to the proposal, which would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people through the creation of an Indigenous advisory body, the Voice to Parliament. Im devastated, Indigenous leader and prominent Yes campaigner Thomas Mayo said on ABC News. We need a Voice. We need that structural change. Australias Indigenous citizens, who make up 3.8 of the countrys 26 million population, have inhabited the land for about 60,000 years but are not mentioned in the constitution and are, by most socio-economic measures, the most disadvantaged people in the country. Academics and human rights advocates fear a win for the No camp could set back reconciliation efforts by years. The Voice to Parliament was proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a 2017 document crafted by Indigenous leaders that set out a roadmap for reconciliation with wider Australia. Supporters of the proposal believe entrenching an Indigenous Voice into the constitution would unite Australia and usher in a new era with its Indigenous people. Many Indigenous people favour the change, but some say it is a distraction from achieving practical and positive outcomes. The political opposition has criticised the measure, saying it is divisive, would be ineffective, and would slow government decision-making. Setback for Albanese Referendums are difficult to pass in Australia, with only eight of 44 succeeding since the countrys founding in 1901. This is the first referendum in Australia in almost a quarter of a century. Australian voters rejected a 1999 proposal to become a republic. In 1967, a referendum to count Indigenous people as part of the Australian population was a resounding success with bipartisan political support. The 2023 referendum has not garnered unified political support, with leaders of the major conservative parties campaigning for a No vote. The problem that the Yes campaign had was they went and spoke to the leadership, the elites of this community, and they kept on saying: Weve got these communities, said Warren Mundine, a leader of the No campaign across the country. The Voice has been a key feature of Prime Minister Anthony Albaneses term in office, and a referendum loss would stand out, political analysts say, as his biggest setback since coming to power in May last year. The task ahead for us is to come together and chart a new path forward, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. I dont know yet what that would be but its something that we can do as a country.

        "title": "Israel announces 6-hour window for Gazans fleeing south, as troops gather near border",
        "date": "October 14, 2023 04:26 pm",
        "content": "Israels military has announced a six-hour window for Palestinians to flee south along specified streets within Gaza, as tens of thousands flee their homes following a stark evacuation order ahead of a possible Israeli ground assault. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned more than 1 million residents in northern Gaza to evacuate on Friday, as it massed troops and military equipment at the border, and continued bombarding the territory with relentless airstrikes in response to the deadly October 7 attacks by Islamist militant group Hamas. Even before the warning, more than 400,000 Palestinians had already been internally displaced by the past week of fighting as conditions worsen inside the bombarded strip. But the evacuation order and the prospect of a potential incursion have been sharply criticized by rights groups, including the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) head, who warned that such a move could bring catastrophic humanitarian consequences. The IDF announced on Saturday it would allow people to move south for their own safety on specified streets of Gaza from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time, according to a statement shared by the IDFs Arabic spokesperson Avishay Adraee on X, formerly known as Twitter. The IDF claimed Hamas leaders had already taken measures to protect themselves from strikes in the area. It is unclear how widely the messaging has been received on the ground given the current electricity and internet blackout. When asked by CNN how this six-hour window has been communicated to citizens in Gaza, IDF spokesperson Maj. Doron Spielman said that everybody in Gaza City now knows exactly whats happening. Theyve been notified in Arabic, in multiple languages on every available platform, both electronic and non-electronic platforms. Everyone in Gaza City knows that they need to go past Wadi Gaza. Spielman confirmed the IDF had dropped leaflets informing people in Gaza about the IDFs announcement. However, CNN has talked to a United Nations Relief and Works Agency school official, a paramedic and a journalist on the ground who were all unaware of this latest advisory on Saturday. More than 2 million Palestinians  including over a million children  live in the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Images from Gaza have shown a mass rush toward the south of the coastal enclave beginning Friday. Civilians crammed into cars, taxis, pickup trucks and even donkey-pulled carts; roads were filled with snaking lines of vehicles strapped with suitcases and mattresses. Those without other options walked, carrying what they could. Some have stayed put regardless, telling CNN they felt nowhere was safe. Since the evacuation order was issued Friday, Israeli military airstrikes have killed 70 evacuees and injured 200 more, Hamas media office told CNN on Saturday. Saturday morning marked one week since Hamas unprecedented and bloody attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,300 people and led to the capture of civilian and military hostages now believed to be held in Gaza. The surprise attack, widely described as Israels 911, saw waves of heavily armed Hamas fighters rampage through rural Israeli towns, kibbutzim and army bases. In response, Israel ordered a complete siege of Gaza, including blocking food, water and fuel, while mounting its heaviest ever airstrikes on the enclave. International observers warn the cutoff will see Gaza civilians die by starvation, disease and lack of medical care for the growing numbers of dying and wounded. At least 2,215 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza from Israeli strikes, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said in an update Saturday. That toll includes 724 children. An overwhelmed hospital in Gaza has resorted to using ice cream trucks from local factories as makeshift morgues to supplement the overflowing hospital mortuaries. Dr. Yasser Khatab, a forensic pathologist in al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, said in a video message sent to CNN on Saturday that the Martyrs hospital in Deir AlBalah is unable to accommodate the increasing number of deceased. Israel has been massing hundreds of thousands of troops and military equipment at the border while it ramps up its siege of Gaza. However, its not clear what kind of operation the IDF is preparing for, or when it may take place. UN officials were initially told by Israel on Thursday the relocation of Gaza residents should happen within 24 hours. But Israel has since acknowledged that the mass migration order will take time, and IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said Friday that any deadline may slip, adding to the uncertainty swirling. Another IDF spokesperson, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, claimed on Saturday that Hamas was trying to stop Palestinian civilians from evacuating via messages and also checkpoints and stops on the ground, citing media reports. When asked by CNN whether the evacuation order suggested an impending ground incursion, Conricus said the IDF would assess the situation on the ground and see how many civilians are left in the area  Once we see that the situation will be permissible for significant combat operations, then they will commence. The IDF also said Saturday that its fighter jets had struck operational headquarters used by Hamas militants, killing the head of the Hamas Aerial System in Gaza City, who the military claimed was largely responsible for directing terrorists during last weeks attack on Israel. The IDFs order has raised international alarm and sharp criticism from some rights groups, especially as critical supplies run out and deaths rise in the isolated enclave, from which residents say they have no escape. The order to evacuate 1.1 million people from northern Gaza defies the rules of war and basic humanity, wrote OCHA head Martin Griffiths in a statement late Friday. Roads and homes (in Gaza) have been reduced to rubble. There is nowhere safe to go. Forcing scared and traumatized civilians, including women and children, to move from one densely populated area to another, without even a pause in the fighting and without humanitarian support, is dangerous and outrageous, he added, warning it would bring catastrophic humanitarian consequences. The territory has been under a land, sea and air blockade enforced by Israel since 2007, with more than half its residents living under the poverty line even before the latest conflict. Now theres only one corridor left for Palestinians to flee or for aid to enter, connecting Gaza to Egypt  and its not clear if thats even operational. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme said it distributed food to 135,000 people in shelters across Gaza on Friday, but warned humanitarian supplies are running low. OCHA added that most people now have no access to water in the strip. As a last resort, people are consuming brackish water from agricultural wells, triggering serious concerns about the spread of waterborne diseases, it said. In response, Israels ambassador to the UN said on Friday the government is doing all that we can to minimize civilian casualties by issuing the evacuation order, and accused the UN of not wanting Israel to defend itself.

        "date": "October 14, 2023 07:35 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering a speech addressing the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel, has emphasized the importance of the current situation and its potential impact on the global order. He made these remarks at the dinner hosted by the Geopolitical Cartographer, an international research foundation specializing in the Indian Ocean, under the theme Emerging New Order in the Indian Ocean Region at the Colombo City Center on Friday (Oct. 13), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. President Wickremesinghe has commenced his address by discussing how the conflict had unfolded, with Hamas attacking Israel, and the worlds initial sympathies with Israel, including Sri Lanka, which traditionally supported Palestine. He has highlighted the recent developments, including Israels call for over a million people in Gaza to move to the south, drawing condemnation from various countries and organizations, according to the PMD. There were those who felt, probably in most of the Middle East, other Muslim countries, that Israel should be condemned. And others said, no, Israel has suffered, lets see what this means. The bombing is over now. In the meantime, Secretary of State Blinken went in there. America has announced its stand. Now we find that Israel has announced over a million people in Gaza from North Gaza have to move to the South. Now this in turn has drawn condemnations not only from the UN, from the African countries and even from some of the European countries. The President has speculated about the motivations behind Israels actions, suggesting that the bombing of Gaza aimed to eliminate tunnels where Hamas was hiding. He pondered the potential consequences if Israel found that Hamas had been responsible for a massacre, leading to an even greater crisis, the PMD said. So what happens next? If the people of Gaza have been asked to move out, it means Israel will move in. Why had the people of Gaza been moved out? Why was Gaza bombed? I mean it was done with a purpose. I dont think Israel just went on a rampage. They thought that bombing Gaza, the buildings, and bringing them down was the first stage of cleaning out the tunnels in which Hamas was hiding. So if they go in and find Hamas and they fight, is one issue. What happens if they go in and find that the Hamas do this? Its brutal murder. I mean its a massacre, its something more than that. President Wickremesinghe has expressed concerns about the global geopolitical implications of the conflict, particularly the challenges for the United States in managing multiple international issues simultaneously. He questioned whether the US could handle crises in Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Middle East concurrently. He also noted the changing power dynamics and alliances, suggesting that the world was transitioning from a unipolar or bipolar order to a more complex multipolar system. Can the US manage Ukraine, Taiwan and the Middle East, Gaza? I dont think. If you are going to have two aircraft carrier groups in the Mediterranean, thats serious. Can you manage it? Its going to be difficult because many issues are going rise. The President stressed the need for dialogue and cooperation among nations to address these challenges. He cited the strained relationships among global powers and emphasized that the international community must work together to maintain a stable geopolitical system. He expressed hope that extreme reactions from different parts of the world should not dominate the discourse and that alternative solutions should be explored, including the possibility of a four-state solution involving Israel, Palestine, Gaza, and Lebanon. Its not that I support Hamas or Hezbollah, I dont. But we must see where it goes from here. I do not think Israel and the US can get together. What we have is Israel functioning independently, Gaza that is destroyed and you have Palestine that is half functioning, and Lebanon that is also half functioning. If you are going for a solution, it has to be four states in it. Not two. You also have to think of Syria. So going along the old route we wont find solutions, we have to think anew. In conclusion, President Wickremesinghe urged a fresh approach to solving the conflict, emphasizing that the old ways of addressing the situation may not yield the necessary solutions.",

        "date": "October 14, 2023 09:05 pm",
        "content": "Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has commended the progress Sri Lanka has made thus far with regard to the resolutions under their agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Speaking at the IMF  World Bank meet on Indias Group of 20 (G20) presidency, particularly in response to a question raised regarding the concerns pertaining to the G20 common framework for debt restructuring and claims that progress made under this framework is too slow, Sitharaman explained that albeit Sri Lanka having been categorised as a middle-income country, it was later on the verge of being graded a low-income country when the economic crisis came about, and thus, it could not be addressed by the common framework. The crisis could not be addressed by the common framework because it was a middle-income country, it couldnt qualify to be addressed within the common framework it was outside, she explained. The Finance Minister noted, however, that when compared to many other countries the speed with which Sri Lanka is getting its resolutions through the IMF is very good, and  speedy compared to the common framework. Speaking further in this regard, Sitharaman noted that today, many financial institutions, including the IMF, have realized the need for such processes to be speedier. Emphasisng the value of Sri Lankas progress with regards to the IMF agreement and its resolutions, Sitharaman highlighted that the very formation of the creditor committee through a sovereign debt roundtable, which the IMF established together with the World Bank under the India presidency to address the issue of Sri Lankas debt crisis, is one that is likely to be used as a template for any other country in the future. Albeit agreeing to the fact that the process, could, in fact, be speedier, Sitharaman said It is moving as per the formula and speedily, it can be speedier, thats a different story, but the fact is at the moment it is very speedily.",

        "title": "New Zealand elects conservative Christopher Luxon as premier after 6 years of liberal rule",
        "date": "October 14, 2023 10:59 pm",
        "content": "Conservative former businessman Christopher Luxon will be New Zealands next prime minister after winning a decisive election victory Saturday. People voted for change after six years of a liberal government led for most of that time by Jacinda Ardern. The exact makeup of Luxons government is still to be determined as ballots continued to be counted. Luxon arrived to rapturous applause at an event in Auckland. He was joined on stage by his wife, Amanda, and their children, William and Olivia. He said he was humbled by the victory and couldnt wait to get stuck in to his new job. He thanked people from across the country. You have reached for hope and you have voted for change, he said. Supporters chanted his campaign slogan which promised to get the country back on track. Outgoing Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, who spent just nine months in the top job after taking over from Ardern in January, told supporters late Saturday he had called Luxon to concede. Hipkins said it wasnt the result he wanted. But I want you to be proud of what we achieved over the last six years, he told supporters at an event in Wellington. Ardern unexpectedly stepped down as prime minister in January, saying she no longer had enough in the tank to do the job justice. She won the last election in a landslide, but her popularity waned as people got tired of COVID-19 restrictions and inflation threatened the economy. Her departure left Hipkins, 45, to take over as leader. He had previously served as education minister and led the response to the coronavirus pandemic. With most of the vote counted, Luxons National Party had about 40 of the vote. Under New Zealands proportional voting system, Luxon, 53, is expected to form an alliance with the libertarian ACT Party. Meanwhile, the Labour Party that Hipkins leads was getting only a little over 25 of the vote  about half the proportion it got in the last election under Ardern. And in a result that would be particularly stinging for Labour should it lose the seat, National was in a tight race for Arderns old electorate seat, Mount Albert. The seat has long been a Labour stronghold and was also held by another former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark. The National Party candidate for the seat, Melissa Lee, told The Associated Press she was feeling excited but also nervous about the final result in Mount Albert. Its been Labour since 1946. It has been the biggest, safest Labour seat forever, she said. It would be fantastic if we won it. Lee said that when she was door-knocking, people had told her they were tired of the current government and were concerned with the state of the economy and the spiraling cost of living. David Farrar, a longtime conservative pollster, said there was still a good chance that Labour would end up holding the seat once all the votes were counted. However, he said, his initial impression of voting throughout the country was that it was turning out to be a bloodbath for the left. Luxon has promised tax cuts for middle-income earners and a crackdown on crime. Hipkins had promised free dental care for people younger than 30 and the removal of sales taxes on fruit and vegetables. Also at stake in the election is the governments relationship with Indigenous MƒÅori. Luxon has promised to axe the MƒÅori Health Authority, which he says creates two separate health systems. Hipkins says hes proud of such co-governance efforts and has accused Luxon of condoning racism. Within days of taking the reins in January, Hipkins found himself dealing with a crisis after deadly floods and then a cyclone hit New Zealand. He quickly jettisoned some of Arderns more contentious policies and promised a back to basics approach focused on tackling the spiraling cost of living. Warm spring weather in the largest city, Auckland, seemed to encourage voters, with queues forming outside some polling places. Early voting before Election Day was lower than in recent elections. During a six-week election campaign, both Hipkins and Luxon traveled the country and hammed it up for the cameras Earlier in the week, Luxon, who served as chief executive of both Unilever Canada and Air New Zealand, told an energized crowd in Wellington that he would crack down on gangs. Ive gotta tell you, crime is out of control in this country, Luxon said. And we are going to restore law and order, and we are going to restore personal responsibility. Luxon also got cheers when he promised to fix the capitals gridlocked traffic with a new tunnel project. Luxon is relatively new to politics but held his own against the more experienced Hipkins during televised debates, according to political observers. But Luxon also made some gaffes, such as when he was asked in a 1News debate how much he spent each week on food. His answer of about sixty bucks (U.S. 36) was ridiculed on social media as showing he was out of touch with the cost of living. Source - AP News - Agencies",

However, when the police officers went to the Avissawella area today (15) along with the suspect in search of evidence related to the case based on the statements made by the suspect, he had attempted to escape. The suspect had reportedly tried to strangle one of the police officers by using the handcuffs placed on his hands, however, the other police officers had tried to prevent it, whereupon the suspect was critically injured. The suspect, who sustained critical injuries during the incident, was subsequently taken to the Avissawella Hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon admission, Ada Derana reporter said. The police officer who was injured during the incident is also in critical condition, according to hospital sources. In the late hours of September 20, two assailants on a motorcycle had opened fire at four individuals travelling in a three-wheeler, killing two people and critically injuring the other two, in Thalduwa. Four persons were travelling in a three-wheeler from Avissawella towards Kegalle when they were targeted by the two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle near the Gurupasgoda Bend in Ihala Thalduwa area in the Avissawella police division. The assailants had reportedly used a T-56 assault rifle in the shooting before immediately fleeing the scene of the crime. The four victims were rushed to the Avissawella Hospital, however, two of them, a 27-year-old and a 36-year-old, had succumbed to injuries.",

        "date": "October 15, 2023 12:06 pm",
        "content": "A new earthquake has hit western Afghanistan - several days after two large tremors in the region killed more than 1,000 people. The US Geological Survey (USGS) says the magnitude 6.3 quake struck near the city of Herat. It was at a depth of 6.3km (four miles). So far there have been no reports of any casualties. More than 90 of those who died in the earlier quakes were women and children, the UNs children agency UNICEF said. In its report, the USGS said the epicentre of the latest tremor was 30km north-west of Herat, Afghanistans third-largest city close to the Iranian border. Last Saturdays earthquake hit Zindajan, a rural district some 40km from Herat. The tremor saw entire houses, which were too fragile to withstand the quake, reduced to rubble. Villagers used shovels and bare hands to search for missing people. Afghanistan has been reeling from an economic crisis since the Taliban takeover in 2021, when aid given directly to the government was stopped. The country is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, as it lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. In June last year, the province of Paktika was hit by a 5.9 magnitude quake which killed more than 1,000 people and left tens of thousands homeless. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The government has reportedly drawn attention to protecting the existing fuel stocks in the country due to the uncertainty of fuel supplies in the world market as a result of the escalating war situation in Gaza. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also issued directives pertaining to the matter recently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) said, mentioning that it has been focusing on a better management system of currently prevailing fuel stocks in the country. In the meantime, the Ministry of Power and Energy and the CEYPETCO have initiated discussions regarding future course of actions for protecting the currently available fuel stocks within the country, after a period of two months. These discussions are reportedly focused on deciding whether the previous QR code system will be re-launched or another managed supply system will be implemented if a fuel crisis arises again. However, although no issues have currently arisen regarding the fuel stocks, the government has instructed the relevant authorities to prepare a plan in case of any crisis in the near future. CEYPETCO further emphasized that since SINOPEC is also successfully carrying out retail operations in Sri Lanka, it will be able to maintain the fuel supply without any crisis in the future. Nevertheless, if any crisis situation is created due to the impact of current global situation, the relevant fuel management methods will be announced after prior notification, according to the CEYPETCO.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka urges China to share debt terms to help other deals - Report",
        "date": "October 15, 2023 02:46 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is urging China to share with other creditors the terms of its recent 4.2 billion bilateral debt deal, a step needed to help the bankrupt nation speed up the process of restoring its finances more than a year after it defaulted. Sharing the information would ensure transparency and assure other bilateral creditors that theyre getting a comparable deal, Nandalal Weerasinghe, the countrys central bank governor, said on a panel Friday. The request from Sri Lanka comes as it seeks to finalize a deal with its official creditor committee, co-led by Japan, India and the Paris Club, an informal and influential group of Western lenders. The South Asia nation defaulted in May 2022 and owes more than 12 billion in overseas bonds, according to the governments quarterly debt bulletin. Sri Lankas debt restructuring is among a few test cases of the IMF-led efforts to develop new guidelines among rich and poor countries to manage defaults. Thats mainly driven by Chinas limited experience restructuring distressed loans after its rise over the past decade to become the biggest bilateral lender to emerging markets, as well as a bigger role played by private creditors. Sri Lanka is asking China to share the deal terms with all other creditors as soon as possible to make it more transparent and ensure comparability so that we can make progress, Weerasinghe said. Because this is a bilateral agreement, obviously, we need to have a consensus from the other party to share that information. Private creditors are seeking a separate deal. An ad hoc group of bondholders, organized by advisers including Rothschild  Co., recently submitted a proposal to Sri Lanka that includes taking a 20 haircut and issuance of new debt, including a so-called macro-linked bond. Incorporating China, along with other rising bilateral creditors such as India and Saudi Arabia, into the established order of the Paris Club has been a lengthy process and a main focus of the International Monetary Funds annual meetings this week in Morocco. Beijing made an unexpected announcement earlier this week of a deal between Sri Lanka and the Export-Import Bank of China, which has increased confusion over the process. The IMF and other creditors also werent aware of the development, and Weeransinghe on Friday said that the announcement was a bit of a surprise to the Sri Lanka government as well. The issue will likely be in focus next week when Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe travels to China to participate in the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. About 40 of its bilateral debt is owed to China and 16 to India, according to estimates from the IMF. Separately, the IMF is assessing Sri Lankas progress toward meeting economic and reform targets under the nations 3 billion bailout package. A staff-level agreement is the first step needed in order for a second tranche of 334 million in loans. Sri Lanka and the IMF are close to reaching such a staff-level agreement following talks in Morocco this week, according to people involved in the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the matter isnt finalized yet. Only a few outstanding issues remain, one person said, declining to provide more detail. Source  Bloomberg --Agencies",

In an exclusive interview with Chinese state-run TV news channel CGTN, the Head of the State mentioned that it is beneficial for both Sri Lanka and Asia as it offers development opportunities. Indeed, if we could join the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), we would have access to the worlds largest market. We once hoped to establish the South Asian Free Trade Area, but it failed to materialize, he said. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe emphasized that joining the RCEP is feasible for Sri Lanka, because the island nation has close ties with RCEP members. Sri Lanka shares deep cultural ties with not only China but also Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, the President said, adding that to further expand cooperation with China, Japan, South Korea and Australia, we need to strengthen our economic competitiveness. We are willing to work towards this end, because joining the RCEP would mean competing in the global market as China did. We hope to explore markets and attract investment in more regions, Wickremesinghe added. Meanwhile, the President, who expressed that in fact, Sri Lankas trade policies have been established gradually over the past 20 to 25 years whereby the country has removed many barriers to trade with other countries, highlighted that the island nation is benefiting from the fact that free trade has made it easier for the international movement of goods and the flow of capital. Its beneficial for both Sri Lanka and Asia as it offers development opportunities. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe stated that if anyone wants to end this model now, it should be done through consultation with all parties involved rather than being dictated by the West. Even in the U.S. and Europe, there are voices against this. The President also pointed out Sri Lanka position is that the World Trade Organization (WTO) should make the decision, adding that if adjustments are made, they should be reached through joint consultation. Its wrong to take unilateral actions, Wickremesinghe said.",

In a petition sent to the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, Santhan said he was now lodged in the Tiruchi special camp where foreign nationals facing criminal charges or having no valid documents are kept. Since he could not meet his mother during his 32 years of incarceration, in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, he appealed to the president to allow him to visit Sri Lanka and take care of his mother. Petitions for renewal of his national identity card and passport were pending with the High Commission, he said. While A.G.

Cabinets resolution The Tamil Nadu Cabinet passed a resolution in September 2018, recommending the release of the seven life convicts; but the Governor, instead of taking a decision, referred the matter to the Centre. Finally, the Supreme Court exercised extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and ordered the release of the life convicts. Robert Payas and Jeyakumar, also Sri Lankan nationals who have been kept in the Tiruchi special camp, have decided not to return to their home country, fearing a threat to their life.

        "date": "October 15, 2023 09:14 pm",
        "content": "In a pioneering move to bolster the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector in Sri Lanka, the apex body of the ICT industry, FITIS, has unveiled the DigiGo Digital Playbook for SMEs, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The launch event took place at a press conference recently at the Presidents Media Centre, (PMC). Organized by the FITIS Digital Services Chapter, in collaboration with LKDomain Registry and under the patronage of the Ministry of Industries  Plantation Industries, as well as the Ministry of Technology, DigiGo aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for SMEs seeking affordable local digital services, guiding them on their journey towards digital transformation. Addressing the gathering State Minister of Technology, Kanaka Herath, emphasized the pivotal role of technology in propelling the growth of the SME sector. He underscored how technology can provide solutions to the common challenges faced by SMEs, including accessing seed capital, expanding into new markets, overcoming resource constraints and addressing logistical issues. He also expressed his enthusiasm for collaborating with FITIS to launch the DigiGo initiative, which he believes will significantly enhance the SME sector in the country, the PMD said in a statement. Furthermore, the Minister highlighted that the government has initiated the Digicon 2030 program, with the primary objective of formulating a national digital economic policy for the year 2030. This initiative was a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Technology, the industry and with the support of the World Bank (WB). The resulting document was officially presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Notably, SMEs have been identified as one of the six key pillars in shaping the digital economy strategy. This underscores the importance of supporting SMEs in achieving the objectives of the digital economic strategy, it said. The State Minister of Technology, acknowledged the prevalent challenge of limited digital education among SMEs, especially those outside major urban centres like Colombo and Kandy. In response, DigiGo will serve as a guiding resource, enabling SMEs to explore available digital platforms and fully embrace the advantages of going digital. The program plans to host quarterly DigiGo events in all 25 districts by 2030, ensuring the widespread dissemination of digital knowledge. With the recent launch of DigiGo, Minister Herath emphasized its role in promoting awareness about digital transformation and the benefits it offers to all SMEs in Sri Lanka. The DigiGo digital playbook, unveiled during the launch, serves as a unique platform showcasing a wide array of available digital services, creating opportunities for business growth and expansion in the digital sphere. The inaugural event, scheduled to commence on October 20th in Galle, is planned to expand its reach to all 25 districts through collaboration with local business communities. FITIS, in partnership with the Ministry of Technology and various public and private stakeholders, will facilitate these sessions, aimed at empowering SMEs to embrace the digital era and unlock their full potential. In a significant development, Ms. Chio Kenda, the World Bank Country Manager for Maldives and Sri Lanka, unveiled the DigiGo Innovate Digitally to Succeed initiative during her speech. She underscored the potential for digital development to address both global and local challenges, emphasizing its role in job creation, market expansion and the enhancement of access to finance. As Sri Lanka navigates its way out of an economic crisis and sets forth on the path to recovery, the strategic development and implementation of a national business strategy by 2030 are deemed crucial steps, the statement added. On a global scale, the digital economy presents substantial opportunities for SMEs to make significant contributions to national incomes. In the year 2023, business-to-consumer e-commerce recorded sales of nearly US 6 trillion. With over 1.7 million SMEs propelling economic growth in Sri Lanka and driving employment, they collectively represent approximately 90 of all businesses in the country. They are responsible for providing 45 of the nations employment opportunities and contribute to almost half of the countrys GDP. However, SMEs, whether on a global scale or in the Sri Lankan context, face distinctive challenges when it comes to embracing digital transformation. These challenges include constraints related to limited resources, knowledge and digital expertise. Such limitations hinder the potential for business growth, innovation and the attainment of economic and social inclusivity. To address these common challenges, the Digital Goal Programme has been established as a collaborative endeavour, featuring active participation from the private sector, government and local stakeholders, with the essential support of relevant partners. In her address, it was disclosed that the World Bank takes pride in its role as a knowledge partner in this digital program and applauds the central focus on decentralizing SMEs within the upcoming national digital strategy. The institution has committed to providing on-going technical support to both the government and the private sector as they collaborate to shape the 2030 strategy for a digital Sri Lanka. These collaborative efforts are aimed at boosting economic competitiveness, fostering skills development and ultimately facilitating the creation of higher-paying jobs within the country. The inaugural DigiGo event, which is regionally planned, is scheduled to take place on October 20th in Galle, under the guidance of Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, Minister of Industries  Plantation Industries, and Kanaka Herath, State Minister of Technology. The World Banks support for this event underscores its commitment to advancing Sri Lankas digital transformation in alignment with the nations digital economy strategy. Mr. Indika De Zoysa, Chairman of FITIS, unveiled the ground-breaking DigiGo initiative, highlighting the myriad opportunities it offers through digital technologies. DigiGo, from data analytics to e-commerce, aims to provide SMEs with a platform for knowledge sharing, featuring insights from industry experts and thought leaders on emerging trends, best practices and strategies driving digital innovation. SMEs, which contribute 52 to Sri Lankas GDP and represent over 75 of businesses, have long been the backbone of the economy, offering 45 of employment and contributing 20 to exports, as per the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Acknowledging their pivotal role in the nations economic revival, the government has designated them as a key pillar in the Digital Economy Strategy 2030. DigiGo is poised to propel Sri Lankas digital economy by bridging the technology-business gap, fostering a thriving digital ecosystem, with a special focus on the 1 million SMEs across the island. The event was attended by Professor Gihan Dias, a founder member of DigiGo, Omar Sahib, President of the FITIS Digital Services Chapter, Chief Executive Officer of LankaPay Chandran De Silva and other officials, according to the PMD.",

        "title": "NASA considering budget cuts for Hubble and Chandra space telescopes",
        "date": "October 15, 2023 09:56 pm",
        "content": "NASA is considering cutting the budget of two of its biggest space telescopes as it faces broader spending reductions for its astrophysics programs. In an Oct. 13 presentation to the National Academies Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mark Clampin, director of NASAs astrophysics division, said he was studying unspecified cuts in the operating budgets of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope to preserve funding for other priorities in the division. The potential cuts, he said, are driven by the expectation that his division will not receive the full request of nearly 1.56 billion for fiscal year (FY) 2024 because of legislation passed in June that caps non-defense discretionary spending for 2024 at 2023 levels, with only a 1 increase for 2025. Were working with the expectation that FY24 budgets stay at the 23 levels, he said. That means that we have decided to reduce the budget for missions in extended operations, and that is Chandra and Hubble. Clampin declined to say how much the budgets of those two observatories would be cut, or specific impacts on them because of the cuts. He indicated the proposed cuts are still being studied, noting that he was able to make a positive adjustment for Chandra just in the last week. Chandra and Hubble are the two most expensive NASA astrophysics missions to operate after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA requested 93.3 million for Hubble and 68.7 million for Chandra in its fiscal year 2024 budget proposal, in line with past years budgets. Combined, they represent a little more than 10 of the fiscal year 2024 budget request for NASA astrophysics. They are also among the two oldest NASA missions, with Hubble launched in 1990 and Chandra in 1999. Clampin suggested that was a reason for reducing their budgets. Chandra has a number of issues right now. Its becoming increasing difficult to operate, he said. Insulation on the spacecrafts exterior is degrading, warming the spacecraft and making operations increasing difficult. While Hubble doesnt have those issues, he added, it has been operating for a long time and it is a large piece of the astrophysics budget. Clampin said he was planning two mini senior reviews for Chandra and Hubble, likely in May 2024 after the release of the fiscal year 2025 budget proposal. NASA conducts senior reviews to decide whether and how to extend science spacecraft that have completed their primary missions. In the last astrophysics senior review in 2022, Chandra and Hubble were effectively exempted, with separate panels studying each mission to look for efficiencies and other improvements rather that examining if the mission itself should be extended. Hubble and Chandra occupy the top tier given their immense, broad impact on astronomy, the final report of the 2022 senior review stated. Both missions are operating at extremely high efficiency, and although they are increasingly showing signs of age, both are likely to continue to generate world-class science throughout the next half decade, operating in concert with JWST as it begins its flagship role. Clampin said any savings from Chandra and Hubble would go to other astrophysics priorities. What we are trying to do, though, is protect future missions and developing missions and international partnerships, he said. That includes the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, smaller Explorer-class astrophysics missions, and NASAs role on missions led by other nations, such as ESAs LISA gravitational-wave observatory and the Israeli Ultrasat ultraviolet observatory. He said he also wanted to protect early work on the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the next flagship astrophysics mission after Roman slated to launch in the 2040s. Its absolutely fundamental to keep moving Habitable Worlds Observatory forward, he said. That includes the first call for proposals to develop key technologies for that large space telescope and funding teams studying science and technology topics for it. He added that NASA is also considering small reductions to other operating missions, which he did not identify, as well as reductions in technology development spending. All those plans, he said, were to protect against potential sharp cuts in astrophysics. A Senate version of a commerce, justice and science (CJS) spending bill for fiscal year 2024 would give NASA astrophysics 1.544 billion, short of the request but still above the 1.51 billion it received in 2023. House appropriators have yet to publicly release details about its CJS spending bill. Its entirely possible when we get an appropriation, given what you see on the news every day, we could be even well below the 23 level, he warned the committee. Its not a happy outlook out there.

        "content": "Egypt, Israel and the U.S. agreed to a ceasefire in southern Gaza beginning at 0600 GMT coinciding with the re-opening of the Rafah border crossing, two Egyptian security sources said on Monday. The sources said the ceasefire would last for several hours but they were not clear on the exact duration. They also said the three countries had agreed that Rafah would be open until 1400 GMT on Monday as a one-day initial re-opening. Rafah, which is on the border between Egypts Sinai Peninsula and Hamas-governed Gaza, is the only crossing into the territory not controlled by Israel. A security source and NGO source in Al-Arish said that aid trucks were still waiting there after 0600 GMT. Reuters images showed the trucks awaiting permission to make the trip to Rafah, which could take several hours. Egypt has said that the crossing remained open from the Egyptian side in recent days, but was rendered inoperable due to Israeli bombardments on the Palestinian side. Assistance that had come from several countries and organisations has been stalled in al-Arish awaiting an agreement on the delivery of aid and evacuation of foreign nationals from Gaza, which U.S. Secretary of State Blinken said had been achieved after a visit to Cairo. Asked for confirmation, the Israeli military had no immediate comment. Salama Marouf, head of the Hamas government media office, said they have received no confirmation from the Egyptian side about intentions to open the crossing. The U.S. embassy in Israel said the situation at Rafah would be fluid and unpredictable and it is unclear whether, or for how long, travelers will be permitted to transit the crossing. It said citizens who felt safe enough to do so could move towards the crossing. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging the Online Safety Bill, Ada Derana reporter said. The petition has reportedly been filed requesting the court to declare that the proposed bill is in violation of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The Attorney General has been named as a respondent in the petition. The petitioning party states that certain clauses included in the proposed bill curtail fundamental human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and especially the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The petition, which points out that a commission is slated to be appointed for the regulation of social media through this bill, alleges the bill allows the appointment of members to that commission at the sole discretion of the president. Cardinal Ranjith also voiced concerns in his petition that thereby, the president will be granted authority to appoint the individuals as members of the relevant commission and to remove the members on his discretion. Moreover, it is further emphasized through this petition that if the relevant bill is implemented, it will enable the government to impose restrictions on peoples right to information. Accordingly, the petitioner seeks a court order declaring that a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum is required for the bill to be passed. Three other petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court thus far, challenging the Online Safety Bill which was recently tabled in parliament by the government. The relevant petitions have been filed by the Socialist Youth Union (SYU), social activist Tharindu Uduwaragedara and the General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara, SJBs Rehan Jayawickrama and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris. The much-debated Online Safety Bill was tabled in parliament on October 03, by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, despite backlash by various sections over certain aspects of the bill. The Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September, aims to prohibit online communication of certain statements within the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to make provisions to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and for other matters connected therewith.",

Jaishankar urging him to take diplomatic measures for the release of 27 fishermen and their five boats detained by the Sri Lankan navy on Saturday. Meanwhile, the fishermen in Rameswaram declared an indefinite strike and a series of protests till the arrested fishermen and all their boats were released from Sri Lankan custody. In his letter to the External Affairs Minister, the CM stated that the repeated instances of arrest and seizure have caused panic among the fishermen. The livelihoods of these fishermen, who are often the sole breadwinners for their families, are at stake. The economic implications of these recurrent arrests are profound, as they lead to not only the loss of income for the fishermen and their families but also jeopardize food security of countless individuals who depend on their catch, he stated. The Sri Lankan navy detained 27 fishermen -- 23 from Rameswaram and four from Mandapam -- on Saturday on charges of poaching in their territorial waters. As of now, 120 fishing boats are in Sri Lankan custody. The fishermen leaders, who met after the arrest, resorted to taking out an indefinite strike starting Monday. All the fishing boats were moored at jetties. After the district administration intervened, the fishermen postponed their Pamban Bridge siege they announced on October 18. But they will protest in front of the Rameswaram post office on that day demanding that the Centre make efforts to get the fishermen and their boats released. We are also demanding the release of all 120 boats in Sri Lankan custody and demand the Union government to give clearance for salvaging the nine boats released by Sri Lankan courts, said P Jesuraja, fishermen leader from Rameswaram, India.

        "content": "The Attorney General today (16) stated before the Court of Appeal that it is not possible to provide special consideration before the law to Pastor Jerome Fernando, who has been accused of allegedly insulting other religions through a controversial statement made by him. Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrama informed this to the court, when a writ petition filed by Pastor Jerome requesting to issue an order preventing his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), was taken up before the court. The relevant petition was taken up before the Appeals Court judge bench consisting of the President of the Court of Appeal Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais today. Appearing for the religious leaders including Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero who have been named as respondents of the petition, Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena stated before the court that his clients do not oppose the request made by Pastor Jerome, only if the promises to directly appear before the CID soon as he arrives in the island without being arrested at the airport. He, however, further mentioned that his clients expect that the law should be fully enforced against Pastor Jerome. However, Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrama who appeared for the AG strongly objected to that request. Furthermore, the Senior State Counsel, who expressed that the law should be applied equally to all, also highlighted that it is not possible to provide special consideration before the law to Pastor Jerome Fernando. On 26 May, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition.

        "date": "October 16, 2023 07:36 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the United National Party (UNP), MP Vajira Abeywardena emphasized that the present government is dedicated to elevating Sri Lankas global standing by ensuring the publics access to accurate information, drawing inspiration from the significance of the Media Development Authority Act of Singapore in their developmental journey. The MP further highlighted that while everyone enjoys the freedom of social media, regulations will be introduced to deter its misuse for personal attacks or vengeful actions, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The former Minister and Member of Parliament expressed these insights during a press conference held today (16) at the Presidential Media Centre under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. Mr. Abeywardena highlighted that the establishment of the Commission on the Safety of Online Systems will serve as an experimental platform for both journalists and citizens. He further noted that individuals spreading defamatory or false information through online systems will face legal consequences and the commission itself does not possess punitive authority. Expressing his views further Mr. Vajira Abeywardena said; With the advancement of communication worldwide and in Sri Lanka, people have witnessed various outcomes. However, its clear that communication can also be used to mislead and insult citizens. Consequently, those responsible for social media platforms have been striving to establish regulations. In Sri Lanka, there is an ongoing debate about the necessity of such regulations. The landscape of electronic media in Sri Lanka has undergone significant changes since 1978. Initially, there was limited television coverage in the country. It was only with the establishment of ITN by Mr. Shan Wickremesinghe, the brother of the current President, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, that television expanded. However, it later came under government control. After 1978, the government introduced numerous radio and television channels to replace the sole radio station. The regulation of all television media was governed by Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation Act, which lacked comprehensive press development provisions. In contrast, developed countries across the globe have implemented regulatory frameworks to ensure the accuracy of information and the responsible conduct of media outlets. For instance, the Infocommunications Media Development Authority Act of Singapore has played a pivotal role in Singapores development. Today, especially the younger generation faces considerable discomfort due to the messages disseminated through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram and Youtube. Instances of such platforms negatively impacting young lives, even to the point of suicide, highlight the urgent need for rules and regulations. Its important to emphasize that controlling the harmful aspects of information channels, such as Facebook, ensuring the dissemination of accurate information and enforcing laws against those spreading false information are vital for the progress of an educated and developing society. To strengthen Sri Lankas position in Asia and on the global stage, it is essential to enhance the role of the media. A crucial step in this direction would be for all media organizations in Sri Lanka to study the Media Act of Singapore. This act grants full authority to regulate broadcasting services, including the power to grant licenses, revoke them and impose penalties for disseminating inaccurate information. Such measures have contributed to the transformation of countries like Singapore into influential nations worldwide. Beyond the realm of politics, there is a pressing need to change the culture of spreading falsehoods in Sri Lankan politics. Its vital to recognize that the medias responsibility lies in revealing the essential truth, not concealing it. For instance, its imperative for journalists and citizens alike to understand that regulations aim to strengthen the media, not control it. Providing accurate information is a valuable process that benefits the entire nation. To reinforce this, all institutions must unite, offering ideas, suggestions and methods to combat false statements in the media. Recent actions by our neighbouring country, India, which banned 58 mobile phone applications, including Tiktok, illustrate the importance of such regulations. Politicians often reference countries like India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and China as examples of advanced nations, yet they tend to overlook the regulations that underpin their development. In contrast, these countries have comprehensive legal systems and constitutions that have established the necessary rules and regulations to enable them to stand strong on the world stage. As Sri Lankans, it is vital to bring order to the currently disorganized media culture to foster its development and elevate the nations intelligence. One of the primary objectives of the new Broadcasting Regulatory Commission (BRC) bill and the Online Safety Bill is to prevent defamation, false accusations and the destruction of individuals. It is important to note that these regulations aim to create a strong presence for Sri Lanka, both domestically and internationally. The established commission cannot administer punishments; this authority lies with the Magistrate Court or other relevant courts. These new rules and regulations will not only produce responsible journalists but also responsible citizens. They also contribute to the reduction of animosity between nations and affirm the peoples right to access the truth. --PMD--",

        "content": "Responding to the electricity tariff revision requested by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has informed the CEB to submit a revised tariff submission considering the latest available data before Wednesday (18) due to certain deviations in the assumptions made by CEB in its tariff filing. In a letter addressed to the CEBs General Manager, the Director General of the PUCSL states that with regard to the increase in demand, the CEB has forecasted demand of 44.70 GWhday for September 2023 and 42.88 GWhday on average for Oct-Dec 2023. However, actual generation demand of September 2023 is 41.01 GWhday and October 2023 is 41.30 GWhday, he states. Therefore, assumed demand in your proposal can not be substantiated with latest data. Regarding depleted hydropower, the CEB forecasted a starting hydro storage for October 2023 of 503 GWh and for November 2023 635 GWh. As at today hydro storage is 668 GWh, and Inflow for Oct 1 to Oct 12, 2023 is 314 GWh which exceeds the estimates by considerable margin, he emphasized. The PUCSL further noted that for Oct-Dec 2023, the CEB has forecasted a total coal dispatch of 1,444 GWh in May 15, 2023 submission and 1,334 GWh in Sep 4, 2023 submission. However, the Commission says it envisages a drop in demand higher than the drop of coal dispatch. Further coal price has dropped from 68.6 LKRkg in May 15, 2023 submission to 52.6 LKRkg in Sep 4, 2023 submission. The impact of coal dispatch reduction cannot be justified with latest data, the letter. Therefore, the CEB has been informed to submit a revised tariff submission considering the latest available data before October 18, 2023.",

        "date": "October 17, 2023 07:57 am",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has affirmed the National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings of several Sri Lankan insurers and removed them from Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The outlook is Stable. The insurers are: - Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited (SLIC) at A(lka) - Continental Insurance Lanka Limited at A-(lka) - HNB Assurance PLC at A-(lka) - HNB General Insurance Limited at A-(lka) - Peoples Insurance PLC at A-(lka) - Co-operative Insurance Company PLC at BB(lka) - Construction Guarantee Fund at BB(lka) Investment and liquidity risks One factor driving the ratings is easing investment and liquidity risks. The removal of the RWN on the insurers national ratings reflects Fitchs view that near-term investment and liquidity risks have been reduced substantially, evident from the upgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CCC- from RD and the subsequent removal of the RWN on Fitch-rated banks. (SLICs IFS Rating of CC on RWN was not considered in this review.) The government has successfully restructured its local-currency sovereign debt while the holdings of treasury securities of banks and insurers have been excluded from the domestic debt optimisation programme. The investment and liquidity risk profiles of Sri Lankan insurers are closely linked with those of the sovereign and banks as their investment portfolios are dominated by local-currency fixed-income securities issued by the government, corporate debt and deposits with financial institutions. The restructuring of Sri Lankas foreign-currency debt, including defaulted sovereign bonds, has not been completed, but we believe that incremental risks to Fitch-rated insurers capital from the restructuring are likely to be manageable, given their limited exposure to these bonds (0.5 of invested assets at end-March 2023). The domestic banking systems foreign-currency liquidity has improved from the crisis period and should support insurers foreign-currency obligations such as premium payments to foreign reinsurers and claim obligations arising from foreign-currency policies. Better operating conditions Fitch expects the pressure on insurers regulatory capital profiles to ease alongside the alleviated investment and liquidity risks. Fitch-rated insurers regulatory capital ratios have been well above the regulatory minimum of 120. Insurers recent underwriting profitability has deteriorated due to higher claim costs and expenses but Fitch does not expect a material worsening over the next 12-18 months as inflationary pressures have started to ease. Insurers have focused on growing non-motor business lines amid continued restrictions on the import of motor vehicles. NITF At the same time, Fitch has downgraded National Insurance Trust Fund Boards (NITF) National IFS Rating to BBB(lka) from BBB(lka) and removed it from RWN. The outlook is Stable. The one-notch downgrade of NITFs rating reflects the insurers inability to renew its external reinsurance arrangements, resulting in weaker risk-management practices. NITF is the sole domestic reinsurer and receives 30 of reinsurance cessations from all domestic non-life operators. It has faced continued delays in renewing its reinsurance contracts and currently does not have any retrocession cover for its inwards reinsurance business. This, alongside continued capital weakness in certain business lines, exposes NITFs capital and earnings to greater volatility.",

        "date": "October 17, 2023 09:26 am",
        "content": "Belgian police early Tuesday hunted for a gunman with suspected terrorist motives who killed two Swedes with stunning viciousness before disappearing into the night. He created such fear that authorities shut down a Belgium-Sweden soccer match and held 35,000 fans inside for several hours as a precaution. Eric Van Duyse, spokesman for the federal prosecutors office, said the investigation was centering on a possible terrorist motivation for the shooting after a claim of responsibility was posted on social media. This person claims to be inspired by Islamic State, Van Duyse said. The Swedish nationality of the victims was put forward as the probable motive. Sweden raised its terror alert to the second-highest level in August after a series of public Quran-burnings by an Iraqi refugee living in Sweden resulted in threats from Islamic militant groups. At this time, no element indicates a possible link with the Israeli-Palestinian situation, Van Duyse said, offering scant relief on a continent where many nations have increased their vigilance for fear of attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war. In Belgium, the anti-terror center said the terror alert in the capital was raised to its top rating of 4, meaning a threat is extremely serious. It previously stood at 2, which means the threat was average. The alert level or the rest of the country was raised to 2. I have just offered my sincere condolences to SwedishPM following tonights harrowing attack on Swedish citizens in Brussels, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo De Croo said. He added on X, formerly known as Twitter, As close partners the fight against terrorism is a joint one. As for the soccer match, Van Duyse said, security measures were urgently taken to protect the Swedish supporters at the game in the national stadium not far from the schooting. Over two hours after the game was suspended, a message flashed on the big stadium screen saying, Fans, you can leave the stadium calmy. Stand after stand emptied onto the streets filled with police as the manhunt continued. Frustrated, confused, scared. I think everyone was quite scared, said Caroline Lochs, a fan from Antwerp. Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden said, A horrible shooting in Brussels, and the perpetrator is actively being tracked down. Media reports aired amateur videos showing a man arriving on a scooter in an orange fluorescent vast, dropping the vehicle and immediately taking out a large weapon and opening fire on passersby. Apart from the two Swedes who were killed, a local taxi driver was hurt but his life was not in danger. The attacker then picked up his scooter and sped off into the gathering darkness. The shooting came at a time of increased vigilance linked to the Israel-Hamas war that has heightened tension in several European nations. Even though only two people died in the attack, compared to dozens and dozens in several European nations little more than a half decade ago, the return of a sense of dread was immediate. Horrified at the indiscriminate killing in the heart of Brussels tonight, said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Terror and extremism cannot infiltrate in our societies. People must feel safe. Hate will not win. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

He took oaths before Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, shortly after the commencement of todays session. In April 2022, the SLMC had stripped Naseer Ahamed of his party membership after he endorsed the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and voted in favour of the Budget 2022. On October 06, the Supreme Court took into consideration a petition filed by Naseer Ahamed and upheld the decision of SLMC to expel him from the party, determining that it was lawful and that there was no reason to intervene in the partys decision. As such, Naseer Ahamed not only lost his parliamentary seat but also the portfolio of Environment Minister, which was later taken over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Accordingly, on October 11, the Election Commission announced, in a special gazette notification, the appointment of Moulana to the vacant parliamentary seat. The Secretary General of Parliament had informed the Election Commission, under Section 64 (1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981, that a vacancy has emerged in the membership of the Ninth Parliament by reason of Mr. Ahamed Zainulabdeen Naseer ceasing to be a Member of Parliament. The communiqu√© stated that the Returning Officer, for the said Electoral District was directed by the Election Commission under Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 to fill this vacancy as provided for under paragraph 13 (b) of Article 99 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Returning Officer had made a return to the effect that Ali Zahir Moulana was declared elected as an MP for the said Electoral District and has submitted the report to the Election Commission, the gazette stated. Taking to X (formerly known as Twitter) in this regard, Ali Zahir Moulana had said This judgment sets a critical precedent to the political establishment - strengthening the ideologies  principles of political parties, fortifying the doctrines of maintaining a civilized, orderly democracy  most importantly consolidating the absoluteness of our Constitution. The former state minister, who is a senior member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), had previously served as a Batticaloa District MP under the United National Party (UNP).",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has lifted the ban imposed on Danushka Gunathilaka, who was acquitted following a lengthy legal battle in Australia over sexual abuse allegations. The decision has been taken by the national cricket boards Executive Committee at its October 13 meeting, based on a recommendation made by the Inquiry Committee after careful evaluation of Gunathilakas acquittal and with due consideration to his cricketing career and its impact on the cricketing ambitions of the nations. The Inquiry Committee had been tasked with investigating the impact of the criminal allegations against Gunathilaka in Australia. It was headed by retired High Court Judge Sisira Ratnayake and consisted of Attorneys-at-Law Niroshana Perera and Asela Ranawaka. The ban was put in place in November 2022 after the 32-year-old cricketer was arrested in Australia after being accused by a Sydney woman of sexually assaulting her while he was in Australia for the T20 World Cup. Gunathilaka had chatted online for several days and then had dinner with the woman, who could not be identified for legal reasons, before being invited back to her eastern suburbs home, the NSW District Court had heard. The SLC thus suspended him from all cricket activities upon learning of his arrest and charges related to alleged sexual assault in Sydney. This suspension was pending the outcome of legal proceedings and was imposed considering the impact of his actions on the reputation of cricket and the country. Mr. Gunathilaka, who was under travel restriction in Australia for the past 11 months, faced a full trial in the District Court of New South Wales, Australia, where he was acquitted of the single charge levelled against him. Other charges under which he was initially arrested were dropped by the prosecution prior to trial. As such, the Executive Committee had ratified the unanimous recommendation made by the Inquiry Committee to fully lift the ban on Gunathilaka with immediate effect and to allow him to resume regular cricket activities and return to national duty. In addition, Gunathilaka has been cautioned to always uphold his status as a representative of the nation in all his future actions, the SLC said further. Gunathilakas case was that he had removed a condom during intercourse without the womans knowledge when she had consented only to protected sex. The complainant had told the court she did not see the batsman remove the condom but saw it on the floor shortly after the intercourse stopped. But Judge Sarah Huggett had found evidence about the genesis of the womans complaint undermined the reliability of her evidence. The judge said the woman had given different accounts in her two statements; the second, given in April this year, went into further detail about the issue of stealthing. The judge also said there were times when it appeared the complainant was motivated by a desire to paint the accused in an unfavourable light.",

        "content": "Indias top court has rejected a landmark petition seeking the recognition of same-sex marriage in the country, a blow for the queer community that denies tens of millions of LGBT couples the right to marry their partners. In a lengthy judgement, the Supreme Court of India urged the government to create legal recognition for same-sex couples so that they do not face descrimination, but stopped short of including such couples within the existing legal framework of marriage. The case involved 21 separate petitions from members of the LGBT community who argued that not being able to marry violated their constitutional rights, making them second-class citizens. The government contested the petitions, which came just five years after India decriminalised gay sex, arguing that marriage is exclusively an institution between a man and a woman and that those seeking marriage equality represented an urban elitist view for the purpose of social acceptance. The case was overseen by the countrys most senior judge, chief justice DY Chandrachud, as well as four other Supreme Court justices. It held hearings up until 11 May this year and had been deliberating its verdict for more than five months since then. Source - The Independent - Agencies",

He further mentioned that they are planning to travel to Egypt together with other people living in Gaza who are currently heading to the South. Currently, the people living especially in the northern part of Gaza have moved to the South. Among them, there are 27 Sri Lankans, he said quoting the Representative Office of Sri Lanka in Palestine. The 27 Sri Lankans are expected to travel to Egypt with the rest of the group of evacuees. The Palestine Office will make arrangements for that through a road opened by them Egyptian authorities, he said. Furthermore, Mr. Bandara said it has been confirmed that there are foreign nationals from around 36 countries including Sri Lanka, among nearly 150 individuals who are being held hostage by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The Red Cross has requested the heads of the Hamas to provide information regarding them. I trust that we will be able to access information as to whether the two Sri Lankans who are currently reported missing are among these hostages, he added. Last week, the Israeli military ordered some 1 million people to evacuate the southern part of Gaza ahead of an expected ground invasion in retaliation for the surprise attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Meanwhile, MP Chaminda Wijesiri stated that the government should properly manage the impending economic issues prompted by the escalating war between Israel and Palestine, as it can have adverse effects on the island nation.

        "date": "October 17, 2023 01:30 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden will make an extraordinary wartime visit to Israel this week as he seeks to demonstrate staunch support for the country as it works to eliminate Hamas while also pressing for ways to ease humanitarian suffering in Gaza. The dueling objectives, spelled out by his top diplomat Monday evening, bring with them significant risks for the president as he works to prevent the crisis in the Middle East from widening. Aides said Biden had expressed a strong interest in making the journey after being invited over the weekend by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Biden has known for four decades. He spent Monday deliberating over the trip at the White House with his top national security and intelligence advisers. Meanwhile, in Tel Aviv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was convening a marathon session with top Israeli officials to discuss opening Gaza to humanitarian aid and preventing civilians from getting caught up in Israels response to the terror attacks. In announcing Bidens Wednesday trip after more than seven hours of negotiations, Blinken said that the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza. The US president will also travel to Jordan, where he will meet with King Abdullah II, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The top US diplomat in recent days met separately with the three leaders  all of whom have condemned the situation in Gaza. The security risks of a diplomatic visit to Israel were starkly illustrated Monday when Blinken, in his meeting with Netanyahu, was forced to shelter in place after air sirens warned of incoming rockets. White House officials said theyd carefully weighed the risks of a presidential visit, and deemed it safe enough both to execute and announce ahead of time. The presidents visit will build on Blinkens seven nation, multi-day tour of the Middle East, which comes as the US tries to strike a delicate balance of providing unwavering support for Israels military operations while mitigating the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and stopping the war from spreading to further fronts. Biden will make it clear that we want to continue to work with all our partners in the region, including Israel, to get humanitarian assistance and again to provide some sort of safe passage for civilians to get out, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday evening. It wasnt clear ahead of Bidens visit whether any progress had been made on the opening of the Rafah crossing in Egypt  the only viable route to access Gaza. Blinken said the agreement to work on the plan was done at the US request, and they welcome the government of Israels commitment to work on this plan. It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible, Blinken said, noting that the US shares Israels concern that Hamas may seize or destroy aid entering Gaza or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it. If Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians, including by seizing the aid itself, well be the first to condemn it. And we will work to prevent it from happening again, he said. Biden, he said, very much looks forward to discussing it further during his visit. A visit with strategic importance In weighing Netanyahus invitation with his team, Biden factored in both the symbolism of a visit and its practicalities. Aside from a high-profile show of support for Israel, the trip will send a warning to other players in the region, namely Iran and its Hezbollah proxy in Lebanon, about becoming further engaged in the conflict. But it will also link Biden more closely with the Israeli response in Gaza, including concerns over a mounting humanitarian crisis, and could act as a tacit endorsement of Netanyahus decisions. The pressure on Biden to encourage restraint was evident Monday in front of the White House, where a large protest led by progressive Jewish groups called on him to push for a ceasefire. Loud singing and chanting could be heard from inside the gates. The conflict is forcing a new assessment of the administrations immediate foreign policy priorities, with the reality setting in that renewed violence in the Middle East will now occupy the bulk of the presidents time at least in the near-term. Huddling in the Oval Office on Monday, Biden discussed the latest developments on the ground with top national security advisers, including the administrations two leading intelligence officials. While Biden has stopped well short of encouraging a ceasefire  the word hasnt been used at all in the administrations response so far  he has issued steadily stronger warnings about protecting civilian life, including during his telephone calls with Netanyahu. Biden and Blinken, advisers say, have upheld a moral high ground and cemented credibility with the Israelis by remaining sympathetic to civilian and humanitarian needs, while reinforcing their commitment to the security state. Traveling to Israel in person may provide Biden  who has long espoused the importance of face-to-face meetings  a better opportunity to convey those views to his Israeli counterpart, a leader with whom he believes he has a deep understanding. Before war in Israel broke out, Biden and Netanyahu were planning to visit in person again at the White House, a personal invitation Biden extended when the two last met in New York City. Already, in their phone calls, the men have discussed the importance of adhering to the rules of war. In an interview that aired Sunday, Biden offered his most public statement urging restraint, saying it would be a mistake for Israel to try reoccupying Gaza. Speaking to reporters Monday, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said a visit by Biden would have strategic importance for the entire Middle East. The most senior representative of the USA comes to Israel for a full report on the war in the Middle East and all the action we have to take, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters when asked earlier about a possible visit by the US president. Right now, we are focusing on Gaza and the steps that we are going to take to prepare for war and that is how we will progress, he added. The last time that Biden made a last-minute and highly secretive trip abroad was in February, when he visited Kyiv, Ukraine, around the one-year anniversary of Russias invasion. With only a small group of some of his senior-most advisers even aware of the plans ahead of time  and ultimately with just one reporter and one photographer in tow  the president quietly rode a train across the Polish-Ukrainian border to enter an active war-zone. His brief visit served as a remarkable show of solidarity for the Ukrainian people and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, which the White House hoped would also translate to a forceful rallying cry for the US allies to continue supporting Ukraines cause. But unlike his visit to Ukraine earlier this year, his expected to Israel this week marks a remarkably swift decision to visit the country only days after the outbreak of war. Those familiar with Bidens decadeslong relationship with Netanyahu say it is clear the administrations response to Hamas attacks is being shaped in no small way by Bidens personal friendship with Netanyahu  and his desire to demonstrate his unequivocal support for the prime minister. American officials spent much of the weekend watching with growing concern the potential for the war widening, and sending public and private signals to Iran to stay out of the conflict. US officials engage with counterparts in region From his first phone call with Netanyahu last weekend, Biden has raised concern that a northern front could open along Israels border with Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has been engaging sporadically with Israeli forces. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the administration was engaged in back-channel diplomacy with Tehran to send the same message it has been conveying publicly about not escalating the crisis further. Rhetorically, theyre cranking it up, said a person close to the situation. But theyre backing it up with hardware. For Biden and his team, the risks of a wider conflict include the potential of further engaging American military assets in defending Israel. Though the White House has said repeatedly there are no plans to send American troops to Israel  in part because Israel itself does not want it  there is the potential US air and naval assets become further involved if a multi-front war breaks out. Over the weekend, Biden ordered a second US aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean, bolstering what he and other officials have described as a deterrence posture. The military muscle is intended to send a signal to Iran to stay out. Yet behind the scenes, Biden and his team are discussing the various possibilities should the crisis escalate. We cant rule out that Iran would choose to get directly engaged some way. We have to prepare for every possible contingency, Sullivan said on CBS. The outbreak of violence is forcing the Biden administration to closely engage with  and heavily lean on  actors in the region with histories of glaring human rights violations. US officials have been actively discussing with their counterparts in Egypt the establishment of a humanitarian corridor that would allow civilians  including hundreds of American citizens  to escape Israels counteroffensive attacks raining down in Gaza. But those efforts have yet to be fruitful. Over the weekend, scenes of chaos and confusion poured out of southern Gaza, where families attempting to leave found that the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt remained closed, despite having been previously told that there would be a midday window to leave. The issue had been a major topic of discussion between Blinken and el-Sisi, and after their in-person meeting, Blinken pledged Sunday that Rafah will be open. Blinkens frenzied multi-day trip to the region also included a stop in Saudi Arabia, a country that Biden, as a presidential candidate, had pledged to make a pariah on the global stage after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The secretary of state met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the countrys de facto leader whom the US intelligence community concluded had approved the operation to kill Khashoggi. Such direct and swift courtship of the regions strongman leaders is a clear signal of the administrations determination to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond Israels borders.

The following day, Israel declared war on Hamas, killing at least 2,800 people in their retaliation attacks. The violence has spurred Iran-backed Hezbollah to pledge solidarity with the Palestinian people.

        "title": "Will have to ground SriLankan Airlines, if no buyer for joint venture  Aviation Minister",
        "date": "October 17, 2023 04:53 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva says that the government will have to ground state-owned national carrier SriLankan Airlines, if there is no buyer to enter into a joint venture with the government. Responding to the allegations of staff shortages, salary and debt issues within the airline, during Ada Deranas State of the Nation programme, the Aviation Minister refuted the allegations of staff shortages and declared that SriLankan Airlines has the necessary number of staff for running an airline, according to the international norms. Allegations that we dont have the necessary staff for operating the airline are not correct. According to the international norms and the practicality of running an airline, we have the necessary number. The minister further explaining the exact figures highlighted that, in 2019 we had 311 pilots and we operated 26 aircraft and in 2020 we had 339 pilots and we operated 05 aircraft as it was the Covid-19 pandemic period. In 2021, we operated 13 aircraft with 293 pilots. That was of course a part of the Covid-19 period. In 2022, we had 295 pilots and we operated 19 aircraft. As of now, in 2023, we are operating only 15 aircraft with 273 pilots, and as of June 01, 2023, according to the figures, we were operating 16 aircraft and we had 262 pilots, the Minister added. Minister de Silva claimed that in comparison to these figures, it is very clear that the number of pilots for the number of aircraft that SriLankan Airlines are flying is quite enough. Therefore, the allegation that we dont have the necessary number of pilots is wrong. The Minister also commented regarding the Engineering staff, pointing out that In the same way, with the same Engineering staff, we have operated more aircraft during 2019. So, why cant they do it now? But that is not the fact. The fact is something else. It is because of trade union actions. Pilots refuse to fly during their off days and the engineers also went on a go-slow campaign, he expressed. However, the minister alleged that those actions are also the cause for the downfall of the airline, which was making a profit in the last few years. Meanwhile, the minister was also inquired regarding certain reports alleging that the government is planning to sell off SriLankan Airlines by the end of 2024. In response, Minister de Silva denied these claims, emphasizing that it not possible under Sri Lankan law, while adding that that if the airline is sold, it will lose landing rights in many important destinations. We are not going to sell. We cant sell the airline in terms of the Sri Lankan law. Then we will lose our landing rights in many important destinations. So what were going to do is we want to retain 51 with us and to divest 49 of the shares of SriLankan Airlines, so that it will be a joint venture, he said. Around 08 months ago, I carried a Cabinet paper and requested the Cabinet to approve such a divesture. Reaching into an agreement, a joint venture and well run this airline because were in debt. Speaking further in this regard, the Minister said, we have a debt of USD 1.2 billion. That is to the international market we have taken about USD 175 million from the sovereign bonds and about another USD 100 million we owe to the lessors of the aircraft because we dont own a single aircraft. All these aircraft have been leased out from the lessors. The Minister further stated that SriLankan Airlines owes money to even the Airport and Aviation Authority, and to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) for the jet fuel they have used. Therefore we cant run this airline because we need a capital injection here. We have to put at least USD 500 million capital to make this airline a viable airline. The government has no money to do that and the government does not intend to do that, because we feel the correct policy is to go into a joint venture and get the necessary capital and ensure that the airline is run smoothly. That is the formula we have at the moment, he said, adding that we have not yet called for Expression of Interest (EOI) from the buyers or from anybody who wants to come and invest here. But there are a lot of inquiries from us, but we cant negotiate with them because now the Treasury is the owner of the airline. It is a Treasury-owned company. The Minister said that when he presented the Cabinet paper, the Cabinet thought it prudent to refer it to the Treasury and the Treasury has taken the view, in consultation with the World Bank and the IMF, to appoint an independent transaction advisor. That advisor has been selected by the World Bank and that advisor is working on that. But I am pressing on him and Mr. Suresh Shah, who is in charge of this privatization process. So, I told him that I cant wait anymore. I need this joint venture to be done soon. Nimal Siripala de Silva said that he has been promised that they will get all the papers ready by the end of this month, and will publish it in international media, so that anybody interested can apply and we will appoint necessary committees and we will get the best proposal. He added: Till the airline goes into a joint venture as we have envisaged, we have to run this airline. So for that purpose, we need to get some more aircraft. But have advertised to get some more aircraft. However, the Aviation Minister emphasized that it is very difficult to obtain Airbus A330 aircraft at present, as theres a shortage in the market. Therefore we are being affected by this international situation also, he added. Minister de Silva also stated that the Chairman and Board of Directors of the airline are trying their best to make this a viable business venture, for which the government need the cooperation of trade unions, pilots, engineers, cabin crews and all others. If they dont cooperate, its not the government that will suffer. They will suffer because we will not be able to go on the venture we have proposed. So if there is no taker, then we will have to ground this aircraft at some time or other, he added. Therefore, I always appeal to the trade unions and workers to be cautious and cooperate with us till we embark upon this process.",

        "date": "October 17, 2023 05:28 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Senator Michael Bennet on Tuesday sought information on how tech giants Meta, X, TikTok and Google were trying to stop the spread of false and misleading content about the Israel-Hamas conflict on their platforms. Deceptive content has ricocheted across social media sites since the conflict began, sometimes receiving millions of views, Bennet, a Democrat, said in the letter addressed to the company chiefs. Visuals from older conflicts, video game footage, and altered documents are among misleading content that has flooded social media platforms since Hamas militants attacked Israeli civilians on Oct. 7. In many cases, your platforms algorithms have amplified this content, contributing to a dangerous cycle of outrage, engagement, and redistribution, Bennet said. The Senators comments come after European Union industry chief Thierry Breton blasted the companies, demanding they take stricter steps to battle disinformation amid the escalating conflict. In his letter, Bennet has posed a series of questions to the companies seeking details on their content moderation practices and sought answers by Oct. 31. The social media firms have outlined some steps theyve taken in recent days in response to the conflict. The short video app TikTok said it had hired more Arabic and Hebrew-speaking content moderators. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said it had removed or marked as disturbing more than 795,000 pieces of content in Hebrew or Arabic in the first three days since the Hamas attack. X and Google-owned YouTube both said they had also taken down harmful content. But Bennet said those actions were not enough. The mountain of false content clearly demonstrates that your current policies and protocols are inadequate, he said in the letter. Bennet also slammed the four companies for having laid off staff from their trust and safety teams in the past year that were in charge of monitoring for false and misleading content. Twitter shelved 15 of its trust and safety staff and dissolved a related council in Nov. 2022 after Elon Musk acquired the company, cutting more staff last month, Bennet noted. Meta reduced 100 similar positions in January, while Google reduced by a third a team creating tools to counter online hate speech and disinformation, Bennet said. These decisions contribute to a cascade of violence, paranoia, and distrust around the world, he said. Your platforms are helping produce an information ecosystem in which basic facts are increasingly in dispute, while untrustworthy sources are repeatedly designated as authoritative.

        "date": "October 17, 2023 06:01 pm",
        "content": "A miniature X-wing Starfighter used in a Star Wars film sold for over 3 million during an auction over the weekend of items both collected and created by longtime Hollywood model-maker Greg Jein. The collection amassed by Jein, who died last year at the age of 76, brought in about 13.6 million during an event at Heritage Auctions in Dallas. The auction house said that everyone from model-makers to collectors and science-fiction fans attended, making the event its best-attended in years. Joe Maddalena, Heritages executive vice president and a longtime friend of Jeins, said in a news release Monday that the auction was a profound testament to my friend as both a visual-effects master and one of the great collectors. Jein not only had an Oscar and Emmy-nominated career making miniature models for nearly half a century, but he also spent a lifetime collecting costumes, props, scripts, artwork, photographs and models from the shows he loved. The Red Leader X-wing Starfighter that was used in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV  A New Hope sold for about 3.1 million after a bidding duel between two collectors, the auction house said. Also going for an eye-popping amount was a Star Wars Stormtrooper costume that sold for 645,000. A rare surviving spacesuit from Stanley Kubricks 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey sold for 447,000. Jein was a fan of  Star Trek  before he worked on the franchise  and some of the items that he collected were popular at the auction. A filming model of the SS Botany Bay vessel from Star Trek: The Original Series from the 1960s went for 200,000 while prop devices from that series like a hero phaser went for 187,500 and a tricorder garnered 175,000. Jein, who grew up in Los Angeles, was still early in his career when he led the team that created the mothership for Steven Spielbergs 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The model that appears gigantic in the movie is just over 5 feet (1.5 meters) long and now part of the collection at the Smithsonians National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A small preliminary model, which is about 5 inches (12 centimeters) long, brought in 55,000 at the auction. Lou Zutavern, Jeins longtime friend and shop supervisor, said that he and Jein always had a ball working together. He said Jein was a great friend, and recalled the time he brought a box filled with model kits to entertain Zutavern after he had a knee surgery. Zutavern said his friend had a love of Hollywood history, and a passion for seeking out items for his collection. He loved the search and finding things and making a trade, Zutavern said. It was part of the fun for him. Source  The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "Chinese tech giant Huawei has expressed its willingness to support an annual study programme aimed at nurturing software and hardware engineers in Sri Lanka. Speaking in this regard, Simon Lin, Senior Vice President of Huawei Technologies and President of Huawei Asia Pacific, revealed that Huawei has already initiated collaborations with several Sri Lankan universities, not only pertaining to providing academic assistance but also in providing technology and infrastructure. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is on an official four-day trip to China, led the delegation to Huaweis research and development centre in Beijing today (17 Oct.). Highlighting the purpose of his visit, which is to discuss Sri Lankas future, President Wickremesinghe emphasised the crucial role of both the Chinese Government and Huawei in supporting Sri Lankas digital education system and green energy production. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the need for Sri Lanka to build a competitive digital and green economy to face the challenges of the future, and noted that the foundational work for this transformation is already underway. The discussions extended to the importance of empowering Sri Lankan citizens with digital technology, which is closely linked to the nations economic growth.
