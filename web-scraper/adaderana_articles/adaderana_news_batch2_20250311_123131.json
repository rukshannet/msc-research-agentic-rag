        "title": "UN Security Council considers action on Sudan war",
        "date": "November 12, 2024 12:54 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations Security Council is discussing a British-drafted resolution that demands Sudans warring parties cease hostilities and calls on them to allow safe, rapid and unhindered deliveries of aid across front lines and borders. War erupted in April 2023 from a power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, and triggered the worlds largest displacement crisis. It has produced waves of ethnically driven violence blamed largely on the RSF. The RSF has denied harming civilians in Sudan and attributed the activity to rogue actors. In the first U.N. sanctions imposed during the current conflict, a Security Council committee designated two RSF generals last week. Nineteen months in to the war, both sides are committing egregious human rights violations, including the widespread rape of women and girls, Britains U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, told reporters at the start of this month as Britain assumed the Security Councils presidency for November. More than half the Sudanese population are experiencing severe food insecurity, she said. Despite this, the SAF and the RSF remain focussed on fighting each other and not the famine and suffering facing their country. Britain wanted to put the draft resolution to a vote as quickly as possible, diplomats said. To be adopted, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., France, Britain, Russia or China. AID ACROSS BORDERS The U.N. says nearly 25 million people - half of Sudans population - need aid as famine has taken hold in displacement camps and 11 million people have fled their homes. Nearly 3 million of those people have left for other countries. Britains draft text demands that the Rapid Support Forces immediately halt its offensives throughout Sudan, and demands that the warring parties immediately cease hostilities. It also calls on the parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate the full, safe, rapid, and unhindered crossline and cross-border humanitarian access into and throughout Sudan. The draft also calls for the Adre border crossing with Chad to remain open for aid deliveries and stresses the need to sustain humanitarian access through all border crossings, while humanitarian needs persist, and without impediments. A three-month approval given by Sudanese authorities for the U.N. and aid groups to use the Adre border crossing to reach Darfur is due to expire in mid-November. The Security Council has adopted two previous resolutions on Sudan: in March it called for an immediate cessation of hostilities for the holy month of Ramadan, then in June it specifically demanded a halt to a siege of a city of 1.8 million people in Sudans North Darfur region by the RSF. Both resolutions - adopted with 14 votes in favor and a Russian abstention - also called for full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.

        "date": "November 12, 2024 05:16 pm",
        "content": "Police in China say 35 people were killed and another 43 injured when a driver rammed his car into people exercising at a sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai. The 62-year-old driver was detained, police said Monday. It was not immediately clear whether it was an attack or an accident. No motive was mentioned, and police said investigations continued. The Monday night incident came on the eve of the countrys premier aviation exhibition by the Peoples Liberation Army, hosted annually in Zhuhai. There has been heavy censorship of information about the incident given the timing and location, with officials only announcing the death toll the following day. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured people, state media reported Monday. Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, consistent with the practice by Chinese authorities. The police statement said the vehicle knocked down a number of of pedestrians Monday evening. President Xi Jinping called in a statement on Tuesday for the driver to punished in accordance with Chinese law. A man at the emergency clinic of Shang Chong Hospital in Zhuhai said they had received some slightly injured people and most of them left after treatment. Zhuhai Peoples Hospital said it had received injured, but it did not offer a number of casualties. Calls to the Xiangzhou District Peoples Hospital and the Third Peoples Hospital of Zhuhai went unanswered. Videos showed a firefighter performing CPR on a person as people were told to leave the scene Monday night. They were shared by news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. Dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports center in the videos. In one, a woman can be heard saying her foot is broken. By Tuesday morning, searches for information about the incident on Chinese social media platforms were being heavily censored. A search on Weibo, similar to X, for the sports center only turned up a few posts, with only a couple referring to the fact that something had happened there, and no pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media outlets about the incident from Monday night had been taken down. Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media ahead of and during major events, such as the meeting of the National Peoples Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year. The sports center for the city district of Xiangzhou regularly attracts hundreds of residents to run on the track field, play soccer and dance. Following the incident, the center announced it would be closed until further notice. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target random people, including schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 12, 2024 05:40 pm",
        "content": "MK Stalin, the Chief Minister of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has written to Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, highlighting the increasing frequency of arrests of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy. In a letter, Stalin highlighted that the number of Indian fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy this year is the highest in seven years. The Sri Lankan Navy maintains that Indian fishing boats are poaching in Sri Lankan waters and that their Naval vessels conduct regular patrols and operations in their waters to curb illegal fishing practices of foreign fishing boats, taking into account the impact of those practices on the livelihood of local fishermen. Thus far this year, the Sri Lankan Navy says they have held 66 Indian fishing boats and 497 Indian fishermen in the island nations waters. The fishermen issue remains a sore point in India-Sri Lanka ties, with fishers from each side crossing over into the others waters. This is a longstanding and complex problem that involves fishing rights and territory in the narrow Palk Strait, the water body that separates the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the Northern part of the island nation Sri Lanka. In the letter, MK Stalin touched upon the two incidents from Sunday, 9th November, and Tuesday, November 12, where a total of 35 fishermen from Tamil Nadu, and their four boats were taken into custody by Sri Lankan authorities. These arrests not only disrupt their livelihoods but also cause immense distress to their families, he stated. Meetings between Indian and Sri Lankan Authorities In recent days, Maritime security agencies from India and Sri Lanka have been meeting to discuss various issues, including efforts to combat transnational maritime crime and to promote regional cooperation. The 7th Annual High-Level Meeting (HLM) between the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and the Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) was conducted on November 11, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The meeting underscored the commitment of both the Coast Guards to jointly address a plethora of maritime challenges including drug trafficking, marine pollution, the safety of mariners, adoption of best practices, capacity-building programmes, and other collaborative arrangements. The meeting between the Coast Guard leadership comes barely a week after the 34th India and Sri Lanka Navy  Coast Guard International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) meeting, chaired by senior officials of the Indian and Sri Lankan Navies. This meeting was held onboard the Sri Lankan Naval Ship SLNS Vijayabahu in Palk Bay on November 6, 2024. Representatives from both sides held discussions with a special focus on maritime security in Palk Bay  Gulf of Mannar, the safety of fishermen, and ways to enhance fishermens response to real-time communications. Campaigning ahead of the countrys Parliamentary polls, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake accused Indian fishermen of destroying the marine resources belonging to the Sri Lankan Tamil-populated northern region of the island nation. During his speech at Jaffna city, he also stated that his government will ensure that such exploitation of marine resources does not happen. He assured that he would protect the rights of Sri Lankan fishermen, bring more jobs to the region, and support agriculture and fisheries. He also touched upon the issue of drug abuse and vowed to crack down. Source: Wion --Agencies",

        "title": "President summons new Parliament to meet on Nov 21",
        "date": "November 12, 2024 07:59 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has issued Extraordinary Gazette notification summoning the new Parliament to convene at 10.00 a.m. on November 21 (Thursday). The proclamation has been issued today (12) by the Secretary to the President, by order of the President, by virtue of the powers vested in him by Article 70 of the Constitution. The upcoming general election to elect Members of Parliament for the Tenth Parliament is scheduled for November 14. Through this election, a total of 225 Members of Parliament will be elected, comprising 196 members elected by public vote and 29 members entering through the national list, the statement added. The inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament, comprising of members through this process, is scheduled to commence on November 21, as per the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 240313 dated 2024.09.24 issued by the President, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. First day of the new Parliament The first day of Parliaments inaugural session holds particular significance due to the series of special proceedings expected to take place on that day. On the first day, the primary responsibilities within the Chamber are entrusted to the Secretary-General of Parliament. Members of Parliament are not assigned specific seating arrangements on this day and are allowed to sit in any seat of their choice. Following the placement of the mace in the Chamber, the Secretary-General will present to Parliament, as the first business of the day, the Extraordinary Gazette Notification issued by the President, which specifies the date and time for the convening of Parliament. Subsequently, in accordance with Article 64 (1) of the Constitution and Standing Orders 4, 5, and 6 of Parliament, the Speaker is elected by vote, followed by the administration of the official affirmation or oath of office by the Speaker. Thereafter, Members of Parliament take their official affirmation or oath, and the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are elected by vote. Electing the Speaker Any Member of Parliament may be appointed as the Speaker. However, prior to nominating a member for the position, it is essential to confirm that the Member is willing to accept the appointment. The election of the Speaker must proceed based solely on the nominations made by Members, without allowing any debate on the matter. At this stage, the Secretary-General informs the House that the Speaker must be appointed first. When a member rises to propose a name, the Secretary-General directs the Houses attention to that Members nomination. After one name has been proposed, the Secretary-General must ask if there are any other nominations. If no other nominations are presented, that Member is duly elected as Speaker. It is a long-standing tradition for the two Members who formally proposed and seconded the name of the Speaker to escort the elected Member to the Speakers chair, holding them by the arms. The Speaker then takes their official affirmation or oath of office before the Secretary-General. Before taking their seat, it is customary for the newly appointed Speaker to briefly thank the House for the appointment. Congratulatory remarks are then offered by both the government and opposition representatives, after which the Speaker delivers a statement of thanks. Following this, the remaining Members proceed to take their official affirmation or oath before the Speaker. When the names of two Members are proposed for the position of Speaker, a secret ballot is conducted. There are two instances in parliamentary procedure when a secret ballot is held: during the election of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Chairperson of Committees, and also when Parliament elects a President. During the ballot, a continuous five-minute Quorum Bell shall signal Members to prepare. The Secretary-General then distributes ballot papers to each Member, who must write the name of their chosen candidate and sign the paper. Members then fold the ballot paper discreetly and place it in the ballot box. The authority to determine the voting method and to conduct the count rests solely with the Secretary-General, who tallies the votes at the Table of Parliament. After counting, the Secretary-General announces the result to the House. If a ballot paper lacks the Members signature, it is deemed invalid. If three Members are proposed for the position of Speaker and no candidate secures an absolute majority in the vote, the candidate with the least number of votes shall be eliminated, and a new round of voting is conducted. The candidate who then receives the majority of votes is elected as Speaker. Similarly, in instances where multiple Members are proposed, successive rounds of voting are held, eliminating the candidate with the least votes each time, until one candidate secures an absolute majority. At any point, if a candidate achieves an absolute majority, they are immediately elected as Speaker. In cases where three Members stand for election and two of them receive an equal number of votes, the Secretary-General has the authority to eliminate one of the tied candidates by drawing lots. Following this, a vote is held between the remaining candidate and the candidate with the highest votes, and the Speaker is selected based on the results. If there is a vote between two candidates and both receive an equal number of votes, a re-vote is conducted. Should there still be a tie after this second vote, the Secretary-General has the authority to select the Speaker by drawing lots. The Secretary-General has full discretion to determine the procedure for drawing lots. Following the conclusion of a vote, the corresponding ballot papers must be kept under the custody of the Secretary-General for a period of one month. After this period, they should be destroyed in accordance with the directive from Parliament, and a report of this destruction must be submitted to Parliament. All Members of Parliament elected must sign the Member roll after taking their oath or affirmation on the first day. The Speaker signs first, followed by the Prime Minister as a tradition, after which the other Members affix their signatures. This signed record is maintained as a highly secure document in accordance with established protocols. When the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are to be elected, the Speaker, having already been appointed, conducts all notifications and voting procedures. After nominations for the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson are made, the Speaker will ask the House if there are any further nominations. If none are forthcoming, the nominated Members are elected to their respective positions. Should a vote be necessary, the procedure followed will mirror that of the election of the Speaker, with the notable difference that the voting will be conducted by the Speaker instead of the Secretary-General. After these activities are completed, Parliament will be adjourned. Typically, the adjournment will be until the next scheduled parliamentary day. However, according to Article 33 of the Constitution, if the President addresses Parliament on that day to present government policy statement, the House will be temporarily suspended at the end of these initial proceedings. When Parliament reconvenes, the President will preside over the House and present the government policy statement. Following the policy statement the President will then adjourn Parliament until the next scheduled day.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Defence has informed former MPs, former Provincial Councillors, political party leaders and political organizations, as well as officers who held executive appointments in the government to surrender the firearms and ammunition issued to them at various periods, before December 30, 2024. Issuing a statement, the Ministry of Defence said it has observed that the Sri Lanka Police and Sri Lanka Army have issued a significant number of pistols, revolvers and other firearms for the protection of Members of Parliament, Provincial Council members, political party leaders and political organizations as well as officers who held executive appointments in the government. The Ministry of Defence informs the concerned individuals, parties and organizations to hand over these firearms to the nearest police station before December 30, 2024. Further, it said that the Sri Lanka Police maintain a list of individuals who have been issued firearms and have directed Officers in Charge of all Police Stations to contact these individuals and acquire the firearms into police custody. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence requests the concerned individuals to cooperate with the police during these inquiries to maintain law and order. Additionally, individuals are requested to support this effort by providing documents confirming that they have returned firearms to the government, if they have already done so. In pursuant to Ministry of Defence press release on 06 October 2024, all licensees were informed to return their firearms and ammunition, issued for personal protection, to the Commercial Explosive Firearms and Ammunition Procurement Unit (CEFAP) at the Sri Lanka Navy camp in Welisara before 07 November 2024. However, in response to requests from various parties, including licensees currently abroad and due to insufficient time to notify all licensees through formal letters, the Ministry of Defence had decided to extend the deadline for the return of firearms and ammunition to 21 November 2024.",

        "title": "Archbishop of Canterbury resigns over handling of church child abuse case",
        "date": "November 12, 2024 09:58 pm",
        "content": "Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when release of the inquirys findings kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024, Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. I believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Monday that Welbys position was untenable after some members of the churchs national assembly started a petition calling on him to step down because he had lost the confidence of his clergy. But the strongest outcry had come from the victims of the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who abused teenage boys and young men at Christian summer camps in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over five decades. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over a period of five years, said that resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the churchs handling of historical abuse cases more broadly. I believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign, Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down. I say opportunity in the sense that this would be an opportunity for him to stand with the victims of the Smyth abuse and all victims that have not been treated properly by the Church of England in their own abuse cases. Welbys resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England a place where abusers could hide. Welbys supporters had argued that he had been instrumental in changing the culture of the church since he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. But it was an investigation into crimes that began long before that date that ultimately led to his downfall. The church on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa beginning in the 1970s. The 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as energetically as they should have been after he learned of the abuse, but said he had decided not to resign. On Monday, Welbys office issued a statement reiterating that position and expressing his horror at the scale of John Smyths egregious abuse. Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report participated in an active cover-up to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018. Smyths abuse wasnt made public until a 2017 investigation by Britains Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him. Stephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at Kings College Cambridge, said that Welby could no longer represent the people. There are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly, Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned. And the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.

Manjula explained that due to safety concerns in areas like Orugodawatta, Thotalaga, and Grandpass, these containers were being held within the port and released to facilitate container clearances. However, after a recent inspection by the minister, authorities have decided to remove the container trucks from the port and send them out, causing traffic jams, especially in areas such as Orugodawatta and Thotalaga. He further emphasized that this decision had put both the drivers and the containers at risk, as there have been threats to their safety. The Inspector General of Police and the Director General of Customs had been informed. Accordingly, they were stopped at the port premises and sent through a system, he added. The Container Transporters expressed their views on the difficulty they have faced. Now we are in a situation where we cannot leave for three days. This is an act of revenge. These people are doing this because the truth about them was revealed. It is unfair. We have no food. Nothing to drink...we are helpless.

Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, an entity Trump indicated will operate outside the confines of government. Trump said in a statement that Musk and Ramaswamy will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies. Trump said the new department will realize long-held Republican dreams and provide advice and guidance from outside of government, signaling the Musk and Ramaswamy roles would be informal, without requiring Senate approval and allowing Musk to remain the head of electric car company Tesla social media platform X and rocket company SpaceX. The new department would work with the White House and Office of Management  Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before, Trump said. The work would conclude by July 4, 2026 - the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world, already stood to benefit from Trumps victory, with the billionaire entrepreneur expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favorable government treatment. With many links to Washington, opens new tab, Musk gave millions of dollars to support Trumps presidential campaign and made public appearances with him. Trump had said he would offer Musk a role in his administration promoting government efficiency. Adding a government portfolio to Musks plate could benefit the market value of his companies and favored businesses such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Its clear that Musk will have a massive role in the Trump White House with his increasing reach clearly across many federal agencies, equities analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a research note. We believe the major benefits for Musk and Tesla far outweigh any negatives as this continues to be a poker move for the ages by Musk betting on Trump, Ives said. Trump likened the efficiency effort to the Manhattan Project, the U.S. undertaking to build the atomic bomb that helped end World War Two, while Musk promised transparency. All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency, Musk said on X, inviting the public to provide tips. We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining, Musk said. Musk said at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October that the federal budget could be reduced by at least 2 trillion. Discretionary spending, including defense spending, is estimated to total 1.9 trillion out of 6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. Were going to get the government off you back and out of your pocketbook, Musk said at the rally. The acronym of the new department - DOGE - also references the name of the cryptocurrency dogecoin that Musk promotes. In August Musk and Tesla won the dismissal of a federal lawsuit accusing them of defrauding investors by hyping dogecoin and conducting insider trading, causing billions of dollars of losses. Ramaswamy is the founder of a pharmaceutical company who ran for the Republican presidential nomination against Trump and then threw his support behind the former president after dropping out. Ramaswamy said the appointment means he is withdrawing from consideration for the pending U.S. Senate appointment in Ohio, where Governor Mike DeWine will appoint a replacement for JD Vance, who will become Trumps vice president when they are inaugurated on Jan. 20.

        "date": "November 13, 2024 12:21 pm",
        "content": "British author Samantha Harvey has won the 2024 Booker Prize award with her novel Orbital, the first book set in space to win the prize. Orbital contemplates the world from a different viewpoint as it follows a team of astronauts in the International Space Station. Its the biggest-selling book on the shortlist in the UK, and has also outsold the past three Booker winners combined, up to the eve of their success. Harvey, the first woman to win the award since 2019, was announced as winner at a ceremony in Londons Old Billingsgate, and will take home 50,000. She dedicated the prize to all the people who speak for and not against the Earth and work for and not against peace. She said she questioned herself while writing the book: Why would anybody want to hear from a woman at her desk in Wiltshire writing about space when people have actually been there? I lost my nerve with it and I thought I didnt have the authority to write it. Speaking to BBC News, Harvey said she was in complete shock and very overwhelmed. She added that the award would change her life. Asked how she would spend the 50,000 prize money, she said: I need to buy myself a new bike, and its going to be a good bike. Beauty and ambition Chair of the judges, Edmund de Waal, described Orbital as a book about a wounded world. He said the judges all recognised its beauty and ambition and praised her language of lyricism. Writing it, Harvey said she thought of it as a space pastoral - a kind of nature writing about the beauty of space. The 136-page long story, which is Harveys fifth novel, takes place over a single day in the life of six astronauts and cosmonauts. During those 24 hours, they observe 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over their silent blue planet, spinning past continents and cycling past seasons, taking in glaciers and deserts, the peaks of mountains and the swells of oceans. It is the second-shortest book to win the prize, and covers the briefest timeframe of any book on the shortlist. The shortest winning novel in the history of the prize was 1979s Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald, at 132 pages. Harvey previously told BBC Radio 4s Front Row programme she wrote Orbital over the course of successive lockdowns. I was writing about six people trapped in a tin can. It felt like there was something resonant about that and our experience of lockdown, of not being able to escape each other and also not being able to get to other people. Harvey previously made the longlist for the Booker Prize in 2009 with her debut novel, The Wilderness. This years shortlist had five women on its six-strong shortlist - the largest number of women represented in its 55-year history. The other nominees were:  James - Percival Everett (US)  Creation Lake - Rachel Kushner (US)  Held - Anne Michaels (Canada)  The Safekeep - Yael van der Wouden (Netherlands)  Stone Yard Devotion - Charlotte Wood (Australia) The prestigious prize is open to works of fiction written in English by authors anywhere in the world and published in the UK or Ireland. Previous winning authors include Margaret Atwood, Hilary Mantel, Bernardine Evaristo and Salman Rushdie. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Jetstar and Qantas said they had stopped flights to Bali on Wednesday for safety reasons because of volcanic ash, while plane tracking website Flightradar24 showed flights to the island by AirAsia and Virgin were also cancelled. Bali is Indonesias top tourist hotspot and is a popular destination for Australian visitors. The first eruption of the Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki on Nov. 3 in the East Nusa Tenggara province, about 800 km (497 miles)from Bali, killed at least nine people. It has since erupted repeatedly, including multiple times on Tuesday. From Nov. 4 to Nov. 12, 80 flights in Bali were cancelled, including from Singapore, Hong Kong, and several Australian cities, said Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, general manager of Balis Ngurah Rai airport. Indonesia has close to 130 active volcanoes and sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity atop various tectonic plates.

        "content": "The U.S. Embassy in Colombo has lifted the travel restrictions issued to American citizens on October 23, 2024, for the Arugam Bay area in Sri Lanka. In its latest travel security update, the U.S. Embassy in Colombo encourages all U.S. citizens to review the Travel Advisory for Sri Lanka, maintain vigilance, be aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activity and emergencies to local authorities (119). It was widely reported yesterday that the government had requested the US Embassy in Colombo to lift its adverse travel advisory warning its citizens to stay away from travelling to the east coast surfing resort of Arugam Bay. The embassy on October 23 warned tourists to stay away from Arugam Bay following credible information received on a possible attack. Later, as the UK and other countries followed suit with travel warnings, it transpired that Israeli tourists were the targets. The Sri Lankan government had subsequently requested the US authorities to do away with the adverse advisory, according to reports. Sri Lanka Police arrested six locals following the information received by the government and a special security network had been established to prevent possible attacks against all tourist sites favoured by foreigners. The US Ambassador in Colombo Julie Chung had defended the Embassy action claiming it was not a travel ban but a precaution against any incidents from taking place.",

        "content": "The Attorney General has informed the Supreme Court that the Department of Excise has decided to suspend the licenses of five liquor manufacturers, including W.M. Mendis  Co. Ltd., if they fail to pay arrears taxes before November 30, 2024. Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle, representing the Excise Commissioner General, informed the court of this when a fundamental rights petition filed by social activist Sanjaya Mahawaththa and others was taken up today (13). The petition was heard before a bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda, and Priyantha Fernando. The Additional Solicitor General stated that five liquor manufacturing companies including W. M. Mendis  Co Ltd and Royal Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd, that have been named as respondents, have agreed to pay the arrears by the end of the month. He also reiterated the Excise Departments decision to suspend their licenses if payments are not made on time. The three-judge panel ordered a follow-up hearing on January 22, directing the respondents to report on their progress. According to the case report, the tax arrears owed by these companies amount to nearly Rs. 6 billion. The petitioners argue that the prolonged tax defaults have significantly impacted the national economy and requested that the Excise Department enforce the collection of overdue taxes and suspend licenses for non-compliance. CORRECTION: The article had previously incorrectly named Royal Casks Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd as one of the liquor manufacturers with tax arrears and has now been corrected as Royal Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd.",

The customs officers had resorted to a union action of carrying out only the work related to their official duties, in protest against the alleged false accusations levelled against them by container truck owners and drivers during an observation visit by Minister Vijitha Herath to the Colombo Port on November 07. This had resulted in a serious delay in the clearing of the containers at the port. However, the President of the Customs Trade Union Alliance stated that the decision to carry out only duty-related activities was temporarily suspended considering that the container truck drivers and assistants would not be able to vote due to having to park their container trucks. The President of the alliance Mr. Amila Sanjeeva said the following during a press conference this afternoon (13): We can see that there is a lot of container traffic in the clearing yards with this action. The country is in a special situation. The General Election will be held tomorrow. The right to vote is everyones right. Therefore, until the end of the election, in order to allow the truck drivers and assistants to vote, we have decided to work under some restrictions by keeping the container trucks in the port premises in such a way that the roads will not be blocked. We have not found an acceptable solution to these problems. Therefore, from next Monday, we will inform our members again to proceed according to the instructions we issued on November 12.",

These will include records for births, marriages, and deaths that have been registered since January 1, 1960.

        "date": "November 14, 2024 08:01 am",
        "content": "Over 17 million Sri Lankans will have the chance to vote for the countrys tenth Parliament election weeks after Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lankas presidential election after a historic second round of counting. This snap election, called by the new President, is expected to have significant ramifications for the nations political gridlock, particularly as the National Peoples Power (NPP) party led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which currently holds only three seats, seeks to establish itself as the dominant political force. A total of 17,140,354 Sri Lankans are eligible to vote in this years Parliamentary Election, with the Gampaha District registering the highest number of voters with 1,881,129. Colombo District is second with 1,765,351 registered voters, and Kurunegala District has 1,417,226 voters. The Northern Province has a combined total of 899,268 registered voters. However, during the 2024 Presidential Poll held on 21 September 2024, over 3.5 million citizens who were eligible to vote, had not casted their votes during 2024 Presidential Election. Out of 17,140,354 registered voters, a total of 13,619,916 had cast their votes in the Presidential Election which is 79.46, while 3,520,438 (21.54) did not vote. The voting will take place at polling stations established across the island from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. today (14). Eligible voters are required to carry one of nine accepted forms of identification to cast their vote: 1. National Identity Card (NIC) 2. Valid Passport 3. Valid Driving License 4. Public Service Retirement ID 5. Elders Identity Card 6. ID Cards provided to clergy 7. Confirmation letter of NIC information 8. Temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for disabled persons 9. Temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for others Unlike during usual elections, voters will have their left hands index finger, instead of the little finger, marked with an appropriate sign to prevent double voting and ensure transparency during 2024 Parliamentary Poll. This decision comes in light of concerns about possible confusion during the polling process for the Presidential Election 2024, which took place recently. Meanwhile, if a voters left index finger is unavailable, the mark will be applied to another finger, as suitable, according to the Election Commission. The Election Commission has also issued guidelines on the proper voting and preference-marking procedure. Each voter has one vote, which can be cast for a recognized political party or an independent group. To do so, an x mark should be placed in front of the chosen political partys symbol or in the space before the number and symbol of the independent group. Additionally, voters may express their preference for up to three candidates nominated by the selected party or group by placing an x in the space containing the number assigned to each candidate at the end of the ballot paper. The Election Commission clarified that any ballot showing votes for multiple political parties or independent groups, or containing identifiable marks other than the specified x, will be considered invalid. Meanwhile, only an x mark should be used for both voting and indicating candidate preferences, as per the election regulatory body. Additionally, the Election Commission has announced guidelines regarding leave for public and private sector employees to allow them to vote. The guidelines are as follows:  Half-day leave if the polling station is within 40 km of the workplace.  One days leave if the distance is between 40 and 100 km.  One and a half days leave for distances between 100 and 150 km.  Two days leave for distances exceeding 150 km. The postal voting for the General Election commenced on October 30, and continued on November 1 and 4 where more than 700,000 of the registered voters had qualified for the advance voting process. Through this election, a total of 225 Members of Parliament will be elected, comprising 196 members elected by public vote and 29 members entering through the national list. Each electoral district has been allocated a designated number of seats, with Gampaha District receiving the highest number of parliamentary seats at 19 and a bonus seat, while Trincomalee District has been allocated the lowest number, with 4 seats. The political party or independent group securing the highest number of votes in the district is entitled to have one member declared elected to the Bonus seat. The remaining number of members is declared elected on the basis of the proportion of votes obtained by the political party or the independent group. In terms of section 99 (6) (a) of the Constitution, a recognised political party or independent group polling less than 5 percent of the total votes polled within the district is disqualified and the balance valid votes are reckoned for allocation of seats on the basis of the proportional computation. Dissanayake won the presidential election in September with 42.3 of the vote. Sri Lankans ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July 2022 after the economy tipped into its worst crisis under his watch. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had been appointed prime minister only two months earlier, took over as interim president. A record 38 contenders vied for Sri Lankas presidency. For the first time in the countrys history, election officials counted the second-preference votes after no candidate secured 50 percent. After a historic first of second round of counting, the country of Sri Lanka has elecetd a new president  Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The 55-year-old fended off competition from opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, while current President, Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third. Just after the polling ended, the Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake described the 2024 Presidential Election as the best in the nations electoral history, emphasizing that the election process was notably peaceful, with no reports of violence during the polling period. Dissanayake dissolved parliament soon after his voctory and called for elections to consolidate power so that he could enact crucial laws. Soon after the General Election date was declared, former President Wickremesinghe, along with many senior political figures, announced that he will not contest the general election. The Rajapaksa family has similarly opted out. This leaves Sajith Premadasas SJB as the main challenger to the NPP. The election watchdogs described the pre-election period of this years General Election as more peaceful with the lowest number of instances of public resource misuse and public property violations, while present, have not reached critical levels. The Executive Director of the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi earlier stated that despite 8,888 candidates vying for positions in this years General Election, fewer than 1,000 were actively campaigning, reflecting a notable decline in political engagement. Looking toward the election date, the Supreme Court has dismissed challenges against the election date, paving the way for what could be one of the most contentious and transformative elections in Sri Lankas history. The inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament, comprising of members elected through this process, is scheduled to commence on November 21, as per the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 240313 dated 2024.09.24 issued by the President, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "title": "Israel removes severe travel warning for Sri Lankas Arugam Bay",
        "date": "November 14, 2024 09:46 am",
        "content": "Israeli authorities eased a travel warning for Sri Lanka on Wednesday, some three weeks after cautioning tourists at a popular beach town of an imminent terrorist threat. The National Security Council, which publishes travel advisories, said it was lowering the warning level for Sri Lankas Arugam Bay area from four, which indicates a highly credible threat, to two, indicating a more mild occasional threat. The high-level threat area had extended across Sri Lankas southeastern coast as far as the town of Hikkaduwa. The rest of the island nation was lowered from level three  moderate  to level two. The NSC says the threat level is being updated from level 4 (high) in the southwest of the country and level 3 (moderate) in the rest of Sri Lanka, to level 2 (an occasional threat) for the entire country. The NSC says Israeli travelers should alert local security forces if there are any hostilities toward Jews or Israelis, and cautions against wearing Jewish or Israeli symbols. Last month, the NSC called on Israelis to leave Sri Lankas south and west, and said Israelis should postpone travel to the rest of the country. They also urged nationals to hide signs that indicate they are Israelis and avoid gathering in large numbers. The United States, which had also issued a warning for Arugam Bay, rescinded its advisory as well on Wednesday, the embassy in Colombo said. According to an affidavit filed in US federal court late last week, an Afghani man named Farhad Shakeri, recruited by Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told the FBI on October 28 that he and an accomplice had been ordered to plan a mass shooting attack against Israelis at an unnamed location in Arugam Bay, a popular spot for Israeli surfers chasing an endless summer. The accomplice, whom the filing identified as one of three people arrested by Sri Lankan authorities a day after the warning was issued, had agreed to provide AK-47s and other weapons for the attack, according to the complaint. The accomplice was unnamed, but was said to have served prison time with Shakeri in the US. According to reports, three others have since been arrested. No details were available on the suspects. Israel had advised its nationals in Arugam Bay and nearby areas to leave immediately on October 23, citing the threat of terrorist attacks against several targets, including popular terrorist locations in Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Israelis remaining in the country were advised to go to Colombo, where there were more local security forces, and to hide anything that might identify them as Israelis or avoid gathering in large numbers. The decision to downgrade the warning came two days after Sri Lankas Foreign Ministry asked the US to cancel its warning. Sri Lankan authorities had bolstered security for tourists following the warnings and on Sunday Defense Secretary Sampath Thuyacontha visited the area around Arugam Bay to assess the security situation. Israels National Security Council cautioned travelers Wednesday to remain vigilant while visiting the country, leaving in place the advisory against wearing Jewish or Israeli symbols. Protests by local Muslim groups against Israels war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have drawn support from the wider community in the predominantly Buddhist South Asian nation. The war broke out following Hamass October 7 onslaught last year, which saw terrorists kill some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnap 251. The Starting the next day, Lebanese terror group Hezbollah has been firing at Israel on a near-daily basis. Israelis accounted for less than 1.5 percent of the 1.5 million tourists who visited the island in the first nine months of this year  or around 20,000 people altogether. But Arugam Bay, a hotspot for surfing around 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Colombo by road, is a popular destination for Israeli tourists. Shakeri, the IRGC agent named in the US court filing, remains at large and is thought to be in Iran. According to the complaint, aside from allegedly plotting to attack Israelis at Arugam Bay, he had also plotted attacks for Iran against US President-elect Donald Trump, as well as attempted assassinations of Jewish businesspeople in New York and a prominent Iranian exile.

        "content": "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka requests voters to visit their respective voting centers in the morning and cast their votes at the earliest possible opportunities. The Chairman of the Election Commission, R.M.A.L. Ratnayake, urged voters to make sure that they take a valid document to confirm their identity when vising polling centers. However, he clarified that not receiving an official polling card will not be an obstacle for registered voters to cast their votes. If you have not received an official polling card, there is no issue. If you have a valid Identity Card you will get the opportunity to cast your vote. National Identity Card (NIC), Valid Passport, Valid Driving License, Public Service Retirement ID, elders Identity Card, ID cards provided to clergy, confirmation letter of NIC information, temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for disabled persons or the temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for others. If you have one of these accepted forms of identification youre eligible to cast your vote, he said. The Election Commission has also issued guidelines on the proper voting and preference-marking procedure. Each voter has one vote, which can be cast for a recognized political party or an independent group. To do so, an x mark should be placed in front of the chosen political partys symbol or in the space before the number and symbol of the independent group. Additionally, voters may express their preference for up to three candidates nominated by the selected party or group by placing an x in the space containing the number assigned to each candidate at the end of the ballot paper. The Election Commission clarified that any ballot showing votes for multiple political parties or independent groups, or containing identifiable marks other than the specified x, will be considered invalid. Meanwhile, only an x mark should be used for both voting and indicating candidate preferences, as per the election regulatory body.",

        "title": "Republicans win majority of US House seats, giving Donald Trump and party control of govt",
        "date": "November 14, 2024 12:45 pm",
        "content": "Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the partys sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats. With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trumps vision for the country. The incoming president has promised to carry out the countrys largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal governments most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it. When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time. When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his Make America Great Again movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed. Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election. I suspect I wont be running again unless you say, Hes good, we got to figure something else, Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trumps endorsement won the Republican Conferences nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a blowtorch to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an ambitious 100-day agenda. Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate, Johnson said earlier this week. The American people want us to implement and deliver that America First agenda. Trumps allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fierce loyalist, for attorney general. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said GOP lawmakers are not taking anything off the table in their plans to investigate Special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Still, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trumps decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration  Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far  could complicate Johnsons ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress. Gaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years. With the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson  at times with Trumps help  largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trumps election victory. The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses. In the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history. Thune in the past has been critical of Trump, but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid. This Republican team is united. We are on one team, Thune said. We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trumps agenda. The GOPs Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Still, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver. Meanwhile, Trumps social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the worlds richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a despicable human being in his private notes. However, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "A man killed himself with a bomb outside Brazils Supreme Court after trying to enter the building on Wednesday, officials said, stirring security concerns before the country hosts global leaders from the Group of 20 major economies. The blasts come five days before the G20 heads of state meet in Rio de Janeiro, followed by a state visit to the capital Brasilia by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The first of two explosions went off on Wednesday evening in a parking lot near the court building and a second blast came seconds later in front of the court, where the mans body was found. Federal District Vice Governor Celina Leao said preliminary information suggested the man had killed himself with explosives after trying to enter the Supreme Court. She said he owned a nearby car in which another explosion blew open the trunk. Leao said she hoped it was the crime of a lone wolf, but she could not be sure. Police said they had not made a final identification of the dead man as they were confronting the risk of additional explosives on the body. The explosions took place around the Plaza of the Three Powers, an iconic square in Brasilia connecting the principal buildings of Brazils three branches of federal government. It was the scene of riots on Jan. 8 last year when supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the buildings to protest his electoral defeat. Police deployed a bomb squad with an explosive disposal robot to the square in the heart of Brazilian capital to investigate the blasts. The Supreme Court justices had just ended a plenary session when the blasts happened and were quickly evacuated safely, the court said in a statement. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had left the executive palace on Wednesday night shortly before the explosions. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Australia will require social media platforms to act to prevent online harm to users",
        "date": "November 14, 2024 04:46 pm",
        "content": "Australia plans to require social media platforms to act to prevent online harms to users such as bullying, predatory behavior and algorithms pushing destructive content, the government said Thursday. The Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement. The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments. Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images. Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union. Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said. Legislating a duty of care would mean services cant set and forget. Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said. The categories of harm in the legislation include harm to young people and mental well-being, promotion of harmful practices and illegal activity. The government has not said when the duty of care legislation will be introduced to Parliament or outlined the punishment for breaches. The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia better known as DIGI, welcomed government efforts to future-proof the Online Safety Act. DIGIs members together represent some of the safest sections of the Internet, and their work to keep people safe on their services never stops, DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. While we wait for further details about this announcement, DIGIs members will continue to deliver safety-by-design on their services and work constructively with the government to keep Australians safe online, Bose added. Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet described the duty of care as a great idea. Its quite pioneering to expect that platforms that host Australian users would have a duty of care responsibility in terms of the content they show and the experiences they offer, Barnet said. Its making the platforms take responsibility and that just simply doesnt happen at the moment. Theres an assumption that theyre a neutral third party. Theyre not responsible for the impact of that content, Barnet added. Source: AP --Agencies",
