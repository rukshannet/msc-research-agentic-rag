There, the officials shared their concerns over the persistent delays in container clearances which have been ongoing for about two years. They pointed out that, about two to three years ago despite following all the methods, around 1,800 to 2,000 containers could be dispatched from the port daily. However, they noted that recently, there have been several irregularities in the container clearance process and even when a token number is assigned for container clearance, the containers do not exit the port in the proper order. Additionally, the officials also revealed that the causes for the delays are that some of the workers are performing their duties while under the influence of alcohol, while others have been neglecting their duties and attending funerals. Therefore, the officials requested the minister to provide them with the opportunity to carry out container clearances efficiently, without corruption or interference.",

Another boat nearby raised the alarm after reporting the 129-ton ship was going under at around 4:30 a.m. (1930 GMT on Thursday), prompting authorities to launch a rescue operation, said Chung Moo-won, a Jeju coast guard official. Of the 27 crew aboard, 15 were rescued, including two South Korean nationals who later died after being hospitalised, Chung said. Twelve people were still missing, two of them from Indonesia. A total of 43 vessels including three navy ships, 13 aircraft and several deep-sea divers were dispatched to assist in the rescue efforts, he said. We offer our condolences to the bereaved families and will make utmost efforts to find the missing by mobilising all rescue equipment and resources, Chung told a televised briefing. One of the rescued sailors told the Yonhap news agency that the boat capsized when they were hauling up fishing nets to transfer the catch to another vessel. Chung said authorities would look into the exact cause of the accident by interviewing survivors. President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered all available resources to be deployed for the operation while ensuring the rescue workers safety, his office said in a statement. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo also called for the defence ministry to supply military flares and aircraft to support night operations. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 8, 2024 03:11 pm",
        "content": "Indias three-decade ban on importing author Salman Rushdies controversial The Satanic Verses book has effectively been lifted after a court said the government was unable to produce the original notification that imposed the ban. The India-born British authors novel was banned by India in 1988 after some Muslims viewed it as blasphemous. The Delhi High Court was hearing a 2019 case challenging the import ban of the book in India. According to a Nov. 5 court order, Indias government told the Delhi High Court that the import ban order was untraceable and, therefore could not be produced. As a result, the court said it had no other option except to presume that no such notification exists. The ban has been lifted as of Nov. 5 because there is no notification, Uddyam Mukherjee, lawyer for petitioner Sandipan Khan, said. Indias interior and finance ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Khans plea said he approached the court after being told at book stores that the novel could not be sold or imported in India and then when he searched, he could not find the official import ban order on the government websites. Even in court the government has been unable to produce the order, he said. None of the respondents could produce the said notification ... in fact the purported author of the said notification has also shown his helplessness in producing a copy, the Nov. 5 order noted, referring to the customs department official who drafted the order. Rushdies fourth fictional novel ran into a global controversy shortly after its publication in September 1988, as some Muslims saw passages about Prophet Muhammad as blasphemous. It sparked violent demonstrations and book burnings across the Muslim world, including in India, which has the worlds third largest Muslim population. In 1989, Irans then supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling on Muslims to assassinate Rushdie, sending the Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for six years. In August 2022, about 33 years after the fatwa, Rushdie was stabbed on stage during a lecture in New York, which left him blind in one eye and affected the use of one of his hands.

        "title": "Elon Musks net worth jumps 26.5 billion after Trumps election victory",
        "date": "November 8, 2024 03:31 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, had his net worth surge by an incredible 26.5 billion when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Trumps pro-business policies and deregulation stance have been credited by investors with the stock market surge that has increased the wealth of the CEOs of SpaceX and Tesla. Along with other well-known billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, and Warren Buffett, who also saw significant increases in their fortune, Musks gain was one of the largest among the titans of the IT industry. Musks rise in wealth is indicative of Teslas strong market position, which has been reinforced by investor expectations of advantageous regulatory reforms under a Trump administration. Musks ownership of Tesla greatly increased his overall fortune when stocks in manufacturing and technology firms soared following Trumps victory. This increase demonstrates investor optimism in industries led by Musk, such as energy storage, electric vehicles, and space exploration. Tech billionaires observe windfall during policy speculations Musk made a stunning 26.5 billion boost, while other tech giants saw big gains as well. With their own significant increases in net worth, Berkshire Hathaways Warren Buffett, Oracles Larry Ellison, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also benefited from the stock market boom alongside Musk. The response of the market indicates a general perception that Trumps presidency will have a positive effect on the sectors in which these tech titans work. Large enterprises are expected to receive tax breaks, relaxed restrictions, and other incentives from investors, which could facilitate their growth and innovation. Trumps business-friendly policies are thought to encourage expansion in the energy, financial, and technological industries. Stocks of businesses like Tesla, whose breakthroughs in renewable energy storage and electric automobiles keep attracting the curiosity of investors and consumers alike, have benefited from these expectations. Musk is well-positioned to gain more advantages under Trumps government because of his goals, which include developing battery technology and seeking sustainable energy solutions. Potential impacts on the broader technology industry Elon Musks enormous net worth rise shows the serious implications of political changes on the tech sector, as investors grow more perceptive of changes in regulations that impact innovation and expansion. Now that Trump has won, there may be even more opportunities for growth for tech firms like Amazon, Tesla, and Oracle, since less regulations could encourage RD spending. Not only does this atmosphere help well-established digital titans, but it also establishes a favorable standard for startups and new businesses looking to enter competitive marketplaces. How Musks wealth boost could influence future ventures This significant rise in net worth not only strengthens Musks position as one of the worlds richest people, but it also makes it easier for him to take on risky projects. In addition to accessing new markets and increasing production, Musk has laid out extensive plans for Tesla. Additionally, the increase in wealth might help SpaceX achieve its ambitious expensive goals of space exploration and Mars settlement. Musk is well-positioned to advance these innovative initiatives with significant financial support as investors support SpaceX and Tesla. Musks wealth increase shows how governmental changes, particularly those that are favorable to business, may have an instantaneous and long-lasting impact on market performance and personal wealth. The markets reaction to Trumps policies may have an impact on these billionaires development plans and investment choices as they continue to influence sectors ranging from aerospace to e-commerce.

        "date": "November 9, 2024 08:28 am",
        "content": "The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70 of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. The U.N. tally since the start of the war, in which Israels military is fighting Hamas militants, includes only fatalities it has managed to verify with three sources, and counting continues. The 8,119 victims verified is a much lower number than the toll of more than 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the 13-month-old war. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war. This finding indicates a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality, the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report. It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said. Israels diplomatic mission to the U.N. in Geneva said it categorically rejected the report. Once again, OHCHR fails to accurately reflect the realities on the ground, and disregards the extensive role of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in deliberately causing civilian harm in Gaza, it said, referring to the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights. The Israelis say Hamas deliberately hides among civilians and uses them as human shields, so the militants have responsibility for their deaths. Israel reports that approximately one civilian has been killed for every fighter, a ratio it blames on Hamas. Hamas has denied using civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as human shields. Israels military, which began its offensive in response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in which Israel says Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, said it took great effort to mitigate harm to civilians. Comprehensive processes ensure forces complied with the law of armed conflict, with a regulated, multi-tiered process for approving attacks that was designed to give commanders all reasonably available information, the military said. Every military action is carried out in accordance with the principles of distinction and proportionality, and is preceded by a careful assessment of the potential for civilian harm, the military said in a statement. YOUNGEST VICTIM AGED ONE DAY Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office for the occupied Palestinian Territory, told reporters at a briefing in Geneva that the fatalities included in the report were verified by three sources such as neighbours, family members, local NGOs, hospital records or U.N. staff on the ground. The numbers are, of course, massive compared to previous years, so we do need time to catch up and verify, he said, adding that he thought the final U.N. tally was likely to be similar to the Palestinian toll. The youngest victim whose death was verified by U.N. monitors was a one-day-old boy, and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman, the report said. Overall, those aged 18 or under represented 44 of the victims, with children aged 5 to 9 representing the single biggest age category, followed by those aged 10-14, and then those aged up to and including 4. This broadly reflects the enclaves demographics, which the report said was evidence of an apparent failure to take precautions to avoid civilian losses. The report found that in 88 of cases, five or more people were killed in the same attack, pointing to the Israeli militarys use of weapons with an effect across a wide area. It said some fatalities may have been the result of errant projectiles from Palestinian armed groups. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The meeting was held yesterday (08) focusing on determining if the Salinity Barrier is indeed contributing to the floods leading to agricultural damage, according to Presidents Media Division (PMD). It was decided that a thorough study is necessary to address these concerns and that the Engineering Department of the University of Peradeniya will assist in this investigation. The Secretary to the President supported this proposal and directed the officials to create an action plan based on the findings from the study. Additionally, officials reported that saltwater intrusion has adversely affected livelihoods, with many residents losing farmland. The Secretary highlighted that restoring normal conditions is both a government and official responsibility and directed further action to address flooding in the Matara area, the PMD stated. Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake has instructed officials to prepare a proposal based on a study by the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Peradeniya. The solutions derived from this report will guide the second phase of the project, with necessary funding requests to be submitted. He also emphasized the importance of implementing a structured flood management plan for the Matara district and directed the coordination between the Irrigation Department and Water Supply and Drainage Board to establish a sustainable flood management plan in Matara, said the PMD. The Secretary noted that there have been complaints from residents by the river banks regarding the adverse effects of the salinity barrier, which has led to the loss of farmland and livelihoods along the Nilwala River. He stressed that it is the governments responsibility to address this issue urgently and to restore normalcy.

        "content": "The Peoples Republic of China has provided financial assistance totaling approximately Rs. 30 million to compensate for damage to houses and properties caused by natural disasters from January 1 to October 30, 2024. This amount has been forwarded to the Treasury, according to the PMD. In addition, the Department of National Budget has allocated further financial provisions to the Ministry of Defence for the reconstruction of homes affected by the disasters. The Department of Treasury Operations has promptly released these funds to the Ministry of Defence, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. These additional provisions were necessary because the 2024 budget did not include adequate funds to address the needs of disaster victims, it said. Furthermore, material assistance worth 10 million Yuan is expected from the Peoples Republic of China under the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Program. The goods will be properly accounted for and distributed once received, the PMD said. Finally, steps have been taken to ensure the timely disbursement of compensation for damaged homes and properties, as well as the swift completion of reconstruction and renovation efforts, through the Disaster Relief and Monitoring Project. --PMD--",

        "title": "Beyoncé leads 2025 Grammy noms, becoming most nominated artist in history",
        "date": "November 9, 2024 11:29 am",
        "content": "Welcome to Beyoncé country. When it comes to the 2025 Grammy Award nominations, Cowboy Carter rules the nation. She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history. Cowboy Carter is up for album and country album of the year, and Texas Hold Em is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories. This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88. If Beyoncé wins the album of the year, shell become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys top prize. Post Malone also received his first ever nominations in the country categories this year, having released his debut country album F-1 Trillion in August. That one is up for country album and I Had Some Help, his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, is nominated for country song and country duogroup performance. They are Wallens first ever Grammy nominations. Malone is just behind Beyoncé, with seven nominations, tied with Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli XCX, who earned her first nominations as a solo artist. Lamars ubiquitous diss track released during his feud with Drake, Not Like Us, is nominated for record and song of the year, rap song, music video as well as best rap performance. He has two simultaneous entries in the latter category, a career first: Future  Metro Boomin featuring Lamar, Like That is up for best rap performance and best rap song. This is his third time receiving two simultaneous nominations for best rap song. Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each. Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside Cowboy Carter is André 3000s new age, alt-jazz New Blue Sun and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Colliers Djesse Vol. 4. Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with Short n Sweet and The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess respectively, as well as Swifts The Tortured Poets Department, Eilishs Hit Me Hard and Soft, and Charli XCXs rave-ready BRAT. Eilish is the only artist to have her first three albums become nominated for album of the year. Last year, Swift won album of the year for Midnights, breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. This year, she becomes the first ever woman to seven career nominations in the category. The breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting, says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. Weve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible. Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3. In the best new artist category, Carpenter and Roan will go head-to-head, alongside Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. In the song of the year category, Beyoncé is joined by Eilish with Birds of a Feather, Swift and Post Malone with Fortnight, Roans Good Luck, Babe!, Carpenters Please Please Please, Lamars Not Like Us, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars Die With A Smile, and Shaboozeys A Bar Song (Tipsy). Shaboozey is also a first-time nominee. His A Bar Song (Tipsy) is the biggest song of the year, having spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other  it is so popular, a remix of the track is also up for remixed recording. Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyoncés SPAGHETTII. Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination. For record of the year, Texas Hold Em will compete against Swift and Post Malones Fortnight, Eilishs Birds of a Father, Lamars Not Like Us, Roans Good Luck, Babe!, Carpenters Espresso, Charli XCXs 360, and the Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted Now and Then. Were trying to make sure were keeping up with how music creators and our community are using technology. And in this case, AI enhanced the record and allowed it to be eligible in the categories that it was eligible in, Mason jr explains. Dolly Parton scored her 55th career nomination in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category for her Behind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones, news The Associated Press broke to the country music legend Friday morning. No! What did I get nominated for? she cheered over the phone. Oh, well, thats cool. I thought it would be for my rock album, Id take it. It feels good. Im always appreciative of everything. I dont work for that, but its always good to say youve done good work, and for somebody to acknowledge that. So, Im always proud of every award I get and every mention I get. That just makes me feel like Im doing the right thing. Shes up against producer Guy Oldfield, George Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Jimmy Carter, who could become the oldest Grammy award winner in history at 100. So, whats missing? Like last year, theres a huge dearth of Latin music  the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States  across the board, and no representation in the major categories. There are also only four entries in the best Música Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres. And K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members whove released solo material this year: RMs Right Place, Wrong Person, J-Hopes Hope on the Street, Vol. 1, and Jimins Muse. As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across their career. I definitely see room for improvement across many genres and we are continuing to invite people to be a part of the academy, Mason jr. says. Without the right representation we dont get the right results. When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of whats happening in music today. So, the work continues. The 2025 Grammy Awards will air Feb. 2 live on CBS and Paramount from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "At least 24 people were killed and more than 40 injured in a bomb blast at a railway station in Quetta in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, police and other officials told Reuters. Pakistan is grappling with a surge in strikes by separatist ethnic militants in the south and Islamist militants in its northwest. Inspector general of police for Balochistan, Mouzzam Jah Ansari, said 24 people have died from the blast so far. The target was army personnel from the Infantry School, he said, with many of the injured in critical condition. So far 44 injured people have been brought to civil hospital, Dr. Wasim Baig, a hospital spokesman, told Reuters. Senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said the blast seemed to be a suicide bomb and that investigations were underway for more information. The blast took place inside the railway station when the Peshawar-bound express was about to leave for its destination, Baloch said. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast at Quettas main railway station, which is usually busy early in the day. In August, at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways. The assaults in August were the most widespread in years by militants fighting a decades-long insurgency to win secession of the resource-rich southwestern province, home to major China-led projects such as a port and a gold and copper mine.

        "date": "November 9, 2024 03:44 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice has on Friday charged an Iranian asset Farhad Shakeri, who is accused in a plot to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, and claim that he was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. The Justice Department on Friday announced federal charges in a thwarted Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump before the presidential election. According to court documents, Iranian officials asked Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump. Shakeri is still at large in Iran, the Justice Department said. This is a newly disclosed plot and marks yet another alleged attempt on Trumps life by the Iranian regime, the CNN reported. Prosecutors allege Shakeri  who participated in recorded conversations with law enforcement  was originally tasked by Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps to carrying out other assassinations against US and Israeli citizens inside the US. But IRGC officials told Shakeri on October 7 to focus only on Trump, court documents say, and that he had seven days to formulate an assassination plan. Shakeri, who is an Afghan national residing in Tehran, told investigators that if he was unable to do come up with a plan in that timeframe, the IRGC would wait until after the presidential election to move forward as they believed Trump would lose. Two other individuals charged on Friday, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, who are American citizens, were arrested in New York and are accused of helping the Iranian government surveil a separate US citizen of Iranian origin. They made their initial appearance in court on Thursday, the Justice Department said, and are being detained pending trial. Shakeri also said he was tasked with surveilling and assassinating two individuals described only as Jewish businesspeople living in New York City. IRGC officials, prosecutors say, also asked Shakeri to help plan a mass shooting targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka, prompting US and Sri Lankann authorities to warn travelers about threats of an attack. The complaint by the FBI agent states the following facts in relation to the plot to attack Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka: According to SHAKERI, IRGC Official-I also asked SHAKERI to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka and to plan a mass shooting event in approximately October 2024. On or about October 23, 2024, the governments of the United States and Israel publicly warned travelers about threats of an attack targeting tourist locations in the Arugam By area, and, on or about the following day, Sri Lankan authorities reported having arrested three individuals in connection with the threat. One of the individuals arrested was identified as CC-2. On or about October 28, 2024-after the public travel warnings issued by the governments of the United States and Israel and after CC-2s arrest by Sri Lankan authorities-SHAKERI advised the FBI that he had previously tasked CC-2 with surveilling the Israeli consulate in Sri Lanka. SHAKERI stated that he and CC-2 had served time in prison together. SHAKERI informed the FBI that he had provided this surveillance to IRGC Official-1. According to SHAKERI, after being provided surveillance on the Israeli consulate, IRGC Official-1 asked SHAKERI to identify another target, and SHAKERI then instructed CC-2 to surveil a tourist location in Arugam Bay frequented by Israeli tourists. IRGC Official-I instructed SHAKERI to orchestrate a mass shooting at the Arugam Bay location. And, according to SHAKERI, they planned that CC-2 would supply AK47s and other weapons for the attack. Iran has categorically dismissed the Justice Departments allegation. The Foreign Ministry, posting on social media platform X on Saturday, described the claims as completely baseless and rejected, adding that similar accusations have been made in the past, which Iran has firmly denied and proven false. The claims amount to a malicious conspiracy aimed at further complicating the issues between the US and Iran, the ministry said. Background of Farhad Shakeri Shakeri, an asset of the IRGC based in Tehran, immigrated to the US as a child. He was deported in 2008 after serving 14 years for a robbery conviction. In recent months, Shakeri has been involved in leveraging a network of criminal associates he met in US prisons to assist the IRGC. He has reportedly been supplying the IRGC with operatives for conducting surveillance and assassinations targeting individuals of interest, according to the US Department of Justice. Though he was deported in 2008, his parole monitoring continued until 2015. In 2019, he was detained in Sri Lanka in connection with the seizure of a large quantity of heroin, highlighting an ongoing series of alleged criminal activities linked to his network. Shakeri faces multiple charges, including conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, which could result in up to 20 years in prison. He is also charged with providing material support to the same organisation, as well as conspiring to violate sanctions against the Iranian government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, each of which carries a potential 20-year prison sentence. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "November 9, 2024 09:53 pm",
        "content": "The Computer Crime Investigation Division (CCID) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has uncovered a large-scale online financial scams racket in Colombo. A total of 59 suspects, including two persons who headed the racket, were arrested on suspicion of orchestrating the scheme. According to police, the scammers targeted foreign nationals, defrauding victims of an estimated Rs. 300 million. The Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka filed a complaint with the CID on Thursday reporting that a Sri Lanka-based company by the name of Wavetec, had scammed a Korean national out of approximately Rs. 300 million under the guise of business investments. According to the complaint, about US 1 million was obtained from the Korean national on several occasions under the pretext of investing in business activities, and later they had avoided paying back the money. The CIDs CCID officers had later uncovered that the operation was being carried out from a luxury apartment complex on Havelock Road, Colombo. In a raid yesterday (08), they arrested 57 Sri Lankan nationals, including 23 women - two of whom are pregnant. Police reported that the suspects were multilingual, with some proficient in over five languages. Following the interrogation of the suspects, the sleuths managed to arrest the Director (a female attorney) and the Manager of the operation. The arrested employees had claimed they had been hired for IT jobs but had only undergone language proficiency tests in Japanese, Korean, and German prior to being hired. This location was raided yesterday. The facility was maintained with a monthly rent exceeding Rs. 9 million, Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa stated. The apartments 40th floor had been partitioned, and employees were instructed to avoid contact with others. The suspects alleged they were unaware of the fraud, stating they received salaries ranging from Rs. 150,000 to Rs. 600,000, with no knowledge of how the funds from foreign investors were handled. Upon raiding the premises, the police found the computer systems had been disabled, and fake investment documents were discovered. Investigators noted that Wavetec was officially registered, which added a veneer of legitimacy that misled even embassy officials. The director and manager reportedly lived lavish lifestyles, funded by the operations proceeds. Investigators revealed that the duo managed three similar operations and promptly shut down the other facilities after the raid, instructing their employees not to report to work. Defense attorneys argued that some of the detained employees were new hires, many under the age of 25, who had not even received their first paychecks yet. Following the hearing, the Colombo Magistrates Court remanded the director and manager in remand custody until November 12 while the other suspects were each released on two sureties of Rs. 1 million each.",

        "title": "Qatar suspends role as mediator between Israel and Hamas",
        "date": "November 10, 2024 07:51 am",
        "content": "Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say. The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel show their willingness to negotiate. It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza. Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamass political office in Doha no longer serves its purpose were inaccurate. Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round, a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said. Qatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war. Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration. Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith. But the foreign ministry said the reports were inaccurate. The claims have also been denied by Hamas officials. The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia. Alongside the US and Egypt, the Qataris have also played a major role in rounds of so-far unsuccessful talks to broker a ceasefire in the year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But there is growing evidence of a shift in the relationship. After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas held a two-hour mourning tent in Doha in a small hall, a stark contrast to the recent three-day mourning held for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was conducted with official state oversight and security. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. The group has always called for a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The Qatari foreign ministry statement said: Media reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha is inaccurate. The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication... which has contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages. Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals. Days after being fired earlier this week, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rejecting a peace deal against the advice of his security chiefs. The call for Hamas to be expelled from Qatar appears to be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to force some sort of peace deal before the end of his term in January. Were Hamas to be forced to leave Doha, it is unclear where they would base their political office. Key ally Iran would be an option, although the assassination of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July suggests they may be at risk from Israel if based there. It would also not give them anything close to the same diplomatic channels to the West. A more likely option would be Turkey. As a Nato member but also a Sunni majority state, it would give the group a base from which to operate in relative safety. Last April President Erdogan hosted then Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and his delegation in Istanbul, where they talked about what needs to be done to ensure adequate and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and a fair and lasting peace process in the region. The move would also most likely be welcomed by Ankara, which has often sought to position itself as a broker between east and west. Key Hamas figures such as Osama Hamdan, Taher al-Nunu, and others frequently featured on news outlets have been staying in Istanbul for over a month. Their extended presence in Turkey marks a departure from past visits, which were typically limited to brief stays. It is thought the personal safety of Hamas leadership is now a major concern for the group, which saw two leaders killed in less than four months. As well as Haniyehs death in July, in October Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel. According to the European Council of Foreign Relations, Hamas has adopted a temporary model of collective leadership to mitigate the effect of future Israeli assassinations. H A Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC that nowhere will give them protection from Israeli assassination attempts in the same way that being in Doha, where America has its largest military base in the region, did. The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war. In October, the US Secretaries of State and Defense said if Israel did not allow more humanitarian aid into the territory by 12 November, they would face unspecified policy implications. Last weekend a number of UN officials warned the situation in northern Gaza was apocalyptic. On Saturday the independent Famine Review Committee said there was a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas. The relationship between President Joe Biden and Netanyahu has deteriorated over the course of the war in Gaza, with increasing pressure from Washington to improve the humanitarian situation for the Palestinians and find some sort of negotiated settlement. But, according to Dr Hellyer, US attempts at negotiation have been fatally flawed. By setting red lines and allowing Netanyahu to cross them without consequence, the Biden administration effectively encouraged further impunity. I dont think any of this will change in the next 10 weeks, he said. Any overtures have been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition, who will now also feel emboldened by the prospect of an incoming Donald Trump presidency. While exactly what approach Trump will take to the region remains uncertain, he is thought to be more likely to allow Israel to act on its terms. He has previously said Israel should finish what they started in Gaza. During his last term in the White House, he took a number of steps deemed highly favourable to Israel, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. It has also been reported, however, that Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants to see an end to the fighting by the time he takes office. Either way, it seems likely that the current US administration will have less influence over the government in Jerusalem. They may therefore believe the best way to force some sort of deal is to apply pressure on Hamas. Whether it pays off may depend on whether Qatar, so long a reliable ally, decides to go along with it. Source: BBC --Agencies",

It is the first time in history that the region of Al-Jawf, which lies at the northern edge of the Al-Nafūd desert, has experienced a snowfall. Footage shows the arid desert turned into an unexpected winter landscape, with the flakes still settling. A caravan of camels are seen treading cautiously on the layer of ice that covers the sand. People are shown getting out of their cars to capture the unprecedented weather. Temperatures in the Al-Nafūd desert could reach as high as 55C in places, so the sudden drop comes is a phenomenon. State media reported that heavy rainfall and hailstorms swept through parts of the Al-Jawf region on Monday. The United Arab Emirates National Centre of Meteorology attributed the unusual weather event to a low-pressure system moving from the Arabian Sea to Oman. This weather pattern has brought moisture-laden air into an area known for its arid conditions, leading to thunderstorms, hail, and rainfall across Saudi Arabia and the neighbouring UAE. The Saudi Weather Department has issued warnings of ongoing severe weather in the coming days. Thunderstorms, additional heavy rainfall, hail, and strong winds are expected to continue across the region, affecting visibility and disrupting travel.

        "content": "SpaceX has teased Marslink as a new high-speed internet connection between Mars and Earth, with Elon Musks startup using an adaption of its Starlink satellite network to pump internet connectivity to Mars. SpaceX presented Marslink to NASA with the aim of establishing a high-speed data relay system -- something capable of transmitting 4Mbps or more -- across 1.5 astronomical units (AUs), which is the distance between Earth and Mars. The Marslink concept sees multiple satellites in Mars orbit, using Starlinks advanced laser communications technology to maintain a constant, near-instantaneous data flow between planets. Elon Musk was recently at now President-elect Trumps rally wearing his iconic Occupy Mars t-shirt, and then days later were seeing Marslink unveiled to the world... which would serve perfectly into future missions to Mars, allowing real-time images and data streams blasted from Mars to Earth. Into the deeper (hopefully not too deep) future, Marslink will assist in ground operations and Mars orbit assets. SpaceX says in its Marslink concept proposed to NASA will be using multiple space satellites placed in Mars orbit to provide full visibility and interoperability for ground and orbital assets. The exciting new Marslink concept also exceeds the requested capability, and can also be used for imaging and monitoring Mars. The long-term vision of Starlink is far bigger than providing internet connectivity to millions of people across the world, but being able to transmit data, have video calls, and more with people in and around Mars? Thats an incredible feat for SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the United States. Elon isnt happy with the speeds already, stating that Earth and Mars will ultimately need  petabitsec connectivity.

        "content": "The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) has urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in writing to launch an immediate investigation into state-sanctioned crimes during the 1988-89 period, and serve justice for the lives of fallen Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) heroes including Rohana Wijeweera. Ahead of the 35th Il Maha Viru Samaruwa, the commemoration of fallen JVP heroes on November 13, the FSPs letter to the President, honoring Comrade Rohana Wijeweera and others who lost their lives in the struggle for socialist transformation, emphasized the need to uncover the truth behind kidnappings, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings attributed to state terrorism at that time. The FSP further stated that crimes against humanity were not limited to the 1988-89 southern uprisings but were also widespread during the civil conflict in the north. They highlighted past commissions and the Office of Missing Persons as steps taken by prior administrations, yet they argue these efforts have fallen short of true justice. Now that the President, leader of the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), has assumed office, the FSP calls on him to prioritize a comprehensive investigation, bringing to light the events surrounding the deaths and disappearances, including that of Rohana Wijeweera. As an initial step, the FSP proposes full disclosure of investigation findings to the public and accountability for those responsible. The party has pledged its support and offered to provide relevant evidence to assist in delivering justice to the victims and their families.",

        "title": "Veteran Kollywood actor Delhi Ganesh passes away",
        "date": "November 10, 2024 06:12 pm",
        "content": "Actor Delhi Ganesh, known for acing both comic and serious roles, passed away at his Chennai residence due to age-related ailments. He was 80. Ganesh was part of the generation of actors who successfully transitioned from the stage to the big screen. In fact, Ganesh was given the moniker of Delhi, after being part of the famous drama troupe, Dakshina Bharata Nataka Sabha, based out of Delhi. Having worked in the Indian Air Force for over a decade, he resigned from his job when his acting career started flourishing in the South. The veteran made his debut with K Balachanders Pattina Pravesham (1976), and went on to become a mainstay in Tamil cinema for over 45 years, and was last seen on the big screen in Kamal Haasan-Shankars Indian 2. Best known for his collaborations with K Balachander, Visu, and Kamal Haasan, Delhi Ganesh was a consummate performer, who was equally at ease in both comic and serious roles. He could be a drunkard father in one film, and a responsible one in his next. He could be a dreaded crime lord in one, and a bumbling office secretary in another. He could be a cook with an acerbic tongue in one, and a doctor with nefarious intentions in another. Basically, he was an actor who could be anything, and that is probably why some of the finest filmmakers from across the spectrum in Tamil cinema vouched for him. He was equally at ease in a K Balachander or Mani Ratnam film as he was in the sets of a Visu or a Suresh Krishna film. He fit into their vision, and had all the hallmarks of a thorough directors actor. Ganeshs longevity in films can be attributed to his understanding of the importance of supporting acts in a film. He knew cinema isnt just made up of the stars and the superstars. That is why his career, which started off with a film featuring fellow rank newcomers, went on to feature him in starring roles alongside every star of his generation, the next generation, and then, the next. Be it Sivaji Ganesan, KR Vijaya, Sivakumar, Rajinikanth, and Kamal Haasan or Vijayakanth, Karthik, Mohan, Mammootty and Prabhu, or Murali, Arjun, Sarathkumar, Prashanth,Mohanlal and Sathyaraj, or Vijay, Ajith Kumar, Madhavan, Suriya, Vikram, and Prabhudeva, and upto the likes of Nakkhul, Shiva, Raghava Lawrence, Sivakarthikeyan, Karthi, Arya, and Vishal, Delhi Ganesh was everywhere. It wasnt like he starred in blink-and-miss roles. They were mostly author-backed that needed a thespian to ace it, and almost every filmmaker knew whom to call. It wasnt just his cinematic exploits that made Delhi Ganesh a household name. He was one of the earliest cinema actors to become television actors, and his presence in serials like Ragasiyam, Sorna Regai, Veetuku Veedu Looty, and Kasthuri helped him make an indelible mark in the Tamil consciousness. Known for his affability that made him equally at ease with veterans and young filmmakers, Delhi Ganesh even made a mark in the digital space. He was an hilarious addition to the sketch comedy YouTube channel, Put Chutney, which featured him in the role of a Tamil-ised Alfred Pennyworth. In his final web series, Navarasa, he played a jealous patriarch of a household in the Vasanth-directed short, Payasam, which brought out a different facet to his performance in his 45th year as an actor. One of the most secure actors of his generation, there was no role too small for Delhi Ganesh, who imbibed Konstantin Stanislavskis famous statement, there are no small parts, only small actors. And as the industry mourns the loss of such a powerhouse, lets take a step back and remind ourselves that art might have the power to transcend generations, but it takes a special kind of talent to take it there. Delhi Ganesh had it, and thats why he will be forever remembered as an actor who could do anything, and did everything. Source: The Indian Express --Agencies",

        "date": "November 11, 2024 08:37 am",
        "content": "At least 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday, including two dozen when a residential building in the northern town of Jabalia was hit, Palestinian health officials and a human rights group said. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) in Gaza said at least 24 people were killed when an Israeli strike destroyed the three-story building in Jabalia at dawn. Thirty other people from nearby houses were wounded, PCHR said in a statement. Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed about a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets and laid on the ground outside a hospital near Jabalia. Local media said they were the bodies of people killed in the attack on the residential building, which housed at least 30 people, according to residents. The Israeli military said it struck a site in Jabalia in which terrorists were operating. These terrorists posed a threat to IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) troops operating in the area. The details are under review, the Israel military said. In Gaza City, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra neighbourhood on Sunday killed Wael Al-Khour, an official at the welfare ministry, as well as his wife, Khour, one son, two daughters and three grandchildren, medical officials and relatives said. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said its teams, in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, evacuated 20 patients from Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia on Sunday to another facility in Gaza City. It said one of the patients died as the ambulances were held up for hours at an Israeli checkpoint separating northern Gaza areas from Gaza City. The three hospitals in and around Jabalia have been besieged by Israeli forces for several weeks and hospital officials have refused army orders to evacuate the facilities or leave their patients unattended despite the depletion of food, medical and fuel supplies. The Israeli military accuses Palestinian militant group Hamas of exploiting the civilian population and property in Gaza for military purposes, a charge the militant group denies. Hamas armed wing said it killed 15 Israeli soldiers in an attack in the city of Beit Lahiya, north of Jabalia, on Sunday. There has been no comment from Israel and Reuters could not independently verify the account. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service says its operations have been halted by an ongoing Israeli raid on two towns and a refugee camp in northern Gaza that began on Oct. 5. Israel says it sent forces since Oct. 5 into Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza to fight Hamas militants waging attacks from there and to prevent them from regrouping. It says its troops have killed hundreds of militants in those areas since the new offensive began. Efforts to reach a ceasefire between the two warring sides have failed so far, with Israel and Hamas trading blame. Qatar, which has been trying to negotiate a ceasefire along with Egypt and the United States, has told, Hamas and Israel it will suspend its efforts until both sides show willingness and seriousness to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday. There was no official response from Hamas or Israel. The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies. Israels military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The incident took place in a bar in the downtown area of the states capital, also known as Queretaro, where four gunmen entered, killing seven men and three women, according to the state attorney general and Queretaro citys security chief. Seven other people were injured. One person was so far in police custody, authorities said. Investigators were at the scene and also looking into a vehicle believed to be linked to the incident.

        "date": "November 11, 2024 10:50 am",
        "content": "Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded to U.S. charges that Tehran was linked to an alleged plot to kill Donald Trump and tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka while calling on for confidence-building between the two hostile countries. Now ... a new scenario is fabricated ... as a killer does not exist in reality, scriptwriters are brought in to manufacture a third-rate comedy, Araqchi said in a post on X. He was referring to the alleged plot which Washington said was ordered by Irans elite Revolutionary Guards to assassinate Trump, who won Tuesdays presidential election and takes office in January. The American people have made their decision. And Iran respects their right to elect the President of their choice. The path forward is also a choice. It begins with respect, Araqchi said. Iran is NOT after nuclear weapons, period. This is a policy based on Islamic teachings and our security calculations. Confidence-building is needed from both sides. It is not a one-way street, he added. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said earlier that the claim was a repulsive plot by Israel and the Iranian opposition outside the country to complicate matters between America and Iran. Iranian analysts and insiders have not dismissed the possibility of a detente between Tehran and Washington under Trump, although without restoring diplomatic ties. Iran will act based on its own interests. It is possible that secret talks between Tehran and Washington take place. If security threats against the Islamic Republic are removed, anything is possible, Tehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said this week. While facing off against arch-foe Israel, Irans clerical leadership is also concerned about the possibility of an all-out war in the region, where Israel is engaged in conflicts with Tehrans allies in Gaza and Lebanon. A 51-year-old Iranian national charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, was implicated in a plot to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka, according to the US Department of Justice. Farhad Shakeri, faces criminal charges for his alleged role in a conspiracy to kill Trump. The FBI stated that Shakeri, who is reportedly an asset of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is at large and is believed to be residing in the Iranian capital of Tehran. In addition to the Trump assassination plot, Shakeri was alleged to have been tasked by the Iranian armed forces to carry out attacks against Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. US authorities say Shakeri was involved in planning a mass shooting targeting Israeli nationals at a tourist spot in Sri Lanka, which allegedly was scheduled to be executed in October 2024. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "First day of new Parliament on Nov. 21",
        "date": "November 11, 2024 11:14 am",
        "content": "The Parliamentary Communications Department has issued a statement regarding the inaugural session of the tenth Parliament, to be commenced on November 21, following the 2024 General Election. The upcoming general election to elect Members of Parliament for the Tenth Parliament is scheduled for November 14. Through this election, a total of 225 Members of Parliament will be elected, comprising 196 members elected by public vote and 29 members entering through the national list, the statement added. The inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament, comprising of members through this process, is scheduled to commence on November 21, as per the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 240313 dated 2024.09.24 issued by the President, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. First day of the new Parliament The first day of Parliaments inaugural session holds particular significance due to the series of special proceedings expected to take place on that day. On the first day, the primary responsibilities within the Chamber are entrusted to the Secretary-General of Parliament. Members of Parliament are not assigned specific seating arrangements on this day and are allowed to sit in any seat of their choice. Following the placement of the mace in the Chamber, the Secretary-General will present to Parliament, as the first business of the day, the Extraordinary Gazette Notification issued by the President, which specifies the date and time for the convening of Parliament. Subsequently, in accordance with Article 64 (1) of the Constitution and Standing Orders 4, 5, and 6 of Parliament, the Speaker is elected by vote, followed by the administration of the official affirmation or oath of office by the Speaker. Thereafter, Members of Parliament take their official affirmation or oath, and the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are elected by vote. Electing the Speaker Any Member of Parliament may be appointed as the Speaker. However, prior to nominating a member for the position, it is essential to confirm that the Member is willing to accept the appointment. The election of the Speaker must proceed based solely on the nominations made by Members, without allowing any debate on the matter. At this stage, the Secretary-General informs the House that the Speaker must be appointed first. When a member rises to propose a name, the Secretary-General directs the Houses attention to that Members nomination. After one name has been proposed, the Secretary-General must ask if there are any other nominations. If no other nominations are presented, that Member is duly elected as Speaker. It is a long-standing tradition for the two Members who formally proposed and seconded the name of the Speaker to escort the elected Member to the Speakers chair, holding them by the arms. The Speaker then takes their official affirmation or oath of office before the Secretary-General. Before taking their seat, it is customary for the newly appointed Speaker to briefly thank the House for the appointment. Congratulatory remarks are then offered by both the government and opposition representatives, after which the Speaker delivers a statement of thanks. Following this, the remaining Members proceed to take their official affirmation or oath before the Speaker. When the names of two Members are proposed for the position of Speaker, a secret ballot is conducted. There are two instances in parliamentary procedure when a secret ballot is held: during the election of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Chairperson of Committees, and also when Parliament elects a President. During the ballot, a continuous five-minute Quorum Bell shall signal Members to prepare. The Secretary-General then distributes ballot papers to each Member, who must write the name of their chosen candidate and sign the paper. Members then fold the ballot paper discreetly and place it in the ballot box. The authority to determine the voting method and to conduct the count rests solely with the Secretary-General, who tallies the votes at the Table of Parliament. After counting, the Secretary-General announces the result to the House. If a ballot paper lacks the Members signature, it is deemed invalid. If three Members are proposed for the position of Speaker and no candidate secures an absolute majority in the vote, the candidate with the least number of votes shall be eliminated, and a new round of voting is conducted. The candidate who then receives the majority of votes is elected as Speaker. Similarly, in instances where multiple Members are proposed, successive rounds of voting are held, eliminating the candidate with the least votes each time, until one candidate secures an absolute majority. At any point, if a candidate achieves an absolute majority, they are immediately elected as Speaker. In cases where three Members stand for election and two of them receive an equal number of votes, the Secretary-General has the authority to eliminate one of the tied candidates by drawing lots. Following this, a vote is held between the remaining candidate and the candidate with the highest votes, and the Speaker is selected based on the results. If there is a vote between two candidates and both receive an equal number of votes, a re-vote is conducted. Should there still be a tie after this second vote, the Secretary-General has the authority to select the Speaker by drawing lots. The Secretary-General has full discretion to determine the procedure for drawing lots. Following the conclusion of a vote, the corresponding ballot papers must be kept under the custody of the Secretary-General for a period of one month. After this period, they should be destroyed in accordance with the directive from Parliament, and a report of this destruction must be submitted to Parliament. All Members of Parliament elected must sign the Member roll after taking their oath or affirmation on the first day. The Speaker signs first, followed by the Prime Minister as a tradition, after which the other Members affix their signatures. This signed record is maintained as a highly secure document in accordance with established protocols. When the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of Committees are to be elected, the Speaker, having already been appointed, conducts all notifications and voting procedures. After nominations for the Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson are made, the Speaker will ask the House if there are any further nominations. If none are forthcoming, the nominated Members are elected to their respective positions. Should a vote be necessary, the procedure followed will mirror that of the election of the Speaker, with the notable difference that the voting will be conducted by the Speaker instead of the Secretary-General. After these activities are completed, Parliament will be adjourned. Typically, the adjournment will be until the next scheduled parliamentary day. However, according to Article 33 of the Constitution, if the President addresses Parliament on that day to present government policy statement, the House will be temporarily suspended at the end of these initial proceedings. When Parliament reconvenes, the President will preside over the House and present the government policy statement. Following the policy statement the President will then adjourn Parliament until the next scheduled day, the statement added.",

Meanwhile, the Maradagahamula Rice Traders Association says that due to the shortage and high prices of certain types of rice in the market, the sale of rice has dropped by about 50. In recent weeks, rice prices in the market have exceeded the government control price, with a noted shortage of Nadu rice. In response, on October 24, the President convened a meeting with large-scale rice producers, directing them to adhere to the control price, to which they agreed. Subsequently, on November 06, the Consumer Affairs Authority submitted a comprehensive report to the President, in line with his directive to promptly provide data on the countrys paddy and rice stock levels. However, both consumers and vendors report that a shortage of certain rice varieties persists in the market, with available stocks often sold at prices exceeding the government control price.",

According to what we heard, the government is attempting to implement this factory closure through a private company. We would like to say that we will do our best to defeat this attempt. When they got to know that we spoke against this matter, the government began to deny the shutdown of the Thriposha factory. Then, I would like to ask why they published the gazette notification on the 27th of September, just a few days after the incumbent president assumed power?, he questioned. During the past few days, the new government who used the working publics suffering for their advantage, are now contesting for the general election. The person who promised to fight for the remaining two-thirds of the teachers benefits, is also contesting for the election. Furthermore, the SJB leader said: After they fulfil their political goals, they say that the countrys trade unions are useless and all of them should be dissolved. Please do not be entangled in this web of lies. If the country lets the new government continue its term, they will face another crisis in 2028, just like the previous government in 2022. The reason I said the year 2028 is that the debt repayment process will begin in 2028 and if the government is unable to repay the sufficient debts, the country will be pushed down to bankruptcy, he added.",

        "content": "Dr. Deepal Perera, a paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, states that a recent rise in fever cases among children is observed, attributing this to a surge in viral infections as well as an uptick in dengue cases. He emphasized that parents should closely monitor childrens symptoms, especially if a fever lasts more than three days, as it may indicate a more serious infection. According to Dr. Perera, many children are presenting with symptoms of viral fever, such as cough, cold, body aches, and occasional vomiting. He warned that some of these symptoms can mimic those of influenza, making it essential for parents to observe children carefully and seek medical attention if fevers persist. Additionally, he advised obtaining relevant blood tests to identify potential dengue infections. Dengue is a particularly concerning risk, as it can be fatal, with a 0.1 mortality rate, Dr. Perera cautioned. Dr. Perera encouraged parents to remain vigilant and prioritize early testing and treatment to ensure children receive the care they need during this period of increased infections.",

During the investigation, both Ratwatte and his wife had explained to the police that his mother-in-law resides in the said house.

        "title": "Indias luxury airline Vistara concludes operations",
        "date": "November 11, 2024 12:04 pm",
        "content": "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence. A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet. This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months. As part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India, an Air India spokesperson said in an email response. Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistaras in-flight experience will remain unchanged. Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts. The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistaras books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst. Air India has essentially been suckered into taking a loss-making airline in a desperate move, he added. Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them. To be sure, both Air India and Vistaras annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent. The exercise has been riddled with problems  from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India. There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems. The Tatas have announced a 400m (308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. Theyve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering. But this turnaround is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters. Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too. Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling emotional that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a gold standard for Indian aviation was ceasing operations. It is a big loss for the industry, said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply copy, paste and exceed the high standards set by Vistara, given that its a much smaller airline thats being gobbled up by a much larger one. Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it. This would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness, he adds. Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges. Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding, says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks. Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistaras agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air Indias complex bureaucracy and systems. But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience. These are two airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective, said Mr Martin. Still, many believe Vistara had to go  now or some years later. A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and India imprinted in its identity, wouldnt have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process. Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another. The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo. The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) will be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce, an Air India spokesperson said. Getting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn, said Mr Awtaney. But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in Indias skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways. Its still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The couple, who were shot while traveling on a motorcycle in the Urawatte area, succumbed to gunfire allegedly fired by two unidentified assailants on another motorcycle. Police report that the victims, identified as a married couple, had previously lodged a complaint with Ambalangoda Police, regarding a dispute with the neighbors. Both had reportedly been embroiled in drug-related issues, with the man having a criminal history and being remanded on several occasions. Authorities believe that an earlier attempt on his life, which failed, was also drug-related. Meanwhile, the deceased mans brother had also been shot dead around a year ago in a drug-linked incident, according to police. Police suspect that the recent killings may be a continuation of unresolved issues within the same criminal network. Following the incident, law enforcement recovered a motorcycle suspected to have been used in the shooting. The vehicle was found concealed in a cinnamon forest in Denmark Colony, Meetiyagoda. Authorities suspect that the assailants fled the scene on another motorcycle. Ambalangoda Police is conducting further investigations regarding the incident.",

        "date": "November 11, 2024 04:08 pm",
        "content": "Japans parliament reelected Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday after his governing coalition suffered the worst election loss in more than a decade, forcing the struggling leader to form his second Cabinet in just over a month since taking office. Ishibas ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost their majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japans two-house parliament, in the Oct. 27 election due to continued voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party and its lukewarm response. A special parliamentary session convened Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election. Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years. Ishiba reappointed most of his previous Cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, but had to replace three who lost seats or were affected by the election results. Ishiba is expected to hold a news conference to explain his new Cabinet and policies. Ishiba has refused to step down and showed willingness to cooperate with additional coalition partners to boost stability and help him pursue his partys policies. Ishiba will struggle in the coming months as he must gain consent from the opposition on policies including the budget and other legislation, experts say. He is eyeing a rising smaller, conservative opposition, the Democratic Party for the People, whose seats quadrupled to 28 under its popular leader Yuichiro Tamaki, whose proposal for raising the basic tax-free income allowance and increasing take-home wages garnered support from low income and younger voters. Tamaki only wants to cooperate with Ishibas party on policy  not as part of a coalition  since he wants to use his leverage to increase his partys standing ahead of the next election. However, Tamaki was recently stung by a magazine article exposing an extramarital affair, which he admitted to on Monday. Ishibas government is preparing for his trip later this month to Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits, as well as a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on his way home.

        "content": "Five masked robbers reportedly broke into the residence of a wealthy gem businessman in the Devaladeniya area, Laggala, making off with cash, gold, and gemstones worth approximately Rs. 70 million. The robbery took place late on November 10, when the suspects infiltrated the property by scaling the wall at the back of the house. Armed and masked, they reportedly subdued the businessman with a pistol, forced him inside, and restrained him with duct tape. The robbers also tied up his wife and father before ransacking the home and fleeing the scene in the businessmans car. Among the stolen items were cash, as well as significant amounts of gold and a gemstone worth around Rs. 30 million. The suspects dismantled and took the homes security camera system, erasing any video evidence, the police said. The businessmans vehicle, which the robbers used for their escape, was later found abandoned by police this morning in the Thalakiriyagama area of the Galewela police division. During a search, police have discovered a pair of shoes near the abandoned car, believed to belong to one of the suspects. A police dog named Gio inspected the vehicle, leading officers to a spot where it appeared the suspects had paused during their escape. The businessmans wife and father have been taken to the Dambulla judicial medical officer for examination, while the investigations are ongoing.",

        "content": "The National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force (NAHTTF) has issued a warning regarding a spike in cases of Sri Lankans being referred to cybercrime camps in Myanmar. According to the NAHTTF, recent reports have revealed that Sri Lankan citizens, particularly those living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are being targeted by human traffickers who falsely promise high-paying jobs, particularly in the IT sector. As per NAHTTFs latest findings, traffickers lure skilled IT professionals under the pretense of lucrative foreign job opportunities. Victims are taken to places like Dubai for supposed interviews, only to be illegally transported and forced into cybercrime operations in Myanmar. Investigations into these cybercrime camps have uncovered severe human rights abuses, with detainees facing both mental and brutal physical torture, including electrocution, the NAHTTF said in a statement. Thus, NAHTTF urges the public to be cautious, avoid traveling abroad on tourist visas for employment, and to use only authorized agencies for overseas job placements. Violating these guidelines can increase vulnerability to illegal trafficking and is also against the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau Act, it added. To combat these trafficking networks, NAHTTF is calling on the public for support in several ways: - Use only legal channels: Ensure migration for employment is handled through licensed agencies. - Stay alert: Report any suspicious activities to authorities. - Protect at-risk individuals: Inform relevant authorities if you know Sri Lankan workers who may be in danger or those abroad in similar situations. To report any similar suspicious activities, the public is encouraged to contact NAHTTF through the following channels: -Hotline: 0112102570  076 844 7700 -Email: nahttfsrilankagmail.com All information provided will be handled with strict confidentiality, the NAHTTF noted.",

        "date": "November 11, 2024 06:00 pm",
        "content": "Former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan has been summoned to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) tomorrow (12), in order to record a statement related to the allegations in the documentary aired by British television network Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka. Speaking at a press conference held today (11), Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the CID has launched a probe into the relevant incident as per a complaint lodged by an organization with the Ministry of Public Security against the statement made by Azad Maulana to Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. He said that accordingly, an investigation was launched by the CID into the controversial statements made by several individuals regarding the Easter attacks. On 06 September 2023, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s new Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long videos with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by former MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. According to the documentary, Maulana, who has sought asylum overseas after facing fraud charges here, has witnessed a meeting in Puttalam in 2018, between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer prior to the Easter Sunday attacks. Claiming that he had, on the directives of Pillayan, arranged the said meeting between then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay and the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) members including its leader Zahran Hashim, Maulana said the plot to create insecurity in the country to pave way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019 was hatched over 2-3 years. The documentary, which recapped the countrys political situation, also gave a lengthy commentary on former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksas time in power and their attempts to return to power after election defeats. Recalling the 2009 disappearance of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga who was a prominent critic of the then-government, the Dispatches investigation video claimed that Mahinda Rajapaksas administration had formed a clandestine death squad called the Tripoli Platoon with the support of Pillayans group to crack down on anti-government media persons. It had interviewed former senior CID officer Nishantha Silva who was investigating the disappearance of Wickrematunga. He claimed that he found phone record evidence putting Tripoli Platoon members at the scene and that Gotabaya Rajapaksa had direct monitoring of this death squad. The documentary also presented testimonies from His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, journalist Frederica Jansz who was a witness in the White Flag case, the brother of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga, former commissioner of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Ambika Satkunanathan and former diplomat Sarath Kongahage. However, Kongahage later accused the British television network of distorting his comments from the interview. Calling a media briefing on September 12, 2023, the former ambassador said Channel 4 had used his remarks out of context.",

        "content": "Gampaha District parliamentary candidate and leader of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance, Dilith Jayaweera, stated that he has a practical plan to address Sri Lankas ongoing debt crisis and is ready to assist the President in repaying the debt through this plan. Jayaweera made these remarks while addressing a public rally in Maharagama today (11). We want to bring this country to a positive state. That is why Sarvajana Balaya is here. We are the political force of the developing people. Our goal is to inspire the nation to rise up and move forward, not to fill their minds with fantasies, hate, and anger. This is not the politics we need, Jayaweera said. He emphasized that eliminating corruption and prosecuting wrongdoers is the first step toward national development. He criticized other political groups for focusing on social media campaigns, contrasting their approach with the Sarvajana Balaya movements focus on real change. We will not drag the President down. Instead, we offer a strategic plan to deal with the debt crisis. If the President genuinely wants to fulfill his promises, we are ready to work together to implement a plan that addresses the financial challenges the country faces, Jayaweera added. He further stressed the importance of boosting entrepreneurship, exports, and production, and strategically managing the nations wealth to address the looming economic issues. According to Jayaweera, achieving a target of 150 billion by 2029 will require cooperation and the involvement of those in Parliament who truly love the country. Only through such efforts can we save Sri Lanka, he added.",

        "title": "Haitis main airport shuts down as gang violence surges and a new prime minister is sworn in",
        "date": "November 12, 2024 08:54 am",
        "content": "Haitis international airport shut down on Monday after gangs opened fire at a commercial flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, prompting some airlines to temporarily suspend operations as the country swore in a new interim prime minister who promised to restore peace. The Spirit Airlines flight headed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Port-Au-Prince was just hundreds of feet from landing in Haitis capital when gangs shot at the plane striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries, according to the airline, the U.S. Embassy and flight tracking data. The flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. The shooting appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports. Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines said Monday they were canceling flights to and from Haiti. In other parts of Haitis capital, firefights between gangs and police broke out. Rounds of gunfire echoed through the streets as heavily armed officers ducked behind walls and civilians ran in terror. In other upper class areas, gangs set fire to homes. Schools closed as panic spread in a number of areas. The turmoil comes a day after a council meant to reestablish democratic order in the Caribbean nation fired the interim prime minister Garry Conille, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aimé. The council has been marked by infighting and three members were recently accused of corruption. As he was sworn in, Fils-Aimé said his top priorities were to restore peace to the crisis-stricken nation and hold elections, which havent been held in Haiti since 2016. There is a lot to be done to bring back hope he said before a room of suit-clad diplomats and security officials. Im deeply sorry for the people ... that have been victimized, forced to leave everything they own. The country has seen weeks of political chaos, which observers warned could result in even more violence in a place where bloodshed has become the new normal. The countrys slate of gangs have long capitalized on political turmoil to make power grabs, shutting down airports, shipping ports and stirring chaos. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85 of the capital of Port-au-Prince, while a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. Louis-Henri Mars, executive director of Lakou Lapè, an organization working on peace building in violent areas of Haiti, said the political fighting has allowed the gangs to have more freedom to attack more neighborhoods in the city and expand their control of Port-au-Prince. Civilians, he fears, will suffer the consequences. There will be more lives lost, more internal displacement, and more hunger in a country where half the population is on the brink of starvation, he said. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haitis next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell violence, which exploded after Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021. The council was meant to pave the way to democratic elections, but it has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille, the interim prime minister they hand picked six months ago, who they fired yesterday. Gangs have capitalized on that power vacuum to make their own power grabs. Conille railed against the councils decision to fire him, calling it an illegal overreach of their powers. This resolution, taken outside of any legal and constitutional framework, raises serious concerns about its legitimacy and its repercussions on the future of our country, he wrote in a letter. Organizations including the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition. On Monday, U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric urged all involved in Haitis democratic transition to work constructively together, although he stopped short of offering an opinion on the move to oust Conille. Overcoming their differences and putting the country first remains critical, he said. What is important is that Haitian political leaders put the interests of Haiti first and foremost.

        "content": "The Maligakanda Magistrates Court has ordered to record statements from 18 then-Cabinet Ministers pertaining to the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. The Attorney General Department has informed the court that statements are required to be obtained from 18 individuals including former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, former Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, former Ministers Tiran Alles, Mahinda Amaraweera, Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, Harin Fernando, Roshan Ranasinghe and Nimal Siripala who were members of the Cabinet which approved the Cabinet paper presented by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella for the import of the drugs in question. Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema who granted permission for the request, ordered to record statements from the 18 former Cabinet members related to the matter. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the alleged drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, former Additional Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were arrested and remanded over the case. Meanwhile, one of the suspects in the case, former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal on July 25 ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody. Accordingly, a total of 12 suspects had been arrested and remanded over the case while presently all but one of them are out on bail. The first accused, the owner of the company that supplied the substandard drugs, Sudath Janaka Fernando is receiving treatment while under remand custody. Former Health Minister Kehliya Rambukwella, who was in remand custody for over seven months, was released on bail on September 11, 2024.",

        "title": "New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life",
        "date": "November 12, 2024 11:12 am",
        "content": "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought. Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say. Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasas Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago. But a new analysis shows that Voyagers visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like. Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds  as if it had been knocked over  making it arguably the weirdest. We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons. But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought. The measurements from the spacecrafts instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranuss protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun. A planets magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive. This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar systems other planets and their moons. But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day. The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field. So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London. These results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans that below the surface that could be teeming with fish!. Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy. The results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system, she told BBC News. Im also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. Its amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries. Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as very exciting. It shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions. Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research. It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years time. According to Nasas Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey. Some of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries. Nasas Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life.

        "date": "November 12, 2024 11:32 am",
        "content": "We now know the fate of Kevin Costners John Dutton in Yellowstone. The long-delayed second half of Season 5 debuted Sunday. Moments into the episode, the audience learns that Dutton, the patriarch of the family, had died from a gunshot wound. While it is initially believed that Dutton has died at his own hand, it is later revealed that he was actually murdered in a scheme involving Sarah Atwood (played by Dawn Olivieri), who is romantically involved with Jamie Dutton (Wes Bentley). Costner confirmed in June that he would not be returning for the new season. The actor made the announcement in a video he shared on Instagram. I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things thats required, and thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love, Costner said. I just realized that Im not going to be able to continue Season 5b or into the future. The western Horizon: An American Saga, was the first of Costners planned multi-part film series which ultimately did not break through at the box office. On Monday, Costner appeared on Sirius XMs The Michael Smerconish Program and revealed that he didnt even realize this episode was airing over the weekend, nor did he know the specifics of his characters fate. I found out about it this morning, actually, he said. Costner added that he still hasnt seen the episode but was made aware of the nature of Duttons death, which doesnt make me wanna rush to go see it. Thats their business, he said. I gave it five seasons  I didnt even know I was going to do it that long. There was a couple times where I talked about possible endings for myself. Yellowstone viewers took to social media to lament the loss of Costners character and how he was written out of the show. Some of his cast members shared in the sadness. Its hard to imagine the show without him. But thats always where the show was headed. It was, can these kids do it without him? Luke Grimes, who plays Kayce Dutton, told The Independent. So we all knew it was going to get there, we just didnt know how or when, and clearly it was different than what we thought, Grimes said. But what it did do was ramp the show up to a 10 and now everything starts to unravel. Source: CNN --Agencies",
