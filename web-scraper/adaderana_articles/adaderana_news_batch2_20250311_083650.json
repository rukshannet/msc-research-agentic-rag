        "title": "Imran Khan: Pakistan court suspends jail sentence in graft appeal",
        "date": "April 1, 2024 05:44 pm",
        "content": "A Pakistani court on Monday granted former Prime Minister Imran Khan an appeal of his conviction for graft and suspended his 14-year jail sentence, his lawyer said, a relief for his embattled party which had won most seats in Februarys national polls. Just a week ahead of the Feb. 8 elections, Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were both handed a 14-year sentence on charges of unlawfully selling state gifts by an anti-graft court. Despite the suspension, Khan will remain in jail on multiple other sentences which were imposed on the ex-cricket star ahead of the polls, which also disqualified him from holding any public office for 10 years. Islamabad High Court said that the couples graft sentence will remain suspended until a final decision on the conviction which will be taken up for arguments and evidence as a main petition after Eid holidays, said the lawyer, Barrister Ali Zafar. No evidence backs up this conviction, he told reporters outside the court in Islamabad, saying that was why the court suspended the sentence on first hearing of the appeal. Khan and his wife were charged with illegally selling gifts, worth more than 140 million rupees (500,000) and received during his 2018-2022 premiership, from a state treasury known locally known as the Toshakhana. A list of these gifts shared by a former information minister included perfumes, diamond jewellery, dinner sets and seven watches, six of them Rolexes - the most expensive being a Master Graff limited edition valued at 85 million rupees (304,000). Khan was also handed a three-year prison sentence in August for the same charge by another court, but that sentence had been suspended on appeal. Khan and his party say the legal cases against him were based on made-up charges to keep him out of politics at the behest of the countrys powerful army after he had fallen out with the militarys generals. The army denies the accusation. The military has directly ruled Pakistan for half of its history since its independence from British rule in 1947. The military holds oversized role in making or breaking governments in the nation of 241 million people. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire roars to 80M opening",
        "date": "April 1, 2024 06:07 pm",
        "content": "The Godzilla-King Kong combo stomped on expectations as  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  roared to an 80 million opening on 3,861 North American screens, according to Sunday studio estimates. The monster merger from Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures starring Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry brought the second-highest opening in what has been a robust year, falling just short of the the 81.5 million debut of Dune: Part 2. Projections had put the the opening weekend of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which sees the monsters teaming up instead of squaring up, at closer to 50 million. Its a cinematic event, and were seeing these iconic characters doing things weve never seen them do before, said Mary Parent, chairman of worldwide production for Legendary. Theres big swaths of the film that dont have any dialogue, where we put you with the characters, its a very mythic experience. Last weeks No. 1 at the box office,  Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, was second with 15.7 million for a two-week total of 73.4 million.  Dune: Part Two  stayed strong in its fifth week, falling in the third spot with an 11.1 million take and a domestic total of 252.4 million. The last matchup of the two monsters from Warner Bros. and Legendary, 2021s  Godzilla vs. Kong, had a much smaller opening weekend of 48.5 million, but for a film slowed by the coronavirus pandemic and released simultaneously on HBO Max, it was a serious success that signaled what was to come for the pairing. It was a really big number all things considered, Parent said. The newer film had the second biggest opening of the studios broader MonsterVerse franchise. Godzilla brought in 93.2 million in 2014. It was the biggest earner in the nearly 70-year cinematic history of the creature that originated and spent most of its screen life in Japan. It earned more than 200 million in North America and more than 500 million globally. Godzilla x Kong comes just four months after the most recent Japanese rendition, the critical favorite and Oscar winner Godzilla Minus One. But there was clearly no Godzilla glut for audiences, many of whom were willing to pay extra for IMAX and other special formats. These are literally two of the biggest movie stars in the world, and you have to see them on the biggest screen possible with the biggest sound possible, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. The combination of Godzilla x Kong, Dune Part Two and Ghostbusters has put the year to date 6 percent behind 2023, while it was 20 percent behind on the eve of the March 1 release of Dune. The industry was feeling pretty glum right before Dune Part 2 opened, but theyve made up a lot of ground, said Dergarabedian. The summer is full of titles that are not guaranteed megahits but could break big, including Ryan Goslings The Fall Guy and the next installments of Planet of the Apes, Mad Max, Inside Out and Deadpool. That brings cause for optimism as the theatrical movie business seeks to hang on, though its highly unlikely it will surpass 2023, which saw Barbie surpass 1 billion globally with its release-date mate Oppenheimer not far behind. Barbenheimer is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event, Dergarabedian said. Estimated ticket sales are for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, 80 million. 2. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, 15.7 million. 3. Dune: Part Two, 11.1 million. 4. Kung Fu Panda 4, 10.2. million. 5. Immaculate, 3.3 million. 6. Arthur the King, 2.4 million. 7. Late Night With the Devil, 2.2 million. 8. Tillu Square, 1.8 million. 9. Crew, 1.5 million. 10. Imaginary, 1.4 million. Source: ABC News --Agencies",

        "title": "Microsoft to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny",
        "date": "April 1, 2024 06:19 pm",
        "content": "Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been investigating Microsofts tying of Office and Teams since a 2020 complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. Teams, which was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free, subsequently replaced Skype for Business and became popular during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing. Rivals, however, said packaging the products together gives Microsoft an unfair advantage. The company started selling the two products separately in the EU and Switzerland on Aug. 31 last year. To ensure clarity for our customers, we are extending the steps we took last year to unbundle Teams from M365 and O365 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to customers globally, a Microsoft spokesperson said. Doing so also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardise their purchasing across geographies. Microsoft said in a blogpost that it was introducing a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include Teams in regions outside the EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, and also a new standalone Teams offering for Enterprise customers in those regions. Starting April 1, customers can either continue with their current licensing deal, renew, update or switch to the new offers. For new commercial customers, prices for Office without Teams range from 7.75 to 54.75 depending on the product while Teams Standalone will cost 5.25. The figures may vary by country and currency. The company did not disclose prices for current packaged products. Microsofts unbundling may not be enough to stave off EU antitrust charges which will likely be sent to the company in the coming months as rivals criticise the level of the fees and the ability of their messaging services to function with Office Web Applications in their own services, sources said. Microsoft, which has racked up 2.2 billion euros (2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the past decade for tying or bundling two or more products together, risks a fine of as much as 10 of its global annual turnover if found guilty of antitrust breaches.

        "date": "April 1, 2024 09:30 pm",
        "content": "Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe emphasized the significant progress made under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, affirming his capability to tackle the countrys economic crisis effectively. Stressing the necessity of President Wickremesinghes continued leadership, Semasinghe cautioned against the misconception that anyone could manage the countrys affairs, highlighting the unique expertise and suitability of President Wickremesinghe for the task. The Finance State Minister further announced that following the distribution of relief benefits to 2.4 million Aswesuma recipients, plans are underway to conduct a follow-up survey. These statements were made by the State Minister during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (01), focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further, State Minister Semasinghe said, Following the call for applications for the Aswesuma second phase, authorities anticipate receiving around 400,000 submissions. This will complete the provision of insurance for 2.4 million beneficiaries. However, it is important to note that a revaluation survey will be carried out for the 3.4 million individuals who applied during the first settlement since last May. Additionally, a comprehensive survey is underway for the newly submitted 400,000 applications. These efforts are aimed at enhancing the selection process to ensure that the subsidy reaches the appropriate recipients. We also aim to conduct a post-selection survey on the 2.4 million Aswesuma beneficiaries. This survey will focus on understanding how they utilized the funds provided by the Aswesuma. Additionally, we seek to evaluate the impact of this support on potential empowerment programs in the future. Special attention will be given to the specific benefits they gained from this assistance. We have diligently worked towards revitalizing a country that experienced six consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The economy has shown signs of improvement, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. This positive turn of events is attributed to the countrys adherence to recognized financial discipline, facilitated by collaborative efforts between the administration of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Despite the ongoing challenges faced by the population, there has been a methodical reduction in the overall economic burden. In the latest economic report, its noted that inflation has decreased by 0.9 over the past month. This positive trend is seen as a step towards strengthening the rupee and creating a favorable environment for consumer benefits. Currently, prices are showing signs of stabilization, indicating a more balanced economic situation. Amidst discussions and criticisms about the economy, the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been pivotal. The progress achieved under his guidance highlights his capability and suitability in addressing the countrys economic challenges. The Presidents skillful handling of the economic crisis has been widely praised, underscoring the necessity for his ongoing leadership to steer the country towards economic stability and growth. Despite the progress made by the country, some individuals have been led to believe that anyone could effectively govern the nation. However, it is important to note that such a notion is inaccurate and misguided. The current stability and positive trajectory have been the result of meticulous planning and strategic decisions. It is widely believed that by staying the course with the current program, the country can surpass a 2 economic growth rate in the year 2024. This optimistic outlook underscores the significance of maintaining effective leadership and prudent economic strategies moving forward. Although the exchange rate has strengthened and inflation has dropped significantly from 70 to 5, there have been public complaints about not seeing the benefits of these reduced prices. This issue has emerged due to unregulated prices in the black market. To address this, the Minister of Commerce has announced plans to launch a weekly notification system for wholesale prices starting next week. This move is aimed at enhancing transparency in wholesale pricing, allowing the public to have a clearer understanding and estimation of retail prices. Furthermore, substantial progress has been made in the debt restructuring program. The second review with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was finalized two weeks ago and has been approved at the staff-level. However, obtaining the third instalment has become increasingly challenging. --PMD",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Tamil political parties plan to field a candidate from the minority community for the presidential election who would present a credible and acceptable political solution for them, a senior community leader has said. Sri Lanka is set to hold the next presidential election in the last quarter of 2024. The next president would be elected by mid-November at the latest. Addressing reporters at his residence in the eastern district of Trincomalee on Sunday, senior Tamil leader R Sampanthan said that Tamils would be well served in the forthcoming presidential election by supporting a candidate who would pledge to resolve all issues concerning the Tamil minority through an acceptable political solution. Sampanthan said the political parties that form the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have proposed to field a Tamil candidate. But the Tamils must understand that such a candidate would not be able to pull much support and as such the parties must decide on the best course of action, he added. Sampanthan stressed that the candidate who would present a credible and acceptable political solution for the Tamils by the merger of north and east provinces should be the important political factor for the Tamils. Asked if the Tamils were likely to extend support to the incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe if he came forward to be a candidate, Sampanthan said it would depend on talks with him following his handing over of the nominations to contest the election. In Sri Lankas presidential election history since 1982, Tamil candidates have contested the election but at most elections, they have by and large supported the opposition front-runner against the incumbent.

        "date": "April 2, 2024 08:23 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Suspected Israeli warplanes bombed Irans embassy in Syria on Monday, a marked escalation in a war pitting Israel against its regional adversaries, and Tehran said the strike killed seven military advisers including three senior commanders. Reuters reporters at the site in the Mezzeh district of Damascus saw emergency workers clambering atop rubble of a destroyed building inside the diplomatic compound, adjacent to the main embassy building. Emergency vehicles were parked outside. An Iranian flag hung from a pole by the debris. The Syrian foreign minister and interior minister were both spotted at the scene. We strongly condemn this atrocious terrorist attack that targeted the Iranian consulate building in Damascus and killed a number of innocents, Syrias Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said. Israel has long targeted Irans military installations in Syria and those of its proxies, and has ramped up those strikes in parallel with its campaign against Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the Gaza war was ignited by Hamas Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, Israel military has escalated airstrikes in Syria against Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Iranian-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, both of which support Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government. Mondays attack was the first time Israel hit the vast embassy compound itself. Israel typically does not discuss attacks by its forces on Syria. Asked about the strike, an Israeli military spokesperson said: We do not comment on reports in the foreign media. Irans ambassador to Syria Hossein Akbari, who was unharmed, told Iranian state TV that five to seven people, including diplomats, were killed and Tehrans response would be harsh. Irans Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that seven military advisers died in the strike including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the IRGCs Quds Force, which is an elite foreign espionage and paramilitary arm. Iranian state media said that Tehran believed Zahedi was the target of the attack. His deputy and another senior commander were also killed along with four others. The New York Times cited four unnamed Israeli officials as acknowledging Israel had carried out the attack. Irans Arabic Language Al Alam Television said that Zahedi was a military adviser in Syria who served as the head of the Quds Force in Lebanon and Syria until 2016. BUILDING PARTLY USED AS AMBASSADORS RESIDENCE Citing a military source, Syrian state media said Israel launched an attack from the occupied Golan Heights onto the Iranian embassy, and Syria shot down some missiles with its air defence system. The Iranian ambassador said the strike hit a consular building within the embassy compound and his residence was on the top two floors. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at a regular news briefing that the United States remained concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region. Miller said he did not expect it to impact talks on freeing Israeli hostages held by Iran-backed Hamas. Spokespeople for Hamas and Houthis, an Iran-backed Yemeni group that has attacked shipping in the Gulf of Aden since mid-November, condemned the Damascus strike. On Friday, Israel carried out its deadliest strikes in months on northern Syrias Aleppo province and killed a senior Hezbollah fighter in Lebanon. It has also regularly struck the airports in Aleppo and Damascus in an attempt to halt Irans weapons transfers to its proxies. The Israeli military said on Monday it also stopped advanced weapons, including shrapnel charges and anti-tank mines, from being smuggled into the West Bank from Iran. It said the weapons were uncovered during an operation against a Lebanese-based operative of Hezbollah and the IRGC. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankan minister says no word from India on Katchatheevu",
        "date": "April 2, 2024 09:00 am",
        "content": "India has not sent any official communication yet on the Katchatheevu island issue, a senior Sri Lanka minister told The Indian Express on Monday even as the BJP scaled up its attack on the Congress, accusing it and the DMK of giving away the island, and the partys Tamil Nadu unit chief K Annamalai claiming that the Centre is taking all possible measures to reclaim the territory. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, Katchatheevu island falls within the Sri Lankan line of control. Narendra Modis foreign policy with Sri Lanka is organic and healthy. So far, there has not been an official communication from India to return the powers of Katchatheevu island. No such request from India so far. If there is such a communication, the foreign ministry will reply to that, Jeevan Thondaman, a minister in President Ranil Wickremesinghes Cabinet, told The Indian Express. This came on a day Indias External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar added his weight to the BJP claims that the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi had given away the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka in 1974 and kept this hidden and Annamalai said the central government is taking all possible measures to reclaim the territory. Speaking at a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, Jaishankar, however, parried a question on whether the government plans to reclaim the island, saying the matter is in Supreme Court. It is a sub-judice matter, he said. Later in the day, Annamalai told reporters in Chennai: The ball is in the Centres court now. All solutions possible will be considered. The only aim of the BJP in this issue is to protect the safety of Tamil fishermen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and EAM Jaishankar are being very serious in this case. It (Katchatheevu) was handed over illegally to Sri Lanka. Even as Thondaman denied any communication yet from India, another Sri Lankan minister, who did not want to be named, told The Indian Express that national boundaries cannot be changed as per wishes of a new government. For good or bad, Katchatheevu was formally recognised inside Sri Lankas line of control. Once the boundary is decided, no one can demand a change just because of a change in government But Katchatheevu hasnt been a topic of discussion in the Sri Lankan Cabinet; there is no communication from India in this regard, the minister said. If Katchatheevu is about the Tamil community, they exist on either side of the borders. If it is about the Tamil fishermen issue, linking both is inappropriate and inaccurate because the issue with regards to Indian fishermen is all about the bottom-trawlers they use for fishing outside Indian waters, which is illegal as per international maritime laws, he said. When this huge exploitation and depletion of maritime resources happen in the entire ocean region, the victims of these trawlers owned by Indian Tamil fishermen are not Muslims or Sinhala fishermen but the Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen, the minister said. The last high-level discussions between India and Sri Lanka were held in New Delhi on March 28, just three days before the BJP brought up the issue, following a news report based on information accessed by Annamalai under the RTI Act. A communication from the Sri Lankan Presidents media division said after the talks that the delegation headed by Sagala Ratnayaka, senior adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff, had discussions to assess bilateral economic connectivity projects between Sri Lanka and India. Ratnayaka was unavailable for comment on Monday. The revival of the Katchatheevu issue and the unprecedented interest in it shown by Delhi in the past two days have reignited speculation in Tamil Nadu that the BJP has a plan laid out for Katchatheevu before the Lok Sabha election day on April 19. A senior state BJP leader said the island issue has been in the partys radar since Annamalais much-hyped four-day visit to Sri Lanka in 2022. This visit was considered a significant outreach on behalf of the BJP leadership to address pending issues with Sri Lanka such as Katchatheevu and the attacks on Tamil fishermen by the Sri Lankan navy. The BJP leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said following Annamalais visit, the party leadership had a plan to come out with a significant announcement on Katchatheevu island before the end of the current Modi regime. Of course it was an ambitious plan but it hasnt materialised so far, he said. Withdrawing a set of executive instructions from 1976 on the 1974 agreement was the strategy, but we are not sure of the efforts taken by Delhi in this regard. Even as retrieving the island is a near impossible idea, our request to Delhi was to restore the traditional rights of Indian vessels in the area as it would have been a huge gain for the BJP Tamil Nadu unit, the leader said.

        "date": "April 2, 2024 10:25 am",
        "content": "The fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed against the appointment of Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon are slated to be taken up for consideration before the Supreme Court on Tuesday (02). A three-member bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya will sit for the consideration of the petitions put forward by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Prof. Savitri Gunasekara, former MP Hirunika Premachandra and several others. The Speaker of Parliament, the members of the Constitutional Council, IGP Tennakoon, the Attorney General and several others have been named as the respondents of the petitions. The petitioners allege that Tennakoon had neglected his duties during his tenure as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Western Province when the 2019 Easter attacks happened, and a pre-mediated attack was launched on the GotaGoGama protest site at the Galle Face Green where several protesters were brutally beaten. They emphasized that the post of the police chief, who is responsible for the implementation of the law in the country, should be given to an individual who has humane qualities, as opposed to someone who acted contrary to his assigned duties and in violation of basic human rights. Further, the petitioners claimed that the appointment of the police chief had not been properly approved by the Constitutional Council. On that account, the petitioners have sought a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the appointment of the police chief. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena found himself in hot water for unconstitutionally and unlawfully using his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided on a tie on the matter. It was reported that four Constitutional Council members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment. Against this backdrop, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volter Turk also raised concerns about the recent appointment of IGP Tennakoon, despite the Supreme Courts finding that he was implicated in the torture of an individual in 2010.",

        "content": "A Sri Lanka Muslim organization hosted an iftar in Colombo on Sunday for over 1,500 students from different religious backgrounds to promote interfaith understanding and dialogue. Muslims make up less than 10 percent of Sri Lankas 22 million people, who are predominantly Sinhalese Buddhists. The students and their parents gathered in the Sri Lankan capital for the event. Sri Lanka being a multi-religious and multi-ethnic country, we want to share our thoughts and benefits of iftar, Siddi Farook, chairman of the events co-organizer, the Sri Lanka Muslim Civil Society, told Arab News. Our aim is to build bridges between communities. The SLMCS, which was formed following the 2019 Easter attacks in Colombo that killed at least 250 people, has partnered with Soup Kitchen Sri Lanka for the Break Fast at Sunset events over the last three years. The aim is to promote a better understanding among the countrys diverse communities. The whole point is that we introduce how we as Muslims break our fasts, and how we do things in unity, and to make sure that people realize and understand what Muslim faith is all (about) to just show the beauty of Islam through simple things like iftar, Zareena Akbarally, who is part of Soup Kitchen Sri Lanka, told Arab News. This year, the iftar was held in the Battaramulla area, where residents are predominantly Buddhist. We brought it to this area for the particular aim  to show them again what the process of iftar is, and introduce them and bring them and invite them to be a part of our culture  and our faith, Akbarally said. Galkande Dhammananda Thero, a Buddhist monk and chairman of the Walpola Rahula Institute, said the event represented a great opportunity for mutual understanding. Its a great thing to understand each other, how each one practices their religion and to appreciate the valuable message that they are sharing. Im really happy to see this, Thero told Arab News. It is to understand each other, coming closer then only we can understand the value of the practice. Source: Arab News -Agencies",

        "content": "The government has decided to provide free-of-charge sanitary napkins to schoolgirls starting this month. At its meeting on Monday (01), the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted a proposal presented by Education Minister Susil Premajayantha to carry out the program annually. Thereby, as many as 800,000 schoolgirls from rural schools, remote schools, estate schools, and urban schools with poverty-stricken students, will thus be provided with sanitary napkins free of charge. According to the government, out of Sri Lankans student population, which amounts to approximately 4 million, a total of 1.2 million are menstruating schoolgirls. Last month, the PublicFinance.lk revealed that sanitary napkins are subjected to unreasonably high taxes in Sri Lanka, which amounts to 47.1 as opposed to 30.6 on gold jewellery, 22.3 raw silk, and 22.3 golf clubs, golf balls and military artillery weapons. Meanwhile, a recent survey made an alarming revelation about period poverty in Sri Lanka. As per the study, 40 of menstruating women and girls in Sri Lanka have stopped using menstrual products against the backdrop of the ongoing economic crisis.",

Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero, who was recently handed a 4-year rigorous imprisonment. High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige conveyed the decision when the bail application put forward by the defense attorneys requesting the court to release their client on bail was taken up before the court on Tuesday morning. On March 28, Judge Patabendige sentenced the BBS General Secretary to four years of rigorous imprisonment for the defamatory comments made against Islam in late 2016. Gnanasara Thero had been accused of making defamatory comments against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened with respect to the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony. The judge had found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately. Gnanasara Theros prison sentence will be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine. The case had been filed based on a complaint filed by former MPs Mujibur Rahman and Azath Salley.",

        "date": "April 2, 2024 02:31 pm",
        "content": "Three 12-year-old children were shot and wounded at a school in Finland on Tuesday and the suspect, also 12, was taken into custody, police said. The victims were taken to hospital, a police spokesperson told Reuters. No further details were immediately available. The shooting took place at the Viertola school in Vantaa, a suburb of the capital Helsinki, which has around 800 pupils from first to ninth grade and a staff of 90 people, according to the local municipality. The immediate danger is over, the Viertola schools principal Sari Laasila told Reuters, declining to comment further on the incident. The day started in a horrifying way. There has been a shooting incident at the Viertola school in Vantaa. I can only imagine the pain and worry that many families are experiencing at the moment. The suspected perpetrator has been caught, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said on X. Previous school shootings in Finland have put a harsh focus on Finlands gun policy. In 2007, Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed six students, the school nurse, the principal, and himself using a handgun at Jokela High School, near Helsinki. A year later, in 2008, Matti Saari, another student, opened fire at a vocational school in Kauhajoki, located in northwest Finland. He killed nine students and one male staff member before turning the gun on himself. Finland tightened its gun legislation in 2010, introducing an aptitude test for all firearms licence applicants. The age limit for applicants was also changed to 20 from 18. There are more than 1.5 million licensed firearms and about 430,000 licence holders in the nation of 5.6 million people, where hunting and target shooting are popular activities.

        "title": "Sri Lankas economy shows signs of stabilization, but poverty to remain elevated  World Bank",
        "date": "April 2, 2024 03:50 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy is projected to see moderate growth of 2.2 in 2024, showing signs of stabilization, following the severe economic downturn of 2022. But, the country still faces elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labor market concerns, says the World Banks latest bi-annual update. Released today, the Sri Lanka Development Update, Bridge to Recovery, highlights that Sri Lanka saw declining inflation, higher revenues on the back of the implementation of new fiscal policies, and a current account surplus for the first time in nearly five decades, buoyed by increased remittances and a rebound in tourism. However, poverty rates continued to rise for the fourth year in a row, with an estimated 25.9 of Sri Lankans living below the poverty line in 2023. Labor force participation has also seen a decline, particularly among women and in urban areas, exacerbated by the closure of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Households are grappling with multiple pressures from high prices, income losses, and under employment. This has led to households taking on debt to meet food requirements and maintain spending on health and education. Sri Lankas economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms, emphasized Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This involves a two-pronged strategy: first, to maintain reforms that contribute to macroeconomic stability and second, to accelerate reforms to stimulate private investment and capital inflows, which are crucial for economic growth and poverty reduction. Looking forward, the report projects a modest pickup in growth of 2.5 in 2025, with a gradual increase in inflation and a small current account surplus. However, high debt service obligations are expected to exert pressure on fiscal balances. Poverty rates are anticipated to remain above 22 until 2026. Risks to the outlook remain, particularly related to inadequate debt restructuring, reversal of reforms, financial sector vulnerabilities, and the enduring impact of the crisis. The report emphasizes that strong reform implementation will be fundamental to fostering a resilient economy through continued macro-fiscal-financial stability, greater private sector investment, and addressing risks associated with state-owned enterprises. The Sri Lanka Development Update is a companion piece to the South Asia Development Update, a twice-a-year World Bank report that examines economic developments and prospects in the South Asia region and analyzes policy challenges faced by countries. The April 2024 edition, Jobs for Resilience, projects South Asia to remain the fastest-growing region in the world, with growth projected to be 6.0 in 2024- driven mainly by robust growth in India and recoveries in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But this strong outlook is deceptive, says the report. For most countries, growth is still below pre-pandemic levels and is reliant on public spending. At the same time, private investment growth has slowed sharply in all South Asian countries and the region is not creating enough jobs to keep pace with its rapidly increasing working-age population. The report recommends a range of policies to spur firm growth and boost employment as well as help lift growth and productivity and free up space for public investments in climate adaptation.",

        "date": "April 2, 2024 04:14 pm",
        "content": "The UK and US have signed a landmark artificial intelligence (AI) agreement to collaborate on testing and mitigating the risks of AI models. The deal is the first global bilateral agreement on AI safety, bringing together the UK and US governments to share technical knowledge, information and talent on AI safety. The deal was signed by UK Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan and US Commerce Secretary Fina Raimondo in Washington on Monday. Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said: The next year is when weve really got to act quickly because the next generation of models are coming out, which could be complete game-changers, and we dont know the full capabilities that they will offer yet. The fact that the United States, a great AI powerhouse, is signing this agreement with us, the United Kingdom, speaks volumes for how we are leading the way on AI safety. Under the deal, the UKs new AI Safety Institute and the subsequent US organisation, which is yet to begin work, will exchange research expertise with the aim of mitigating the risks of AI, including how to independently evaluate private AI models from organisations such as OpenAI. The partnership is modelled on the security collaboration between GCHQ and the National Security Agency. Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, Head of AI Research at Zoho Corporation, commented: As the UK strives to be recognised as a leader in AI, collaboration with our US counterparts to share knowledge and resources is essential. AI is already playing a significant role for businesses in areas such as data analysis, forecasting and customer experience to enhance the efficiency of day-to-day operations, but to maximise the benefits AI offers, it is also important to promote trust and safety in its development and adoption. Ensuring AIs development and use are governed by trust and safety is paramount. Taking safeguards to protect training data, for instance, mitigates risks and bolsters confidence among those deploying AI solutions, leading to superior outcomes for customers. John Kirk, Deputy CEO at Inspired Thinking Group commented: AI-powered tools and platforms are helping to transform the future of marketing, empowering creatives and relieving the burden of the ever-increasing content demand, all while delivering brand-compliant localisation across all content. Its promising to see collaboration between the UK and US in such a rapidly evolving area. Ensuring a well-managed governance model to support the development of AI and content operations in the creative industries can help mitigate risks and any hesitancy towards the adoption of AI in day-to-day applications. Despite the focus on risk, Donelan insisted that the UK has no plans to regulate AI more broadly in the short term. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has taken a stricter position on AI models that threaten national security. Elsewhere, the EU AI Act, passed in April, has taken a tougher stance on AI regulation to slow down rapid advancement and put-up guardrails. Dr Henry Balani, Global Head of Industry  Regulatory Affairs at Encompass Corporation, said: Generative AI, in particular, has a huge role to play across the financial services industry, improving the accuracy and speed of detection of financial crime by analysing large data sets, for example. Mitigating the risks of AI, through this collaboration agreement with the US, is a key step towards mitigating risks of financial crime, fostering collaboration and supporting innovation in a crucial, advancing area of technology. GenAI is here to augment the work of staff across the financial services sector, and particularly Know Your Customer (KYC) analysts, by streamlining processes and combing through vast data sets quickly and accurately. But for this to be truly effective, banks and financial institutions need to first put in place robust digital and automated processes to optimise data quality and deliver deeper customer insights, which can help to fuel the use of GenAI.

        "title": "JK Rowling dares police to arrest her over anti-trans statements",
        "date": "April 2, 2024 05:02 pm",
        "content": "JK Rowling has challenged Scotlands new hate crime law in a series of social media posts - inviting police to arrest her if they believe she has committed an offence. The Harry Potter author, who lives in Edinburgh, described several transgender women as men, including convicted prisoners, trans activists and other public figures. She said freedom of speech and belief was at an end if accurate description of biological sex was outlawed. Earlier, Scotlands first minister Humza Yousaf said the new law would deal with a rising tide of hatred. The Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 creates a new crime of stirring up hatred relating to age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or being intersex. The law does not protect women as a group from hatred. The Scottish government is expected to include this later in a separate misogyny law. Ms Rowling, who has long been a critic of some trans activism, posted on X on the day the new legislation came into force. She wrote: Scottish lawmakers seem to have placed higher value on the feelings of men performing their idea of femaleness, however misogynistically or opportunistically, than on the rights and freedoms of actual women and girls. She added: It is impossible to accurately describe or tackle the reality of violence and sexual violence committed against women and girls, or address the current assault on womens and girls rights, unless we are allowed to call a man a man. Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal. Ms Rowling highlighted some criminal cases, including transgender rapist Isla Bryson and Andrew Miller, who abducted and assaulted a girl in the Scottish Borders. She described them as men in a series of posts, that also included transgender campaigners and other individuals. Ms Rowling said: Im currently out of the country, but if what Ive written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment. Police Scotland said it had not received any complaints over the posts. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said people should not be criminalised for stating simple facts on biology. In a statement given to The Daily Telegraph, he promised that his party would always protect free speech. The maximum penalty under the new act in Scotland is a jail sentence of seven years. A person commits an offence if they communicate material, or behave in a manner, that a reasonable person would consider to be threatening or abusive, with the intention of stirring up hatred based on protected characteristics. Stirring up hatred based on race, sexual orientation and religion was already illegal in Great Britain under the Public Order Act 1986, but that will also now fall under the new act in Scotland The bar for this offence is lower than for the other protected characteristics, as it also includes insulting behaviour. In England and Wales stirring up hatred over race, religion or sexual orientation by threatening behaviour remains illegal. In Scotland, the new act also consolidates existing laws on crimes which are aggravated by prejudice towards a protected characteristic. This can be taken into account by a judge who might issue a longer sentence or a higher fine. A protest group of around 200 people gathered outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh on the morning the new law came into effect. The Scottish government said the Hate Crime Act would provide protection from hate and prejudice without stifling individual expression. First Minister Humza Yousaf said it was designed to deal with what he called a rising tide of hatred in society. In response to general criticism of the act, he said: Unless your behaviour is threatening or abusive and intends to stir up hatred, then you have nothing to worry about in terms of the new offences being created.

        "date": "April 2, 2024 06:34 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Citizens from Australia, Britain and Poland were among seven people working for celebrity chef Jose Andres World Central Kitchen who were killed in an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza on Monday, the NGO said. The workers, who also included Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, were travelling in two armoured cars emblazoned with the WCK logo and another vehicle, WCK said in a statement. Israel has long denied it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, saying the problem is caused by the inability of international aid groups to get it to those in need. Despite co-ordinating movements with the Israeli Defence Force, the convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse, after unloading more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said. This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war, said Erin Gore, chief executive of World Central Kitchen. This is unforgivable. The Israeli military said it was doing a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of what it called a tragic incident and pledged an investigation by an independent, professional and expert body. The IDF makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and has been working closely with WCK in their vital efforts to provide food and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, the military said. Israel has been under mounting international pressure to alleviate the severe hunger in Gaza, which has been devastated by months of fighting that has laid waste to much of the enclave and forced most of the population from their homes. The United Nations and other international groups have accused Israel of hindering aid distribution with bureaucratic obstacles and failing to ensure the security of food convoys, underlined by a disaster on Feb. 29, in which around 100 people were killed as they waited for an aid delivery. Hamas, the Islamist group that controlled Gaza, has said the main problem with aid distribution was Israeli targeting of aid workers. Following the latest incident, it issued a statement saying the attack aimed to terrorise workers of international humanitarian agencies, deterring them from their missions. Last week, the World Court ordered Israel to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclaves Palestinian population and halt spreading famine. In response, Israeli officials accused the United Nations and other international bodies of failure over the problems in getting aid to hungry people in Gaza, saying they lack the logistical capacity to perform their jobs. Andres, who started WCK in 2010 by sending cooks and food to Haiti after an earthquake, earlier said he was heartbroken and grieving for the families and friends of those who died. The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing, he said on social media. It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon. No more innocent lives lost. Peace starts with our shared humanity. It needs to start now. AUSTRALIA CONFIRMS DEATH Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the death of 44-year-old aid worker Lalzawmi Zomi Frankcom and said his government had contacted Israel to demand those responsible be held accountable. This is a human tragedy that should never have occurred, that is completely unacceptable and Australia will seek full and proper accountability, he told a press conference on Tuesday. Albanese said innocent civilians and humanitarian workers needed to be protected and reiterated his call for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza along with more aid to help those suffering from tremendous deprivation. Poland, which also lost a citizen, issued a statement objecting to the disregard for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers. Video obtained by Reuters showed a large hole in the roof of a four wheel drive WCK vehicle and its burned and torn interior, as well as paramedics moving bodies into a hospital and displaying the passports of three of those killed. We are heartbroken and deeply troubled by the strike that killed WCKitchen aid workers in Gaza, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on social media. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected as they deliver aid that is desperately needed, and we urge Israel to swiftly investigate what happened. WCK said it was pausing its operations in the region immediately and would make decisions soon about the future of its work. WCK delivers food relief and prepares meals for people in need. It said last month it had served more than 42 million meals in Gaza over 175 days. WCK was involved in the first shipment of aid to Gaza via a sea corridor from Cyprus in March. A second WCK maritime aid shipment of 332 tons arrived in Gaza early this week. Since starting operations in 2010, the organisation has delivered food for communities hit by natural disasters, refugees at the U.S. border, healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and people in conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

        "content": "The government has decided to import a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists. Accordingly, in a bid to boost the tourism sector, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to a proposal presented by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans and 250 buses. As per the proposal, 6-15-seater vans, as well as 16-30-seater (small) buses and 30-45-seater (large) buses are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief. The government says that, although it is considered a custom in the tourist industry that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the industry is not satisfactory and sufficient. In a statement, it added that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts. Therefore, the requirement of importing vehicles essential for enhancing the industry has been recognized by the government, considering the contribution to the tourist industry within the economic revival process of Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka will investigate reported hazardous materials on board the cargo vessel that collided with a key Baltimore bridge last week, the state minister of environment told Parliament on Tuesday, insisting that the countrys authorities have not been informed about the content of the cargo. The Singapore-flagged container ship vessel, Dali, which was mainly manned by an Indian crew, collided with the 2.6-km-long four-lane Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Patapsco River in Baltimore in the early hours of March 26. The 984-foot cargo ship was bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka. It was reported that the container ship was carrying 764 tonnes of hazardous materials to Colombo. The Central Environment Authority has not been informed of any hazardous cargo, Janaka Wakkumbura, the state minister of environment, told Parliament. He said both Sri Lanka Customs and the Colombo Port have been instructed to carry out a probe. They will carry out an investigation, Wakkumbura said. He was responding to a question from Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa who asked if permission had been granted to unload cargo in the Colombo port. The port officials said the ship was due to reach Colombo on April 22 and the information on its cargo would only have been known 48 hours before its arrival. The Central Environment Authority officials said its approval was a must even if unloading in Colombo was limited to transhipment of cargo. The collapse of the bridge has effectively shut down operations at Baltimores port, affecting about 8,000 jobs and about USD 2 million in daily wages for those workers, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week.

        "date": "April 3, 2024 07:28 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - An earthquake offshore Taiwan with a magnitude of 7.2 rocked the capital Taipei on Wednesday morning, knocking out power in several parts of the city and sparking a tsunami warning for the islands of southern Japan and the Philippines. Taiwan television stations showed footage of some collapsed buildings in the eastern county of Hualien, near the quakes epicentre, and media reported some people were trapped. The quake hit at 07:58 a.m. (2358 GMT) at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) just off the eastern coast of Taiwan, according to Taiwans Central Weather Administration. It was the strongest quake to hit the island in 25 years, state media said. Japan issued an evacuation advisory for the coastal areas of the southern prefecture of Okinawa. Tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10 feet) were expected to reach large areas of Japans southwestern coast, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, which put the quake magnitude at 7.5. A 30 cm (1 foot) tsunami reached Yonaguni Island at 9:18 a.m. (0018 GMT), JMA said. The Philippines Seismology Agency also issued a warning for residents in coastal areas of several provinces, urging them to evacuate to higher ground. The quake was felt in Shanghai, a Reuters witness said. Chinese state media said it was also felt in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou and Ningde in Chinas Fujian province. The Taipei city government has not received any reports of damage and the citys MRT was up and running soon after. Taiwans high speed rail operator said no damage or injuries were reported on its trains, but noted trains will be delayed while it carries out inspections. Southern Taiwan Science Park, where semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has a plant, said companies were operating without impact. Taiwans official central news agency said the quake was the biggest to hit the island since 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude tremor killed around 2,400 people and destroyed or damaged 50,000 buildings in one of Taiwans worst-recorded quakes. Japanese public broadcaster NHK said the earthquake registered an intensity of an Upper 6 in Taiwans Hualien on Japans 1-7 intensity scale. In an Upper 6 earthquake, most unreinforced concrete-block walls collapse and people find it impossible to remain standing or move without crawling, the Japan Meteorological Agency says.

        "date": "April 3, 2024 07:55 am",
        "content": "A formal discussion on the educational challenges confronting Muslim schools in the Colombo region was convened under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Secretariat, on Tuesday (02). Key issues addressed included the shortage of teachers, inadequate space and classrooms, difficulties in teaching Islam in Sinhala, absence of schools in Muslim-majority areas, according to the Presidents Media Division. During the session, Minister Ali Sabry and representatives of school principals and organizations briefed President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the challenges faced by Muslim schools in Colombo, the release said. The President promptly initiated steps to address some of these issues, directing officials from the Ministry of Education and the Urban Development Authority to investigate and report on specific matters. Approximately 40,000 students receive education through the Sinhala medium and the meeting addressed the shortage of teachers proficient in teaching Islam in Sinhala. Highlighting the issues faced as a result of the shortage of Muslims students, Minister Ali Sabry noted that there are only around 19 Muslim schools in Colombo whereas there are around 70 in Kalutara. As a result, he said the drop-out rate in Colombo is much higher leading to other social issues, which is not a threat just to the community but the whole country. Hence, President Wickremesinghe instructed the officials of the Ministry of Education to look into this matter and come up with proposals to address this issue. Additionally, attention was drawn to the lack of Muslim schools in certain areas of Colombo, leading to students inability to engage in educational activities. President Wickremesinghe directed Urban Development Authority officials to explore options for relocating some schools to suitable land. The meeting delved into overcoming obstacles to donor-funded construction of new school buildings to address space shortages. Principals and organization representatives highlighted a shortage of approximately 200 teachers in 19 Muslim schools in Colombo and stressed the importance of resolving this issue. The President advised officials to initiate agriculture related training programs for Advanced Level-passed students. President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced plans to reconvene at the end of the month to further review the challenges faced by Muslim schools, the PMD said. Participants in this significant meeting comprised Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Governor of the Western Province Air Marshall Roshan Gunathilaka, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Education Thilaka Jayasundara, Provincial Education Officials, representatives from the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, Urban Development Authority Officials, school principals, members of school development committees, representatives of Muslim organizations and educators. --PMD",

        "title": "Israel says airstrike unintentionally killed aid workers in Gaza, allies demand explanations",
        "date": "April 3, 2024 08:59 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israel mistakenly killed seven people working for the aid charity World Central Kitchen in a Gaza airstrike, and the U.S. and other allies called for explanations amid widespread condemnation. Israels military voiced sincere sorrow over the incident, which ratcheted up international pressure for steps to ease the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza nearly six months into Israels siege and invasion of the Palestinian enclave. The strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy killed citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. WCK, which was founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres, said its staff were traveling in two armored cars emblazoned with the charitys logo and another vehicle, and had coordinated their movements with the Israeli military. Unfortunately in the past day there was a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu said in a video statement. This happens in war. We are conducting a thorough inquiry and are in contact with the governments. We will do everything to prevent a recurrence. The Israeli military pledged an investigation by an independent, professional and expert body. At least 196 humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the United Nations, and Hamas has previously accused Israel of targeting aid distribution sites. In a call on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told Netanyahu that Britain was appalled by the deaths, which included three Britons, and demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation, Sunaks office said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he expressed anger and concern to Netanyahu in a separate call. The United States, Israels closest ally, said that there was no evidence Israel deliberately targeted the aid workers but that it was outraged by their deaths and Israel had an obligation to ensure aid workers in Gaza were not harmed. U.S. President Joe Biden called WCK founder Andres to express condolences. Washington will press Israel to do more to protect aid workers, the White House said. These people are heroes, they run into the fire, not away from it, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said of the seven aid workers, speaking to reporters in Paris. We shouldnt have a situation where people who are simply trying to help their fellow human beings are themselves at grave risk. The United Nations, which has warned of a looming famine in Gaza, again called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Israel has long denied accusations that it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, which it has besieged in a war since October, saying the problem is caused by international aid groups inability to get it to those in need. The aid convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse after unloading more than 100 tons of food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said. This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war, said Erin Gore, chief executive of World Central Kitchen. This is unforgivable. The U.S.-based charity said it would pause its work in Gaza, and the United Arab Emirates, which has financed the seaborne food deliveries to Gaza that WCK distributed, said it was putting the shipments on hold pending safety guarantees from Israel and a full investigation. Anera, a U.S.-based aid group that works in part with WCK, said on Tuesday it too was pausing operations in Gaza because of safety concerns. INCREASING ISRAELI ISOLATION Australia, Britain and Poland, countries which have generally been friendly towards Israel, all demanded action to protect aid workers, underscoring Netanyahus increasing diplomatic isolation over Gaza. Israel has been under rising international pressure to alleviate severe hunger in Gaza, which has been shattered by Israels offensive against the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. The conflict began after Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. Since then, much of the densely populated territory has been laid waste and most of its 2.3 million population displaced. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The United Nations and other international groups have accused Israel of hindering aid distribution with bureaucratic obstacles and failing to ensure the security of food convoys, underlined by a disaster on Feb. 29, in which around 100 people were killed as they awaited an aid delivery. Hamas, Gazas dominant group, has said the main problem with aid distribution is Israeli targeting of aid workers. After the latest incident, it issued a statement saying the attack aimed to terrorize workers of international humanitarian agencies, deterring them from their missions. Andres, who started WCK in 2010 by sending cooks and food to Haiti after an earthquake, said he was heartbroken and grieving for the families and friends of those who died in the airstrike. The Israeli government ... needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon, he said. Video obtained by Reuters showed a large hole in the roof of a four-wheel-drive WCK vehicle and its burned and torn interior, as well as paramedics moving bodies into a hospital and displaying the passports of three of those killed. Conditions in Gaza remain extremely precarious with fighting going on in several areas on Tuesday and 71 people killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours, according to Gaza health authorities.

He communicated this through a motion submitted to the Maligakanda Magistrates Court through his legal counsels on Wednesday (03). On March 28, the Maligakanda Magistrate ordered the former president to make a statement in court on 04 April pertaining to his comments that raised eyebrows. However, the CID on March 25 obtained a five-hour-long statement from Sirisena after Public Security Minister Tiran Alles ordered an immediate investigation into the matter. On March 22, Sirisena, who was the incumbent when the coordinated bombings happened, stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true masterminds of the carnage. He had also expressed readiness to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. Sirisena soon received backlash with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people. Amidst the controversy, however former President Sirisena had later claimed that his statement was based on certain information he had received three weeks ago.",

The other accused in the case are former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta, Additional Health Secretary Dr. Saman Ratnayake, Director of the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) Kapila Wickremenayake, Deputy Director of MSD Thusitha Sudarshana, Assistant MSD Director Devashantha Soloman, MSD Accountant (Supplies) Neran Dhananjaya, MSD Stock Controller Sujith Kumara and the owner of the company which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of IVIG vials. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

        "title": "Google to delete incognito search data to end privacy suit",
        "date": "April 3, 2024 02:33 pm",
        "content": "Google has agreed to delete a vast trove of search data to settle a suit that it tracked millions of US users who thought they were browsing the internet privately. If a proposed settlement filed Monday in San Francisco federal court is approved by a judge, Google must delete andor remediate billions of data records linked to people using the Chrome browsers incognito mode, according to court documents. This settlement is an historic step in requiring dominant technology companies to be honest in their representations to users about how the companies collect and employ user data, and to delete and remediate data collected, lawyer David Boies said in the filing. A hearing is slated for July 30 before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is to decide whether to approve the deal that would let Google avoid a trial in the class-action suit. The settlement calls for no cash damages to be paid but leaves an option for Chrome users who feel they were wronged to sue Google separately to get money. The suit originally filed in June of 2020 sought at least 5 billion in damages. We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless, Google spokesman Jorge Castaneda said in a statement. We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization. The object of the lawsuit was the Incognito Mode in the Chrome browser that plaintiffs said gave users a false sense that what they were surfing online was not being tracked by the Silicon Valley tech firm. But internal Google emails brought forward in the lawsuit demonstrated that users using incognito mode were being followed by the search and advertising behemoth for measuring web traffic and selling ads. The lawsuit, filed in a California court, claimed Googles practices had infringed on users privacy by intentionally deceiving them with the incognito option. The original complaint alleged that Google had been given the power to learn intimate details about individuals lives, interests, and internet usage. Google has made itself an unaccountable trove of information so detailed and expansive that George Orwell could never have dreamed it, it added. The settlement requires Google, for the next five years, to block third-party tracking cookies by default in Incognito Mode. Third-party cookies are small files which are used to target advertising by tracking web navigation and are placed by visited sites and not by the browser itself. No cookies? Google earlier this year began limiting third-party cookies for some users of its Chrome browser, a first step towards eventually abandoning the files that have raised privacy concerns. Google announced in January 2020 that it would begin eliminating third-party cookies within two years, but the start has been delayed several times amid opposition from web media publishers. Cookies have recently been subject to greater regulation, including the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation introduced in 2016 as well as regulations in California.

The order was issued when the case filed against Fernando was taken up before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court today (03). A request had been made to the court stating that the defendant is required to travel to several foreign countries and after taking the facts presented in this regard into consideration, the court has temporarily lifted the foreign travel ban subject to previous bail conditions. The court had previously imposed an overseas travel ban on Pastor Jerome Fernando in connection with the case filed against him for allegedly making derogatory statements about other religions in May last year. The controversial pastor was arrested on 01 December 2023 after a video of one of his sermons, containing alleged derogatory statements on other religions, went viral on social media. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando had finally returned to the island on Wednesday morning (29 Nov.). Pastor Jerome had initially provided a statement to the CID on 30 November for around eight hours. This was after the Court of Appeal issued an interim order on 17 November, directing the CID not to arrest him upon his arrival in Sri Lanka. The order also mandated Pastor Fernando to record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his return. The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court granted bail to the self-styled prophet Jerome Fernando on 03 January 2024. Despite being granted bail, the court imposed travel restrictions on Pastor Jerome, prohibiting him from leaving the country, and the strict condition that he refrain from making any such statements in the future that could disturb religious harmony.",

        "content": "Three Sri Lankans, who were convicted in the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and prematurely freed from prison, returned to the island on Wednesday (03). According to Ada Derana correspondent, the trio  Murugan (53), Robert Payas (53) and Jayakumar (62)  reached the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on Wednesday afternoon after departing Chennai, India around 11.30 IST. They were among six freed in November 2022 by the Indian Supreme Court, which had said they showed satisfactory behaviour while in jail and also noted the Tamil Nadu government had recommended their release. Upon their release from jail, the three men were escorted from a special camp in Tiruchirappalli, where they had been detained, to the Chennai International Airport by a team of police officers in the morning. They had recently been granted passports by Sri Lanka to facilitate their return. One of the six - Murugan - is married to Nalini, an Indian citizen who was among the six released in 2022 on the Supreme Courts orders. Nalini accompanied her husband to the airport; visuals showed her sitting with him for a few moments before he was taken into the terminal. Three decades ago, an intervention by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, the late Prime Ministers widow, spared Nalinis life - she, and the others, had been sentenced to death - after it emerged she had been pregnant during the sentencing. Her daughter is now a doctor in the United Kingdom. The death sentences of the others was commuted by the top court, citing an inordinate delay by the President in disposing off their mercy pleas. Nalini is attempting to secure a visa for the reunion with her daughter. Her brother, Packianathan, told NDTV, ... we hope Murugan will also get it from Colombo. They just want the family reunion. Another of the six released two years ago - Santhan - died in a Chennai hospital. He had been receiving treatment for a liver condition. He too was a Sri Lankan national. The first of the convicts released was Perarivalan, also an Indian citizen. He was released in May 2022. --with inputs from agencies",

Juan Vicente Pérez, who was born on May 27, 1909, would have celebrated his 115th birthday next month. Juan Vicente Perez Mora has transcended into eternity at 114 years of age, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on social media platform X. Perez was officially confirmed as the oldest man alive on February 4, 2022, when he was 112 years and 253 days old, according to Guinness. A father of 11, as of 2022 he had 41 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren and 12 great-great-grandchildren. The farmer known as Tio Vicente was born in the town of El Cobre, in the Andean state of Tachira on May 27, 1909, and was the ninth of 10 children. At the age of five years old, he started working with his dad and brothers in agriculture and assisted with sugar cane and coffee harvesting, a Guinness statement from 2022 said. Perez went on to become a sheriff and was responsible for resolving land and family disputes, while still working in agriculture. In an interview with Guinness World Records, Mr Pérez Mora put his longevity down to working hard, resting on holidays, going to bed early, drinking a glass of aguardiente every day, loving God, and always carrying him in his heart. He was married to Ediofina del Rosario García for more than six decades until her passing in 1997. They had six sons and five daughters together.

        "date": "April 3, 2024 09:13 pm",
        "content": "Rescue efforts are under way in Taiwan after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the islands eastern coast, killing at least nine and injuring more than 800. Some 127 people are trapped in collapsed tunnels and on mountainous roads along the rugged coastline. The epicentre was 18km (11 miles) south of Hualien city, but strong tremors were felt all the way in the capital Taipei, more than 100km away. This is the strongest quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years. It also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands which were later retracted. It caused the most damage in Hualien, where buildings fell, roads were blocked and train lines disrupted, leaving the remote region even more cut off from the rest of Taiwan. I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over, Ocean Tsai, who lives in Hualien, told BBC Chinese. It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal. But social media was soon filled with extraordinary footage of landslides along the coast. They tumbled down the mountains, making huge clouds billow up from the sea as they crashed into it. It is along this coastline, with its narrow, winding roads and tunnels carved out of the rock, that dozens have become trapped. The route is popular with tourists, famed for its spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But it is also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides. Rescue operations to reach 77 people trapped in the Jinwen and Qingshui tunnels along the road in Hualien were continuing into the night. Pictures show how the road outside the Qingshui tunnel has simply fallen away. It is unclear how long those inside will be trapped - and whether or not they have food and water, or can communicate with the outside world. Further north, Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing collapsed residential buildings, and people being evacuated from their homes and schools. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray. Power cuts and internet outages were reported across the island. The earthquake is close to land and its shallow. Its felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... Its the strongest in 25 years, said Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipeis Seismology Centre. Taiwan, home to 23 million people, is largely mountainous in the east, where Hualien sits. It is a sparsely populated area, home to indigenous tribes. For most of its history, the area has been completely cut off from the rest of Taiwan because of its high mountains. But since the 1930s the government has carved roads out of the rockface and built tunnels connecting the area to the rest of the island - it is still, however, considered a difficult place to reach, which will complicate rescue efforts. These are stunning routes that take locals and tourists to the Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien, which is considered to be one of the natural wonders of Asia. Three of those who died were hikers on a trail there and 50 of those who are trapped are staff who were being transported to a popular hotel, ahead of a four-day long weekend. Wednesdays earthquake hit at 07:58 local time (23:58 GMT) at a depth of 15.5km and set off at least nine aftershocks at magnitude 4 or larger. The government must ensure the accuracy of information and provide timely assistance to people in need, so that people can feel at ease and safe, President Tsai Ing-wen said. Taiwans foreign office issued a statement on X expressing thanks for the offers of aid from allies and friends like Japan and Paraguay. Taiwans agency, which engages with China, the Mainland Affairs Council, also thanked China for its concern but said there would be no request for assistance from that side. Beijing claims sovereignty of the self-governed island, which sees itself as distinct from China. While Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades. The last major quake - at 7.6-magnitude - hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 3, 2024 10:51 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed deep concern about the recent remarks made by certain Members of Parliament condemning the invocation of Supreme Courts fundamental rights jurisdiction by a citizen to challenge the issuance of liquor licenses. Reiterating that every citizen has a fundamental right to seek redress from the Supreme Court, the apex court of the country, as enshrined in the Constitution, the BASL said this right cannot be curtailed under the guise of parliamentary privileges. Accordingly, it has categorically condemned the claims made by these MPs suggesting otherwise. The BASL, in a statement issued on Wednesday (03), said it views with grave concern that any attempts to use parliamentary privileges to interfere with the independence of the judiciary directly or indirectly. It also emphasized that it would, under no circumstances, remain silent when attempts are made to weaken the independence of the judiciary. The recent trend of parliamentarians making statements that undermine the rule of law and the proper administration of justice is deeply troubling. Furthermore, the BASL raised concerns about reports of a citizen being summoned before a parliamentary privileges committee for expressing personal views on social media regarding an MP. The Constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, to all citizens. Holding individuals accountable before Parliament for expressing their views on the performance of elected officials is a clear violation of these fundamental rights. The right to freedom of expression is a cornerstone of a democratic society. Sri Lankan citizens have the right to express their views, including those critical of a legislators performance, without fear of retribution from Parliament. As such, the BASL urged all parties to uphold the rule of law and respect the independence of the judiciary, underscoring that the citizens must be free to exercise their fundamental rights, and parliamentarians should refrain from actions that undermine these principles. It also went on to urge all stakeholders to uphold the principles enshrined in the Constitution, particularly the independence of the judiciary and the fundamental rights of citizens.",

        "date": "April 3, 2024 11:55 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has declared the formation of an Agricultural Modernization Organization Council, which will be chaired by both the Head of State and Prime Minister. The primary objective of this council will be to oversee the restructuring of ministries, institutions, and organizations associated with agriculture in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe made this announcement during a progress review meeting of the Agriculture Modernization Program held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday morning (03). He emphasized that establishment of this new council aims to enhance the efficiency of government institutions involved in the agricultural modernization initiative. At the meeting, Senior Prof. Gamini Senanayake, Chairman of the expert committee, presented the policy framework devised for the modernization of the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka to the President. The policy framework devised for the implementation of the agriculture modernization program in Sri Lanka encompasses various key objectives. These include enhancing productivity and efficiency, promoting sustainability and resilience, fostering inclusive growth and rural development, ensuring food security and nutrition, improving market access and trade, strengthening institutional capacity and governance, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. During discussions, it was revealed that 26 projects have been meticulously chosen from 26 Divisional Secretariat divisions, covering all 25 districts, for the initial implementation phase of the agricultural modernization program. Funds have already been allocated to kick-start these pilot projects, indicating a proactive approach towards achieving tangible results. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the necessity of transitioning from subsistence agriculture towards a more modernized approach that encompasses both large-scale and small-scale operations. He underlined the pivotal role of the agricultural export sector in the national economy, highlighting the urgent need for the rapid transformation of agriculture to align with the broader economic development agenda of the country. During the deliberations, significant emphasis was placed on advancing and refining various facets of agriculture, encompassing paddy cultivation, other agricultural crops, as well as dairy production and animal husbandry. The participants explored avenues to modernize these sectors, aiming to enhance their efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. Moreover, discussions revolved around the allocation of 500,000 acres of new land for cultivation, indicating a concerted effort to expand agricultural activities in Sri Lanka and address emerging agricultural challenges. Plans were also devised to educate and train farmers across the nation in modern agricultural techniques, underscoring the importance of equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in evolving agricultural landscapes. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe engaged with officials on the potential for leveraging support from the private sector and attracting foreign investments to drive the agricultural transformation process forward. He highlighted the importance of prompt restructuring of public institutions to facilitate the establishment of public-private partnerships and foster cooperation, signalling a collaborative approach to address agricultural development needs. In addition to modernizing agricultural practices, discussions also centred on the importance of value addition to agricultural products and the exploration of export opportunities. Collaborative efforts with the private sector were highlighted as a means to streamline processes and eliminate or restructure redundant public institutions, thereby fostering a more efficient and responsive agricultural ecosystem. President Wickremesinghe underscored the critical role of water management, particularly in the face of climate change, emphasizing the need for the implementation of advanced strategies to ensure sustainable water usage in agricultural activities. Furthermore, the Presidents attention was directed towards resolving pressing issues related to land ownership for farmers, facilitating access to modern machinery essential for agricultural modernization, and encouraging youth participation in agriculture through supportive initiatives. To expedite progress in these areas, the President instructed officials to prepare and submit proposals related to the overall plan within two weeks. He expressed his intention to discuss these proposals with relevant ministries and seek Cabinet approval, underscoring the governments commitment to advancing agricultural modernization initiatives in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe affirmed his commitment to transparency and accountability by stating his intention to present the proposal to Parliament. Prior to this, relevant parliamentary oversight committees will be given the opportunity to review the proposal, ensuring comprehensive scrutiny and input from stakeholders.

        "date": "April 4, 2024 10:26 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday (03) reaffirmed the governments commitment to facilitating economic growth and providing financial resources for essential public services. Addressing a ceremony held at the Temple Trees to award appointment letters to 2,320 graduate teachers in the Western Province, the Head of State spoke of the positive economic trajectory that Sri Lanka has achieved through prudent fiscal management by the government. Despite a previous period of economic decline, the Sri Lankan economy has witnessed a strengthening, leading to the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, Wickremesinghe highlighted. He attributed this positive shift to effective economic policies implemented by the government, which allowed for the current recruitment of teachers. Last year, the rupee had depreciated to 370 against the dollar, but today, it stands at 300. The president expressed his optimism in further reducing this value to 280 in the future, which he said would bolster the purchasing power of the people. Wickremesinghe emphasized the governments commitment to facilitating economic growth and providing financial resources for essential public services. Despite facing challenges, the Head of State underscored the governments achievements in enhancing public sector salaries and benefits, tripling Aswesuma welfare benefits and ensuring fair prices for agricultural produce, particularly during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season. Looking ahead, he affirmed the governments dedication to further bolstering economic development, with plans to allocate additional funds to the education sector for teacher recruitment by the following year. Wickremesinghe also announced significant strides in education, revealing that the government has initiated the recruitment of approximately 4,000 teachers in 2024. With the strengthening of the countrys economy, he assured that more funds would be allocated to fill teaching vacancies by the following year. He highlighted that while 2,300 teachers have been appointed, there are still 700 vacancies to be filled. Plans are underway to hire approximately 1000 more teachers based on existing vacancies. This year alone, around 4000 teachers have been recruited, marking a significant milestone after a hiatus of three to four years. The president attributed the resumption of teacher recruitment to the countrys economic recovery and the easing of constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had previously halted such initiatives.",

The fishermen representatives of the north pointed out that the illegal encroachment of the northern coast by Indian fishermen have severely affected their livelihoods. Moreover, it was disclosed that the damage to marine resources due to fishing using trawling methods by Indian fishermen has not been assessed so far, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. The committees chair expressed his displeasure that although surveys of marine resources within 24 nautical miles from the coast have been conducted in other parts of the island, the relevant government institutions have not conducted such a survey in the North. Considering these facts, the committee instructed the Fisheries Secretary to consult all relevant parties regarding the prevention of illegal fishing activities in the North and submit a report containing the necessary recommendations to the Parliament as soon as possible. Furthermore, there was a discussion at length regarding the permission given to import fish to Sri Lanka for re-export. The committees chair pointed out that the imported fish would be re-exported with added value and a portion of it would be sold locally. He argued that by doing so, the country will lose taxes and the reputation of Sri Lankan fish in the international market would also be affected. Meanwhile, the officials revealed that a certain company involved in importing and re-exporting fish is bringing in a type of prawns that can cause diseases, adding that it has started to affect the entire shrimp production in Sri Lanka. The committees chair raised a question regarding the decision taken to allow the import of fish affecting the fishing industry and instructed the secretary to the Fisheries Ministry to call all relevant parties immediately and take a decision in this regard.

Singer-songwriter Swift entered the rich list after achieving megastar status. She stole the show at this years Grammy Awards, becoming the first performer to win the prize for album of the year four times. Her album 1989 (Taylors Version) was also the best-selling vinyl LP of last year. Swifts success is not just confined to the world of music.

        "date": "April 4, 2024 04:12 pm",
        "content": "Amid the attempts of Indias Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to reignite the decades-old Katchatheevu issue ahead of the general elections, former Sri Lankan envoy to India Austin Fernando said the party may have invoked a vote-puller but it would be difficult for the Indian government to step back after the elections, which is a problem. A widely respected and experienced official, Fernando was speaking with The Indian Express over the phone from Colombo on Wednesday. He said if the Indian government crosses the Sri Lankan maritime international boundary line, it would be seen as a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty, as he recalled Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasas statements on the Indian Peacekeeping Force in late 1980s. If Pakistan proposes such sea encroachment near Goa, will India tolerate it? Or if Bangladesh does something like this in the Bay of Bengal, what will be Indias response? said Fernando, who was Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India between 2018 and 2020. India had ceded the tiny island of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. Now, weeks before the Lok Sabha election in Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused the Indira Gandhi government of callously giving it away to Sri Lanka. Fernando said: BJP does not have much of a hold in Tamil Nadu comparatively, so it has sparked off a vote-puller. It seems that this is only rhetoric for the election. But once they have said something like this, it is difficult for the government to get out of it after the elections, because BJP will win. It is the problem. They and we both should think about it, he told The Indian Express. To satisfy the voters of Tamil Nadu, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar might say: Well, let us have the fishing rights in the Katchatheevu area. Whether it can be done effectively or not is another issue. Who would control any issues? Do not tell us it is the Indian Coast Guard, said Fernando, who has also served as Sri Lankan Defence Secretary. If the Sri Lankan government gives in, it will reduce a fair share of northern fishermens votes to the government, Fernando said. If the Indian government crosses the Sri Lankan maritime international boundary line, then it will be seen as a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty. Do not forget that that stance was taken by President Premadasa when the IPKF was here, he said. Fernando, 81, has held several top-level positions in the Sri Lankan government  including as Secretary to the Sri Lankan President, Governor of Eastern province, Advisor to Sri Lankan Prime Minister, Defence Secretary and Home Secretary. In his illustrious career of almost six decades, he has worked with Sri Lankan Presidents and Prime Ministers from across the political aisle. Speaking about the economic aid extended by the Indian government during the countrys economic crisis, he said: I am mindful of the fact that India helped Sri Lanka during the economic difficulty by extending 4 billion and supporting us at the International Monetary Fund. Our government will be thinking of that, so they have to diplomatically keep mum because of such obligations. Because of the current difficult situation in our country and the election environment here, I think this should not have been raised at all. But I understand that for BJP it may be the most opportune time. Referring to the Indian presence in Sri Lanka, he said: The Opposition here is critical of Indian investments and this will fuel more criticism, creating another difficult political environment. Former Indian and Sri Lankan diplomats had told The Indian Express Tuesday that the governments in place in the 1970s had concluded the agreement in good faith, where both sides had won some and lost some. Indian diplomats, who have dealt with Sri Lanka in the past, have also underlined that Delhi was able to get access to Wadge Bank and its rich resources. Source: The Indian Express -Agencies",

        "content": "State-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. is in preliminary talks with Indias atomic power monopoly to build small nuclear units, an early-stage technology seen as a cost-effective alternative to larger plants. The refiner and fuel retailer is exploring a partnership with state-controlled Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd. to use small modular reactors, or SMRs, in its refineries for clean power, Alok Sharma, Indian Oils director for research and development, said at a conference in New Delhi Wednesday. As several bigger projects face delays, policymakers are promoting small-scale nuclear technology with a capacity of up to 300 megawatts, which is quicker to build and easier to adjust to the requirements of the grid. To boost the nascent sector, the Indian government is considering allowing private firms to manage and operate reactors. Besides Indian Oil, state-run power producer NTPC Ltd. and hydrocarbons producer Oil  Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. are among companies exploring opportunities in nuclear. India produces about three-quarters of its electricity from coal, while nuclear accounts for about 3 of the generation. Globally, only China and Russia have operating SMR units, while some other countries are preparing for their commissioning, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

The Colombo District Court on Thursday (04) issued an interim injunction preventing Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP chairman, following a complaint filed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Speaking to the media this evening (04), Sirisena said: I got to know in the afternoon that Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike has obtained an interim injunction to remove me from the chairmanship of SLFP. I only saw on media that the injunction is effective until April 18. The former President also said that he has not been officially informed of the order in writing as of yet. These types of challenges are not new in the history of the SLFP. Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike, Mr. Kumaratunga, Mr. Anura Bandaranaike they have all separated from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and formed new parties. After Mrs. Bandaranaikes civic rights were stripped in 1977, we had to remain in the opposition for 17 years due to such actions by them, he added. Regardless of the challenges we face, we, as a steadfast group within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, will conduct future political activities independently of the ruling party.

        "date": "April 4, 2024 09:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the governments prudent decisions over the past two years have bolstered the nations economy, providing a favourable environment for political activities on the streets. However, he cautioned that the economy still faces challenges, urging citizens to weigh the choice of either continuing with the governments initiatives for prosperity or risking regression. Highlighting a remarkable increase of over 50 in government income in 2023 compared to 2022, President Wickremesinghe underscored the conducive backdrop for advancing confidently with a robust economy. These remarks were made during his attendance at the inauguration of the International Gem and Jewellery Trade Centre, known as the Ratnapura Gem Tower, this morning (04). Plans have been shown for the construction of the Ratnapura Gem Tower in Demuwawa area of Ratnapura, to be executed in two phases. The initial phase saw the completion of a five-story building, costing Rs. 365 million. The forthcoming second phase entails the construction of an additional 14 floors, with an estimated expenditure of Rs. 450 million. The newly inaugurated International Gem Trade Centre comprises 27 business premises, with 17 allocated to local entrepreneurs and 10 designated for foreign counterparts. Financing for this venture is sourced from the National Gems and Jewellery Authority, aiming to establish an international hub facilitating seamless transactions between sellers and buyers. Functioning akin to renowned sales centres in Bangkok and Hong Kong, the centre will offer comprehensive services including independent quality testing, laboratory facilities, and banking and export services. This initiative aims to bolster the gem and jewellery trade, positioning Ratnapura as a pivotal player in the global market. During his visit to the International Gems and Jewellery Trade Centre, President Ranil Wickremesinghe not only unveiled the plaque to mark its inauguration but also conducted an inspection tour of the facilities. As part of the occasion, a souvenir gift was presented to the President, and he left a commemorative note in the special guest book. Addressing the gathering, the President emphasized the governments commitment to further enhancing the gem and jewellery industrys contribution to the national economy. He instructed officials to compile a report by the end of April outlining potential solutions to industry challenges and proposed reliefs for industry stakeholders. Notably, the President stressed the importance of ensuring benefits for gem miners as part of this initiative. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the significance of the International Gem Trading Centre in elevating Sri Lankas gems to attain their rightful value on the international stage. This initiative aims to position Sri Lanka as a prominent player in the global gem and jewellery market, fostering economic growth and prosperity for the nation. During his address at the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged the origins of the International Gems and Jewellery Centre, noting that its construction commenced during the tenure of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He also paid tribute to the dedication of Ministers Lohan Ratwatte and Chamara Sampath to the projects realization. Highlighting the significance of the centre, President Wickremesinghe emphasized that its impact extends beyond Ratnapura, positioning it as a pivotal hub for the gem and jewellery industry nationwide. He reiterated the governments commitment to fostering the industrys growth and its pivotal role in contributing to the national economy. Reflecting on the challenges faced by the gem and jewellery sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn in the 2021-2022 period, President Wickremesinghe noted a modest improvement in 2023. He underscored the industrys resilience and its contribution as a cornerstone for economic recovery efforts. Following recent discussions with relevant ministries regarding challenges stemming from increased taxes in the gem and gold sectors, I have instructed officials to explore potential reliefs and submit a report by the end of this April, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated. Additionally, we are aiming to generate at least USD 02 billion in revenue from this field in the future, with a particular emphasis on ensuring benefits for gem miners during the sectors development. In reflecting on the countrys economic trajectory over the past two years, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the difficult journey, which necessitated tough decisions, including tax hikes. Nonetheless, he underscored the positive outcomes achieved to date, instilling confidence for the future. Highlighting a significant transformation in the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) growth, President Wickremesinghe noted a shift from a decline of minus 7.4 in July 2022 to a positive 4.5 in 2024. This marked improvement over two years underscores the resilience and perseverance of the population, who endured hardships and contributed to the nations economic advancement. President Ranil Wickremesinghe provided insightful data on the countrys economic progress. He noted that in July 2022, inflation stood at a staggering 54.6, but today it has significantly reduced to 0.9. This control over inflation has contributed to the strengthening of the Sri Lankan Rupee. Additionally, bank interest rates have decreased from 23.8 to 10.3, with expectations for further reduction in the coming months as stated by the Governor of the Central Bank. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the improvement in the foreign exchange rate, which has decreased from Rs. 361.80 per dollar in the past to Rs. 300.40 presently. Efforts are underway to further lower this rate to Rs. 280, aiming to bolster the strength of the rupee. In terms of government finances, President Wickremesinghe emphasized a significant increase of over 50 in government income in 2023 compared to 2022. Furthermore, expenditure for social services has tripled, reflecting the governments commitment to enhancing social welfare. Regarding debt restructuring, President Wickremesinghe noted the completion of discussions on domestic debt and highlighted the on-going negotiations with creditor countries. He stressed the importance of adhering to relevant goals and agreements, including those with the International Monetary Fund, to ensure the successful continuation of this process. President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined ambitious targets for reducing government debt as a percentage of GDP, aiming to bring it down from the current 128 to 95 by 2032. He emphasized the necessity of achieving a cash income of 35 of GDP, which needs to be reduced to 13 by 2032. Additionally, the goal is to transform foreign loans, which currently stand at 9.4 of GDP, into a surplus of 2.3 by 2025. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of adhering to these targets to avoid repercussions such as demands for loan repayment from creditor countries. Highlighting recent positive developments, President Wickremesinghe mentioned a successful harvest during the Maha season and efforts to increase salaries for government employees during this New Year season. He also noted relief provided through increased Aswesuma benefits and announced plans to distribute an additional 20 kilograms of rice to low-income individuals in the coming months. Moreover, the initiation of decentralized budgeting has injected funds into the rural economy, while tourism and foreign exchange earnings have shown promising signs of recovery, contributing to the reconstruction of the countrys income landscape. President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the stark contrast between the challenging conditions of the past and the current improved situation. He pointed out the scarcity of fuel for three-wheelers and electricity shortages in previous times, contrasting it with the present abundance of fuel and availability of electricity. President Wickremesinghe noted that the income of three-wheeler drivers has also increased, attributed to the influx of both domestic and foreign tourists. He emphasized the significance of these improvements by highlighting the three-wheeler drivers involvement in political activities, while displaying posters, which would not have been feasible without the economic progress achieved in the last two years. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of safeguarding the current economic gains and moving forward. He cautioned against the risk of regression, emphasizing that the country still teeters on the edge economically. He called for a decisive choice between either falling back into past hardships or continuing to advance from the current position. Adressing the gathering, Industry and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana expressed his enthusiasm as the International Gem Trade Centre, initiated in 2021, is officially inaugurated today. Dr. Pathirana emphasized the pivotal role of this centre in facilitating rapid growth in the countrys foreign exchange earnings, providing a crucial platform for gem businessmen. He highlighted the proactive approach taken by local leaders in addressing the challenges faced by gem traders, with the President offering directives for prompt resolutions. Comparing Sri Lankas gem trade performance to that of Hong Kong and Thailand, Dr. Pathirana underscored the immense potential for revenue generation. Despite Sri Lankas abundant gem resources, its income in this sector remains comparatively low. Dr. Pathirana advocated for the timely promotion of free trade, akin to the successful models in Thailand and Hong Kong, expressing confidence in the endorsement of such economic initiatives by the President. Minister of Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation and Irrigation Mrs. Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, hailed the inauguration of the International Gem Trade Centre in Ratnapura as a significant boon for the nations economy. She acknowledged the myriad challenges faced by gem businessmen in the past, including the burden of high bank interest rates amidst an economic crisis. Minister Wanniarachchi credited President Ranil Wickremesinghes economic policies upon assuming office, which provided much-needed relief not only to gem traders but also to the wider populace. She highlighted the establishment of the international gem trade centre as a testament to President Wickremesinghes efforts in uplifting the countrys economic stature. Furthermore, Minister Wanniarachchi commended initiatives such as the Aswesuma program, aimed at safeguarding the livelihoods of twenty lakh impoverished families, and the Urumaya program, which sought to secure land rights for citizens. In concluding her remarks, Minister Wanniarachchi underscored President Wickremesinghes demonstrated leadership and capability in steering the nation through tumultuous times, emphasizing the importance of experienced leadership for the countrys progress. Minister of State for Primary Industries Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, expressed his optimism regarding the opening of the International Gem Trade Centre, emphasizing its potential to significantly benefit not only Ratnapura but also the entire nations economy. He highlighted the centre s ability to centralize and streamline the gem business community in Ratnapura, thereby boosting income generation rates. State Minister Dasanayake underscored that the centre is fully equipped with facilities essential for the gem business. In response to media reports discussing economic development, State Minister criticized political leaders who had not stepped forward to address the economic crisis in 2022, yet now seek to engage in debates regarding the countrys economic progress. He questioned the credibility of individuals who failed to develop the housing development authority in spearheading the nations economic development efforts. Member of Parliament W.D.J. Seneviratne highlighted the historical significance of gemstones in Sri Lanka and lamented the lack of a comprehensive program to properly value and showcase them on the global stage. He commended the establishment of the International Gem Trade Centre as a landmark initiative, marking the first concerted effort to bring Sri Lankas gem industry to the world market. Mr. Seneviratne emphasized the importance of this international centre in facilitating the sale of Sri Lankan gems at fair prices globally, which in turn would contribute to the economic recovery of the country. He noted that the conception of this centre dates back to 2012, and its completion despite numerous challenges represents a victory for both the business community and the nation as a whole. The event was attended by a distinguished gathering including the Chancellor of Uva-Wellassa University and the Chief Incumbent of the Sri Pada Temple (Adams Peak) Ven. Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Nayaka Thera, Ministers of State Lohan Rathwatte and Janaka Wakkumbura, as well as Members of Parliament Akila Ellawala and Gamini Waleboda. Also in attendance were the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province Navin Dissanayake and the Chairman of the National Gems and Jewellery Authority Viraj Silva, alongside prominent gem businessmen and members of the gem and jewellery community. --PMD--",

        "date": "April 5, 2024 08:23 am",
        "content": "The number of scams in Singapore hit a record high in 2023, Home Minister K. Shanmugam said, adding that the country saw a rise of 18 per cent in duping cases against migrants, many of whom are from India and Sri Lanka. A total of 46,563 cases of scams were reported in Singapore, with people losing SGD 651.8 million to scams in 2023, the police earlier told The Straits Times, saying this is the highest number of scam cases since they began tracking them in 2016. Falling prey to the scams are about 500 foreign maids from South Asian countries, mostly from India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, migrated to the country in search of better employment opportunities, higher wages and a stable political and economic environment. How are they duped? In 2020, a maid from Myanmar was reached out via messaging application Viber where a man who claimed to be a bank staff member asked her details to update her ATM card. Before she realised, around SGD 2,600 were withdrawn from her account, leaving her with just SGD 45. Fortunately, she managed to recover SGD 1,700 from the bank, as per a report by the Singaporean newspaper. How is government preventing the scam spike? When Shanmugam was asked whether the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) tracks the number of such workers and what measures the authorities are taking to prevent financial crimes, he assured that they are doing their bit by creating awareness and training the workers against the scams. The foreign maids majorly fell for phishing, Internet love, and loan scams in 2021, the police had said in February. The home minister said as part of the Ministry of Manpowers mandatory settling-in programme, workers are asked to adopt measures to protect themselves from scams adding that the authorities carry out anti-scam education efforts regularly for workers already working here. They are educated on the latest scam trends so that they are equipped to detect scams and become advocates for scam prevention within their own community, said Shanmugam in his reply. As per the annual scams statistics for 2023, people in Singapore have lost more than 2.3 billion to scams since 2019. With many losing a large chunk of their income and lifetime savings. Not only to protect themselves against financial scams, the police also run the Domestic Guardians Programme, which trains migrant domestic workers on how to prevent common crimes such as housebreaking, trespassing, and abuse.

        "date": "April 5, 2024 09:16 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that there is strong expectation that Sri Lanka will reach a deal with its commercial creditors by the completion of the IMFs second review. Sri Lanka is in talks with bondholders to restructure about USD 12 billion in debt, a key step in its bid to emerge from a punishing financial crisis. There is a strong expectation that agreements with commercial creditors consistent with program parameters will be reached by completion of the second review, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack told a press briefing. The IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Sri Lanka on its second review of a four-year bailout programme late last month, but it still needs approval from the IMFs board. Kozack further commented that the macroeconomic policy reforms in Sri Lanka are starting to bear fruit, adding that commendable outcomes include rapid disinflation, robust reserve accumulation, and initial signs of economic growth while preserving the stability of the financial system. Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms, and it is critical that this reform momentum be continued, she added. --with inputs from Reuters",

        "date": "April 5, 2024 11:25 am",
        "content": "President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year. A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as Netanyahus office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza. Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since Hamass October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally. But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior. In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that. For the first time, Biden made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israels immediate action to curtail the killing of civilians and aid workers and improve the dire humanitarian situation, the White House said. The tough language, describing the aid worker attack as unacceptable and urging Israel to take steps towards an immediate ceasefire, reflected mounting tensions with Netanyahu. What happened to the World Central Kitchen, that event certainly was a catalyst for the call today, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN Thursday evening. Earlier this week the WCK convoy was repeatedly struck by Israeli forces despite clearing its route with the military. A US-Canadian dual national was among those killed in the attack, which Israel has called a mistake. Bidens frustration has been growing over recent weeks and months over the dangers to the civilian population in Gaza and to aid workers, Kirby said. Later that evening Netanyahus office announced it was reopening the Erez border crossing for the first time since October 7 to allow aid into the northern Gaza Strip, as well as allowing supplies to pass through the port of Ashdod. Increased levels of Jordanian aid will go through Kerem Shalom. The White House said the steps were taken at the presidents request and must now be fully and rapidly implemented. Stop it now The Biden administration faces a difficult balancing act on Gaza between what Kirby called its overall ironclad commitment to Israel and mounting opposition at home to the war. Democrats fear anger among Arab American and Muslim voters in an expected tight election against Republican Donald Trump in November. A key Biden confidant had earlier urged him to leverage the huge military aid that Washington gives Israel every year. I think were at that point, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from the presidents home state of Delaware, told CNN. Biden also reportedly faces pressure even closer to home -- from First Lady Jill Biden. Stop it, stop it now, she told the president about the growing toll of civilian casualties in Gaza, according to comments by Biden himself during a meeting with members of the Muslim community, reported by the New York Times. Bedrock ally Despite historic tensions with right-winger Netanyahu, Biden traveled to Israel as a self-described Zionist days after the Hamas attacks and hugged the premier. But Bidens rhetoric has sharpened as the civilian death toll soared past 30,000 and the humanitarian situation becomes ever more dire. Biden ordered US airdrops of aid into Gaza. He also allowed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire to go through -- infuriating Netanyahu. Bidens words, however, have not been matched by concrete steps to limit the billions of dollars in military aid flowing to Washingtons bedrock regional ally. The United States approved the transfer of thousands more bombs to Israel on the same day as the Israeli strikes that killed the WCK aid workers, the Washington Post reported Thursday. US voters are increasingly turning against Israels Gaza offensive. A majority of 55 percent now disapprove of Israels actions, compared to 36 percent who approve, according to a Gallup poll released on March 27. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "April 5, 2024 02:28 pm",
        "content": "The statements coming out of India on reclaiming Kachchatheevu island from Sri Lanka have no ground, the Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda has said. The senior Sri Lankan Tamil politicians comments came days after the Narendra Modi government targeted the Congress and its ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu accusing them of overlooking national interests in the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. The BJP has also been targeting the two parties for not ensuring the rights of the fishermen wanting to fish in waters around the Katchatheevu island. It is the election time in India, it is not unusual to hear such noises of claims and counterclaims about Kachchatheevu, Devananda told reporters in Jaffna on Thursday, 4 April. I think India is acting on its interests to secure this place to ensure Sri Lankan fishermen would not have any access to that area and that Sri Lanka should not claim any rights in that resourceful area, Devananda said. The statements on reclaiming Kachchatheevu from Sri Lankas hold has no ground, Devananda has said. Protests from local fishermen The Sri Lankan minister said according to the 1974 agreement fishermen from both sides could fish in the territorial waters of both countries. But it was later reviewed and amended in 1976. Accordingly, fishermen from both countries were banned from fishing in neighbouring waters. Devananda stressed, There claims to be a place called West Bank which is located below Kanyakumari  it is a much bigger area with extensive sea resources  it is 80 times bigger than Kachchatheevu, India secured it at the 1976 review agreement. Devananda, as the fisheries minister, has faced pressure from the local fishermen in recent months. The local fishermen have led widespread protests to stop illegal fishing by their Indian counterparts in the Sri Lankan waters. They say the bottom trawling by the Indians is harmful to Sri Lankan fishing community interests. So far this year, at least 178 Indian fishermen and 23 trawlers have been arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy. Devananda, an ex-Tamil militant who now leads the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, was named a proclaimed offender by a court in Chennai in 1994. MEA steers clear On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) steered clear of the row surrounding Katchatheevu island. To a volley of questions on the Katchatheevu issue, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal referred to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankars recent comments on the matter. I would like to tell you that on the issues that have been raised, the external affairs minister has spoken to the press here in Delhi and also in Gujarat clarifying all the issues, he said. I would refer that you please look at his press engagements. You will get your answers there, Jaiswal said in New Delhi. The Narendra Modi government has targeted the Congress and its ally DMK accusing it of overlooking national interests in the ceding of Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka in the mid-1970s. What did Jaishankar say? Jaishankar on Monday, 1 April, claimed that prime ministers from the Congress displayed indifference about Katchatheevu island as if they did not care and gave away Indian fishermens rights despite legal views to the contrary. Prime ministers such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi dubbed Katchatheevu, given to Sri Lanka in 1974 as part of a maritime boundary agreement, as a little island and little rock, he had told a press conference. Jaishankar asserted that the issue has not cropped up abruptly but was always a live matter. The records exist of the then foreign secretary keeping the then Tamil Nadu chief minister M Karunanidhi, the late DMK patriarch, fully informed of the talks between the two countries, the external affairs minister said. He also accused the DMK of conniving with the Congress in 1974 and thereafter in creating the situation which has been a cause of great concern. The same people who connived at all this are today standing up and trying to pretend to be champions of fishermen, he said. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "content": "Only vehicles used for the tourism sector have been allowed to import, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has clarified. Speaking to the media, Siyambalapitiya expressed that the Cabinet of Ministers approved the import of 250 buses and 750 vans intended for the tourism industry. With the foreign exchange issue in the country, we restricted the import of vehicles. But in the tourism industry, vehicles older than 6 years cannot be used. Now the vehicles are getting old. That is why the Cabinet of Ministers decided to bring 250 buses and 750 vans for the tourism industry. Only 1000 vehicles are imported, he added. At its meeting on April 01, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted a proposal tabled by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando to allow importing a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists. As per the proposal, 6-15-seater vans, as well as 16-30-seater (small) buses and 30-45-seater (large) buses are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief. The approval was given after taking into account the unsatisfactory and insufficient conditions of the vehicles currently used in the tourism industry, despite the fact that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years. The government earlier said that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts.",
