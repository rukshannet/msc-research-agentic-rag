        "title": "Political risks to Sri Lankas debt restructuring agreement recede  Fitch",
        "date": "October 9, 2024 12:32 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan authorities confirmation that they endorse the targets set under the countrys IMF programme, and intend to implement debt restructuring based on the terms agreed with international sovereign bondholders in September, reduces risks to the debt treatment process associated with the outcome of the presidential election on 21 September, says Fitch Ratings. The election of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, of the opposition Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as president in September had increased policy uncertainty, raising the risk that the government could launch challenges to key elements of the IMF programme, potentially delaying Sri Lankas foreign-currency debt restructuring. However, the Ministry of Finance announced on 4 October that consultations with the IMF and Sri Lankas Official Credit Committee had been successfully concluded, suggesting that any policy changes are unlikely to threaten the IMF programme or the debt treatment agreement-in-principle reached under the previous administration. The Ministry also indicated that the consultation had agreed that the preliminary agreement adhered to the principle of comparability of treatment between official creditors and bondholders, and was compatible with the IMF programmes terms. We view this as a positive sign for the restructuring processs prospects. Fitch has rated Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at RD (Restricted Default) since May 2022, and the government is not currently servicing its foreign-currency debt. We may move the IDR out of RD upon the sovereigns completion of a commercial debt restructuring that we judge to have normalised the relationship with the international financial community. Sri Lankas post-default rating would depend upon our assessment of its credit profile. Fitch upgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CCC- in September 2023, reflecting the completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lankas domestic debt optimisation plan. We expect Sri Lankas government debt to remain relatively high, even if debt restructuring is completed successfully along the lines laid out in the agreements with its creditors. The IMF forecasts Sri Lankas gross general government debtGDP ratio to decline only gradually to about 103 of GDP by 2028, from about 116 in 2022, after building in a local- and foreign-currency debt restructuring. The governments revenueGDP ratio remains low, but the effects of several revenue-raising measures passed since May 2022 are beginning to be felt. Revenue collection in 7M24 rose by about 43 yoy, well above the nominal GDP growth rate of 9.5 in 1H24. Our baseline projections assume an increase in revenueGDP, from 11.4 in 2023 to 15.5 in 2026, reflecting the measures already in place. However, these forecasts could be affected, if the new government introduces fiscal reforms. The IMF programmes targets offer some flexibility for changes in the governments fiscal policy approach. The presidents capacity to push through policy changes may depend partly on the outcome of the parliamentary election on 14 November. The JVP and its allies had relatively few seats in the outgoing legislature, though the trends evident in the recent presidential election suggest that there will probably be large changes in the make-up of the new chamber. The economy more broadly remains on a recovering trend. Real GDP growth was 5.0 yoy in 1H24, after contracting by 7.3 during 1H23. We expect the economy to expand by 3.9 in 2024 and to average growth of 3.6 over 2025-2026. External liquidity stresses have also eased, with foreign-exchange reserves hitting USD6.0 billion in August 2024, up almost 66 yoy. Nevertheless, the speed of the recovery in reserves is likely to be set back when Sri Lanka resumes external debt-service payments. --Fitch Ratings--",

Currently, the Prime Minister is working as the Minister of Health. In particular, we say that in the past, a lot of fraud and corruption occurred in matters such as the procurement of large stocks of drugs, he said. Dharmawickrama further emphasized that the new President and the Prime Minister, who is concurrently serving as the Minister of Health, should take immediate action on this matter. As professional associations, we have continuously exposed these. We especially hope that this new president and the health minister will immediately act to appoint a committee to investigate the corruption that occurred in the past. He emphasized that that the appointed committee should not be the same as those in the past and that it needs to be an independent committee. Dharmawickrama added that a conducive environment should be created allowing the healthcare trade union leaders, as well as the healthcare workers, to disclose information about the acts of fraud and corruption they are aware of.",

        "date": "October 9, 2024 03:45 pm",
        "content": "The breakdown of human relationships and the increased isolation of individuals in modern society are significant contributors to rising suicide rates, says Prof. Mohamed Mahees of the Department of Sociology at the University of Colombo. Speaking during Ada Deranas current affairs programme Big Focus on Wednesday (09), he highlighted the growing detachment of people from one another as a pressing concern. Prof. Mahees pointed out that modern humans often prioritize their interactions with technology over meaningful relationships with others, which he believes is a root cause of this growing disconnection. We see that most suicides are reported in developed countries, but Sri Lanka is not one of those. Despite this, the breakdown of human relationships and the isolation of people in society are major factors here as well, he explained. Furthermore, he emphasized the need for individuals to reconnect with themselves and others to rebuild stronger relationships stating, We dont fully understand ourselves or others. To address this, we need to revisit our values and embrace a deeper passion for lifeThe main reason for this is the collapse of human desires, ambitions and unfulfillment of hopes; living with great desires beyond necessity. Quoting poet Rudyard Kipling, he added, It doesnt matter if you lose everything you have; dont lose your passion for life. If you have that, you can regain everything. Prof. Mahees also commented on the role of economic hardships in worsening societal isolation. With the recent economic challenges in the country, we see people unable to adapt, choosing to leave instead. This indicates deficiencies in our sense of humanity. However, we have solutions all around us  through nature, art, religion, and our environment. Highlighting the dangers of advanced technology, Prof. Mahees said that mobile phone use is more dangerous than a T-56 firearm, as it fosters a new form of isolation. People are now alone among people. In the past, we maintained connections with our families, village elders, and nature. Today, we see the individual increasingly isolated, immersed in their phones rather than interacting with those around them, he said. Prof. Mahees called for society to re-evaluate its values and priorities to address this alarming trend and prevent further isolation and disconnection in communities.

        "date": "October 9, 2024 03:57 pm",
        "content": "Scientists David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the award-giving body said on Wednesday, for their work on the structure of proteins. The prize, widely regarded as among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns (1.1 million). One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences, the academy said in a statement. Half the prize was awarded to Baker for computational protein design while the other half was shared by Hassabis and Jumper for protein structure prediction, the academy said. The third award to be handed out every year, the chemistry prize follows those for medicine and physics announced earlier this week. The Nobel prizes were established in the will of dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel and are awarded to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. Half the prize was awarded to Baker for computational protein design while the other half was shared by Hassabis and Jumper for protein structure prediction, the academy said. The third award to be handed out every year, the chemistry prize follows those for medicine and physics announced earlier this week. The Nobel prizes were established in the will of dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel and are awarded to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. First handed out in 1901, 15 years after Nobels death, it is awarded for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. Recipients in each category share the prize sum that has been adjusted over the years. The economics prize is a later addition funded by the Swedish central bank. Chemistry, close to Alfred Nobels heart and the discipline most applicable to his own work as an inventor, may not always be the most headline-grabbing of the prizes, but past recipients include scientific greats such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie. Last years chemistry award went to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Aleksey Ekimov for their discovery of tiny clusters of atoms known as quantum dots, widely used today to create colours in flat screens, light emitting diode (LED) lamps and devices that help surgeons see blood vessels in tumours. Alongside the cash prize, the winners will be presented a medal by the Swedish king on Dec. 10, followed by a lavish banquet in Stockholm city hall. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "TikTok faces new lawsuits filed by 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday, accusing the popular social media platform of harming and failing to protect young people. The lawsuits filed separately in New York, California, the District of Columbia and 11 other states, expand Chinese-owned TikToks legal fight with U.S. regulators, and seek new financial penalties against the company. The states accuse TikTok of using intentionally addictive software designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness. TikTok cultivates social media addiction to boost corporate profits, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content. TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in order to target them with ads, the states say. Young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok, said New York Attorney General Letitia James. TikTok said on Tuesday that it strongly disagreed with the claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading, and that it was disappointed the states chose to sue rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has ordered that a petition filed seeking an order be issued to the National Police Commission to take disciplinary actions against the former Director of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena, to be taken up on November 13. This petition has been filed against the former SIS chief over his failure to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday terror attack despite receiving intelligence in advance. The petition filed by the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) was taken up before a two-member Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Mahen Gopallawa today. During the hearing, Presidents Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for the defendant, stated before the court that the relevant petition filed against his client should be dismissed since the National Police Commission has already initiated a new investigation regarding the matter following a Supreme Court order. Accordingly, the court ordered the next hearing to be scheduled on November 13, in order to consider whether to confirm the facts presented regarding the petition or allow its withdrawal.",

        "content": "The Panadura Magistrate today ordered (09) to remand the 20 Chinese nationals, who were arrested while staying at a hotel in the Gorakana area of Panadura for overstaying their visas, until October 23. The arrest was made following a tip-off received by officers of the Western Province Intelligence Division. In a statement, the Police Media Division indicated that investigations are underway to determine whether there is a connection between the Chinese nationals arrested today and those apprehended by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on October 6 in the Hanwella police area, on suspicion of engaging in organized online financial scams. Officers from the Panadura Special Crimes Unit, who carried out a raid on the hotel, have discovered that the group of Chinese nationals had been staying at the hotel on a monthly rent of Rs. 2 million. During the raid, the police also seized a significant number of electronic devices, including 5 laptops, 437 mobile phones, 332 USB cables, 133 mobile phone chargers, 21 USB cords, 17 routers, 2 iPhones, and other accessories. The items are suspected to be linked to potential financial fraud and scams.

        "content": "The draft resolution AHRC57L.1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka has been adopted without a vote during the ongoing 57th Regular Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. The draft resolution is sponsored by countries including the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia and the United States of America. Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the UN, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, the Human Rights Council has decided to: Recalling previous Human Rights Council resolutions on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, the most recent of which being resolution 511 of 6 October 2022, 1. Welcomes the report of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka, presented to the Human Rights Council at its present session; 2. Decides to extend the mandate of the Office of the High Commissioner and all work requested of it by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 511, and requests the Office to present an oral update to the Council at its fifty-eighth session and a comprehensive report on progress in reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka at its sixtieth session, to be discussed in an interactive dialogue. On Tuesday, Sri Lankas Cabinet of Ministers agreed to strongly reject the proposed drafted resolution at the present session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and that Sri Lanka continues to oppose the 511 resolution of the drafted resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council and has not agreed to any resolution that extends the powers of the collection of external evidence mechanism. Furthermore, the Cabinet of Ministers agreed that even though, the said proposal has been denied, Sri Lanka has firmly believed to take action in respect of main human right issues including the reconciliation through local procedure. Meanwhile, the Cabinet has also reached an agreement that Sri Lanka will continue to engage in the cooperative and meaningful discussions with the Human Rights Council and regular human right mechanism further.",

        "date": "October 9, 2024 10:03 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka today rejected the draft resolution which was tabled before the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) seeking to extend the mandate of Resolution 511 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. Earlier today (09), the draft resolution AHRC57L.1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka was adopted without a vote during the ongoing 57th Regular Session of the UNHRC in Geneva. However, delivering the governments statement prior to the adoption of the draft proposal, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN Himalee Arunatilaka said the draft resolution 57L.1 extends the mandates contained in Human Rights Council resolution 511. She said Sri Lanka has opposed HRC resolution 511 and the preceding HRC resolution 461 under which an external evidence gathering mechanism has been established within the OHCHR. She said Sri Lanka also disassociates from the Report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and that Resolution 511 was tabled without Sri Lankas consent as the country concerned, and was adopted by a divided vote. As such, any subsequent decision extending mandates established by this resolution lack consensus in the Council, the Ambassador said. As we have repeatedly reminded this Council, setting up of this external evidence gathering mechanism within the OHCHR is an unprecedented and ad hoc expansion of the Councils mandate, and contradicts its founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. No sovereign state can accept the superimposition of an external mechanism that runs contrary to its Constitution and which pre-judges the commitment of its domestic legal processes, the statement said. Furthermore, Sri Lanka pointed out that many countries have already raised serious concerns on the budgetary implications of this mechanism given its ever-expanding mandate. For the above reasons, we are obliged to reject the draft resolution which is tabled before this Council today seeking to extend the mandate of Resolution 511. Notwithstanding its rejection of the Resolution, Sri Lanka said it will continue its longstanding constructive engagement with the Council including with regular human rights bodies, and all core Human Rights treaties to which it is party, as well as the countrys commitments under the UPR process. Sri Lanka also expressed appreciation for the principled positions taken by many countries in the UNHRC in support of Sri Lanka as it enters a new chapter in the country. At a time of intense cynicism and polarization within the multilateral arena on human rights and humanitarian situations in the context of the on-going travesties of these norms, we urge the co- sponsors of this politicized draft resolution which we oppose, to support and encourage the Governments clear intention to address human rights and reconciliation through domestic processes and in line with our international obligations.",

        "title": "Ratan Tata, former Tata Group chairman, dies at age 86",
        "date": "October 10, 2024 01:44 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Ratan Tata, the former Tata Group chairman who put a staid and sprawling Indian conglomerate on the global stage with a string of high-profile acquisitions, has died, the Tata Group said in a statement late on Wednesday. He was 86. Tata, who ran the conglomerate for more than 20 years as chairman, had been undergoing intensive care in a Mumbai hospital, two sources with direct knowledge of his medical situation told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. After graduating with a degree in architecture at Cornell University, he returned to India and in 1962 began working for the group his great-grandfather had founded nearly a century earlier. He worked in several Tata companies, including Telco, now Tata Motors Ltd, as well as Tata Steel Ltd, later making his mark by erasing losses and increasing market share at group unit National Radio  Electronics Company. In 1991, he took the helm of the conglomerate when his uncle J.R.D. Tata stepped down - the passing of the baton coming just as India embarked on radical reforms that opened up its economy to the world and ushered in an era of high growth. In one of his first steps, Ratan Tata sought to rein in the power of some heads of Tata Groups companies, enforcing retirement ages, promoting younger people to senior positions and ramping up control over companies. He founded telecommunications firm Tata Teleservices in 1996 and took IT firm Tata Consultancy Services , the groups cash cow, public in 2004. But to grow properly, the group determined it needed to look beyond Indian shores. It was the quest for growth and changing the ground rules to say that we could grow by acquisitions which earlier we had never done, he said in an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2013. The group purchased British tea firm Tetley in 2000 for 432 million and Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007 for 13 billion, at the time the biggest takeover of a foreign firm by an Indian company. Tata Motors then acquired British luxury auto brands Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co in 2008 for 2.3 billion. His pet projects at Tata Motors included the Indica - the first car model designed and built in India - as well as the Nano, touted as the worlds cheapest car. He contributed initial sketches for both models. The Indica was a commercial success. The Nano, however, priced at just 100,000 rupees (about 1,200) and the culmination of Ratan Tatas dream to produce an affordable car for Indias masses, was hurt by initial safety issues and bungled marketing. It was discontinued a decade after its launch. A licensed pilot who would occasionally fly the company plane, Ratan Tata never married and was known for his quiet demeanour, relatively modest lifestyle and philanthropic work. About two-thirds of share capital of Tata Sons, the groups holding company, is held by philanthropic trusts. His leadership at Tata was not without controversy - most notably a bitter public feud after the company ousted Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, as chairman of Tata Sons in 2016. The Tata Group said Mistry had failed to turnaround poorly performing businesses while Mistry accused Ratan Tata, who was chairman emeritus of the conglomerate, of interfering and creating an alternate power centre at the group. After he stepped back from the Tata Group, Ratan Tata became known as a prominent investor in Indian startups, backing a plethora of companies including digital payments firm Paytm, Ola Electric, a unit of ride hailing firm Ola, and home and beauty services provider Urban Company. Among his many awards, he received the Padma Vibhushan, Indias second highest civilian honour, in 2008 for exceptional and distinguished service in trade and industry. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 10, 2024 12:37 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy has stabilized, with growth expected to reach 4.4 percent in 2024, surpassing earlier forecasts. This positive outlook follows four consecutive quarters of growth driven by the industrial and tourism sectors and supported by critical structural and policy reforms, says the World Bank. Released today, the World Banks bi-annual Sri Lanka Development Update, titled Opening Up to the Future, cautions that the recovery remains fragile and hinges on maintaining macroeconomic stability, successfully restructuring debt, and continuing structural reforms to increase medium-term growth and reduce poverty. Key reforms aimed at boosting exports, attracting foreign investment, enhancing female labor force participation, improving productivity, and addressing challenges such as poverty, food insecurity, and vulnerabilities in the financial sector are crucial for achieving more inclusive and sustainable growth. The report underscores the countrys potential for achieving higher and sustainable growth through trade. Sri Lanka has an untapped export potential estimated at 10 billion annually, which could create approximately 142,500 new jobs. There is significant opportunity for diversifying and expanding exports in manufacturing, services and agriculture, provided the necessary reforms are implemented. Sri Lankas recent economic stabilization, marked by four quarters of growth and a current account surplus in 2023, is a significant milestone, said David Sislen, World Bank Regional Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. At this moment, Sri Lanka has a real opportunity to realize its export potential, which we estimate at 10 billion annually. There is an opening for Sri Lanka to deepen its participation in global value chains and take advantage of its geography and an evolving global landscape to generate jobs and sustain growth. The continued implementation of important economic and governance-related reforms will allow Sri Lanka to fully benefit from this moment. Looking ahead, the report projects a modest growth of 3.5 percent in 2025. Growth is then expected to follow a modest path over the medium term due to the scarring effects of the economic crisis. Poverty is expected to gradually decline but remain above 20 percent until 2026. Inflation is likely to stay below the central banks target of 5 percent in 2024, gradually increasing as demand picks up. The current account is projected to remain in surplus in 2024, driven by tourism and remittances. The Sri Lanka Development Update is a companion piece to the South Asia Development Update, a twice-a-year World Bank report that examines economic developments and prospects in the South Asia region and analyzes policy challenges faced by countries in this region. The October 2024 edition, Women, Jobs, and Growth, projects growth of 6.4 percent in South Asia this year, making it the fastest- growing EMDE region in the world. Increasing womens participation in the labor force and opening further to global trade and investment could help the region grow even faster and achieve its development goals, says the World Banks regional outlook.",

        "date": "October 10, 2024 03:18 pm",
        "content": "Hurricane Milton churned across Florida on Thursday after plowing into the state as a Category 3 storm, bringing misery to a coast still ravaged by Helene, pounding cities with winds of over 100 mph (160 kph) after producing a barrage of tornadoes, but sparing Tampa a direct hit. The storm tracked to the south in the final hours and made landfall Wednesday night in Siesta Key near Sarasota, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Tampa. The situation in the Tampa area was still a major emergency as St. Petersburg recorded over 16 inches (41 centimeters) of rain, prompting the National Weather Service to warn of flash flooding there as well as other parts of western and central Florida. Tropicana Field, the home of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team in St. Petersburg, appeared badly damaged. The fabric that serves as the domed stadiums roof was ripped to shreds by the fierce winds. It was not immediately clear if there was damage inside. Multiple cranes were also toppled in the storm, the weather service said. St. Petersburg residents also could no longer get water from their household taps because a water main break led the city to shut down service. The storm knocked out power across a large section of Florida, with more than 3 million homes and businesses without power as of early Thursday, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports. Before Milton even made landfall, tornadoes were touching down across the state. The Spanish Lakes Country Club near Fort Pierce, on Floridas Atlantic Coast, was hit particularly hard, with homes destroyed and some residents killed. We have lost some life, St. Lucie County Sheriff Keith Pearson told WPBF News, though he wouldnt say how many people were killed. About 125 homes were destroyed before the hurricane came ashore, many of them mobile homes in communities for senior citizens, said Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. About 90 minutes after making landfall, Milton was downgraded to a Category 2 storm. By early Thursday, the hurricane was a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of about 85 mph (135 kph) as it moved offshore and was about 35 miles (55 kilometers) east of Orlando. Heavy rains were also likely to cause flooding inland along rivers and lakes as Milton traverses the Florida Peninsula as a hurricane, eventually to emerge in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. It is expected to impact the heavily populated Orlando area. The storm slammed into a region still reeling two weeks after Hurricane Helene flooded streets and homes in western Florida and left at least 230 people dead across the South. In many places along the coast, municipalities raced to collect and dispose of debris before Miltons winds and storm surge could toss it around and compound any damage. Officials had issued dire warnings to flee or face grim odds of survival. This is it, folks, said Cathie Perkins, emergency management director in Pinellas County, which sits on the peninsula that forms Tampa Bay. Those of you who were punched during Hurricane Helene, this is going to be a knockout. You need to get out, and you need to get out now. By late afternoon, some officials said the time had passed for such efforts, suggesting that people who stayed behind hunker down instead. By the evening, some counties announced they had suspended emergency services. Jackie Curnick said she wrestled with her decision to stay aat home in Sarasota, just north of where the storm made landfall. But with a 2-year-old son and a baby girl due Oct. 29, Curnick and her husband thought it was for the best. Curnick said they started packing Monday to evacuate, but they couldnt find any available hotel rooms, and the few they came by were too expensive. She said there were too many unanswered questions if they got in the car and left: Where to sleep, if theyd be able to fill up their gas tank, and if they could even find a safe route out of the state. The thing is its so difficult to evacuate in a peninsula, she said. In most other states, you can go in any direction to get out. In Florida there are only so many roads that take you north or south. At a news conference in Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis described deployment of a wide range of resources, including 9,000 National Guard members from Florida and other states; over 50,000 utility workers from as far as California; and highway patrol cars with sirens to escort gasoline tankers to replenish supplies so people could fill up their tanks before evacuating. Unfortunately, there will be fatalities. I dont think theres any way around that, DeSantis said. Heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida starting Wednesday morning, with conditions deteriorating throughout the day. Six to 12 inches (15 to 31 centimeters) of rain, with up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) in some places, was expected well inland, bringing the risk of catastrophic flooding. One twister touched down Wednesday morning in the lightly populated Everglades and crossed Interstate 75. Another apparent tornado touched down in Fort Myers, snapping tree limbs and tearing a gas stations canopy to shreds. Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders across 15 Florida counties with a total population of about 7.2 million people. Officials warned that anyone staying behind must fend for themselves, because first responders were not expected to risk their lives attempting rescues at the height of the storm. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch told residents to expect long power outages and the possible shutdown of the sewer system. In Charlotte Harbor, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Tampa, clouds swirled and winds gusted as Josh Parks packed his Kia sedan with clothes and other belongings. Two weeks ago, Helenes surge brought about 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water to the neighborhood, and its streets remain filled with waterlogged furniture, torn-out drywall and other debris. Parks, an auto technician, planned to flee to his daughters home inland and said his roommate already left. I told her to pack like you arent coming back, he said. By early afternoon, airlines had canceled about 1,900 flights. SeaWorld was closed all day Wednesday, and Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando shut down in the afternoon. More than 60 of gas stations in Tampa and St. Petersburg were out of gas Wednesday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. DeSantis said the states overall supply was fine, and highway patrol officers were escorting tanker trucks to replenish the supply. In the Tampa Bay areas Gulfport, Christian Burke and his mother stayed put in their three-story concrete home overlooking the bay. Burke said his father designed this home with a Category 5 in mind  and now theyre going to test it. As a passing police vehicle blared encouragement to evacuate, Burke acknowledged staying isnt a good idea and said hes not laughing at this storm one bit. Source: AP --Agencies",

Issuing a statement, Semasinghe reflected on the countrys economic challenges over the past year and his dedication to rebuilding the economy alongside former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, following the economic collapse. Semasinghe expressed his belief that once the country and its economy stabilize, the public would begin to appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made during the recovery process. He stated that the benefits of these efforts would ultimately reach the people, allowing them to better understand the trajectory of the countrys economic recovery. However, the former state minister acknowledged his disappointment in the publics apparent lack of recognition of these efforts, which he believes was reflected in the outcome of 2024 presidential election. He noted that the peoples rejection of the previous governments principled approach, which was built through considerable effort, played a pivotal role in his decision to withdraw from the upcoming election. Semasinghe was elected to the Parliament from the Anuradhapura District representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in the 2020 General Election, where he garnered 119,878 votes, ranking fourth in the district.",

        "date": "October 10, 2024 04:49 pm",
        "content": "South Korean author Han Kang won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life, the award-giving body said on Thursday. The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns (1.1 million). She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose, Anders Olsson, chairman of the academys Nobel Committee, said in a statement. Han Kang, opens new tab, the first South Korean to win the literature prize, began her career in 1993 with the publication of a number of poems in the magazine Literature and Society, while her prose debut came in 1995 with the short story collection Love of Yeosu. Her major international breakthrough came with the novel The Vegetarian. Bookmaker favourites ahead of the announcement included Chinese writer Can Xue and many other perennial possible candidates such as Kenyas Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Australias Gerald Murnane and Canadas Anne Carson. The literature prize is the most accessible of the Nobels for many and, as such, the Academys choices are met with praise and criticism, often in equal measure. The Academys omission of literary giants such as Russias Leo Tolstoy, Frances Emile Zola and Irelands James Joyce has left many book-lovers scratching their heads over the last century. The 2016 prize award to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan was hailed as radical rethink about what literature is, but also seen as a snub to authors in more traditional genres. The prizes, for achievements in science, literature and peace, were created through a bequest in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. They have been awarded since 1901, with the final prize in the line-up - economics - being a later addition. After peace, the literature award tends to garner the most attention, thrusting authors into the global spotlight and yielding a spike in book sales that can, however, be relatively short-lived for authors who are not household names. Even so, the prize money and a place on a list that includes luminaries such as Irish poet W.B. Yeats, who won in 1923, American novelist Ernest Hemingway, who took the award in 1954, and Colombias Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner in 1982, is an appealing proposition.

        "title": "Tesla is unveiling its long-awaited robotaxi amid doubts about the technology it runs on",
        "date": "October 10, 2024 05:26 pm",
        "content": "Expectations are high for the long-awaited unveiling of Teslas robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night. Too high for some analysts and investors. The company, which began selling software it calls Full Self-Driving nine years ago that still cant drive itself, is expected to show off the so-called Cybercab vehicle, which may not have a steering wheel and pedals. The unveiling comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to persuade investors that his company is more about artificial intelligence and robotics as it struggles to sell its core products, an aging lineup of electric vehicles. Some analysts are predicting that it will be a historic day for the Austin, Texas, company as it takes a huge step toward a long-awaited robotaxi service powered by AI. But others who track self-driving vehicles say Musk has yet to demonstrate Teslas system can travel safely without a human driver ready to step in to prevent crashes. I dont know why the headlines continue to be What will Tesla announce? rather than Why does Tesla think were so stupid? said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies autonomous vehicles. He doesnt see Tesla having the ability to show off software and hardware that can work without human supervision, even in a limited area thats well-known to the driving system. We just havent seen any indication that that is what Tesla is working toward, Walker Smith said. If they were, they would be showcasing this not on a closed lot, but in an actual city or on an actual freeway. Without a clear breakthrough in autonomous technology, Tesla will just show off a vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel, which already has been done by numerous other companies, he said. The challenge is developing a combination of hardware and software plus the human and digital infrastructure to actually safely drive a vehicle even without a steering wheel on public roads in any conditions, Walker Smith said. Tesla has been giving us that demo every year, and its not reassuring us. Many industry analysts arent expecting much from the event either. While TD Cowens Jeff Osborne expects Musk to reveal the Cybercab and perhaps the Model 2, a lower-cost electric vehicle, he said he doesnt expect much of a change on self-driving technology. We expect the event to be light on details and appeal to the true long-term believers in Tesla, Osborne wrote in a note. Musks claims on the readiness of Full Self Driving, though, will be crucial given past delays and ongoing scrutiny of the system and of Teslas less-sophisticated Autopilot driver-assist software. Teslas model lineup is struggling and isnt likely to be refreshed until late next year at the earliest, Osborne wrote. Plus, he wrote that in TD Cowens view the politicization of Elon is tarnishing the Tesla brand among Democrat buyers in the U.S. Musk has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and has pushed many conservative causes. Last weekend he joined Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. Musk has been saying for more than five years that a fleet of robotaxis is near, allowing Tesla owners to make money by having their cars carry passengers while theyre not in use by the owners. But he has acknowledged that past predictions for the use of autonomous driving proved too optimistic. In 2019, he promised the fleet of autonomous vehicles by the end of 2020. However, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is bullish on Tesla stock, wrote in an investor note that robotaxi event, dubbed We, Robot, by the company, will be a new chapter of growth for Tesla. Ives expects many updates and details from Tesla on the robotaxi, plus breakthroughs in Full Self Driving and artificial intelligence. He also is looking for a phased-in strategy for rolling out the robotaxis within the next year, as well as a Tesla ride-sharing app, and demonstrations of technology designed to revolutionize urban transportation. Ives, whose organization will attend the invitation-only event at the Warner Bros. studio, wrote that he also expects updates on Teslas Optimus humanoid robot, which the company plans to start selling in 2026. We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi RD shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk  Co. lay out the companys vision for the future, Ives wrote. The announcement comes as U.S. safety regulators are investigating Full Self Driving and Autopilot based on evidence that it has a weak system for making sure human drivers pay attention. In addition, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration forced Tesla to recall Full Self-Driving in February because it allowed speeding and violated other traffic laws, especially near intersections. Tesla was to fix the problems with an online software update. Last April in Snohomish County, Washington, near Seattle, a Tesla using Full Self-Driving hit and killed a motorcyclist, authorities said. The Tesla driver told authorities that he was using the system while looking at his phone when the car rear-ended the motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. NHTSA says its evaluating information on the fatal crash from Tesla and law enforcement officials. The Justice Department also has sought information from Tesla about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, as well as other items. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "At a ceremony held today at Sri Lanka Air Force Base in Katunayake, U.S. Navy Admiral Steve Koehler, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, officially handed over a Beechcraft King Air 360ER aircraft, gifted by the United States, to the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). The event, attended by U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung, Secretary to the Ministry of Defense Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha (Retd), and Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, marked the handover of this advanced aircrafta symbol of the enduring U.S.-Sri Lanka partnership and a crucial step in strengthening Sri Lankas maritime security and sovereignty, the US Embassy in Colombo said in a statement. Equipped with cutting-edge surveillance technology, the King Air will strengthen Sri Lankas ability to patrol its waters, counter maritime threats, and secure vital trade routes in the Indian Ocean, the statement added. U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung emphasized the importance of the King Air aircraft, highlighting it as a testament to the strong U.S.-Sri Lanka partnership and Sri Lankas role in ensuring peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region: As partners, the United States shares Sri Lankas vision that security is a collective responsibility, as our seas connect us. Maritime domain awareness is crucial to safeguarding Sri Lankas maritime trade routes, which are the lifeblood of its economy. While the oceans are rich in economic opportunities, they are also vulnerable to significant threats  from illegal fishing to smuggling, human trafficking, and other illegal, coercive, and deceitful activities. It is my hope that this Beechcraft King Air will serve as a constant guardian of your nations peace and prosperity, always vigilant in defending what is rightfully yours. Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force, welcomed the Beechcraft King Air 360ER aircraft as a significant milestone of the longstanding partnership between Sri Lanka and the United States. The induction of the Beechcraft King Air 360ER aircraft is one of the instrumental steps in augmenting the Air Forces airpower for maritime domain awareness, he stated. This substantiates our enhanced focus on ensuring maritime security and broadening HADR capabilities in the Indian Ocean Region as a responsible and key stakeholder nation. Further, this advanced ISR platform will be the latest addition to the ongoing efforts of fostering collective security and interoperability to face the threats in the air and maritime domains and curb transnational crime in our region. We look forward to playing a greater role in the regional maritime domain awareness, particularly in maritime surveillance, monitoring and patrolling whilst fulfilling our obligations to regional peace and security. Admiral Steve Koehler reaffirmed U.S. commitment to regional security and partnership with Sri Lanka, stating: Todays ceremony is about much more than one aircraft, its about our two nations commitment to protecting sovereignty and addressing complex maritime challenges together in the Indian Ocean. I look forward to strengthening our partnership and advancing a shared vision for peace and stability by upholding the rules based international order. The King Air, funded by the U.S. Department of Defenses Building Partner Capacity program, was manufactured by Beechcraft Textron Aviation and completed in 2022, with maritime surveillance upgrades added in 2024. Sri Lanka Air Force personnel received specialized training in Kansas and Florida to operate the aircraft, and further training will be conducted by U.S. government personnel over the next three months. The King Air 360ER will undergo final preparations at the Ratmalana Air Force Base before joining Maritime Patrol Squadron 3 in China Bay, Trincomalee, according to the US Embassy.",

        "content": "Gunmen invaded another town north of Haitis capital on Thursday, shooting at people and setting homes on fire, just a week after a massacre killed at least 115 people in the countrys central region. The number of casualties was not immediately known. Residents in the coastal town of Arcahaie called radio stations pleading for help and asking that police come and save them. Lionel Lazarre, deputy police spokesman, told Radio Caraïbes that officers were on site and that authorities were taking several measures to strengthen their presence. The police heard the people of Arcahaie shouting for help, he said. Radio Télé Monopole reported that gunmen attacked the town before dawn, opening fire and wounding multiple people as they set fire to homes, especially those in the Vigner and Bercy communities. Several radio stations reported that the attack was launched by the gang in the area of Canaan known as the Taliban. The gang has around 200 members and operates mostly in the northern part of the Port-au-Prince capital. Arcahaie is located between Haitis capital and the central town of Pont-Sondé, where another gang, Gran Grif, is accused of killing more than 115 people last Thursday. While most of the gang violence is centered in Port-au-Prince  which is 80 controlled by gangs  it has spread north of the capital in recent years, especially the central Artibonite region.

        "content": "One person has died and 23 people have been rescued after they were trapped hundreds of feet underground at the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine, a tourist mine in Cripple Creek, Colorado, officials said Thursday. Eleven people were rescued earlier Thursday and a dozen more people were trapped at the bottom of the 1,000-foot-deep mine for several hours before being rescued Thursday night. I am relieved that 12 of the people trapped in the Mollie Kathleen Mine have been safely rescued. Our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the individual lost in this incident, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Thursday night. Among those rescued, two were children and four were seen by medical personnel for minor injuries, according to Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, who did not provide details on the fatality. At around noon Thursday, the mine experienced a mechanical issue with its elevator system, causing a severe danger for the participants, Mikesell said during a news conference. The cause of the accident remains under investigation. As the dozen people trapped faced cold temperatures around 50 degrees, they had water, blankets, chairs and a radio. Facilities like restrooms however werent available underground, according to the tour website. We are thrilled to hear all 12 people who were still inside the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine have been safely rescued, the fire department said in a social media post Thursday night. Were grateful for the work of all first responders who ensured the safety of those still inside. Our condolences go out to the family who lost a loved one tonight, please keep them in your prayers. The mine last experienced an accident in 1986, and it has been operating as a family-owned tourist attraction for well over 50 years, Mikesell said. The one hour tour  an entirely underground experience that takes guests through the 1890s gold mine  is not claustrophobic but, the descent in the shaft is very close for 2 minutes (each way), the tour website states. After going down the elevator, guests take a short ride on an underground rail car, then continue on foot for a quarter mile of flat and level walking and are shown how gold mining worked, according to the website. Guests are provided hard hats, and are told to leave personal items like walkers and wheelchairs behind during the tour. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "October 11, 2024 11:16 am",
        "content": "Elon Musk showcased a robotaxi with two gull-wing doors and no steering wheel or pedals at a splashy event on Thursday and added a robovan to the roster as Teslas goal shifts from low-priced mass-market automaker to robotics manufacturer. Musk reached the stage in a Cybercab which he said will go into production in 2026 and be priced less than 30,000. He said operation will cost 20 cents a mile over time and charging will be inductive, requiring no plugs. He said the cars rely on artificial intelligence and cameras and do not need other hardware such as what robotaxi rivals use - an approach investors and analysts have flagged as challenging both from a technical and regulatory stand point. The autonomous future is here, Musk said. We have 50 fully autonomous cars here tonight. Youll see model Ys and the Cybercab. All driverless. Musk also showcased a larger, self-driving vehicle - called Robovan - capable of carrying up to 20 people, and showed off Teslas Optimus humanoid robot. Musks plan is to operate a fleet of self-driving Tesla taxis that passengers can hail through an app. Individual Tesla owners will also be able to make money on the app by listing their vehicles as robotaxis. Thursdays event at the Warner Bros studio near Los Angeles, California, is titled We, Robot - an apparent nod to the I, Robot science-fiction short stories by American writer Isaac Asimov, but also echoes Musks insistence that Tesla should be thought of as an AI robotics company rather than an automaker. Those attending included investors, stock analysts and Tesla fans. Investors expecting concrete details on how quickly Tesla can ramp up robotaxi production, secure regulatory approval and implement a strong business plan to leapfrog rivals such as Alphabets Waymo were left disappointed. Everything looks cool, but not much in terms of time lines, Im a shareholder and pretty disappointed. I think the market wanted more definitive time lines, said Dennis Dick, equity trader at Triple D Trading. I dont think he said much about anything... He didnt give much info. Musk said he tends to be optimistic with time frames. MISSED PROMISES Musk said in 2019 he was very confident the company would have operational robotaxis by the next year. After missed promises, Musk this year diverted his focus to developing the vehicles after scrapping plans to build a smaller, cheaper car widely seen as essential to countering slowing EV demand. Tesla is at risk of posting its first-ever decline in deliveries this year as buying incentives have failed to attract enough customers to its aging EV lineup. Steep price cuts meant to offset high interest rates have also squeezed profit margins. Complicated technology and tight regulation have led to billion of dollars in loss for other companies attempting to crack the robotaxi market, forcing some to shut shop. Some are still pushing, including General Motors Cruise, Amazons Zoox and Chinese firms such as WeRide. Unlike expensive hardware such as lidar that others use, Musk is relying only on cameras and AI to run FSD to keep costs down. But FSD, which requires constant driver attention, has faced regulatory and legal scrutiny with at least two fatal accidents involving the technology. We do expect to start fully autonomous unsupervised FSD in Texas and California next year. Musk said. Thats with the Model 3 and Model Y. He did not say if the robotaxis will use any new technology or depend on FSD. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers stationed with the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon have been injured after a nearby village was targeted by an Israeli airstrike, Sri Lankas Military Spokesperson confirmed. He stated that the two Sri Lankan Army personnel attached to the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon sustained minor injuries when Israeli tanks fired at a watchtower in Naqoura, Lebanon, yesterday. The soldiers were reportedly hit by fragments from a tank shell that was fired at one of UNIFILs observation towers in Naqoura. Sri Lankan soldiers were reportedly injured when Israeli artillery struck UN peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL) in Naqoura, southern Lebanon, as reported by the Lebanese News Agency on Friday. The incident occurred when a tank shell struck near one of the UNIFIL towers in Naqoura, resulting in shrapnel injuries to the soldiers. António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, called the attack a violation of international humanitarian law. Earlier on Friday, European Council President Charles Michel condemned the Israeli attack on United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), calling it unacceptable and stating that an attack on an international peacekeeping mission is irresponsible and unacceptable, urging Israel and all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law. According to Lebanons official National News Agency, an Israeli Merkava tank targeted one of UNIFILs observation towers on the main road connecting Tyre to Naqoura, in front of a Lebanese Army checkpoint, injuring the Sri Lankan contingent stationed there. It said Israeli artillery fired a shell that struck the main entrance of the UNIFIL command center in Naqoura, causing damage to the site. The media report said the UNIFILs command center in Naqoura has been targeted by Israeli military artillery for the second time in three days. On Thursday, the UN peacekeeping force said UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura and several of its troops positions were repeatedly shelled by Israeli forces, injuring two troops. The situation remains tense as UNIFIL operates in a challenging environment amid ongoing military actions in the region. Israel has mounted massive airstrikes across Lebanon against what it claims are Hezbollah targets since Sept. 23, killing at least 1,351 people, injuring over 3,800 others, and displacing more than 1.2 million people. --With Agencies Inputs",

Hibakusha is receiving the Peace Prize for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said in its citation. Witnesses to the only two nuclear bombs ever to be used in conflict have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a nuclear-free world. The Hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons, the committee said. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has regularly put focus on the issue of nuclear weapons, most recently with its award to the ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, who won the award in 2017. The Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish crowns, or about 1 million, is due to be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed officials of the Ministry of Finance to take necessary action to provide a monthly interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 to all pensioners, from next week, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. After reviewing the delay in adding the Rs. 3,000 allowance to the October pension, the President directed that this amount be credited to the pensioners accounts within the next week. These instructions were given during a meeting held yesterday (10) afternoon at the Presidential Secretariat with senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, chaired by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the PMD reported. Despite the circular No. 022024 dated 20240824 issued by the Public Administration Department to grant a monthly interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 to all pensioners, funds were not allocated for this purpose. Upon reviewing the matter, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake informed the officials of the Ministry of Finance to ensure that the required funds are provided, the statement said. Considering the hardships faced by pensioners due to the non-payment of the Rs. 3,000 allowance with the October pension, and their subsequent requests, the President decided to proceed with the payment from this month, despite the prevailing financial difficulties of the government, it said. Since the October pension has already been credited to the pensioners accounts, the President instructed officials to ensure that the Rs. 3,000 allowance is credited to their accounts within the next week, and from next month, this allowance will be added to the monthly pension. Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mahinda Siriwardena and several senior officials from the Ministry of Finance were present at this meeting. --PMD",

        "date": "October 12, 2024 08:09 am",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike killed two Lebanese soldiers and wounded three on Friday, Lebanons military said, just hours after the Israeli military fired on the headquarters of U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, injuring two of them for the second day in a row. The incidents entangling both Lebanons official army which has largely stayed on the sidelines of the conflict between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah and the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon raised alarm as Israel broadens its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across the country and a ground invasion at the border. In central Beirut, rescue workers combed Friday through the rubble of a collapsed building, searching for survivors of an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 22 people and wounded dozens in the Lebanese capital the night before. Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel over the past year in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza following Hamas devastating Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and resulted in 250 taken hostage. In return, Israels military has pounded Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing more than 2,237 Lebanese including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel according to the Lebanese health ministry. Among them, the ministry reported late Friday, were a two-year-old and 16-year-old killed by airstrikes in the southern village of Baysarieh. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers, both in northern Israel since October 2023, and in southern Lebanon since Sept. 30, when Israel launched its ground invasion. Israel strikes a Lebanese army checkpoint On Friday, the Lebanese army said an Israeli airstrike hit a building near a military checkpoint in the southern Bint Jbeil province. The Israeli military said it had been targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon when reports emerged that it had hit several Lebanese army soldiers. The Israeli army said it investigated the incident but remained unaware of any Lebanese army facilities found in the area of the strike. Lebanons army is not a party to the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah after Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30, Lebanese soldiers withdrew some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their observation posts along the border. The only direct clash between the two national armies occurred on Oct. 3, when Israeli tank fire hit a Lebanese army post also in the area of Bint Jbeil, killing a soldier and prompting Lebanese soldiers to return fire. Both Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in southern Lebanon to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 that ended a bloody monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. But Lebanons army is no match for Hezbollah, and neither its soldiers nor the peacekeepers have been capable of preventing the Shiite militants from entrenching themselves in the border region. Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing militant infrastructure along the border in violation of the U.N. resolution. Israel hits U.N. peacekeepers again, wounding two The Israeli military opened fire near the U.N. headquarters in Lebanons southern town of Naqoura on Friday, the army said, hitting the observation post and injuring two peacekeepers for the second time in as many days. An initial review by the Israeli army found that soldiers in southern Lebanon targeted what they believed to be a threat located some 50 meters (yards) from the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon but ultimately struck the peacekeepers. One of the injured peacekeepers was hospitalized in the nearby city of Tyre while the other received medical care on site, the United Nations force, known as UNIFIL, said. Both were identified as Sri Lankan. The army repeated its warning that UNIFIL personnel abandon their positions in areas where Hezbollah militants launch rockets into Israel. Following Thursdays attack, the U.N. peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said 300 peacekeepers in front-line positions on southern Lebanons border were temporarily moved to larger bases. In a statement condemning the strike as a grave violation of international humanitarian law, UNIFIL reported that explosions on Friday hit the same place they did the day before, when Israeli tank fire injured two Indonesian peacekeepers, damaged vehicles and a communication system, and drew sharp international criticism. Peacekeepers must be protected by all parties of the conflict, and what has happened is obviously condemnable, said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The French foreign ministry accused Israel of deliberately firing at peacekeepers and summoned the Israeli ambassador Friday in an official protest. In a call with his Israeli counterpart, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stressed the importance of ensuring the safety of UNIFIL forces and urged Israel to pivot from military operations to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible, the Pentagon said. When President Joe Biden was questioned by reporters whether he was asking Israel to stop striking U.N. peacekeepers, he replied, Absolutely, positively. UNIFIL, which has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries, was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israels 1978 invasion. The U.N. expanded its mission following the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, allowing peacekeepers to patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. Beirut residents left reeling from Israeli strikes From the Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood of central Beirut, civil defense workers dug through concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building brought down by an Israeli airstrike the day before  the deadliest Israeli air raid to hit Beirut over the last year of war. Thursdays airstrikes hit two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in Lebanon. The world suddenly turned upside down, recalled Ahmad al-Khatib, a 42-year-old Lebanese postal worker who was with his wife and toddler daughter in his in-laws apartment when the bombs fell on the building next-door. Al-Khatib said he had pulled his 2 ½-year-old, Ayla, out from under the debris of a collapsed bedroom wall. The force of the explosion had flung his wife, Marwa Hamdan, against a wall and a piece of metal hit her in the head. She remains in intensive care, he said, tears running down his cheeks. Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV channel and Israeli media reported that the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group, but he was not in either targeted building at the time of the strike. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports. Another resident, Mohammed Tarhani, said he had moved in with his brother in Burj Abi Haidar after fleeing southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes in the past weeks. Where is one supposed to go now? he asked. Hezbollah kept up its rocket fire into Israel Friday, setting off air raid sirens just north of Tel Aviv. Interceptions by Israels air defense system scattered rocket fragments in the seaside suburb of Herzliya and sent shrapnel flying into a building there, causing damage but no casualties. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollahs barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel. Hezbollahs chief spokesperson vowed the group would expand its attacks into more populated areas deeper inside Israel. This is only the beginning, Mohammed Afif told reporters from a smoldering street left in ruins by recent Israeli airstrikes in Beiruts southern suburbs. I tell the enemy that you have only seen the minimum. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Gunmen kill 21 coal miners in troubled southwestern Pakistan",
        "date": "October 12, 2024 02:53 pm",
        "content": "Dozens of attackers armed with guns, rockets and hand grenades stormed a cluster of small private coal mines in southwestern Pakistan on Friday, slaying some miners in their sleep and shooting others after lining them up, killing at least 21 in the restive region, police said. The attack by around 40 armed men days before Pakistan hosts a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organization grouping is the worst in weeks in the mineral-rich province of Balochistan bordering Afghanistan and Iran. The armed terrorists remained for around 1-12 hours in the mining area, regional police official Asif Shafi told Reuters. They fired rockets and hurled grenades at the mines and miners quarters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on the mines of the Junaid Coal Co in the Duki area, which also injured six. Among the dead were four Afghan nationals; another four were injured. Afghanistans Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack in a statement, and assigned its Quetta consulate to facilitate the transfer of the bodies. Businesses and shops were shut in Duki as hundreds of people gathered along with the bodies of the dead in a protest to demand the arrest of the attackers, police said. We were receiving threats from the militants for some time but there was no information about the attack, said mine owner Khairullah Nasar, who is also the chairman of the district council. The attackers burnt down all 10 mines, along with the equipment and machinery within, he added. A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region to press demands for a share in mineral-rich regional resources. Several attacks have targeted migrant workers, including some from Afghanistan, employed by smaller, privately operated mines. The attacks have risen in recent months, said provincial Governor Jafar Khan Mandokhel, who called the miners killing an inhuman act. On one side you talked about your independence and your rights and on the other hand you are killing innocent labourers, he told a news conference, referring to the separatist militant groups, adding, We condemn it strongly and we will take all-out action against it. The government was determined to root out all forms of terrorism, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement. The provincial government has ordered an investigation and a case has been registered against unknown assailants under the terrorism law, a government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have resurged since 2022 after revoking a ceasefire with the government. Two Chinese nationals working for a power plant were killed this week in a blast in the southern city of Karachi, for which the Baloch Liberation Army, one of several insurgent groups battling the government, claimed responsibility. The BLA was also behind Balochistans most widespread violence in years in August, which targeted police stations, railway lines, and highways, killing more than 70 people. Armed men who stormed the residence of labourers from the eastern province of Punjab last month killed seven. On Friday, crossfire between police and attackers killed two suspected militants involved in a 2021 attack on dam project workers that killed 13, including nine Chinese nationals.

        "title": "Boeing to lay off 17,000 staff to recoup finances during ongoing strike",
        "date": "October 12, 2024 05:14 pm",
        "content": "Boeing plans to lay off about 10 of its workers in the coming months, about 17,000 people, as it continues to lose money and tries to deal with a strike that is crippling production of the companys best-selling airline planes. New CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff in a memo Friday that the job cuts will include executives, managers and employees. The company has about 170,000 employees worldwide, many of them working in manufacturing facilities in the states of Washington and South Carolina. Boeing had already imposed rolling temporary furloughs, but Ortberg said those will be suspended because of the impending layoffs. The company will further delay the rollout of a new plane, the 777X, to 2026 instead of 2025. It will also stop building the cargo version of its 767 jet in 2027 after finishing current orders. Boeing has lost more than 25 billion since the start of 2019. About 33,000 union machinists have been on strike since Sept. 14. Two days of talks this week failed to produce a deal, and Boeing filed an unfair-labor-practices charge against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. As it announced layoffs, Boeing also gave a preliminary report on its third-quarter financial results  and the news is not good for the company. Boeing said it burned through 1.3 billion in cash during the quarter and lost 9.97 per share. Industry analysts had been expecting the company to lose 1.61 per share in the quarter, according to a FactSet survey, but analysts were likely unaware of some large write-downs that Boeing announced Friday  a 2.6 billion charge related to delays of the 777X, 400 million for the 767, and 2 billion for defense and space programs including new Air Force One jets, a space capsule for NASA and a military refueling tanker. The company based in Arlington, Virginia, said it had 10.5 billion in cash and marketable securities on Sept. 30. Boeing is schedule to release full third-quarter numbers on Oct. 23. The strike has a direct bearing on cash burn because Boeing gets half or more of the price of planes when it delivers them to airline customers. The strike has shut down production of the 737 Max, Boeings best-selling plane, and 777x and 767s. The company is still making 787s at a nonunion plant in South Carolina. Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together, Ortberg told staff. He said the situation requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term. Ortberg took over at Boeing in August, becoming the troubled companys third CEO in less than five years. He is a longtime aerospace-industry executive but an outsider to Boeing. The new CEO faces many challenges to turn the company around. The Federal Aviation Administration increased scrutiny of the company after a panel blew out of a Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Boeing has agreed to plead guilty and pay a fine for conspiracy to commit fraud tied to the Max, but relatives of the 346 people who died in two Max crashes want tougher punishment. And Boeing got attention for all the wrong reasons when NASA decided that a Boeing spacecraft wasnt safe enough to carry two astronauts home from the International Space Station.

Instructions have also been given to expedite investigations into the death of businessman Dinesh Schaffter death and the death of a police officer during the shooting incident near the W15 Hotel in Weligama in 2023, according to the Police Spokesman. Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said the Ministry of Public Security has instructed the Acting IGP to direct special attention and to expedite several special investigations being carried out by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and other agencies as the progress of these investigations have been observed to be somewhat insufficient. He stated that specially the investigations being handled by the CID were recently subjected to a review and that instructions were given with regard to several cases identified including the bond scandal and the Easter attacks, to assign more officers and expedite investigations. DIG Thanduwa said instructions were also given to further investigate the suspicious death of businessman Dinesh Schaffter in 2022 and the disappearance of the former Eastern University Vice Chancellor Prof. S. Raveendranath in 2006. With regard to the latter, he said that it was observed that investigations have not been sufficient and that the ministry instructed to expedite investigations and report on the progress.

He further points out that a courageous opposition will not have to remain in the opposition forever. He made these comments during a special meeting held today (12) in Waskaduwa with the candidates contesting this years parliamentary elections from the Sarvajana Balaya under the symbol of the medal. Speaking during the event, Mr. Dilith Jayaweera said: We are talking about nationalism, not racism. Many people are afraid to say that Sri Lankas nationalism is based on Sinhala Buddhist civilization. They think that people will get angry if they say this. He stated that the issue is that politicians choose the racist part of nationalism and engage in politics. Its done in the south... even in the north. We are against that. Jayaweera stated that this country can be guided towards economic development if everyone in the country is brought to an entrepreneurial mindset. There needs to be a strategic plan. That is how countries have developed, he said. Now we have to go to the opposition. We came to change politics. If we form a noble opposition, we can do more work than a government. If we have a good opposition, we dont have to stay in the opposition all the time. We are a courageous opposition. If there are cases... if there are things hidden under the bed...

        "date": "October 13, 2024 09:04 am",
        "content": "Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel warned people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the U.N. peacekeeping force said its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasnt clear who fired. It occurred a day after Israels military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didnt immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadnt received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israels military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israels war with Hezbollah, a top U.N. official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press hes concerned that Lebanons ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Israels military said Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over Yom Kippur, the holiest and most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Hezbollah claimed a series of rocket strikes on Israeli military positions and said fighters engaged an Israeli infantry unit attempting to enter Lebanese territory. Israels military also said it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldnt be verified. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday hit multiple areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Nine were killed in Maisra village in the northeast. Four were killed in an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut. Rayak and Tal Chiha hospitals in the Bekaa Valley were damaged. In Nabatieh, eight people were wounded. The total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It isnt clear how many were fighters. We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people, the speaker of Irans parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Some Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered while others likely were under rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. An afternoon strike on a home killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israels military said it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force and will continue to do so for a long time. Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90 of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Once again, some families moved south on foot, in donkey carts or crowded in vehicles that navigated piles of rubble. Others refused to go. Its like the first days of the war, said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave. The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week. He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned-shelter in Jabaliya, described constant bombings day and night. He said the shelter hasnt received aid since the beginning of the month and that families will run out of supplies very soon. Food is running out The World Food Program said it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a starvation campaign against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israels offensive in Gaza started after Hamas Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israels offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who dont specify between combatants and civilians. Gazas Health Ministry said that hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. The U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Saturday to express his deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeeping positions in Lebanon, as well as the reported death of two Lebanese soldiers, according to a Pentagon statement. Austin said it was important to ensure the safety and security of UNIFIL forces and Lebanese Armed Forces, and reinforced the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible, according to the statement. The U.S. Secretary of Defense also said steps must be taken to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and reaffirmed the United States unwavering, enduring, and ironclad commitment to Israels security, according to the statement.

        "content": "None of the Rajapaksa brothers, who dominated Sri Lankan politics for decades until they were booted out of office in 2022, will contest in the island nations general elections next month. As nominations for the November 14 parliamentary polls closed on Friday (October 11, 2024), the list of candidates fielded by the Rajapaksas Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or Peoples Front) showed former President and former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, 78, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 75, former Irrigation Minister Chamal Rajapaksa, 81, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, 73, are not running. Further, Mr. Mahindas son Namal Rajapaksa, who was a Cabinet Minister in Mr. Gotabayas ousted administration, is not contesting but is on the partys national list, which includes names of members to be nominated for extra seats the party may secure, based on its share of votes polled. Mr. Namal ran for presidency in the September 2024 election and came fourth, obtaining just 2.57 of the total votes. The Rajapaksa clan dominated the Cabinet in the last administration and several family members held key positions in the government as well. The recent presidential contest, the first election to be held after the islands 2022 crisis, saw popular opposition legislator Anura Kumara Dissanayake emerge winner with 42.31  of the votes, in a drastic shakeup of Sri Lankas political establishment. President Dissanayakes National Peoples Power NPP coalition, led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP), is eyeing a majority in the 225member House. The NPP must increase its seat share from three in the last Parliament, to 113 for a simple majority that Mr. Dissanayake will need to take forward his policy and legislative pledges. Fear of defeat In addition to the Rajapaksas, former Presidents Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena, too, have opted out of the November 14 race. Opposition politician and former Cabinet Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and hardline nationalist politician Wimal Weerawansa have also backed out. NPP member and former parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said by voting for Mr. Dissanayake, the Sri Lankan people have done a great thing. These corrupt and racist politicians have decided not to contest to avoid defeat, he told local media. Asked about the SLPPs decision not to field any of the senior Rajapaksas, party general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said Mr. Mahinda  who was in Parliament, cumulatively, for over four decades  had done his part. He rescued the country from war, led us through our countrys best developmental phase. He has done his best, Mr. Kariyawasam told The Hindu , without commenting on the decision of the other Rajapaksa brothers. However, Mr. Chamals son Shasheendra Rajapaksa is contesting from the southern Monaragala district, he said. Many observers said the decision of the former political heavyweights to quit the race reflected the churn from lingering outcome of the peoples struggle or Janatha Aragalaya of 2022. In addition to demanding Mr. Gotabayas resignation, the protesters had called for system change. Senior Sri Lankan journalist Marianne David observed: One of the best outcomes of the Aragalaya is lifetime politicians stepping down and retiring or choosing not to contest the general elections, knowing full well they will be shown the door by the people.

        "content": "Teslas reveal of a robotaxi designed as a low-slung, two-seater, sporty coupe - quite the opposite of a typical taxi with room for several passengers and luggage - flummoxed investors and analysts. CEO Elon Musk served up the cool design for the prototype of the Tesla robotaxi, dubbed Cybercab, at a much-hyped event near Los Angeles late on Thursday. These will go into production some time in 2026 and cost less than 30,000 a pop, he said. But in true Musk style, he skipped over expectations of how a two-seater robotaxi would serve the needs of families headed to a restaurant or to the airport, or if he expected these to appeal only to a niche clientele. Investors jeered the design and the lack of financial detail, with Tesla stocks tumbling 9 on Wall Street on Friday. When you think of a cab, you think of something thats going to carry more than two people, said Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com. Making this a two-seat-only car is very perplexing. Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment. Experts said robotaxis would best emulate regular taxis with plenty of room, a tall design and sliding doors. Musk did showcase a futuristic robovan that could seat up to 20 people but did not say when that would be available. The market for two-door robotaxis would be very limited, said Sandeep Rao, a senior researcher at Leverage Shares, an investment management company with assets of about 1 billion, including in Tesla. Two-door vehicles account for just 2 of car sales in the U.S., excluding SUVs and pickups, according to data from analytics firm J.D. Power. Musk said he wanted to make robotaxis cheaper than mass transit to operate and predicted an operating cost of 20 cents per mile over time for the Cybercab. But he did not say how quickly Tesla could mass-produce Cybercabs and secure regulatory approvals, or how it could beat Alphabets Waymo, which already operates robotaxis in some U.S. cities. Waymo has a fleet of about 700 Jaguar Land Rover cars that fit four passengers, same as the seating capacity in Amazons Zoox robotaxis. Waymos former CEO John Krafcik said Teslas design looked more playful than serious, and that the two-door configuration posed challenges for older passengers and those with disabilities. MORE PLAYFUL THAN SERIOUS Delivering the robotaxi and capturing a still nascent and tightly regulated market will be critical for Tesla. Musk this year scrapped plans to build a smaller, cheaper vehicle amid slowing EV demand and shifted focus to the advancing Teslas autonomy ambitions. The robotaxi business could catapult Teslas valuation to 5 trillion, he has said, from about 700 billion now. Two-seaters have been proposed for decades as commuter vehicles. They just havent taken off, said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Tesla will eventually need to build larger robotaxis, he said. Blake Anderson, senior investment analyst at Carson Group, a Tesla investor, said that if the Cybercab is supposed to be a lower-cost, mass-market model to widen Teslas appeal, the two-seat design doesnt make sense. Its probably a way that they can introduce something quick to market, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 13, 2024 04:27 pm",
        "content": "A prominent Indian politician known for his strong connections to Bollywood was shot dead in Mumbai on Saturday by unknown assailants, just months before state elections. Baba Siddique, a three-time member of the state legislative assembly, was attacked near his sons office in the upscale Bandra East area of Mumbai. The 66-year-old former Maharashtra state minister was shot in the chest by three men who fired a volley of bullets on Saturday, when the country was celebrating the Hindu festival of Dussehra. Siddique was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, but succumbed to his injuries. An aide accompanying him was also injured. Maharashtras deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is from the same political party as Siddique, said he was shocked by the killing. The incident will be thoroughly investigated and strict action will be taken against the attackers. The mastermind behind the attack will also be traced, Pawar said in a statement. The incident has raised concerns about political violence ahead of the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections and a resurgence of gang violence in Mumbai, something which has been curbed in recent years. The police have arrested three suspects and said they were connected to the crime organisation run by jailed gang leader Lawrence Bishnoi, according to the NDTV news channel. The gang has been linked to a number of high-profile killings and extortion cases in the past. Even though Bishnoi, who faces dozens of criminal cases, is currently lodged in a jail in Gujarat, his gang keeps making headlines over reports of ransom calls to businessmen. Bishnoi has also been linked by police to a number of murder cases in recent years, including the high-profile killing of rapper Sidhu Moosewala. Police said they were yet to confirm the gangs involvement, but told Indian media that the alleged killers had admitted to being in touch with the gang. Police are reportedly investigating two potential motives behind the attack: one involving Bishnois criminal network and another related to a slum rehabilitation case Siddique was handling. Siddique a former member of the Congress Party who later aligned with a faction of the smaller Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) that formed a Maharashtra coalition government with the BJP. His influence stretched far beyond politics, however, and he often made headlines for his ties to Bollywood celebrities. His lavish iftar parties, a festive meal eaten by Muslims at sunset to break their fast during Ramadan, were attended by stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. Siddique reportedly played a key role in mending the relationship between the two Bollywood superstars. Siddique had received a death threat as recently 15 days before the attack and was given Y-level security, the fourth tier of security provided by the government of India to prominent individuals who face threats seen as relatively mild. A security team at this level typically includes 8 personnel, including one or two commandos and some police officers. Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde condemned the killing, calling it extremely unfortunate and warning against the return of gang violence in Mumbai. I have asked the police to take strict action and ensure no one takes law and order into their hands. A gang-war-like situation should not be allowed to resurface in Mumbai, he said. Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who oversees the home ministry, said he is monitoring the case. Sharad Pawar, former chief minister of Maharashtra and a critic of the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party, said people in the government should take responsibility and step down from their posts. The deteriorating law and order situation in the state is a matter of concern, he wrote in the Marathi language. If the home minister and the rulers will take the states vehicle forward with such leniency, it can be a warning sign for the common people. Source: The Independent --Agencies",
