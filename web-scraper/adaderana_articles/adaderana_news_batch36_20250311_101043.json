        "date": "September 5, 2024 07:40 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe officially opened The Mall, a newly constructed duty-free shopping complex in the Colombo Port City area on Thursday (September 5). This marks the debut of the first urban duty-free shopping mall in the region, featuring a range of stores, restaurants, and various retail outlets, the PMD said. Notable international duty-free retailers, including One World, China Duty Free Group (CDFG), and Flemingo will be operating within the mall, positioning the Colombo Port City as a premier shopping destination. Following the unveiling of a commemorative plaque and the official opening, the President embarked on an observation tour of the new complex. In his address at the occasion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe reflected on the rapid development of the port city, noting that two years ago, such progress seemed unlikely. He attributed this turnaround to his governments efforts in establishing economic stability, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has enabled the Port Citys financial sector to advance. The President also highlighted that approximately 100 companies are now interested in the Port City, with 74 expected to commence investment activities by the end of the year. He expressed optimism about the future growth and potential of the area. In October 2023, the Sri Lankan government gazetted the requirements that need to be met in order to conduct duty-free retail business operations or duty-free shopping mall operations at the Colombo Port City. According to the relevant gazette, published by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Investment Promotion, an investor is required to devote a minimum of USD 5 million to run a duty-free retail business and have international-level experience in duty-free trade operations, while an investor needs to devote at least USD 7 million to run a duty-free shopping mall business. In May 2023, Singapore-owned One World Duty Free and the Colombo Port City signed two agreements to operate Sri Lankas first downtown Duty-Free store.",

        "date": "September 6, 2024 09:03 am",
        "content": "Powerful gales and heavy rain from Super Typhoon Yagi drenched southern China on Friday, with schools shut for a second day and flights cancelled as one of the strongest storms to hit Asia this year headed for landfall along Hainans tropical coast. Packing maximum sustained winds of 245 km per hour (152 mph) near its eye, Yagi registers as the worlds second-most powerful tropical cyclone in 2024 so far, after the Category 5 Atlantic hurricane Beryl. More than doubling in strength since devastating the northern Philippines earlier this week, Yagi is expected to make landfall along Chinas coast from Wenchang on the island of Hainan, to Leizhou, in Guangdong province from Friday afternoon. It is then predicted to hit Vietnam and Laos. Vietnams Civil Aviation Authority said four airports in the north, including Hanois Noi Bai International, would be closed on Saturday due to the storm. Winds and rain were accompanied by powerful thunder and lightening across the region overnight and on Friday morning. Im worried about this typhoon. It could destroy months of hard work, said Qizhao, a banana farmer at the village of Gaozhou in Guangdong, adding that villagers were reinforcing their trees with poles to protect them from the wind. Transport links across southern China were mostly shuttered on Friday with many flights cancelled in Hainan, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The worlds longest sea crossing, the main bridge linking Hong Kong with Macau and Zhuhai in Guangdong, was also closed. Intense Rain In the financial hub of Hong Kong, the stock exchange was shuttered while schools remained closed on Friday. The typhoon 8 signal, the third highest, would be lowered by 12.40pm, Hong Kongs observatory said, with winds over the city expected to weaken gradually as Yagi moves away, allowing businesses to begin to reopening. Intense rainbands associated with Yagi will still bring heavy squally showers to the territory, it said, warning residents to stay away from the shoreline. Chinas government sent task forces to Guangdong and Hainan to guide flood and typhoon prevention, official news agency Xinhua said as authorities issued high risk warnings for geological disasters in northern Shanxi, southern Guangdong and most areas of Hainan island. In Hainans capital Haikou, streets were deserted as people stayed indoors, photographs on social media showed. Rare Landfall Yagi is set to be the most severe storm to land in Hainan since 2014, when Typhoon Rammasun slammed into the island province as a Category Five tropical cyclone. Rammasun killed 88 people in Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan and caused economic losses of more than 44 billion yuan (6.25 billion). Formed over the warm seas east of the Philippines and a similar path as Rammasun did, Yagi is expected to arrive in China as a Category Four typhoon, ushering in winds strong enough to overturn vehicles, uproot trees and severely damage roads, bridges and buildings. Its projected landfall in Hainan is rare, as most typhoons landing on the duty-free island are classified as weak. From 1949 to 2023, 106 typhoons landed in Hainan but only nine were classified as super typhoons. Typhoons are becoming stronger, fuelled by warmer oceans, amid climate change, scientists say. Last week, Typhoon Shanshan slammed into southwestern Japan, the strongest storm to hit the country in decades. Yagi, which strengthened into a super typhoon on Wednesday night, is the Japanese word for goat and for the constellation of Capricornus, a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish.

Therefore, the NPP will begin by dissolving the Parliament. Then, the question is what will happen to the Cabinet until a new Parliament can be elected, he said. We will govern the country during that interim period in a constitutional manner. Once I am elected President, my parliamentary seat will be transferred to another member of our party. With a team of four members, including myself, we will form the Cabinet, as stipulated by the constitution, Dissanayake expressed. Furthermore, the NPPs presidential candidate said: If this arrangement is not acceptable, the constitution grants the president the authority to bring all ministerial portfolios under his preview. If that too is unacceptable, we can establish a caretaker government. There are three options available.

As postal voting approached, salaries were increased and public servants were praised. However, we have seen how some politicians treated state sector employees previously, he said.

His efforts included developing provincial councils, airports, hospitals, and integrating graduates into the government sector. However, this programme was completely dismantled in 2015.

He criticized Sajith Premadasa, stating that despite the opposition leader talking about teamwork, he fails to take responsibility as a leader. Wickremesinghe also claimed that Sajith is currently fulfilling an agreement by supporting Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Reflecting on his own leadership, the President highlighted how he successfully steered the countrys economy through a challenging period, working alongside a dedicated team focused on national recovery. He reaffirmed his commitment to advancing the countrys development program with the team chosen by the people in the next general election. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the Puluwan Sri Lanka victory rally held at the Matugama private bus stand on Thursday (05). During the event, the Five-Pronged youth proposal was presented to the President. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe addressed questions regarding his political team, clarifying that his candidacy for the presidential election is not about selecting a group, but rather demonstrating the strength and responsibility required for leadership. He emphasized that a capable leader does not necessarily need a team to talk about the responsibilities of the presidency. The President also highlighted the proposal on the re-examination and assessment of defence expenditure outlined in the Samagi Jana Balawegayas blueprint policy statement, urging them to provide an immediate explanation to the country regarding this matter. I work with the team I have, as a leader should be able to collaborate with any group. Currently, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has not been able to present a unified election manifesto. Instead, there are two conflicting ones, he said. Wickremasinghe stated that on one side, there is Nalaka Godahewa and G.L. Peiris, while on the other, Harsha de Silva and Kabir Hashim represent different ideas. These manifestos have inconsistencies, he charged. One of the policy statements mentions a re-examination and reassessment of defence expenditure, which implies a reduction in military spending.

On July 24, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoons appointment as the IGP. The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon. It was later reported that given the upcoming Presidential Election, President Wickremesinghe has been advised by his legal team that appointing an Acting IGP every two weeks could lead to election petitions against him. Consequently, the President had reportedly informed the Speaker of Parliament that he will refrain from getting involved in this matter. Delivering a special statement in Parliament the following day on the government stance on the matter, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting IGP. The Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently. He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP. Following the PMs statement, the Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had informed the House that the decision to appoint the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was correct, legal, constitutional, and made in good faith. He further said that the situation with regard to the IGP cannot be resolved even by the President, and the matter must be sorted out in court if necessary.",

        "date": "September 6, 2024 04:06 pm",
        "content": "OpenAI said on Thursday it has more than 1 million paying users across its business products, ChatGPT Enterprise, Team and Edu, as the AI firms chatbot continues to see strong adoption owing to its advanced large language model. The figure is a rise from the 600,000 users it had in April, indicating that CEO Sam Altmans push to get enterprises to adopt ChatGPT for corporate use is paying off. Separately, the Information reported on Thursday that OpenAI executives have discussed higher-priced subscriptions for upcoming large-language models such as its reasoning-focused Strawberry and a new flagship LLM dubbed Orion. In early internal talks at OpenAI, subscription prices ranging up to 2,000 per month were discussed, the report said, citing one person with direct knowledge of the numbers. ChatGPT Plus currently costs 20 a month. The free tier of the model is used by hundreds of millions of users every month. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft is working on Strawberry with the aim to enabling AI models to perform deep research, Reuters exclusively reported earlier in July. Strawberry includes a specialized way of what is known as post-training OpenAIs generative AI models, or adapting the base models to hone their performance in specific ways after they have already been trained on reams of generalized data, the report said. The reported pricing discussions come after media reports said Apple and chip giant Nvidia were in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a new fundraising round that could value the ChatGPT maker above 100 billion. The AI startup behind the wildly popular ChatGPT application last week said the chatbot had amassed more than 200 million weekly active users, doubling from the number it had in the last fall season.

        "date": "September 6, 2024 04:23 pm",
        "content": "Allan Lichtman, the historian who correctly predicted the outcome of 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has made his guess on who will reclaim the White House this year. Spoiler alert: its Vice President Kamala Harris. Lichtman said in a video, first reported by The New York Times, that he based his prediction on thirteen keys or big picture true-false questions that tap into the strength and performance of the White House Party. Who is Allan Lichtman? Before receiving the title of Distinguished Professor from the American University in Washington, D.C., Lichtman earned a Ph.D. specializing in modern American history and quantitative methods at Harvard. In addition to lecturing in the U.S. and around the world, Lichtman is the author of 13 books and hundreds of academic articles. He has also been an expert witness in civil and voting rights cases. He routinely provides political commentary and is best known for his election forecasting. What are the 13 keys? The keys include whether:  The White House party gained House seats during the midterm elections.  The sitting president is running for reelection.  The White House party is avoiding a primary contest.  There is a third-party challenger.  The short-term economy is strong.  The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms.  The White House party has made major changes to national policy.  There is sustained social unrest during the term.  The White House is untainted by scandal, the incumbent party is charismatic.  The challenger is uncharismatic.  The incumbent is charismatic.  The White House party has a major failure in foreign policy.  The White House party has foreign policy success. Eight of the keys are in favor of Harris, while three are in favor of Trump. Foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip, he said in the video. The Biden administration is deeply invested in the war in Gaza, which is a humanitarian disaster with no end in sight. But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House. That leaves Harris winning the White House, he said. At least thats my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote. Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half-century, except for the race in 2000, in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore.

The official residence was formally handed over to the estate superintendent yesterday (05). While Mr. Aravindh Kumar had been employed as the chief clerk of the estate in 1987, the estate management had provided this official residence to him to be used as his official residence. However, after he had left that company, the estates management had filed a case in the Nuwara Eliya District Court, alleging that Mr. Aravindh Kumar had not returned the said residence and had made unauthorized renovations while continuing to reside in it. Following an extensive trial, Mr. Arvinda Kumar was ordered to vacate the official residence by the the Nuwara Eliya District Court, however, he had filed an appeal with the Supreme Court challenging that decision. Supreme Court had also ordered him to vacate the said residence. Later, Aravindh Kumar had filed an appeal with the Appeals Court, which had subsequently delivered the same decision. Based on the Nuwara-Eliya Magistrates order, the courts registrar and fiscal officers, accompanied by Lindula Police officers, had arrived at the residence and prepared a registry of the state Ministers personal belongings in the residence to place a copy of the record with the court, and handed over the property to the estate management. The estate management claim that after entering politics the incumbent State Minister of Education had exerted his political influence in order to forcibly occupy the said residence up until now. The official residence of the estate which was handed over to the estate management by the court would now be given to another official for use as their official residence, an estate official said.",

Then you will understand why you are still a citizen of a third world country. In Anura Kumaras book manifesto, there is the health policy. It starts with the fact that all patients will be given a bed. This is the health policy included in a policy statement presented in this presidential election and it says a bed for you allI just took one example. A manifesto should contain a vision.

Hunter Biden, 54, was indicted in California in December on nine counts related to a Justice Department investigation into his taxes. Federal prosecutors charged him with evading at least US1.4 million in tax payments. The only surviving son of President Biden had previously pleaded not guilty in the case. But a lawyer for him announced in court Thursday that Hunter Biden planned to change his not guilty plea before the start of his trial. Hunter Bidens stunning decision to plead guilty to misdemeanour and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case, Xinhua quoted NBC Los Angeles television stations report. Hunter Biden quickly responded guilty as the judge read out each of the nine counts, reported the television station, adding that the charges carry up to 17 years behind bars, but federal sentencing guidelines are likely to call for a much shorter sentence. His sentencing is scheduled for Dec 16, shortly after the 2024 US presidential election set to be held on Nov 5. Hunter Biden was convicted of three felony gun charges in a separate case in June. His conviction is related to purchasing a firearm in 2018 while addicted to crack cocaine, which is the first time in US history that a sitting presidents child has been convicted of a crime.

He added that over the past two years, the Department of Customs has implemented many positive changes, enabling officers to streamline operations through new methods and advanced technical processes. Director General Sarath Nonis highlighted that the dedication of the entire customs staff has been instrumental in combating fraud, corruption, and smuggling.

Almeida had called the accusations baseless and absurd lies in a video shared earlier on his social media, before he was fired. One of the women who was allegedly harassed is the Racial Equality Minister Anielle Franco, local media reported. Franco, also a human rights activist, shared a statement on Friday thanking those who showed their support to her amidst the news. I ask you to respect my space and my right to privacy, she said on social media platform Instagram. Ill contribute to investigations whenever Im called.

Speaking at the event, the SLPP presidential candidate said: Today, some leaders reiterate that they have eliminated queues, but the issue of passport queues remains unresolved. They talk about tourism but have yet to address the issue regarding visa issuance. These systems need to be modernized. The government sector can only be modernized by a political force with a vision and the capability to bring about change, and that force is the SLPP, he added.",

        "content": "While highlighting that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is the only solution as it understands the burdens of the public, presidential candidate of the SJB-led alliance Sajith Premadasa urged the public to vote for him instead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe or Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Addressing a rally in Eheliyagoda, Premadasa claimed that the President and Anura Kumara Dissanayake have struck a political deal to defeat him, adding that Wickremesinghe had struck a similar deal with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019. Throughout history, we have witnessed how President Ranil Wickremesinghe is good at misleading and betrayal. In 2019, he struck a deal with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to defeat me. So, it is clear that President Ranil Wickremesinghe and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have struck a political deal. They have got together and formed an impure alliance to defeat me. Commenting further, Premadasa added: They could have discussed to elect one person as president and the other as prime minister. That is their political alliance. To this day, they are merely acting. Because of these deals, Anura Kumara Dissanayake had the opportunity to talk in state media before the postal voting. For those who are planning to vote for President Ranil Wickremesinghe, I request you not to waste your vote on him. Cast your vote for Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya to make that change. We will take on the responsibilities of the United National Party. The only solution for the country is Samagi Jana Balawegaya that understands the burdens of the public, he added.",

        "content": "Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara is set to succeed Gautam Gambhir as the mentor for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). As per a report in The Telegraph, discussions are currently underway between the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise and Sangakkara regarding the role. The position has been available following Gambhirs appointment as the head coach of the Indian Cricket Team. Gambhir, who took over from Rahul Dravid, stepped into the Indian team role after the national sides T20 World Cup triumph. Gambhir, who served as Lucknow Super Giants mentor for the 2022 and 2023 IPL seasons, joined the KKR ahead of the 2024 campaign. His addition proved successful with the team securing their third IPL title. Gambhir had previously led KKR to two of their title wins during his captaincy. Sangakkara, the Director of Cricket at Rajasthan Royals since 2021, will reportedly leave the job as a result. This decision comes on the heels of the team appointing Rahul Dravid as their head coach for the 2025 IPL season. According to reports, Vikram Rathour, who was part of Rahul Dravids coaching staff with India, will also be joining RR as a coaching staff member. While an official announcement is pending, it is expected that these changes will take place shortly. KKR have been in the need of a coaching overhaul with Gambhir and Abhishek Nayar joining the national team setup.

Addressing a gathering in Jaffna, the NPPs Presidential Candidate went on to say that the NPP plans on establishing a development bank aimed at providing loan facilities to farmers at a low interest rate. We must provide debt relief to farmers. They end up pawning most of their possessions due to the debt burden. We have a plan carefully formulated through a survey, to write off a certain percentage of agricultural debt. We are also planning on establishing a development bank which will provide loans at lower interest rates. We possess a plan which will gradually provide debt relief to farmers, he said. Furthermore, Dissanayake added: Recently in Yapahuwa, Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that voting for Sajith is the same as voting for Anura. What he means is that votes cast for Sajith will aid the NPP to secure victory. Meanwhile in Galle, Sajith said a vote cast for Ranil is the same as a vote cast for Anura. We request the people of this country to not cast their vote for us through other parties. Cast your vote directly, we do not want your votes through Sajith or Ranil. Therefore, we inform Sajith and Ranil that we do not want their votes through other parties. Cast your vote for the NPP and lets establish a NPP-led government, Dissanayake said. The election that will be held on the 21st of September is the Presidential election. However, its results will impact the parliament too.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that he aims to ensure that Ayurveda is recognised as a medical science and is working towards establishing a National Council on Ayurveda to achieve this. The President outlined that a five-year plan will be implemented to enhance Ayurveda and traditional indigenous medicine. Additionally, he noted that plans are underway to maximize the use of Ayurveda to promote tourism in the country. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while addressing the Indigenous Medical Conference held at the Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla on Friday (06). The conference was organized by practitioners of traditional, Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani, and Homeopathic medicine, as well as indigenous medicine manufacturers, exporters, industrialists, shopkeepers, and other stakeholders in the indigenous medical field. The event was held to support President Wickremesinghe during the upcoming presidential election. During the conference, a proposal for the advancement of the indigenous medical field was also presented to the President. Addressing the conference, President Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that his goal is to officially recognize Ayurveda as a medical science and leverage it to attract tourists to the country, much like it works in India. Understanding the scientific basis of our indigenous medical system is crucial, and this requires research and modernization to support tourism. In countries like Thailand, major hotels offer Ayurvedic treatments, and we should implement similar programs here. Integrating Ayurvedic medicine into the tourism sector could significantly boost foreign exchange earnings. Additionally, places like Chennai have successfully developed their astrology systems, and we should aim to enhance our field by integrating these traditions, he added. We seek guidance on how to establish the National Council of Ayurveda in a manner that fosters collaboration among all stakeholders, President Wickremesinghe noted.",

        "date": "September 7, 2024 01:37 pm",
        "content": "Tanzania has lifted visa restrictions for Sri Lanka, marking the end of more than 20-year restrictions. During the announcement, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Kana Kananathan, emphasized that Sri Lanka is no longer on Tanzanias visa referral list,VisaGuide.World reports. Sri Lankan Businessmen  Travelers Can Now Apply for Standard Visas Online to Tanzania As Kananathan revealed, around 450 Sri Lankan businessmen, along with other travelers, including gem and stone traders, can now apply for standard visas online. Extensive high-level negotiations with the Tanzanian government led to Sri Lankas removal from the referral visa list, facilitating smoother travel for both business and personal purposes. The High Commission appreciated the Government of Tanzania for this positive change, which underlines the strong bilateral relations between the two countries. He also encouraged Sri Lankans to take advantage of this new opportunity while maintaining high standards of conduct abroad. As of September 2024, the Tanzanian passport ranks 140th globally according to the VisaGuide Passport Index. Tanzanian passport holders can now travel visa-free to 49 countries and territories. To take advantage of visa-free travel, travelers must ensure their passport is valid for at least six months beyond their departure date and obtain travel health insurance as required by their destination. Sri Lanka Has Also Facilitated Entry Rules for Some Travelers Sri Lanka has announced an immediate visa-free policy for travelers from 38 countries, effective September 3, 2024. This decision comes after a month-long period during which Sri Lanka issued visas on arrival due to issues with its e-Visa system, previously managed by a foreign consortium. With the suspension of the e-Visa system, the country is streamlining its new visa-free process and eliminating the previously available e-visa options, including double-entry visas for up to 30 days (extendable to 60 days) and transit visas for up to two days. Originally scheduled for October 1, the removal of visa requirements has been expedited to start immediately, simplifying entry for travelers from the designated countries. On the other hand, countries such as Afghanistan, Cameroon, Côte dIvoire, North Korea, Ghana, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria are not eligible for visa-on-arrival in Sri Lanka.

Six hours after departing the International Space Station, Starliner parachuted into New Mexicos White Sands Missile Range, descending on autopilot through the desert darkness. It was an uneventful close to a drama that began with the June launch of Boeings long-delayed crew debut and quickly escalated into a dragged-out cliffhanger of a mission stricken by thruster failures and helium leaks. For months, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams return was in question as engineers struggled to understand the capsules problems. Boeing insisted after extensive testing that Starliner was safe to bring the two home, but NASA disagreed and booked a flight with SpaceX instead. Their SpaceX ride wont launch until the end of this month, which means theyll be up there until February more than eight months after blasting off on what should have been a quick trip. Wilmore and Williams should have flown Starliner back to Earth by mid-June, a week after launching in it. But their ride to the space station was marred by the cascade of thruster trouble and helium loss, and NASA ultimately decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "September 7, 2024 04:50 pm",
        "content": "Selena Gomez rose to fame as a child star on Barney and the Disney Channel. Her latest role? Billionaire. The 32-year-old actress and singer has amassed a fortune worth 1.3bn, according to Bloomberg, which added the celebrity to its billionaire index on Friday. It said her wealth came mainly from her Rare Beauty make-up company, which she founded five years ago and retains a stake in worth more than 1bn, the publication estimated. The brands success has made her one of the youngest female self-made wealthy on the list, alongside the likes of Taylor Swift and Rihanna. Rare Beauty, known for liquid blush and lip tint that have had viral success on social media, reportedly did net sales of 400m in the 12 months to February. Gomez has also brought in tens of millions of dollars from endorsement deals with the likes of Louis Vuitton, Coach and Puma, according to Bloomberg. It said she also took home at least 6m per season for her Emmy-nominated turn in the Hulu hit Only Murders in the Building, which was recently renewed for a fifth season. Despite her on-screen and musical success - including multiple nominations for Emmy and Grammy Awards - those achievements count for a relatively a small fraction of her wealth, Bloomberg said. Gomez, born in Texas, has spent nearly three decades in the public eye, where her success has brought scrutiny of her fashion, boyfriends and health travails - including diagnoses of bipolar disorder and the autoimmune disease lupus. She has written about her familys journey to the US from Mexico, starting with her aunt hidden in the back of a truck and recording songs in Spanish. The singer became the most followed woman in the world on Instagram last year. She counts more than 424 million fans on the platform, ahead of Swift and Kylie Jenner - a dubious distinction for a star who has discussed the platforms negative impact on her mental health and at times deleted it. On Friday, the account was quiet as word of her latest distinction hit headlines. In an interview with BBC1 nearly a decade ago, Ms Gomez reflected on the longevity of her career, despite her youth. Its weird its almost two decadesam I too old? she joked, adding that there was more she wanted to achieve. You know whats crazy, is that a lot of times I dont even feel Ive started, she said.

        "date": "September 7, 2024 04:55 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations has called for a full investigation into the killing of a US-Turkish woman in the occupied West Bank during a protest on Friday. Local media reported that Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by Israeli forces as she took part in a weekly protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita near Nablus. Israels military said it was looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. Ms Eygis family said in a statement they were in shock and grief that the loving and fiercely passionate human rights activist was gone. The family said video showed she was killed by a bullet from an Israeli military shooter and called for the US to investigate. The US has urged Israel to investigate the incident. Sean Savett, spokesman for the White Houses National Security Council, said Washington was deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen. We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident, Mr Savett said. In a statement, Ms Eygis family said that given the circumstances, an Israeli investigation is not adequate and called on the US to conduct an independent investigation and ensure full accountability for the guilty parties. Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN secretary general, said: We would want to see a full investigation of the circumstances and that people should be held accountable. Civilians, he added, must be protected at all times. Footage from the scene shortly after the shooting shows medics rushing Ms Eygi into an ambulance. Jewish-Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak, who was at the protest, told BBC World Services Newshour programme he had seen soldiers on the rooftop aiming. He said he had heard two separate shots, with like a second or two distance between them. I heard someone calling my name, saying in English, Help us. We need help. We need help. I ran towards them, he said. He said he had then seen Ms Eygi lying on the ground underneath an olive tree, bleeding to death from her head. I put my hand behind her back to try and stop the bleeding, he said. I looked up, there was a clear line of sight between the soldiers and where we were. I took her pulse, and it was very, very weak. He added that Fridays demonstration had been Ms Eygis first time attending a protest with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group. The dual-national was rushed to a hospital in Nablus and later pronounced dead. Dr Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital where Ms Eygi was admitted, confirmed that a US citizen in her mid-20s had died from a gunshot in the head. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: During Israeli security forces activity adjacent to the area of Beita, the forces responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. The IDF is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review. In his interview with the BBC, Jonathan Pollak was asked about the IDFs statement, where the Israeli military said security forces had responded to stone-throwing. Mr Pollak said there had been clashes but he felt that soldiers had been under no threat. There had been no stone throwing where she had been, he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken deplored the tragic loss, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded the Israeli action barbaric. Ms Eygis family said they were wrestling with the reality that she was gone. Like the olive tree she lay beneath where she took her last breaths, Aysenur was strong, beautiful, and nourishing. Her presence in our lives was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military, the family said. Her family called her a loving daughter, sister, partner, and aunt who was gentle, brave, silly, supportive, and a ray of sunshine and lived a life of caring for those in need with action. Ms Eygi was born in Antalya, as reported by Turkish media. She graduated three months ago from the University of Washington in Seattle, where she studied psychology and Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures, her family said. She was active in campus student-led protests and felt compelled to travel to the West Bank to stand in solidarity with Palestinian civilians. The University of Washingtons president, Ana Mari Cauce, described news of Ms Eygis death as awful, adding that the former student was a positive influence on other students. Israeli forces withdrew from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Friday, following a major nine-day operation there. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - in that time. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. In the past 50 years, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.

        "date": "September 7, 2024 07:22 pm",
        "content": "Israeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, local medics said on Saturday, as Israeli forces battled Hamas-led militants in the territory. Eleven months into the war, numerous rounds of diplomacy have so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal to end the conflict and bring the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza as well as many Palestinians jailed in Israel. An Israeli airstrike in on the Halima al-Sadiyya school compound serving as a shelter for displaced people in the Jabalia urban refugee camp killed at least eight people and wounded 15 others, medics said. The Israeli military said the strike had targeted a Hamas command centre inside the compound. It accused the Islamist militant group of repeatedly exploiting civilians and civilian infrastructure for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies. Five more people were killed in a strike on a house in Gaza City. Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed four people and wounded 25 others at Amr Ibn Alaas school, which also houses displaced families in the Sheikh Radwan suburb of Gaza City, Palestinian medics said. The Israeli military said the air strike targeted a command center operated by Hamas gunmen in the compound that had previously served as a school. Palestinian health officials said Israeli military strikes had killed so far 28 people across the Gaza Strip on Saturday. The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah groups said they had fought Israeli troops in Gaza City, in central areas and in the south with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and in some incidents detonated bombs to target tanks and other army vehicles. The two warring sides continued to blame one another for the failure of mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and the United States, to broker a ceasefire. The U.S. is preparing to present a new proposal, but the prospects of a breakthrough appear dim as gaps between the sides remain large. CIA Director William Burns, the chief U.S. negotiator, told an event in London that a more detailed proposal would be made in the coming days. PAUSES IN FIGHTING LET POLIO VACCINATIONS CONTINUE On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was incumbent on both Israel and Hamas, which ran Gaza before the war and was responsible for the Oct. 7 killing spree against Jews in Israel that triggered it, to make concessions to reach a deal. On Saturday, senior Hamas official Hossam Badran said the group had made no new demands and remained committed to a July 2 proposal put forward by the United States, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attaching new conditions that would not end the war. Netanyahu says it was Hamas that introduced unacceptable conditions. Despite the deadlock, the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, has pursued a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed. U.N. officials said they were making progress, having reached over half of the children needing the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip. On Sunday, the campaign will move to the northern Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first. The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent assault on the enclave has killed over 40,900 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court, which Israel denies.

This meeting has taken place following an invitation by the ITAK leader while Wickremesinghe is on a visit to Jaffna for a public rally as part of his Puluwan Sri Lanka presidential election campaign. However, the stance of the ITAK, which is considered as the main political party of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) remains controversial as the party earlier announced that they have decided to back the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya-led alliance, Sajith Premadasa, during the upcoming presidential election. This decision was communicated by the TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran during a press briefing held on September 01, 2024. MP Sumanthiran said that this decision was reached at the Central Committee meeting of the party. ITAK is considered as the main political party of the Tamil National Alliance. Meanwhile, it was also reported that the ITAK has also agreed not to support the Tamil common candidate P. Ariyanenthiran. The central committee of the ITAK has decided to request Ariyanenthiran not to contest in the 2024 presidential election. Nevertheless, on Sunday (Sep. 01), the ITAK leader Mavai Senathirajah had stated that he was unaware of this decision which was said to have arrive by the partys central committee.",

        "content": "Families of fishermen and local people protested on Sunday at Jegathapattinam in Tamil Nadus Pudukottai district over the Sri Lankan Navy arresting 14 fishermen and seizing their mechanised boats. The fishermen were arrested on Saturday night. K.R. Manikantan, fisherman leader of Jagathapattinam while speaking to IANS, said, On a daily basis our brethren are getting arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy and people are now worried about entering seas for fishing and to carry out their routine means of livelihood. Both the state and Central governments are turning a blind eye to the grave situation being faced by us. The fishermens leader further said, Three mechanised boats were impounded by the Sri Lankan Navy. Even if the fishermen are released after some days of judicial custody in Sri Lanka, our boats will not be released. The boats are then attached by the Lankan government. This is making life miserable for the fishermen fraternity of Tamil Nadu. He said that the fishermen and family members would block the roads and disrupt traffic as a protest against the arrest of the 14 fishermen. The fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and fishing near Neduntheevu in the Palk Strait. Their three boats were also impounded. The arrested fishermen along with 49 others had gone into the sea from Jegathapattinam around 7 a.m. on Saturday. The arrested fishermen are, Pradeep, Ranjith, Prabakaran and Ajith who were on a boat owned by Mahadevan; Vishwa, Anandaraj, Anandababu, Kubendran and Sekar who were on a boat owned by Senthilkumar; and Manikandan, Muthukumar, Sellathambi, Selvam and Suresh who were on a boat owned by Manikandan. The Tamil Nadu coastal police officers said that the arrested fishermen were taken to Kankesanthurai naval base in Sri Lanka. It may be recalled that around 84 fishermen from Tamil Nadu are in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. The arrests have led to protests erupting in coastal districts of Tamil Nadu like Ramanathapuram, Nagapattinam and Pudukottai. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "September 8, 2024 01:31 pm",
        "content": "The Venezuelan government has said opposition presidential candidate Edmundo González has left the country, seeking asylum in Spain. Mr González has been in hiding, and a warrant issued for his arrest after the opposition disputed Julys presidential election result - in which the government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) declared Nicolás Maduro the winner. Venezuelas Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said in a post on social media that after voluntarily seeking refuge at the Spanish embassy in Caracas some days ago, Mr Gonzalez asked the Spanish government for political asylum. She added that Caracas had agreed to his safe passage and that he had left. Spains Minister of Foreign Affairs José Manuel Albares said Mr González had departed the country at his own request, and on a Spanish Air Force plane. He added that Spains government was committed to the political rights of all Venezuelans. Mr González has been granted political asylum there, newspaper El País reports. A lawyer for Mr González confirmed to AFP news agency he had left the country for Spain, but did not give any further detail. While he has departed, security forces in Venezuela have surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital, Caracas. Six political opponents of President Maduro are sheltering there. The countrys foreign ministry alleged that terrorist acts were being plotted inside. Venezuela has been in a political crisis since authorities declared President Maduro the victor of the 28 July election. The opposition claimed it had evidence Mr González had won by a comfortable margin, and uploaded detailed voting tallies to the internet which suggest Mr González beat Mr Maduro convincingly. A number of countries, including the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries, have refused to recognize President Maduro as the winner without Caracas releasing detailed voting data. The government of President Maduro has detained more than 2,400 people since the election, creating what the UN has called a climate of fear. Mr González had been in hiding since 30 July, fearing arrest following statements made by leading government politicians who said he should be behind bars. The attorney generals office, which is closely aligned with the Maduro administration, has accused Mr González of conspiracy and of forging documents, among other serious crimes. The 75-year-old had not been widely known before March this year, when the main opposition coalition registered him as its candidate. The oppositions original choice for presidential candidate had been the charismatic María Corina Machado, who had won an open primary with 93 of votes. But when her efforts to overturn a ban which barred her from running from public office were rebuffed by the government-controlled authorities, the opposition had to find an alternative candidate. After another opposition candidate was also barred, the opposition put forward Mr Gonzálezs name. Fearing he too could be barred from running, the opposition kept Mr González in the background, while Ms Machado criss-crossed the country calling on people to vote for him. On election night, Mr González appeared side-by-side with María Corina Machado disputing the announcement by the CNE, which had declared Mr Maduro the winner with 52 of the votes.

        "date": "September 8, 2024 03:37 pm",
        "content": "Two high-level Indian visits to as many neighbours in the southern Indian Ocean, and it is business as usual for New Delhi in South Asia after the whirlwind mass protests that toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh. External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankars was a return visit after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu and Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer had met him in New Delhi, jointly and separatelythe former on the occasion of incumbent Narendra Modis swearing in as Prime Minister for the third time in a row. National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval was in the Sri Lankan capital not very long after participating in the annual NSA-level meeting of signatories to the 2020 Colombo Security Conclave (CSC). The first was bilateral in character, the first one by a senior Indian dignitary after President Muizzu and his government had introduced avoidable strains in bilateral relations with consequences for regional security and stability. The latter focused directly on regional security and stability, where the NSA took time off to meet with the four major candidates in the Sri Lankan presidential poll, scheduled for September 21. EAM Jaishankars visit centred on the need for greater Indian involvement in crisis-hit Maldives economic recovery before it became even more critical. It was so when circumstances necessitated India as the regional power, with regional responsibilities going beyond national boundaries, to step in and fund Sri Lankas recovery, starting with the immediate supply of food, fuel, medicines, and whatever it required for the Colombo dispensation to overcome the dollar crunch that was at the centre of the import shortages since two years back. Against this, NSA Doval, in Colombo, co-signed a MoU for setting up the CSC Secretariat in the Sri Lankan capital. The August 30 ceremony was to formalise the ad hoc arrangement, as it would also make sense even more if there is a change of elected leadership in Sri Lanka. Significantly, the Maldivian NSA too signed the MoU after the nation had stayed away from the previous NSA-level meeting in Mauritius only weeks after Muizzu had become President in mid-November last. This time, as expected, Bangladesh, still going through the transition process, did not sign the MoU. It is another matter that Bangladesh and the Seychelles still remain observers at the CSC. As an Indian official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) noted, the CSCs core objective is to promote regional security by addressing transnational threats and challenges of common concern to the Member States. There are five pillars of cooperation under the CSC, namely, Maritime Safety and Security, Countering Terrorism and Radicalisation, Combating Trafficking and Transnational Organised Crime, Cyber Security and Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Technology, and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, the MEA statement said. That is to say, the current mandate of the CSC is centred on non-traditional security cooperation, including terrorism and cyber security. However, the scope for furthering the objectives and expanding the scope are phenomenal, as South Asia is witnessing choppy waters and disturbed land borders, especially owing to the not-so-benevolent presence of China, which sees both India and the US as twin adversariesthe former for historic reasons and the latter as a part of Beijings global ambitions as a wannabe superpower, which title no one is willing to confer it as yet. That includes some of the nations client states, like Pakistan and North Korea, and lil pockets of influence elsewhere across the world. Market panic According to media reports, EAM Jaishankars visit discussed ways for India to help out the Maldives to whatever extent possible from an imminent economic crisis, which is a legacy issue at one level and an inevitable customary hand-me-down from before the democratisation of the Maldives in 2008. By the governments own admission, despite the post-Covid recovery of the mainstay tourism sector, there is both a debt crisis and a dollar crunch. A recent development involving joint sector Bank of Maldives (BML), the nations main commercial bank, has the potential to trigger a market panic that in turn can discourage overseas suppliers, including those from India, the main source of all essentials, including rice, sugar, flour, eggs, and medicines. In such a scenario, if one were to develop, the way New Delhi intervenes to ease the evolving situation as it did in Sri Lanka two years back would be of great import on bilateral relations in the coming months, if not years. In contrast, NSA Doval had seemingly convinced his listeners in Colombo that India would work with the President that Sri Lankans elect and had no special or specific preference among the front-runners. The message seems to have gone down well and convincingly so. Yet, there are issues that both Colombo and New Delhi would have to grapple with under the post-poll Sri Lankan President, even if the incumbent gets an elected, five-year term, as against the Parliament-nominated two-year term just now. Sri Lanka is also becoming a sort of touchstone for Indian investments, often routed through or by private sector entities like the Adani Group. Their green energy projects in Tamil North of Sri Lanka are caught in environmental controversies, among others. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court is set to hear the same in October, after a new president has been sworn in. How the post-poll dispensation addresses the court case and allied issues, pending the parliamentary polls that are to follow soon thereafter, will be keenly watched. Apart from addressing Sri Lankas immediate concerns on the food, fuel, and fiscal fronts, New Delhi took the unprecedented step of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman personally arguing Colombos case for a bailout package with the IMF bosses during a regular visit to their Washington headquarters. This is the kind of gesture that should keep the India flag flying high in Sri Lanka, but that is not always the case. Despite Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha recently handing over a cheque for the first installment of funds for the hybrid power projects that New Delhi has promised, there are historic critics of India in Sri Lanka who would not give up. It is, however, not correct to paint them with a China brush, as many are home-grown and have been around long before Beijing began taking a strategic interest in the region. Thus, yes, a post-poll president will have to decide on the fate and future of the one-year moratorium that the present government has imposed on overseas research vessels presence in the Sri Lankan waters and ports. The moratorium was imposed earlier this year, purportedly under pressure from India and the US, which felt uncomfortable with Chinese research ships making an annual sojourn to these waters. India is a neighbour, whose waters, land, and airspace the Chinese ships were believed to spy uponeven while studying the mineral deposits and other characteristics of these waters with both an economic and strategic future in mind. The US has the famed Diego Garcia base in these waters and suspected or anticipated that the so-called Chinese research vessels would be spying on the American military capabilities in these parts. It thus remains to be seen how, after Jaishankars visit, the Muizzu government in the Maldives handles future Chinese requests for berthing those research vessels in the Male port, supposedly for restocking and rotation of personnel, as claimed during the two brief sojourns in the shared waters. What made news but went mostly unreported was the fact that the ship, possibly diverted from Sri Lanka after the moratorium, was researching in the waters outside the Maldivian EEZ for a full monththat is, between the two berthings. At the time, the Maldives claimed that the Chinese vessel did not undertake any research activity in its waters. Gateway to landmass Independent of the presidential poll results in Sri Lanka, current indications are that bilateral ties, especially in the economic sphere, will strengthen on the lines outlined in the Vision Statement and the MoUs signed between the two sides during last years New Delhi visit by President Wickremesinghe. They focused on further facilitating and strengthening the people-to-people contacts between the two countries. The decision for a sea-bridge connecting the two nations, originally floated by Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister in 2003, in the post-modern world connects the island nation not only the south Indian markets but would also be Sri Lankas gateway to the Eurasian landmass. As a follow-up to the Wickremesinghe visit, the two nations have recommenced flights linking southern Tamil Nadu cities to Jaffna town (Palaly air base, to be precise). There seems to be a greater welcome to air connectivity. Likewise, the two sides have also restored the forgotten ferry service linking northern Sri Lanka with southern Tamil Nadu, and it is said to be picking up momentum. Yet, there are grey areas that the two sides will have to sort out when the next government is in place in Colombo. It relates to the induction of private sector Indian corporations for undertaking development works in Sri Lanka, either through funding by New Delhi or otherwise. Foreign investments in key sectors of the economy are what Sri Lanka needs at the moment to revive the economy, which is yet to recover from the shocks and strains of 2022. India needs to address institutionalised troublemakers in that country and find solutions that are foolproof. It will be the kind of approach New Delhi would have to adopt in furthering bilateral economic ties with the Maldives, too. Despite the current economic crisis, there are internal limitations for any elected leader in Male, especially someone like Muizzu, whose strong electoral base comprises traditional conservatives who also revel at asserting Maldivian nationalism. Some among them identify it as Maldivian Islamic nationalism. The two are different, and Muizzu, for instance, seems to be wanting to draw the line if he has to become more acceptable to a neighbour like India, which continues to be uncomfortable, if not suspicious, about his China commitments. As and when stabilised, such a reorientation to neighbourhood economic ties in the south would go a long way in New Delhi, bridging the gaps and divides in the north, rather north-eastern neighbours. Now, during the transition in Bangladesh, anticipated complaints about India identifying with the disgraced Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka are beginning to be heard from that country. The problem for India is to convince the neighbours, their political parties, and the larger population that New Delhi intends to deal only with the leadership that they elect in democratic elections. This is what India did in the case of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh and President Ibrahim Solih in the Maldives, for instance. But it got misinterpreted because New Delhi stayed away from talking to the other side(s), as it could have had the potential of interfering in the internal affairs of those countries. In Sri Lanka, NSA Doval seems to have won the first round for India. Such a strategic approach, rather than tactical preferences, could go a long way in mending fences between India and every one of its neighbours, maybe barring Pakistan and Afghanistan for now. But consistency in the policy approach and a nuanced expression of the same, along with inevitable economic support as a part of regional responsibility, is what could make the change. But change, it will beand it will also have to be. Source: Firstpost --Agencies",

        "date": "September 8, 2024 08:09 pm",
        "content": "A new virus, dubbed wetland virus (WELV), has been discovered in China that can spread to humans through tick bites, causing neurological disease in some cases, according to media reports. The virus was first identified in a 61-year-old patient in Jinzhou city in June 2019, who fell ill five days after being bitten by ticks in Inner Mongolias wetlands. The patient experienced fever, headache and vomiting, with symptoms resistant to antibiotics, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine. WELV belongs to a group of viruses known for being transmitted by ticks, similar to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which can cause severe illness in humans. Following the initial discovery, researchers conducted a thorough investigation in northern China, where they collected nearly 14,600 ticks from various locations. About 2 per cent of these tested positive for WELV genetic material, primarily from the species Haemaphysalis concinna. WELV RNA was also found in sheep, horses, pigs and rodents called Transbaikal zokor. The virus showed cytopathic effects in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells and caused lethal infections in animal models. The researchers also analysed blood samples from forest rangers in the region, finding antibodies to WELV in 12 out of 640 individuals. Further tests on patients with tick bites revealed that 20 individuals tested positive for the virus, with symptoms ranging from fever, dizziness and headache to nausea and diarrhoea. One patient even fell into a coma due to high white blood cell counts in the brain and spinal fluid. Although all patients recovered after treatment, lab experiments on mice showed that WELV can cause lethal infections and potentially affect the nervous system. This suggests that while WELV can be mild in some cases, it has the potential to cause severe health issues, particularly involving the brain. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

He made this statement while speaking at the Puluwan Sri Lanka rally in Haputale earlier today (08), which was organized to support President Wickremesinghes bid for re-election. During his address, the President reflected on the hardships faced by the public during the countrys crisis, particularly the fear and uncertainty experienced by those standing in queues for fuel, gas, and medicine. He emphasized that he took on the presidency to correct those issues and is now seeking a mandate to continue the reforms initiated over the past two years. He stated that rival candidates Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake propose to change the current program, but doing so would forfeit concessions received by Sri Lanka, potentially leading to a decline in the rupee once again. I believe the people of this country are not willing to take that risk. Their promises do not suit the economic needs of the country today, he said. He said they have developed a plan to shift the countrys economy towards an export-driven model, similar to countries like Vietnam and Tailand, which will allow Sri Lanka to build a surplus of foreign reserves. We are also focused on raising wages for plantation workers, ending the line room system, and creating plantation villages where residents will receive free land rights, granting them the same privileges as other village dwellers.",

Against this backdrop, the Executive Director of the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Rohana Hettiarachchi assured that the absence of an official polling card would not hinder the voters from exercising their right to vote, if they are able to provide necessary identity documents. The Election Commission, in collaboration with the Postal Department, is distributing official polling cards to the registered voters. This serves as an invitation for voters to cast their ballots, Hettiarachchi explained. However, whether or not you receive this invitation will not prevent you from voting. He emphasized that the key requirements for voting are being registered on the electoral roll, knowing the assigned polling station, and presenting a valid form of identification as approved by the Election Commission. The official polling card includes important details like your polling station and voter number, making it easier to navigate the process. But even if you dont receive it, voters should not be concerned. It is not a major barrier to casting your vote, Hettiarachchi added, urging voters to remain confident about their ability to participate in the election.

        "content": "The Presidential Candidate of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance Dilith Jayaweera asserted that the four candidates who did not show up for the public debate have no right to address the nation again. Addressing an election rally held in Chilaw on Sunday (08), the Sarvajana Balayas presidential candidate went on to pledge that the political tactics of his alliance will not negatively impact its supporters. Commenting further, he said: All four top candidates, who have three rallies per day, were invited for a debate. All broadcasting corporations were ready to broadcast it live. The whole country was watching. They did not have to even bear any cost. They were given a chance to explain their plan to the country. No one showed up. They missed the opportunity to send their message to the public and say we have a policy, we have a plan. They had the chance to make the case on why their policy is the best. I can understand how two of those parties bring in crowds and how funds flow in. They are politicians who perpetuated corrupt politics. But how can the party that advocates against corruption so much hold three rallies per day? According to our calculations, they need about Rs 100 million for it, Jayaweera said. According to my knowledge, even if you confiscate the property of smugglers in Colombo, you will not be able to raise such a sum of money. They have been doing it for months now.They must reveal the source of funds. If they dont do that, it must be because they betrayed this countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity for money. The top four candidates who did not participate in the debate yesterday do not have the right to address this nation again, he added. Meanwhile, another rally of the Sarvajana Balaya was held in Kurunegala, under the patronage of the alliances Presidential Candidate Dilith Jayaweera. Addressing the gathering Jayaweera added: Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not leave his position because he did not have any political support. His immediate family ousted him. They ousted him in a situation because they could not fulfill their narrow political agendas. I never left this nationalist camp, which has been on its feet for 30 years. I will also never stop representing this nationalist camp. We pledge that our political tactics will never impact our supporters negatively, said Dilith Jayaweera.",

It has always been acknowledged within the Cabinet that surviving on the current salary under the existing economic conditions is extremely difficult, Amaraweera stated. The Minister explained that the government had already decided to increase both the salaries and the cost of living allowance for public sector employees from 2025. These measures were intended to be formally announced during the budget presentation, though the ongoing presidential election may cause delays in the release of this years budget, he added. Amaraweera stressed that the salary increase is aimed at addressing the economic challenges faced by public servants, underscoring the governments commitment to improving their welfare.

        "date": "September 9, 2024 09:59 am",
        "content": "For the first time in its history, Apple is launching its latest iPhone on a Monday, marking a significant shift from its usual Friday releases. The iPhone 16 event is set for Monday, September 9, 2024, breaking from the companys well-established pattern of Friday launches, a tradition that has held for almost two decades. This isnt just a routine changeits a historic moment for Apple fans and the tech world, and theres more to it than meets the eye. Apple has traditionally preferred to launch its flagship iPhones on Fridays. A quick glance at past launches tells the story: the iPhone 5 on September 21, 2012, the iPhone 6 on September 19, 2014, the iPhone 13 on September 24, 2021, and the most recent iPhone 15 on September 22, 2023all Fridays. But this year, the company has moved the launch to Monday, September 9. Just one day after the iPhone 16 debut, Apple faces a potentially massive fine from the European Commission. The Commission is expected to announce whether Apple will be forced to pay a record-breaking 14 billion fine related to a long-running tax dispute. The fine stems from allegations that Apple and Ireland colluded to avoid paying taxes on more than 100 billion generated in Europe between 2004 and 2014. This case, which dates back to 2016, has gone through multiple legal battles and appeals, with the fine sitting in escrow while the final decision is made. The decision date is set for Tuesday, September 10, creating a scheduling dilemma for Apple. Originally, the tech giant had hoped to unveil the iPhone 16 on that day. However, given the monumental nature of the ruling, it would have been too risky to hold such a high-profile event when the company could be facing the largest corporate fine ever imposed in Europe. Apple doesnt know how the ruling will go, but its not a gamble its willing to take. Instead, the company decided to push its launch event to Monday, allowing it to keep the spotlight on its new product without distraction. Theres another reason Apple avoided the original Tuesday launch. September 10 also marks the first US presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. With such a significant political event happening on the same day, Apple would have been competing for media attention. By moving the iPhone launch to Monday, Apple ensures that the event will dominate tech news without being overshadowed by political headlines. With the iPhone 16 launching on Monday and the European Commission ruling looming on Tuesday, Apple is heading into one of the most consequential weeks in its history. The decision to launch on a Monday not only breaks from the companys tradition but highlights how external pressuresfrom legal battles to global politicscan influence even the worlds largest tech company. This years iPhone event will be about more than just the newest device. Its a reflection of the changing landscape Apple finds itself in, and how the company adapts to maintain its dominance in the tech world. While Apple fans will be eagerly awaiting the iPhone 16, the real story might unfold the very next day. The shift to a Monday launch might seem like a small detail, but for a company as calculated as Apple, its a sign of the times. With a major fine hanging in the balance and political events clashing, this years iPhone release is anything but routine. September 9, 2024, will go down as a landmark moment in Apples history, not just for the device being unveiled, but for the unique circumstances surrounding it. Source: Business Today --Agencies",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 10:14 am",
        "content": "Thousands of diaspora Indians protested in more than 130 cities across 25 countries on Sunday, organisers said, to demand justice after last months rape and murder of a trainee doctor at a hospital in the city of Kolkata. The protests started in large and small groups across Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Singapore, before spreading to cities in Europe and the U.S. They added to ongoing nationwide protests in India after the Aug. 9 killing of the 31-year-old postgraduate student of chest medicine. A suspect has been arrested along with the former principal of R.G. Kar Medical College where the victim was studying. The news of this heinous crime committed on a young trainee doctor while on duty numbed and shocked each of us at the sheer ruthlessness, brutality and disregard of human life, said Dipti Jain, an organiser of the global protests. The doctor had retired to sleep on a piece of carpet in a seminar room after a marathon 36-hour shift, given the lack of dorms or resting rooms. She was later found bleeding from her eyes and mouth, with injuries to her legs, stomach, ankles, her right hand and finger, according to a doctors inquest report accessed by Reuters. Hundreds of protesters gathered in several cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, demanding accountability for the crime and safety for Indian women. In Dublin, California, about 35 miles (56 km) east of San Francisco, protesters formed a human chain, shouting slogans and waving placards that read We demand justice and Shout it loud, shout it far, justice for R.G. Kar. People across ages, including young children and seniors, recited poems and took part in a street theatre. While we do want womens safety, this is about the safety of everyone at their workplaces, said Sukalpa Chowdhury, a 39-year-old physician who joined the protests in Dublin. How can we have our future generations, who will go to the same institutes, feel safe, get a good education and serve society? That is a big concern for everyone. At another protest in the Swedish capital Stockholm, scores of mainly black-clad women gathered in Sergels Torg square to sing songs in Bengali and hold signs. Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women continue to suffer from sexual violence. Indias federal police are investigating the crime but are yet to file charges. The countrys Supreme Court created a hospital safety task force last month to recommend steps to ensure medical workers safety. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 12:02 pm",
        "content": "In a big milestone for Japans royal family, Prince Hisahito turned 18 on Friday, becoming the first male royal family member to reach adulthood in almost four decades. It is a significant development for a family that has ruled for more than a millennium but faces the same existential problems as the rest of the nation  a fast-aging, shrinking population. Hisahito, who is set to become the emperor one day, is the nephew of Japanese Emperor Naruhito. His father, Crown Prince Akishino, was the last male to reach adulthood in the family, in 1985. Hisahito is the youngest of the 17-member all-adult imperial family, which currently has only four men. His status as the last heir apparent poses a major problem for a system that doesnt allow empresses. The government is debating how to keep succession stable without relying on women. The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative pre-war family values, only allows a male to succeed to the throne and forces female royal members who marry commoners to lose their royal status. His older cousin, Princess Aiko, the only child of Naruhito and his wife Masako, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, is the general publics favorite as the future empress. But the existing law forbids Masako to take over that role even though she comes from a direct line of descent. The succession chart can get confusing: Naruhito is the emperor. His brother, Akishino, is second in line. Hisahito, the son of Akishino, comes next. An earlier proposal to allow an empress after Aikos birth was shelved as soon as Hisahito was born in 2006. Right now I would like to cherish my remaining time in high school, Hisahito said in a statement. He has long been interested in insects and even co-authored an academic paper on a survey of dragonflies on the grounds of his Akasaka estate in Tokyo, the statement said. A largely conservative government-commissioned panel of experts in January 2022 recommended that the government propose allowing female members to keep royal status after marriage as a way to prevent the declining population within the imperial family, while adopting male descendants from now-defunct royal families to continue the male lineage with distant relatives. Critics say those measures would have a limited effect as long as the male-only succession is maintained because it was workable largely with the help of concubines in the pre-modern era.

        "content": "A potential disaster was averted as a conspiracy to derail the Prayagraj-Bhiwani Kalindi Express in Uttar Pradesh was uncovered on Monday, police said. A train collided with an LPG gas cylinder placed on the tracks near a crossing in Kanpurs Muderi village Sunday morning. The quick response of the loco pilot, who immediately applied emergency brakes, prevented what could have been a catastrophic accident. According to the police, the incident occurred around 8:20 am as the Kalindi Express made its regular journey towards Bhiwani in Haryana. While passing through Shivrajpur, the loco pilot spotted an LPG gas cylinder lying on the railway tracks. Acting swiftly, the pilot slammed the emergency brakes, but the train hit the cylinder, which was thrown clear of the tracks due to the impact. No passengers were harmed, and the train came to a halt shortly after the collision. The train remained stationary for about 20 minutes at the site as the loco pilot reported the incident to the Railway Protection Force (RPF). The express later made another stop at Bilhaur station for a preliminary investigation before continuing its journey. Alongside the damaged LPG cylinder, the RPF and Uttar Pradesh Police recovered a bottle filled with petrol, matchboxes, and other suspicious items, including a bag. The bottle appeared to be fashioned into a makeshift petrol bomb. A forensic investigation has been launched, said Kanpur Commissioner of Police Harish Chandra, adding that railways and law enforcement agencies have intensified security measures on critical railway routes. The RPF, in collaboration with the UP Police Dog Squad, is conducting a thorough investigation, scouring the area for further clues. Additional security forces have been deployed along the Anwarganj-Kasganj railway route. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "title": "President Ranil assures pension and social security scheme for informal labour sector",
        "date": "September 9, 2024 12:42 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that partial compensation has already been distributed to fishermen whose livelihoods were affected by the Express Pearl marine pollution, and assured that the remaining payments will be made promptly. The President made these remarks last night (08) during a meeting with residents of the Willorawatta area in Moratuwa, responding to their concerns. Addressing a request to provide pensions for carpenters in Moratuwa, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that the Puluwan Sri Lanka initiative includes provisions for a pension and social security scheme for those in the informal labour sector. Wickremesinghe further elaborated: I intend to establish an anti-narcotics command center to tackle the drug menace. This center will focus on studying drug issues, implementing control measures, and rehabilitating those affected by drug addiction who are currently serving sentences. We also plan to introduce stricter laws than those currently in place for drug traffickers. First, we implemented the Aswesuma program for low-income individuals, increasing the number of beneficiaries to 2.4 million. In 2024, we also worked to provide relief to public servants as revenue grew. The 2024 budget granted a Rs.10,000 allowance, and starting next year, the report of the Udaya R. Seneviratne committee will be implemented. As a result, both salaries and allowances will increase during 2025-2026. Therefore, the question in this election is whether to continue advancing these initiatives. Our goal is to transform into an export-oriented economy. Additionally, we aim to create 100,000 jobs in collaboration with the government and private sectors and provide training for 50,000 individuals for foreign employment. Within this export economy, we plan to develop the fisheries industry, double tourist arrivals next year, modernize agriculture, establish new investment zones, and create a digital economyall as part of the Pulluwan Sri Lanka program, he expressed. It took other countries around 10-15 years to restore normalcy after going bankrupt, but my goal is to complete this process by 2027. The question remains whether other candidates can achieve this. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya has two policy declarations: Nalaka Godahewas Victory for All and the groups Blue Print 3.0. My friend and the leader of National Peoples Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently stated that Sri Lankan businesses should focus on an export-oriented economy, exporting to India and Africa. I was pleased to see that they are aligning with our approach. However, their policy declaration suggests cancelling all Free Trade Agreements (FTA) Sri Lanka has entered into. Without free trade agreements, how can we develop an export oriented economy? Furthermore, Sunil Handunnetti opposed the Economic Transformation Bill in court, arguing that establishing an export economy violates the Constitution, while emphasizing the need to protect an economy based on import industries, he said. Commenting further, the President added: During my meeting in Morawaka, I requested that he clarify this when he was scheduled to visit Morawaka the following day. However, there was no response. Instead, he spoke about presenting details of the Central Bank bond scam, which is irrelevant to me. A Parliamentary Select Committee and a Presidential Commission of Inquiry were set up to investigate the bond scam. Some alleged my involvement, so I provided statements to the commission. Ultimately, it was confirmed that I was not implicated. Legal proceedings followed based on the reports recommendations, but the accused were acquitted in the High Court. The government then appealed, and the case was dismissed there as well. Now, the government has brought the case before the Supreme Court. Anura Kumara Dissanayake may consult his lawyer about this matter if needed. There appears to be confusion about the facts. We remain committed to eradicating corruption in this country and have prepared the necessary legislation to support this effort, said Wickremesinghe.",

        "content": "Kendrick Lamar will pop out on the NFLs biggest stage next year: The Grammy winner will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans. The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Lamar would lead the halftime festivities from the Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9. The rap megastar, who has won 17 Grammys, said hes looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFLs championship game, where he performed as a guest artist with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem in 2022. Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date, Lamar said in a statement. And Ill be there to remind the world why. They got the right one. Lamar, 37, has experienced massive success since his debut album good kid, m.A.A.d city in 2012. Since then, hes accumulated 17 Grammy wins and became the first non-classical, non-jazz musician to win a Pulitzer Prize for his 2017 album DAMN. The rappers latest album Mr. Morale  The Big Steppers was released in 2022. He was featured on the song Like That with Future and Metro Boomin on a track that spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this year. He also scored another hit with Not Like Us. In 2016, Lamar gave a stunning seven-minute performance of tracks such as The Blacker the Berry and Alright at the 58th Grammy Awards. Lamar dazzled as an opener two years later at the Grammys with a performance of XXX. In June, Lamar turned his Juneteenth Pop Out concert into a celebration of Los Angeles unity. It came on the heels of his rap battle with Drake during the three-hour concert featuring a mix of p-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. Roc Nation founder Jay-Z called Lamar a once-in-a-generation artist and performer. His deep love for hip-hop and culture informs his artistic vision, Jay-Z said. He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendricks work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 02:02 pm",
        "content": "Indias health ministry says it has recorded a suspected case of mpox found in a man who recently travelled from a country suffering an outbreak of the virus. The young male patient has been isolated in a hospital and is in stable condition, the ministry said in a statement on Sunday, adding that the worlds most populous nation had robust measures in place. The case is being managed in line with established protocols, and contact tracing is ongoing to identify potential sources and assess the impact within the country, the health ministry added. The ministry did not specify which strain of the mpox virus the patient might have, but tests were being conducted to confirm the infection. The clade 1b variety of mpox has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa. India has detected 30 cases of an older strain, known as clade 2, between 2022 and March 2024. Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was discovered in 1958 in Denmark, in monkeys kept for research. It was first detected in humans in 1970. It is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals, but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the name monkeypox to mpox, saying the name of the disease appeared to be racist. Last month, the global health body declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. But the WHO added that the mpox outbreak is not another COVID-19. More than 17,500 mpox cases and 629 deaths have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the start of the year, according to the WHO. Both strains  clade 1b and clade 1a  are present in the country. The DRC has received its first batch of mpox vaccines, which health authorities hope will help curb an outbreak that has prompted the United Nations to declare a global public health emergency. The virus has also been detected in Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. Source: Al Jazeera --Agencies",

The e-passport tender issue has led to a crisis within the Immigration Department, causing long queues near the departments premises. Due to the current situation, the process of booking appointments through the online system has been temporarily suspended. Department sources have confirmed that a new stock of passports is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka on October 25. Accordingly, on that date, a total of 50,000 blank passports will be received, followed by an additional 100,000 blank passports approximately two weeks later. Over the next five years, the country plans to secure a total of 5 million blank passports. The Controller General of the Department of Immigration and Emigration, Harsha Ilukpitiya, noted that the new blank passports feature a black cover and are manufactured in Poland. Accordingly, a group of representatives from the Immigration Department has traveled to the relevant factory in Poland to examine the production process of these passports.",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 02:11 pm",
        "content": "Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara has completed the payment of Rs. 75 million in compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks, as ordered by the Supreme Court. It is reported that he made the final payment on August 30, completing the full amount in eight installments. Meanwhile, former President Maithripala Sirisena had also recently completed the payments of compensation of Rs. 100 million to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks as ordered by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, it is reported that the former President had paid the remaining amount of Rs. 12 million on August 16, thereby completing the total compensation payment ordered by the court. On January 12, 2023, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. As a result, they were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered former President Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the former SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and former National Intelligence Director Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. In addition, the judgment also stated that the government should pay Rs. 01 million in compensation to the victims. The order was issued by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, delivering its decision with regard to the 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by the defendants negligence and failure to prevent the terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. The 12 petitions were filed by a group of individuals including Nandana Sirimanna, whose two children were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks, tourism entrepreneur Janath Vidanage, three Catholic Fathers including Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda and Attorney-at-Law Moditha Ekanayake, who was injured in the bombings at the Shangri-La Hotel. On July 15, the Supreme Court had ordered former President Sirisena, former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara and former Chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena, to complete their outstanding compensation payments before August 30, 2024. Furthermore, the seven-member Supreme Court judge panel had ordered that if the relevant individuals fail to complete the payments before the said date, contempt of court charges will be filed against them before September 20, 2024. The former Presidents lawyers had informed the Supreme Court on the same day that Rs. 58 million of the total Rs. 100 million in compensation, which Sirisena had been ordered to pay the victims, had already been paid. Meanwhile, the former President had also requested the court through his lawyers to extend the payment period for the remaining sum by six years. However, this request was rejected by the court which extended the deadline to August 30. On July 11, 2023, the former President completed paying Rs. 15 million as part of the compensation he was ordered to pay to the victims and filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to pay the remaining sum in 10 instalments of Rs. 8.5 million from 30 June 2024 to 20 June 2033. The deadline to complete the relevant compensation payments was initially set for July 12, 2023.",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 02:44 pm",
        "content": "A bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding Monday as more rain fell on northern Vietnam from a former typhoon that has caused at least 59 deaths in the Southeast Asian country, state media reported. Nine people died during the typhoon, which made landfall in Vietnam on Saturday before weakening to a depression, and 50 others died during the consequent floods and landslides. The water levels of several rivers in northern Vietnam were dangerously high. A passenger bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province Monday morning. Rescuers were deployed but landslides blocked the path to where the incident took place. In Phu Tho province, rescue operations were continuing after a steel bridge over the engorged Red River collapsed Monday morning. Reports said 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes fell into the river. Three people were pulled out of the river and taken to the hospital, but 13 others were missing. Pham Truong Son, 50, told VNExpress that he was driving on the bridge on his motorcycle when he heard a loud noise. Before he knew what was happening, he was falling into the river. I felt like I was drowned to the bottom of the river, Son told the newspaper, adding that he managed to swim and hold on to a drifting banana tree to stay afloat before he was rescued. Typhoon Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit Vietnam in decades when it made landfall Saturday with winds up to 149 kph (92 mph). It weakened to a tropical depression Sunday, but the countrys meteorological agency has still warned the continuing downpours could cause floods and landslides. On Sunday, a landslide killed six people including an infant and injured nine others in Sa Pa town, a popular trekking base known for its terraced rice fields and mountains. Overall, state media reported 21 deaths and at least 299 people injured from the weekend. Skies were overcast in the capital, Hanoi, with occasional rain Monday morning as workers cleared the uprooted trees, fallen billboards and toppled electricity poles. Heavy rain continued in northwestern Vietnam and forecasters said it could exceed 40 centimeters (15 inches) in places. Initially, at least 3 million people were left without electricity in Quang Ninh and Haiphong provinces, and its unclear how much has been restored. The two provinces are industrial hubs, housing many factories that export goods including EV maker VinFast and Apple suppliers Pegatrong and USI. Factory workers told The Associated Press on Sunday that many industrial parks were inundated and the roofs of many factories had been blown away. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh visited Haiphong city on Sunday and approved a package of 4.62 million to help the port city recover. Yagi also damaged agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice is mostly grown. Before hitting Vietnam, Yagi caused at least 20 deaths in the Philippines last week and four deaths in southern China. Chinese authorities said infrastructure losses across the Hainan island province amounted to 102 million with 57,000 houses collapsed or damaged, power and water outages and roads damaged or impassable due to fallen trees. Yagi made a second landfall in Guangdong, a mainland province neighboring Hainan, on Friday night. Storms like Typhoon Yagi were getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall, said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

He stated this while addressing a public rally held in front of the Public Market Complex in Ayagama today (9), as part of the Dilith Gamata series of meetings. He expressed concern over threats to the countrys territorial integrity, stating, It is very clear that the territorial integrity of our country is being threatened. They repeatedly claim that there is no such thing as civilization and culture in this country. That means we are a country without culture and civilization. It is true that none of them have civility and culture, and we should sympathize with that. The 3 of the people are without any culture or civilization in the world. That is the truth. But this effort to impose it on the remaining 97 must be defeated, he said. Jayaweera urged citizens to stay vigilant, saying, Therefore, we must say to the patriotic people of this country that they should watch cautiously as to what is going to happen. The decision should be made based on that. If not, an irreversible mistake could happen to this country from our generation, in our lifetime. He also commented on the release of election manifestos by the main candidates, stating, At a time when all three are going to betray the country, three manifestos have been published.

Israeli strikes hit several areas in central Syria late Sunday, damaging a highway in Hama province and sparking fires, Syrian state news agency SANA said. The initial death count reported by the Masyaf National Hospital in western Hama province was four. SANA, citing hospital head Faysal Haydar, said 14 were killed and 43 wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, said at least four of those killed were civilians. One of the strikes targeted a scientific research center in Maysaf and others struck sites where Iranian militias and experts are stationed to develop weapons in Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Local media also reported strikes around the coastal city of Tartous. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations. The strikes often target Syrian forces or Iranian-backed groups. Israel has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria, particularly since Syria is a key route for Iran to send weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israels war against Hamas an ally of Hezbollah in Gaza. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "September 9, 2024 05:51 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka earned only its fourth test victory on English soil after an unbeaten century by opener Pathum Nissanka helped secure an eight-wicket win in the third and final match of the series against England at The Oval on Monday. England won the series 2-1 but missed out on a second clean sweep of its international summer, having defeated the West Indies 3-0 in July. Starting Day 4 on 94-1 and requiring 125 more runs to win, the Sri Lankans needed barely two hours to complete the job in clinical fashion. The platform was built on Sunday when they skittled England for 156 in just 34 overs and were given a victory target of 219. Nissanka underpinned the chase with his second test hundred, reaching three figures in 107 balls and finishing 127 not out as Sri Lanka got to 219 in 40.3 overs. The diminutive opener, who struck 13 fours and two sixes, spread his arms wide and soaked in the applause inside a half-full ground after passing 100, then kissed his bat and looked to the sky. His other century was against the West Indies in 2021, his first year in the Sri Lankan test team. The quality of his knock raised the question why he didnt start the first test against England at Old Trafford last month, before he was recalled for the second test at Lords. Fittingly, it was Nissanka who scored the clinching runs with a cut for four. The tourists previous test wins in England came in 1998  that famous 10-wicket victory in a one-off test at The Oval  as well as at Trent Bridge in 2006 and Headingley in 2014. This latest one looked unlikely after they won the toss but couldnt capitalize on perfect bowling conditions on Day 1, which England ended on 221-3. It was all Sri Lanka after that, however, as England got sloppy and occasionally reckless. The only wicket to fall on Monday was that of Kusal Mendis (39), who pulled a delivery from Gus Atkinson and saw Shoaib Bashir take a diving catch in the deep. Angelo Mathews was unbeaten on 32 alongside Nissanka at the end, with the pair putting on 111 runs in an unbroken stand for the third wicket. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Venezuela opposition leader Gonzalez lands in Spain seeking asylum",
        "date": "September 9, 2024 08:08 pm",
        "content": "Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez flew into Spain on Sunday to seek asylum, Madrid said, hours after quitting his country amid a political and diplomatic crisis over Julys disputed election. Gonzalez - who has challenged President Nicolas Maduros declaration of victory - arrived at the Torrejon de Ardoz military base with his wife, Spains foreign ministry said in a statement. The exit of the 75-year-old - seen by the U.S., the EU and other powers in the region as the winner of the disputed vote - came a week after Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant for him, accusing him of conspiracy and other crimes. Today is a sad day for democracy in Venezuela, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. In a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country. Gonzalez remains the best hope for democracy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a post on messaging platform X. We must not let Maduro and his representatives cling to power by force, he said. Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Instagram authorities had given Gonzalez safe passage in a bid to restore political peace. Spains foreign ministry said there had been no official talks with the Venezuelan government on Gonzalezs exit. Venezuelas opposition say the July 28 election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won. Maduro has dismissed all such assertions and says there was a right-wing plot to sabotage his government. Gonzalezs move to Spain marked another jolting shift in the fortunes of the former diplomat who came out of retirement and took over the candidacy in March, initially as a placeholder after opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and then another replacement could not stand. Machado confirmed on X that Gonzalez was now in Spain, adding he had fled to protect his freedom, his integrity and his life. The increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even the attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected show that the regime has no scruples or limits in its obsession to silence him and try to break him, she wrote. Gonzalez would continue to fight for the opposition from Spain, while she would continue to do so within Venezuela, Machado said, and vowed that he would be sworn in on Jan. 10, 2025, when the next presidential term begins. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told Spanish TV he had told Gonzalez any person whose physical integrity or fundamental rights may be endangered would be welcomed in Spain and its embassy. He added that his relocation to Spain had been planned for days and the foreign ministry said Gonzalezs asylum process would now start. Gonzalez had sought refuge in the Dutch and then the Spanish embassy in Venezuela after the election, Dutch and Venezuelan officials said. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a letter to his parliament on Sunday that Gonzalez had urgently requested refuge in the Dutch embassy the day after the election. At the beginning of September, Edmundo Gonzalez indicated that he ... wanted to leave and continue his fight from Spain, Veldkamp added. Spanish officials, including former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, linked to diplomatic relations in the South American country in the past, were involved in a week of negotiations with Venezuelan authorities for Gonzalez to leave the country, a source with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Opposition Presses for More Protests That Maduro allowed Gonzalezs departure despite the arrest warrant he was facing may soften some harsh recent international criticism of him. Machado, though, remains subject of an investigation and has largely been sequestered at an unknown location since the vote, emerging only occasionally to lead rallies. Gonzalezs departure came less than 24 hours after security forces surrounded Argentinas former embassy in Caracas, now being protected by Brazil, where six opposition staffers have been sheltering since warrants were issued for them in March. Attorney General Tarek Saab, who met with Gonzalezs lawyer this week and who has been one of the oppositions most strident accusers, held a press conference Sunday saying the government knew the exact moment Gonzalez entered the Spanish embassy and agreed to give him safe passage to leave the country. In a recording obtained by Reuters after Gonzalez arrived in Spain, he said his exit from Caracas was surrounded by pressure, coercion and threats. I trust that well soon continue the fight for liberty and the return to democracy in Venezuela, Gonzalez said. The opposition is pressing for more street protests and international pressure for its victory to be recognized, but so far those tactics have borne no fruit amid waning attendance at anti-government rallies.

        "title": "Tiran Alles claims mafia behind the long passport queues",
        "date": "September 9, 2024 10:39 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles alleged that a mafia has been operating behind the recent long queues for passports at the Department of Immigration and Emigration. He stated this in response to an accusation levelled by NPP parliamentarian Vijitha Herath. Long queues were observed in front of the Immigration Departments offices in recent days due to a shortage of new blank passports. During a press conference held today by the National Peoples Power (NPP), the party had accused the government over the crisis pertaining to issuance of passports. However, responding to the allegations during a press briefing at the Ministry of Public Security today, Minister Alles explained that the long queues were not formed due to a passport shortage. He stated that online appointment slots, which are made available for booking at midnight, are quickly taken by a certain group using more than 100 SIM cards to secure the appointments, which are then sold to the innocent people for around Rs. 45,000. When I found out about it, I immediately asked to halt the online system and to let them come int the queue. But then there was no end to the queues. He stated that certain individuals wait in the queue, and then sell that spot for Rs. 20,000 or Rs. 25,000. After that I took a decision and asked the police to take over the queues and they were instructed how to do it. After that day, the queues are over by 10.30 - 11.30, said the minister. Meanwhile, the minister also refuted reports claiming that a group of officials from the Immigration Department has traveled to the relevant factory in Poland to look into the production process of the new passports. They said the immigration bosses went to Poland because of the passport problem. These are blatant lies. Now the passports chief is here with me, he said.",
