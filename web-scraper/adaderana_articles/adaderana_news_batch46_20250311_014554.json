        "title": "President reveals plans to introduce modernised education system",
        "date": "August 17, 2023 05:11 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced plans to introduce a modernised education system in the country that can effectively address upcoming global challenges and incorporate modern technology. He highlighted the critical role of science and technology in various sectors of the world economy. Notably, he pointed out that areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and genome science have significant impacts on the global economy. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during the 20192020 annual prize giving ceremony at Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda yesterday (16 Aug). He stressed the importance of moving forward collectively towards the future, steering away from political traditions fixated on the past. He underlined that progress for the country depends on embracing a novel education system. During the event, President Wickremesinghe also honoured accomplished female students from Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda who excelled in the recent advanced level examination. He expressed gratitude towards the dedicated teachers and was presented with a commemorative gift by the schools principal, marking the historic occasion of a President visiting Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda. Further addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe extended his appreciation to the teachers and students, acknowledging the substantial progress of Anula Vidyalaya. He reflected on the schools humble beginnings and its transformation into one of the countrys leading educational institutions. Emphasizing the schools role in shaping future generations, he highlighted the evolution of the education system over the past five decades. During the time of President J.R. Jayawardena, the education landscape primarily consisted of textbooks. However, todays educational paradigm has integrated the use of cell phones and computers. This evolution also extends to the realm of transportation, as the concept of electric vehicles was non-existent in the past, but now they are an integral part of society. The rapid advancement of science and technology is evident, necessitating a contemporary education system to thrive in this environment. Its evident that a countrys progress hinges on an education system that aligns with societal needs. To construct a prosperous nation, its imperative to nurture a promising future generation. Education stands as the cornerstone for laying the foundation to empower this generation to surmount challenges. The need of the hour is an education framework that is forward-thinking and future-oriented. Our nation must be equipped to confront the potential challenges arising from climate change. The global phenomenon of climate change warrants meticulous study, as exemplified by the current environmental crises in Europe. The United Nations decision to advance the climate change agendas implementation by a decade, due to the urgent nature of the issue, underscores the gravity of the situation. Nations worldwide are gearing up to fulfil the climate agenda by 2040, a decade ahead of the original 2050 timeline. The modern world economy thrives on various sectors driven by scientific and technological advancements. Artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and genome science represent just a fraction of the fields influencing the global economy. Its paramount that we ready ourselves for these transformative shifts. Economists project that the integration of these technologies could contribute a substantial 300 to 700 trillion to the global economy by the mid-21st century. The world is progressing within this economic trajectory, necessitating our proactive preparedness. Much like the readiness exhibited towards the apparel industry in the 1970s and 80s, we must now embrace these emergent technologies. This calls for a fundamental overhaul of our education system. A proliferation of universities specializing in these domains is imperative. Furthermore, proficiency in languages such as English, Chinese, and Hindi is vital. Schools and higher education institutions must be established as centres of knowledge dissemination in these fields. Consequently, our strategy encompasses the establishment of non-state universities alongside state institutions. A scheme akin to the subsidized loan systems abroad has been devised to enable students to pursue education in non-government universities without financial constraints interrupting their academic pursuits. Today, you belong to the Gen Z generation. The succeeding generation, referred to as Gen Alpha, must be equipped to navigate a vastly transformed educational landscape, possibly acquiring knowledge through mobile devices. This paradigm shift in education necessitates our proactive adaptation. While politicians tend to focus on past matters, as students, our attention should be on the present. Yet, we set our sights on the future, compelling us to recalibrate our approach and surge ahead. Those tethered to historical perspectives must be bridged to the present, where insights into the future are attainable. Without modifying our educational framework, our prospects appear bleak. Progress is only conceivable through the adoption of a novel educational system. While factories, edifices, and thoroughfares can be constructed, the absence of education jeopardizes our future. Thus, as a government, we are resolute in our commitment to institute a fresh education system, ushering in a promising future for our nation. In attendance at this event were Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha, Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation Pavitra Wanniarachchi, Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Members of Parliament Jagath Kumara and Major Pradeep Undugoda, along with Governor of the Western Province Air Marshal Roshan Gunathilaka. Also present were the principal, teachers, a significant assembly of students and parents.",

        "content": "Two individuals have been arrested on suspicion of selling banned performance-enhancing drugs to sportspeople, Ada Derana learns. One suspect was arrested in the Wattala police division on Wednesday (Aug. 16), by the officers of Walana Anti-Corruption Unit in Panadura acting on a tip-off they had received. An undercover police officer had caught the suspect in the act as he was preparing to sell Rs. 38,000 worth of substances prohibited in sports. The arrestee was subsequently handed over to the Wattala Police for onward investigations. During interrogations, he had divulged information about the company that illegally imported the banned substances to the country. Based on the revelation made by the suspect, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), together with Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA), conducted a raid in Borella, which led to the arrest of a 29-year-old believed to be complicit in the scheme. The second suspect, identified as a resident of Ja-Ela, was supposed to be produced before the Welisara Magistrates Court today. The NMRA officers stressed that the use of these banned substances can result in impotence and affect the functions of the prostate gland, kidneys and testicles.",

        "date": "August 17, 2023 09:39 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has instructed the officials of the Ministry of Finance to declare the selling price of wheat flour per kilogram as Rs.198 in order to prevent two major companies from making excessive profits and to protect the consumers. This was discussed when the committee met on August 15, chaired by Patali Champika Ranawaka, who was appointed as the pro tem chairperson in the absence of Dr. Harsha de Silva, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. At the meeting, attention was drawn to the Regulations under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 233645 dated June 14, 2023, which is to be approved by the Parliament. The officials of the Finance Ministry have said the gazette published on the said date was issued with the aim of preventing the various companies importing wheat into Sri Lanka from making excessive profits by overstocking. Therefore, instructions were given to provide accurate data on the existing stocks of wheat flour to confirm if the desired objectives of the gazette had been achieved. Thus, the pro tem COPF chair noted that this would give an opportunity to find out if any irregularities have occurred. Attention was also drawn to the Order under the Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 233671. The order to increase the cess levied on raw materials imported for cement production by Rs. 2.00 per kilogram was discussed there. The pro tem COPF chair pointed out that the construction sector can be greatly affected by increasing the cess levy on raw materials for cement manufacturing. Furthermore, the committee pointed out that the selling price of cement after deducting all taxes is Rs. 700 higher than the price of cement unloaded at the port, the statement added. The pro tem COPF chair ordered the officials of the Finance Ministry and the Urban Development  Housing Ministry to submit a report on the matter as it appears that there is a huge gap between the landed cost and the selling price of cement and iron after all related taxes are deducted. Furthermore, it was revealed that the construction work of many houses, including low-income and middle-class houses, under the projects initiated by the Urban Development Authority, has stalled. The COPF thus called for a report on how the construction industry has been affected thus far. The officials also pointed out that the construction of a house, which earlier cost approximately Rs. 1.2 million, now costs at least Rs. 2.4 million. The committee also discussed the lack of proper evaluation of the social impact of rates increased by the Finance Ministry in a bid to boost state revenue, which it said is a huge concern. Furthermore, the COPF pointed out that the relevant departments should intervene in the regulation of cement prices. The Order under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, No.11 of 2021 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 234360 and the Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 233908 were also taken into consideration at the meeting. The officials of the Port City Economic Commission and the Board of Investments elaborated on the issues including the non-adherence of concessional measures to attract investments. Thus, subject to the above-mentioned recommendations, these four gazettes were approved by the COPF. Members of Parliament Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Premnath C. Dolawatte and Madhura Withanage, also attended the meeting.",

        "content": "Moderna said on Thursday an initial study data showed its updated COVID-19 vaccine to be effective against the Eris and Fornax subvariants in humans. The company expects the updated shot to be available, pending approval from health regulators in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, in the coming weeks for the fall vaccination season. Moderna and other COVID-19 vaccine makers Novavax, Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE have created versions of their shots aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant. Earlier on Thursday, Pfizer reported that its updated COVID-19 shot, co-developed with BioNTech, showed neutralizing activity against the Eris subvariant in a study conducted on mice. Eris, the nickname for EG.5, is similar to the XBB.1.5 subvariant and a sub-lineage of the still-dominant Omicron variant. EG.5 accounted for about more than 17 of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to the latest government data. Infections from Fornax, officially known as FL 1.5.1, are also rising across the country. COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S. are up more than 40 on low numbers from June, but are still more than 90 below peak levels hit during the Omicron outbreak in January 2022. The World Health Organization classified EG.5 as a variant of interest, indicating that it should be more closely watched than others because of mutations that might make it more contagious or severe.

        "date": "August 18, 2023 06:38 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (17) announced the development of a novel approach aimed at optimizing the operations of the Local Council, Provincial Council, and Central Government bodies, all geared towards curbing financial inefficiencies. The President directed officials to devise this new mechanism, placing a distinct emphasis on the efficacy of these three entities, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe instructed officials to collaborate with Provincial Governors and Chief Secretaries in order to draft a comprehensive report on this matter within a month. These consultations are intended to ensure a well-rounded perspective before formulating the new approach. These assertions were made during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat, where President Wickremesinghe engaged with Provincial Governors and Chief Secretaries. The purpose of this assembly, held on Thursday afternoon (17), was to deliberate on the forthcoming administrative procedures associated with the provincial council system, the PMD said. Saman Ekanayake, the Secretary to the President, expressed his anticipation for the backing of the Presidential Secretariat in addressing the challenges confronted by Provincial Councils in their interactions with the Central Government, it added. During the discourse, the provincial governors in attendance conveyed to the President the urgent requirement to promptly fill teacher vacancies within their respective provincial council jurisdictions. They took note of the presence of surplus teachers in certain schools, juxtaposed with teacher shortages in others. In response, they sought the implementation of a teacher exchange program to rectify this imbalance. Highlighting the issue of incomplete two-story buildings constructed under the the best school is the nearest school concept, the provincial governors emphasized instances of building deterioration and appealed for the formulation of a suitable program to address this concern. The governors also drew attention to stalled development projects for which allocations had been designated. Regrettably, the funds for some of these projects were still pending. In addition to these matters, the Provincial Governors requested the President to facilitate opportunities for advancing the tourism industry at the provincial level. Present at this discussion were Sagala Ratnayake, the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff; the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance; the Secretary of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government; as well as secretaries and officials from various line ministries, according to the PMD. Expressing his views further, the President said; Today, Ive gathered all of you to engage in a discussion about the governance framework associated with the empowerment of Provincial Councils. Our focus needs to be on how to progress in this direction while also considering the administrative structure of the central government. In certain instances, identical services are delivered by the three different tiers of administration: the Local Council, the Provincial Council, and the Central Government. For instance, look at the tasks like drain maintenance, electric pole installation, and road construction. Unfortunately, this redundancy results in significant financial wastage. If this is indeed the case, it becomes imperative to establish a fresh mechanism that centres around the coordination of these three entities. I have recommended the formulation of a novel system within a months time, following consultations with the Provincial Chief Secretaries. This step is crucial since the Provincial Councils are at present non-operational and bereft of ministers. Consequently, you, the Provincial Governors, hold complete governing authority within the current Provincial Council system. The previous year posed considerable challenges for us, an experience I believe we need not relive. As we strive to tackle the economic predicaments of the nation, our efforts must also encompass the restoration of the countrys governance structure. Of notable significance is that grassroots services are overseen by the provincial councils, while district-level services fall under the purview of the Central Government. Its essential that these undertakings progress harmoniously, without competing with each other, as we endeavour to offer these services jointly. The food security program has now been successfully rolled out across the entire nation. As a result, we are optimistic about a bountiful harvest in the upcoming season. Despite a decrease in the prevalence of malnutrition among the population compared to last year, we mustnt become complacent. Its worth noting that the Aswesuma program played a pivotal role in reducing malnutrition among the citizens of our country. The advantages stemming from the Aswesuma initiative extend beyond mere prosperity. Given that the parliamentary session will continue until the close of the next year, its essential to extend the opportunity for parliamentarians to engage in local government matters. Additionally, plans are underway to establish a dedicated advisory committee that will collaborate closely with the governor. Simultaneously, we are also addressing the powers of Provincial Councils as outlined in the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. Notably, a special emphasis has been placed on enhancing education, professional training endeavours, and the establishment of new universities in each respective province. To bolster the growth of the tourism industry, there are intentions to establish tourism boards at the provincial level. Its also pertinent to mention that numerous programs aimed at incentivizing investors and entrepreneurs are anticipated to be implemented at the provincial level in the future.",

        "date": "August 18, 2023 11:14 pm",
        "content": "A British nurse was found guilty Friday of murdering seven newborn babies and trying to murder six others at the hospital neonatal unit where she worked, becoming the UKs most prolific killer of children. Lucy Letby, 33, -- on trial since last October -- was accused of injecting her young victims, who were either sick or born prematurely, with air, overfeeding them milk and poisoning them with insulin. The jury at Manchester Crown Court in northern England reached all of its verdicts after deliberating for 22 days. Letby was arrested following a string of baby deaths at the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England between June 2015 and June 2016. Described by the prosecution as a calculating woman who used methods of killing that didnt leave much of a trace, Letby had repeatedly denied harming the children. Lucy Letby was entrusted to protect some of the most vulnerable babies. Little did those working alongside her know that there was a murderer in their midst, Senior Crown Prosecutor Pascale Jones said in a statement. Time and again, she harmed babies, in an environment which should have been safe for them and their families, the prosecutor added, calling the killings a complete betrayal of the trust placed in her. Playing God The court heard that colleagues raised concerns after noticing that Letby was on shift when each of the babies collapsed, with some of the newborns attacked just as their parents left their cots. Prosecutor Nick Johnson said Letby gaslighted her colleagues into believing the string of deaths were just a run of bad luck. Letbys final victims were two triplet boys, referred to in court as babies O and P. Child O died shortly after Letby returned from a holiday in Ibiza in June 2016, while child P died a day after their sibling. Letby was also said to have attempted to kill the third triplet, child Q, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge. Johnson said that by that time Letby was completely out of control, adding that she was in effect playing God. Letby was arrested and released twice. On her third arrest in 2020 she was formally charged and held in custody. During searches at her home, police found hospital paperwork and a handwritten note on which Letby had written: I am evil, I did this. Letby later tried to explain the note by saying she wrote it after being placed on clerical duties following the death of the two triplets. Something wrong She said that decision to remove her from medical duties had left her feeling like she had done something wrong. Barrister Ben Myers, defending Letby, told the court she was hardworking, deeply committed and loved her work. He pointed to the fragile health of the babies, many of whom were born prematurely, and said the neonatal unit was overstretched and understaffed. Letby also suggested that a gang of four senior doctors pinned blame on her to cover for the hospitals failings. When Letby took the stand at her trial, she insisted she always wanted to work with children and said it was devastating to find out she was blamed for the deaths. The case revived memories of two of Britains infamous medical murderers, doctor Harold Shipman and nurse Beverley Allitt. Shipman, a general practitioner, hanged himself in prison in 2004, four years after being convicted of killing 15 of his patients. A later public inquiry concluded he killed about 250 patients with lethal morphine injections between 1971 and 1998. Allitt -- a nurse dubbed the angel of death -- was jailed for life in 1993 after being convicted of murdering four young children in her care, attempting to murder three others and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to six more.

        "content": "The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has announced that it has received sufficient financial allocations for paddy purchasing. The PMB, stating that the government has spent Rs. 13 billion on paddy purchasing last year, also mentioned that steps have been taken to convert the purchased paddy stocks into rice and distribute them to 2.9 million low-income families across the island free of charge. In addition, the government, through the Farmers Trust Fund, has provided an amount of Rs. 500 million for the purchase of paddy in Yala Season. Accordingly, the Paddy Marketing Board has thus far purchased Rs. 300 million worth of paddy using the aforesaid financial allocation. Although the PMB still has the remaining Rs. 200 million of the allocation in its possession, it is facing a boycott from the farmers who have refused to sell their crops to the Board. Thus, it has been decided to close paddy warehouses in several districts. Moreover, the government has obtained the Cabinet approval to provide another Rs. 750 million as a loan from state banks to the PMB for paddy purchasing. The Paddy Marketing Board mentions that it is ready to buy paddy by using those funds, whenever the farmers are willing to sell the stocks.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to conduct comprehensive national security review",
        "date": "August 19, 2023 11:22 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says a comprehensive national security review will be conducted to formulate modern security policies for the National Security Council. He said a dedicated team has been appointed to carry out the review, with a focus on a broad range of factors including emerging economic trends and implications of climate change. Wickremesinghe made these remarks addressing a Presidents Colours Awards at the Navy Volunteer Force Advanced Naval Training Centre in Boossa on Friday (Aug. 18), according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The distinguished honour was bestowed upon the Volunteer Naval Force, in recognition of its unwavering dedication, exemplary service, and significant contributions to the nation, as the main supplementary force of the Sri Lanka Navy. Delivering his address, the president said the mandate of the team appointed to conduct the review is to thoroughly assess the nations security landscape and propose modern security policies for the National Security Council. Wickremesinghe pointed out that such evaluations are standard practice in numerous European countries, undertaken at intervals of five to ten years, adding that appraisals encompass an assessment of the nations vulnerabilities, available resources, and a strategic roadmap for implementation These deliberations culminate in informed decisions, juxtaposing military capabilities with economic prowess, and it is imperative for us to heed these principles, he added. Upon the compilation of this review report, a blueprint for modernized security policies of the National Security Council is expected to ensue. He said the task of orchestrating this critical endeavour has been entrusted to Defence 2030, a program initiated to strengthen the defence forces of Sri Lanka, which has diligently appointed an adept review team led by Major General (Rtd.) Channa Gunatillake. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe commented: Today marks your entry into the esteemed ranks of the Navy. When the Sri Lanka Navy was first established, maritime threats were virtually non-existent. The Indian Ocean was under the firm control of the British Navy during that era, and subsequent to their departure, our region remained relatively tranquil. However, the landscape shifted dramatically in 1983 when we were confronted with the exigencies of conflict. On that pivotal day, the LTTE organization showcased its adeptness in naval operations, underscoring their familiarity with the sea. This was a novel experience for our forces, compelling us to undertake a profound study of maritime strategies. Over time, through the unwavering commitment and skilfulness of our security forces, we triumphed over this adversarial entity. This victory resonated on an international scale, highlighting the capabilities of our Navy in combat scenarios. Reflecting on global counterparts grappling with similar challenges, such as the situation in Somalia, it becomes evident that an amalgam of significant naval forces was required. Remarkably, our nation stood resiliently on its own in addressing comparable challenges. As we commemorate 14 years since the culmination of that arduous conflict, the moment signals us to pivot our focus toward the present and the horizon that lies ahead. Presently, the challenges we confront are distinct from the scenarios of 2009 and 1983. The dynamics of todays landscape witness the encroachment of global power struggles into the Indian Oceans realm. On one front, a contest for supremacy unfolds between the United States and China across the expanses of the Pacific Ocean. Simultaneously, a power struggle emerges between Western nations and Russia in the context of Ukraine. This competition for influence extends even to remote reaches such as Niger in Africa, an adjacent nation to Mali, where our dedicated army is stationed. Undoubtedly, the Indian Ocean hosts the worlds pivotal trade routes, making Sri Lanka an integral player at this stage. As we navigate these waters, it is imperative that we chart a course devoid of entanglement in these international rivalries, maintaining an impartial stance. Our foremost concern must be the safeguarding of our security within this sphere. Internally, various countries grapple with threats that emanate from within, a predicament exemplified by incidents like the tragic events of the Easter Sunday attack. Hence, it is incumbent upon us to fortify ourselves against such internal vulnerabilities as well. The reality we inhabit finds us enmeshed in global geopolitics; it is a reality we cannot disregard, compelling us to deliberate upon it, irrespective of our preferences. Indeed, considering the evolving global landscape, I am inclined to initiate a comprehensive review of our nations prospective national security framework. Such evaluations are standard practice in numerous European countries, undertaken at intervals of five to ten years. These appraisals encompass an assessment of the nations vulnerabilities, available resources, and a strategic roadmap for implementation. These deliberations culminate in informed decisions, juxtaposing military capabilities with economic prowess. It is imperative for us to heed these principles. Contemporary times have ushered in an array of advanced technological devices such as drones and others including those relevant to naval operations. Notably, the utilization of submarines in the Indian Ocean has become increasingly pronounced. In light of this, our maritime security strategy should pivot towards the development of a robust program tailored to submarine surveillance and control. Furthermore, we must acknowledge the impermanence of our current aerospace assets. The trajectory of aviation and naval technologies suggests an enhanced reliance on innovative solutions in the future, surpassing the capacities of the present. Our trajectory forward necessitates a progressive incorporation of advanced technologies to effectively address the challenges that await us. Indeed, the foundation for addressing future challenges lies in fortifying our nations economy and fostering swift development. A robust economic landscape would provide the necessary financial means to undertake essential endeavours. Recognizing the limitations posed by our status as a developing nation, it becomes evident that solutions for the future cannot be derived solely from past approaches. In this context, my intent is to instigate a comprehensive review of our nations security apparatus. This review is poised to adopt a forward-looking perspective, intricately tied to emerging economic trends and the pressing issue of climate change. This recalibration of focus is paramount to effectively respond to the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead. Upon the compilation of this review report, a blueprint for modernized security policies of the National Security Council will ensue. The task of orchestrating this critical endeavour has been entrusted to Defence 2030, which has diligently appointed an adept review team. This distinguished team, under the adept guidance of former Major General Channa Gunathilake, is dedicated to the preparation of this pivotal report. In support of these efforts, a dedicated office has been established, reaffirming our unwavering commitment to ensuring the comprehensive security of our nation. Undeniably, the challenges that lie ahead extend far beyond the confines of weaponry or monetary considerations. Our paramount concern remains the welfare and prosperous future of our citizens, encompassing both those in active military service and those who will transition beyond it. Your dedication has not gone unnoticed, and we are committed to integrating your insights and perspectives into this new security review.",

        "content": "The Canadian government on Friday demanded that Meta lift a reckless ban on domestic news from its platforms to allow people to share information about wildfires in the west of the country. Meta started blocking news on its Facebook and Instagram platforms for all users in Canada this month in response to a new law requiring internet giants to pay for news articles. Some people fleeing wildfires in the remote northern town of Yellowknife have complained to domestic media that the ban prevented them from sharing important data about the fires. Metas reckless choice to block news ... is hurting access to vital information on Facebook and Instagram, Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge said in a social media post. We are calling on them to reinstate news sharing today for the safety of Canadians facing this emergency. We need more news right now, not less, she said. Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez earlier said the ban meant people did not have access to crucial information. Chris Bittle, a legislator for the ruling Liberal Party, complained on Thursday that Metas actions to block news are reckless and irresponsible. Ollie Williams, who runs Yellowknifes Cabin Radio digital radio station, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that people were posting screen shots of information on Facebook since they could not share links to news feeds. In response, a Meta spokesperson said by email that the company had activated the Safety Check feature on Facebook that allows users to spread the word that they are safe in the wake of a natural disaster or a crisis. Canadians can use Facebook and Instagram to access content from official government agencies, emergency services and non-governmental organizations, the spokesperson added. Meta says users do not come to its platform for news and forcing the company to pay for content shared on its platforms is unsustainable for its business. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The future bilateral cooperation between Sri Lanka and India will heavily focus on connectivity and investment, says Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India Milinda Moragoda. He stated this while addressing the 63rd National Defence Course at the National Defence College (NDC) in New Delhi, on Friday (Aug. 18) on the theme Evolution of India-Sri Lanka Relation: Opportunities and Challenges. At the outset, Moragoda highlighted the uniqueness of India-Sri Lanka relations while drawing examples from historical ties to the present-day dynamics which involve a wide range of critical facets that define the relations between India and its closest maritime neighbour Sri Lanka. During his interactive session, the High Commissioner focused on key thematic areas of cooperation in the fields of economy, energy, culture, defence, and regional dynamics in the Indian Ocean. He explained how the India-Sri Lanka relations over the years have grown from a transactional phase to a special relationship and highlighted the importance of elevating the existing special relationship to a strategic level with the gradual progression of recently inked initiatives. While thanking the Indian Government for the timely assistance rendered during the recent economic crisis, Moragoda apprised the audience of the current status concerning Sri Lankas economy and the economic stabilization efforts that are underway. He also said the future bilateral cooperation would heavily focus on connectivity and investment based on a reverberant economic integration road-map that was agreed upon by the leaders of the two countries. The Sri Lankan envoy went on to highlight key pillars charted in the Integrated Country Strategy launched in 2021 for Sri Lanka Missions in India and its achievements. Moragoda, emphasizing the importance of the recent official visit of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India, explained that the five key connectivity-focused enablers mapped in the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision would remain the driving force in propelling the existing relations towards a new era. Speaking on the defence cooperation, the High Commissioner thanked the Indian government for the assistance rendered in enhancing the capacities and capabilities of the Sri Lankan armed forces over the years. He also stated that Indias security concerns in the immediate neighbourhood as well as in the Indian Ocean are Sri Lankas security concerns as well, and therefore, Sri Lanka pays a great deal of attention, especially to the developments that are taking place in the Indian Ocean. The 63rd NDC course comprises 120 students representing the Indian military, Indian Civil Services, and friendly foreign countries, including two senior military officers from Sri Lanka. The NDC is dedicated to the intellectual development and strategic enculturation of selected senior officers of the armed forces and civilian government services of India and those from foreign countries, for higher leadership positions and responsibilities.",

        "content": "Mirihana Police on Friday night (Aug. 18) arrested the businessman, who was reported missing in Kolonna for the past few days. He was found hiding inside a three-wheeler in the Delkanda area. On Wednesday (Aug.16), Kolonna Police had received a complaint that a businessman who was traveling in a van in the Kolonna area had been attacked with chili powder and abducted. Later, police recovered the van in which the businessman was traveling, near the Anilkanda Public Cemetery. The police officers discovered chili powder on the drivers seat, leading them to initially suspect that the businessman had been attacked. However, upon further examination, they began to suspect that the chili powder might have been intentionally sprinkled on the seat in a deliberate attempt at misleading. Against this background, an Inspector of Mirihana Police received a tip-off yesterday afternoon, indicating that the said businessman was using a three-wheeler in the Delkanda area as a hiding place. Accordingly, a police team was deployed to the area to arrest the missing businessman. It also led to the arrest of two other individuals, aged 37 and 62, who were staying with him. They have been identified as residents of Rakwana and Gangodawila areas, the police said. Police also seized receipts of cash deposits in favour of several bank accounts and Rs. 250,000 in cash found on one of the suspects, along with the three-wheeler in question. The initial investigations conducted by the police have revealed that the businessman had staged the abduction. Speaking regarding the matter, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa stated that the statements given by the suspect suggest that the purported abduction was a calculated effort to avoid the financial problems he was facing. He has devised this plan himself with the intention to go into hiding for some time, the police spokesman added. The arrested suspects were produced before the courts today (19) and remanded until August 24.",

Accordingly, steps were taken to send him on compulsory leave with effect from August 17, under the recommendations of the Public Services Commission. Despite a suspension imposed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Dr. Haq had performed the post-mortems of the well-known late businessman Dinesh Schaffter, whose murder still remains a mystery, and the child who died at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) for Children in Colombo following a kidney surgery. The SLMC gave Dr. Ruhul Haq (SLMC Registration 15168) an 8-month suspension with effect from December 20, 2022, after an inquiry into the complaint made by Mr. S.A. Rathnasena. The councils website mentions, The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) has decided that commencing from the 20th of December 2022 Dr. Ruhul Haq should be imposed a suspension for a period of eight (08) months from exercising his rights, privileges and immunities conferred upon him by registration as a Medical Practitioner in terms of the provisions of the Disciplinary Regulations published in the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No 7577 dated 10th March 1993 and Medical Ordinance No. 26 of 1927 as amended. Although the suspension is supposed to come to an end on August 20, 2023, Dr. Haq was found to have been practising during this period and has performed the much-talked-about post-mortems of murdered businessman Dinesh Schaffter and Hamdi Fazleen, a three-year-old who was receiving treatment at the LRH. In the post-mortem report on Hamdi Fazleens death, Dr. Haq had mentioned that the boy was born with only one kidney  a condition called renal agenesis. However, Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya had ordered Borella Police not to continue with the investigations based solely on Dr. Haqs forensic analysis as contradictions and obscurities in his reports had been confirmed during previous court proceedings.

        "date": "August 20, 2023 08:08 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - India will impose with immediate effect a 40 export duty on onions up to Dec. 31 in an attempt to improve domestic availability of the vegetable, the ministry of finance said in a notification on Saturday. The duty imposed by the worlds biggest exporter of onions will help New Delhi dampen local prices ahead of key state elections later this year but will force Asian buyers to shell out more, as other regional exporters have limited supplies. The export duty will make Indian onions more expensive than those from Pakistan, China, and Egypt. This will naturally lead to lower exports and aid in reducing local prices, said Ajit Shah, an exporter based in Mumbai. Average wholesale onion price in key markets has jumped nearly 20 from July to August, to 2,400 rupees (28.87) per 100 kg on concerns that erratic rainfall would lead to lower yields. India is heading for its driest August in more than a century, with scant rainfall likely to persist across large areas, partly because of the El Niño weather pattern, two weather department officials told Reuters on Friday. Onions harvested during the summer months are rotting quickly, and the new supplies are being delayed. This situation has prompted the government to take precautionary measures, said another Mumbai-based exporter. Indias onion exports in the first half of 2023 jumped 63 from a year ago to 1.46 million metric tons. Countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka rely on Indian shipments. Onions are used as the base for traditional dishes across Asia such as biryani in Pakistan and India, belacan in Malaysia and fish curry in Bangladesh. The Indian duty would prompt China and Pakistan to raise prices, as they have a limited surplus for exports, said the second exporter. Indias annual retail inflation (INCPIYECI) in July rose to its highest in 15 months as vegetable and cereals prices skyrocketed, putting pressure on the government to take action to bring down prices.

The two sides discussed the possibility of renewing the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the two sides, discussing avenues to strengthen cooperation and sharing expertise with respect to human rights. They also discussed opportunities and challenges facing Sri Lankan workers considering the increasing recruitment of Sri Lankan workers. Al Kuwari outlined that the State of Qatar has taken an array of measures pertaining to the protection of workers rights, chief of which are the right of workers to change their employers under the law No. 18 of 2020, determination of minimum wage and ensure their right to adequate housing and living conditions set forth in the law No. 17 of 2020. He pointed out that the law ensures the workers right to transfer to other employers with streamlined conditions. However, in case of contract termination without adherence to a notice period, employers shall pay compensation to workers as the law specified the compensation value in a way that observes workers rights.

        "title": "Govt ready to provide required facilities - President emphasizes progress in tourism sector",
        "date": "August 20, 2023 02:50 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted that the tourism industry stands as the paramount sector capable of swiftly advancing the countrys economic objectives. The government, under his leadership, has implemented numerous pivotal measures to foster its growth, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The President emphasized the significance of substantial contributions from both the public and private sectors. He stressed that the government is diligently working to provide necessary amenities for all stakeholders involved. Addressing the audience at the inauguration of the Hilton Yala Resort, a luxurious establishment within the Hilton Hotel Group, President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the urgent need for comprehensive development in the region. The Yala National Park, frequented by local and international tourists daily, was singled out as a key area for such development, the PMD said in a statement. Minister of Tourism and Lands, Harin Fernando, speaking at the event, commended President Ranil Wickremesinghes new initiatives to bolster the tourism industry. He expressed optimism that these efforts could position tourism as a primary revenue source for the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, adding his thoughts, expressed his satisfaction in inaugurating the upscale Hilton hotel in the Yala region. He noted that this move would attract energetic tourists and invigorate the tourism sector. He extended gratitude to Melwa and the Hilton Group for their contributions, according to the PMD. Recalling the historical significance of the area, President Ranil Wickremesinghe alluded to the ancient shrines of Situlpawwa and Akasha Chaitya that once graced the Yala region. He praised the past fertility and collaboration that defined the area, as well as its remarkable architectural marvels. The President emphasized a resolute commitment to advancing the tourism industry, urging collective participation towards this goal. He envisioned the development of the Yala area as a unified tourist destination, incorporating nearby regions like Udawalawe. This interconnected approach, he suggested, would drive progress and further enhance the tourism experience in the region, the statement added. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to enhance the facilities catering to tourists visiting these regions. I kindly urge both the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation and the Minister of Tourism, along with their respective ministry officials, to collaborate on devising a comprehensive development plan for the Yala area. This expansion should extend to encompass locales like Galoya, Maduruoya, Somavatiya, Minneriya, and Wasgamuwa. The industry has to be involved, and that is a prerequisite. I have been also looking at this hotel and the area, and I thought we should also promote Yala. We will introduce the greater Yala. Why are you going to call these places Udawalawe, Kumana and all? These are all connected, and the elephant path passage from Udawalawe will take you up to Kumana. So, lets brand this as Greater Yala and make it Greater Yala for all promotional activities. So, why only have luxury hotels here? You can have some near, I am sure, just outside Kumana before Arugambe, we can find some land for another set. Somewhere in Udawalawe, somewhere in Lunugamwehera, where those who want to can also access the Kataragama shrines. So, these are places. Why dont we develop them? I am asking the Minister, together with the Minister of Wildlife and Conservation, as well as the officials of those two ministries, to come up with the Greater Yala concept. I dont think we should stop there. If you take Galloya, Maduroya, Somavathiya, Minneriya, and Wasgamuwa, you will have a unique brand. So, just have two brands and Wilpattu, which can stand on its own. And certainly, why dont you get into a yacht in Colombo, come to Puttlam Bay, spend a day or two at Wilpattu and get back? So, you will have some wildlife reserves, which will be different from what you can get in other places. Additionally, an intriguing prospect lies in establishing wildlife reserves that offer visitors a fresh and unique experience, reminiscent of the offerings in countries like India and Nepal. This avenue warrants significant attention as we formulate a new strategy to elevate the tourism industry. It is essential that we set ambitious targets for the tourism sector, with the goal of doubling the influx of tourists to our country. Correspondingly, the revenue generated from tourism should witness a four to fivefold increase. Reflecting on my visit to the Maldives in 1981, I recall that their tourist income amounted to 25. Interestingly, at that time, fewer tourists visited the Maldives compared to our nation. Today, the number of tourists arriving here, approximately 2.5 million, equals the visitors to the Maldives. Presently, we charge around 200 per tourist, while the Maldives charges approximately 700. Therefore, to invigorate the tourism industry, we must not only boost the number of tourists but also consider elevating the pricing. Upon assuming the presidency, my responsibility extended beyond liberating the country from debt burdens. I was tasked with devising innovative avenues to generate income. Unlike industries and agriculture, which require time to yield returns, the tourism sector presents an avenue for swift contributions. Hence, our primary objective revolves around promoting tourism to generate income and fulfil the needs of our people. As the year concludes, our hotels will brim with touristsa trend thats already underway. Looking ahead to the following year, we must not only fill our rooms with tourists but also double the resultant income. Tourist accommodations across the nation are experiencing high occupancy rates in September, buoyed by the historic Dalada Perehara and the Asian Cup cricket tournament in Kandy. The upcoming Christmas season is anticipated to draw several internationally renowned artists and musicians, including the distinguished Western musician Andrey Mucher, slated to grace our shores in January. The country hosts a myriad of events, such as the Galle Literary Festival, strategically designed to attract more visitors and generate vital revenue for the nation. Simultaneously, this endeavour should serve as a means of both income and employment, necessitating comprehensive training for the youth. In certain instances, this avenue has evolved into a gateway to international employment, highlighting the importance of collective engagement in shaping both individual futures and broader initiatives. Numerous innovative proposals have been introduced to expedite the progress of our tourism sector. Notably, the government is working to extend support for individuals willing to allocate two rooms in their homes for tourists, providing excellent guest services while commanding rates upwards of a hundred dollars. The imperative of achieving our tourism industrys objectives is paramount. We aim to harness resources to swiftly generate income and employment prospects. In this pursuit, I appeal for the unwavering support of all individuals. Harin Fernando Minister of Tourism and Lands Under the guidance of the President, we have executed a range of initiatives aimed at boosting tourism. The outcomes are evident, with an increased inflow of tourists, particularly following the Presidents visit to India. Notably, India constitutes the largest source of visitors to our country, followed by China. Air travel to Sri Lanka has surged, with airlines like Qatar Airways now operating up to six daily flights. Sri Lanka has become an attractive destination for airlines, evidenced by the operation of flights by Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines seven days a week. Akira Airlines from Israel plans to launch direct flights to Sri Lanka twice a week, beginning October 31. Moreover, more flight additions are on the horizon. Our domestic airlines also contribute significantly, with around 80 flights to India weekly. I extend my gratitude to all who have united to confront these challenges. Its especially heartening to learn that the Hilton Hotel Group intends to inaugurate luxurious new hotels in Nuwara Eliya and Negombo. These endeavours are poised to make substantial contributions to our nations tourism industry. The Presidents novel approach to tourism promotion is a departure from past practices and has the potential to align with current industry goals. Statistics reveal that 31 of our tourists are repeat visitors. Our nation neednt be confined to a particular tourist hotspot; instead, our identity should centre on warmth and hospitality. Foreign investors are increasingly drawn to Sri Lanka due to its welcoming atmosphere. It is crucial to sustain this warmth and hospitality to ensure the countrys continued allure. I am confident that under the Presidents visionary program, the tourism sector in our nation will experience resounding success, positioning it as the primary revenue generator. In attendance at this significant event were Professor Maithri Wickramasinghe, American Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands H.M.B.P. Herath, Chairman of the Tourism Promotion Bureau Chalaka Gajabahu, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism and Hotel Management Institute Shirantha Peiris, as well as other distinguished personalities, according to the PMD. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe embarked on an inspection tour of the Yala National Park. During the visit, he highlighted the option of purchasing park tickets online for both local and foreign visitors. Acknowledging the arid climate, the President also observed efforts to rejuvenate dried-up water ponds within the park. Accompanying him were Minister Harin Fernando and American Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung. Also present to grace the occasion were Jamie Mead, Senior Operations Director (South East Asia) of the Hilton Hotels Group, Josh Roberts, Senior Operations Director (Asia  Australasia), Sri Lanka Hilton Hotels Group Regional General Manager Manesh Fernando, Hilton Yala Resort General Manager Gitanjali Chakravarthy, Muruga Pillai, Director of Melwa Hotels  Resorts Private Limited, and several other esteemed officials, it added.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - At least 18 people were killed after a bus crashed and caught on fire in Pakistans eastern Punjab province on Sunday, authorities said. The bus collided with another vehicle in the early hours of the morning while carrying 33 passengers from the southern port city of Karachi to the capital, Islamabad. The unfortunate bus ... collided with a mini-truck loaded with three small tanks of petrol at around 4.30 am, said Fahad Ahmad, the police chief of Punjabs Hafizabad district. The bus and the truck caught fire immediately, the result of which 18 people including the mini-truck driver died on the spot. He said another 16 people with serious injuries had been transferred to hospital.

        "title": "Blue Beetle unseats Barbie atop box office, ending four-week reign",
        "date": "August 21, 2023 10:51 am",
        "content": "The DC superhero film Blue Beetle led weekend ticket sales with a modest 25.4 million opening, according to studio estimates Sunday, dethroning Barbie from the top spot after a record-setting run that left movie theaters colored pink for a month. The Barbie phenomenon is far from over. Greta Gerwigs film, which earlier this week became the highest grossing Warner Bros. release ever domestically, nearly managed to stay No. 1 again with 21.5 million in its fifth weekend. Its up to 567.3 million in North America and an eye-popping 1.28 billion globally. The other half of Barbenheimer also continues to perform remarkably well for a movie so far into its run. Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer took in 10.6 million in its fifth week. With a 285.2 million domestic total, Oppenheimer now owns the distinction of being the biggest box-office hit never to land No. 1 at the weekend box office. The previous record-holder for that unlikely stat is 2016s Sing, which grossed 270.3 million in the shadow of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Hidden Figures. Universal Pictures Oppenheimer has done even better overseas. Its global gross stands at an estimated 717.8 million through Sunday. Blue Beetle, starring Xolo Maridueña, came in on the lower side of expectations and notched one of the lower debuts for a DC Comics movie. Though earlier planned as a streaming-only release, Warner Bros. elected to put Blue Beetle, the first DC movie to star a Latino superhero, into theaters in the late summer, a typically quiet period at the box office. The production price tag of about 105 million was lower for Blue Beetle than the average superhero film. Its one of the last releases produced under an earlier regime at DC Studios, which James Gunn and Peter Safran took the reins of last year. The film, directed by Ángel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, drew solid reviews  certainly better than the three previous DC releases this year (The Flash, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods). Blue Beetle (76 fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) is the rare comic-book film to put a Hispanic cast front and center. But it also faced some tough luck, and not just in the unexpected staying power of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Southern California was bracing Sunday for Hurricane Hilary  potentially dampening ticket sales in the region. (Los Angeles was still its top market.) And like recent releases, Blue Beetle, which added 18 million internationally, didnt have its cast available to promote the movie due to the ongoing actors strike. Universals raunchy R-rated canine comedy Strays showed even less bite. The film, with a voice cast including Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx, landed in fifth place with 8.4 million. Comedies have generally struggled in theaters in recent years, but Strays had it particularly rough given that its starry cast was unavailable. Strays was very narrowly bested by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. The Paramount Pictures animated release earned 8.4 million in its third weekend, bringing its domestic total to 88.1 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Blue Beetle, 25.4 million. 2. Barbie, 21.5 million. 3. Oppenheimer, 10.6 million. 4. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, 8.4 million. 5. Strays, 8.3 million. 6. Meg 2: The Trench, 6.7 million. 7. Talk to Me, 3.2 million. 8. Haunted Mansion, 3 million. 9. Mission: Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part One, 2.7 million. 10. The Last Voyage of the Demeter, 2.5 million.

        "date": "August 21, 2023 11:47 am",
        "content": "The Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera stated that immediate steps will be taken to solve the problems that have arisen in purchasing paddy from farmers. The Minister further stated that since the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has not allocated enough money for the purchase of paddy, a certain amount of paddy has been purchased with the funds received from the Treasury, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. In light of this situation, the farmers are not interested in selling paddy due to not getting the expected price, the Minister said. The Minister stated the above while responding to the problems raised by the Parliamentarians regarding the purchase of paddy at the meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Agriculture held in Parliament recently, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. The Minister pointed out that even if paddy is purchased at the minimum price fixed for the purchase of paddy, the paddy marketing board will have to sell rice at a price lower than that price. Given the situation, he informed that steps will be taken to solve the problems related to the purchase of paddy through discussion with the relevant parties. The Members of Parliament of Batticaloa and Ampara pointed out that farmers in the said districts had to buy fertilizers at a higher price as they started the season earlier than other areas. The Minister said that at the meeting held to decide on the season, he will focus on deciding the start date of the season in general. The Minister also mentioned that attention has been paid to issuing a public announcement about the start date of the season so as to affect the entire island, it added. Furthermore, the Minister pointed out that the price of eggs is high due to the decrease in egg production and that the price of eggs may decrease in the future due to the gradual increase in production. Ministers Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, State Ministers D. B. Herath, Vijitha Berugoda, Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva, Kader Mastan, Members of Parliament A. H. M. Fowzie, Chandima Weerakkody, A. L. M. Athaullah, Piyankara Jayaratne, Sivagnanam Shritharan, Charles Nirmalanathan, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha, Waruna Liyanage, Kins Nelson, Thavaraja Kalai Arasan, Udayakantha Gunathilaka, Kulasingam Thileepan, Jagath Kumara Sumithraarachchi were present at the Committee meeting held, the statement added. However on Saturday (Aug 19), the Paddy Marketing Board announced that it had received sufficient financial allocations for paddy purchasing. Accordingly, the Paddy Marketing Board has thus far purchased Rs. 300 million worth of paddy. Nevertheless, it alleged that although the PMB still has the remaining Rs. 200 million of the allocation in its possession, it is facing a boycott from the farmers who have refused to sell their crops to the Board. Thus, it has been decided to close paddy warehouses in several districts.",

Officers responded to reports of a shooting at Rainier Hookah Lounge just before 4.30 a.m. on Sunday, Xinhua news agency quoted the Seattle Police Department as saying. Police found that two men and a woman had been shot, Seattle Police Chief Adrian Diaz said at a news conference on Sunday evening. The two men, aged 22 and 32, died from injuries at the scene. The woman, aged 30, was taken to hospital in critical condition. She died later in the day, Diaz added. The injured were also taken to the hospital. Four men and a woman were in stable condition as of Sunday evening. A 23-year-old man was in critical condition, Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins said at the news conference. The Departments homicide unit is leading an investigation. Its not clear yet what led to the shooting or how many suspects have been involved. Police confirmed they recovered at least five guns. It appeared they might have been trying to shut down the place, as well. But when it comes to the community, I believe its an isolated incident,  Diaz said. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement that even as Seattle police keeps up a rapid and record pace of recovering guns -- 869 through July -- there are still more illegal guns in the wrong hands that could be used to incite another tragedy like this one.

        "date": "August 21, 2023 03:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas consumer price inflation slowed to 4.6 year-on-year in July from 10.8 in June, helped by easing food prices, the statistics department said on Monday. The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) captures broader retail price inflation and is released with a lag of 21 days every month. Food prices contracted to negative 2.5 in July from 2.5 in June, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement. Prices for non-food items also eased to 10.9 in July from 18.3 year-on-year in June. Since June, Sri Lankas inflation has come down sharply from the runaway levels seen earlier, partly due to the statistical base effect, but also helped by a stronger rupee currency, which has lowered the costs of fuel, power and imported food. A 2.9-billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) secured in March has topped up foreign reserves, which had dwindled to record lows in early 2022, plunging the island into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades.

        "date": "August 21, 2023 05:49 pm",
        "content": "A British judge has sentenced Lucy Letby to spend the rest of her life in prison for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others while working as a neonatal nurse at a hospital in northern England. Justice James Goss imposed the most severe sentence possible under British law on Letby Monday. Following 22 days of deliberation, a jury at Manchester Crown Court convicted Letby, 33, of killing the babies during a yearlong spree that saw her prey on the vulnerabilities of sick newborns and their anxious parents. The victims, including two triplet boys, were killed in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England between June 2015 and June 2016. Following 22 days of deliberation, a jury at Manchester Crown Court convicted Letby, 33, of killing the babies over a yearlong period that saw her prey on the vulnerabilities of sick newborns and their anxious parents. The victims died in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England between June 2015 and June 2016. Letby did not attend the hearing to listen to the anger and anguish from parents of the children whose lives she took or those she injured. I dont think we will ever get over the fact that our daughter was tortured till she had no fight left in her and everything she went through over her short life was deliberately done by someone who was supposed to protect her and help her come home where she belonged, the mother of a girl identified as Child I said in a statement read in court. Prosecutor Nicholas Johnson said Letby deserved a whole-life tariff for sadistic conduct and premeditated crimes. Defense lawyer Ben Myers said Letby has maintained her innocence and that there was nothing he could add that would be able to reduce her sentence. Letbys absence, which is allowed in British courts during sentencing, fueled anger from the families of the victims, who wanted her to listen to statements about the devastation caused by her crimes. You thought it was your right to play God with our childrens lives, the mother of twins, one of whom was murdered and the other whom Letby tried to kill, said in a statement to the court. Politicians and victim advocates have called for changes in the law to force criminals to appear for sentencing after several high-profile convicts chose not to face their victims in recent months. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who called the crimes shocking and harrowing, said his government would bring forward in due course its plan to require convicts to attend their sentencings. Its cowardly that people who commit such horrendous crimes do not face their victims and hear first-hand the impact that their crimes have had on them and their families and loved ones, Sunak said. During Letbys 10-month trial, prosecutors said that in 2015 the hospital started to see a significant rise in the number of babies who were dying or suffering sudden declines in their health for no apparent reason. Some suffered serious catastrophic collapses but survived after help from medical staff. Letby was on duty in all of the cases, with prosecutors describing her as a constant malevolent presence in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died. The nurse harmed babies in ways that were difficult to detect, and she persuaded colleagues that their collapses and deaths were normal, they said. Senior doctors said over the weekend that they had raised concerns about Letby as early as October 2015 and that children might have been saved if managers had taken their concerns seriously. Dr. Stephen Brearey, head consultant at the Countess of Chester Hospitals neonatal unit, told the Guardian newspaper that deaths could arguably have been avoided as early as February 2016 if executives had responded appropriately to an urgent meeting request from concerned doctors. Letby was finally removed from frontline duties in late June of 2016. She was arrested at her home in July 2018. An independent inquiry will be conducted into what happened at the hospital and how staff and management responded to the spike in deaths. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "Trump says he will surrender Thursday on Georgia charges tied to efforts to overturn 2020 election",
        "date": "August 22, 2023 07:56 am",
        "content": "Former US President Donald Trump says he will surrender to authorities in Georgia on Thursday to face charges in the case accusing him of illegally scheming to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Can you believe it? Ill be going to Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday to be ARRESTED, Trump wrote on his social media network Monday night, hours after his bond was set at 200,000. It will be Trumps fourth arrest since April, when he became the first former president in U.S. history to face indictment. Since then, Trump, who remains the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has had what has seemed like an endless procession of bookings and arraignments in jurisdictions across the country. His appearances in New York, Florida and Washington, D.C., have drawn enormous media attention, with news helicopters tracking his every move. Trumps announcement came hours after his attorneys met with prosecutors in Atlanta to discuss the details of his release on bond. The former president is barred from intimidating co-defendants, witnesses or victims in the case  including on social media  according to the bond agreement signed by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, Trumps defense attorneys and the judge. It explicitly includes posts on social media or reposts of posts made by others. Trump has repeatedly used social media to attack people involved in the criminal cases against him as he campaigns to reclaim the White House in 2024. He has been railing against Willis since before he was indicted, and singled out Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp  a Republican who rebuffed his efforts to overturn the election  by name in a social media post Monday morning. The agreement also prohibits the former president from making any direct or indirect threat of any nature against witnesses or co-defendants, and from communicating in any way about the facts of the case with them, except through attorneys. The order sets Trumps bond for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  or RICO  charge at 80,000, and adds 10,000 for each of the 12 other counts he is facing. Bond is the amount defendants must pay as a form of collateral to ensure they show up for required court appearances. Willis set a deadline of noon Friday for Trump and his 18 co-defendants to turn themselves in to be booked. The prosecutor has proposed that arraignments for the defendants follow during the week of Sept. 5. She has said she wants to try the defendants collectively and bring the case to trial in March of next year, which would put it in the heat of the presidential nominating season. A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing. A phone message seeking comment was also left for an attorney for the former president. Trumps appearance in Georgia will come a day after the first Republican primary debate, which he has decided to skip. He is expected to turn himself in at the Fulton County jail, which has long been plagued with problems. The Department of Justice last month opened a civil rights investigation into conditions, citing filthy cells, violence and the death last year of a man whose body was found covered in insects in the main jails psychiatric wing. Three people have died in Fulton County custody in the past month. The Fulton County Sheriffs Office said in a news release Monday afternoon that when Trump surrenders there will be a hard lockdown of the area surrounding the jail. But Trump is not expected to spend much time there. When defendants arrive at the building, they typically pass through a security checkpoint before checking in for formal booking in the lobby. During the booking process, defendants are typically photographed and fingerprinted and asked to provide certain personal information. Since Trumps bond has already been set, he will be released from custody once the booking process is complete. Unlike in other jurisdictions, in Fulton County, arraignments  where a defendant first appears in court  are generally set after a defendant completes the booking process and do not happen on the same day. Booking a former president, who still has 24-hour Secret Service protection, has created myriad security and logistical issues in other jurisdictions. In his past appearances in a New York state court and federal courts in Miami and Washington, Trump was not handcuffed while in custody. He was also not required to pose for a mugshot, with officials instead using existing photographs of the former president. Georgia officials have said Trump will be treated like others charged with crimes in their state. Unless somebody tells me differently, we are following our normal practices, and so it doesnt matter your status, well have a mugshot ready for you, Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat said at a news conference earlier this month. Trump was charged last week in the case alongside a slew of allies, who prosecutors say conspired to subvert the will of voters in a desperate bid to keep the Republican in the White House after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and he characterizes the case  and the three others he is facing  as efforts to hurt his 2024 presidential campaign. He has regularly used his Truth Social platform to single out prosecutors and others involved in his cases, and to continue to spread falsehoods that the 2020 election was stolen from him. In a post on Monday, Trump called the Fulton County district attorney crooked, incompetent,  highly partisan. He also attacked Kemp, whom he has long targeted for the governors refusal to intervene after the 2020 election. Kemp has been outspoken in pushing back against Trump, writing in social media last week: The 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. Bond was also set Monday for three lawyers who were indicted along with Trump. For each of them, the bond for the RICO charge was set at 20,000, with varying amounts for the other charges they face. John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro each had a bond set at 100,000, while Ray Smiths bond is 50,000. Bail bondsman Scott Hall, who was accused of participating in a breach of election equipment in rural Coffee County, had his bond set at 10,000. Other defendants include former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and a Trump administration Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, who aided the then-presidents efforts to undo his election loss in Georgia. The Georgia indictment came just two weeks after the Justice Department special counsel charged Trump in a separate case in a vast conspiracy to overturn the election. Besides the two election-related cases, Trump faces a federal indictment accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents as well as a New York state case charging him with falsifying business records.

        "date": "August 22, 2023 10:58 am",
        "content": "Thailands divisive ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra was jailed Tuesday as he returned to the kingdom after 15 years in exile, hours before parliament votes to install his partys candidate as the new prime minister. The billionaire landed in a private jet at Bangkoks Don Mueang airport at 9 am (0200 GMT), to be greeted by hundreds of noisy Red Shirt supporters waving banners and singing songs. Thaksin emerged briefly from the terminal building to bow and offer a floral garland at a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn as a mark of respect before waving to supporters. More Red Shirts lined the streets as the former Manchester City owner was taken to the Supreme Court. There, he was ordered to serve eight years for three convictions passed in his absence -- one linked to his former Shin Corp company, another linked to a bank loan, and a lottery case. His return came on the day parliament is expected to install business tycoon Srettha Thavisin as prime minister at the head of a coalition led by the Pheu Thai party -- the latest incarnation of Thaksins political movement. Thaksin, 74, was convicted in four cases in his absence, although the statute of limitations has expired in one. Even after the court ruling, it is unclear how long Thaksin will stay in jail. The timing of his return, as his party assumes power, has led many to speculate that a backroom deal has been done to allow him leniency. Welcome back to Thailand daddy. My father has now arrived in Thailand safely and has entered the legal process, his daughter Paetongtarn wrote on Instagram, with a photo of Thaksin with his three children and seven grandchildren in the airports VIP lounge. Crimson supporters Thaksin began the day boarding a private jet in Singapore but he will end it in a Bangkok prison cell -- yet another dramatic shift in a switchback career that has included two election victories, defeat in a coup, criminal charges and long years of self-imposed exile. Thaksin said he was willing to face justice in order to return home and see his grandchildren -- though he has long maintained the criminal charges against him are politically motivated. I would like to request permission to return to live on Thai soil and share the air with my fellow Thai brothers and sisters, he posted Monday on Twitter, which has been rebranded as X. For all his long absence from the country, Thaksin remains Thailands most influential -- and controversial -- politician of modern times. Loved by the rural poor for policies including cheap healthcare and the minimum wage, he is reviled by the pro-military and royalist elite who saw his rule as corrupt, authoritarian and a threat to Thai social order. Parties linked to Thaksin have dominated elections since 2001 -- until this year, when the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP) won the most seats. Hundreds of Red Shirts waited through the night at the airport to welcome him with songs and banners -- most decked out in their usual crimson colours. I am a real Red Shirt -- whenever they want our support, I will always be there for them, Karuna Wantang, 70, a retired bureaucrat from Nongkai, in the countrys northeast, told AFP. I dont only like him but I love him. PM vote While Thaksin was being processed by the courts, his party formally nominated Srettha as its PM candidate in parliament, where a confirmation vote will be held around 3 pm. Pheu Thai was beaten into second place in Mays polls by the progressive MFP. But MFPs leader Pita Limjaroenrat saw his bid to become PM dashed on the rocks of bitter opposition from conservative junta-appointed senators spooked by his determination to reform royal insult laws and tackle business monopolies. Pheu Thai is confident of getting Srettha approved in a joint vote by both houses, after gaining another 40 seats for its coalition on Monday with the addition of the army-linked Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP). It takes their controversial grouping -- including military-backed United Thai Nation, the former party of 2014 coup-maker Prayut Chan-o-cha -- to 314 lower house seats. Following MFPs exclusion from the first coalition, Pheu Thais deals with army-linked parties have enraged some supporters who voted overwhelmingly against military-backed rule in May.

        "content": "The Colombo Lotus Tower Pvt. Ltd. has taken measures to establish educational viewing points at the towers observation deck, as a proactive measure to also prevent incidents of vandalism. The educational content displayed at the viewing points shows information including the location, directions and distance to some of Colombos iconic locales, which are visible from the top of the tower. Furthermore, this assists the visitors to be self-educated on which points they are looking at from the top of the tower, while promoting Colombos iconic locales. An official of the Colombo Lotus Tower Pvt. Ltd. mentioned that assistance was obtained from Police Special Task Force (STF) in order to identify the exact directions and location of the relevant locations. Some of the detailed sceneries displayed on the viewing point include the Colombo National Museum, Colombo Dockyard, Viharamahadevi Park, R. Premadasa International Stadium, Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela Oil Terminals and etc. In several flagrant displays of disregard for warnings, multiple incidents of vandalism and property damage by visitors were reported at the Colombo Lotus Tower recently. However, the officials who mention that a huge maintenance cost has been incurred as some people who visit the property continue to deface it by scribbling or carving out names or initials on it, also emphasize that it is the responsibility of the people to refrain from acts of vandalism and to protect this property built with public money.

        "date": "August 22, 2023 03:40 pm",
        "content": "Six children and two teachers are trapped in a gondola dangling 274 metres (900 feet) above a ravine in Pakistan after a cable snapped, with an extremely risky helicopter rescue mission being hampered by high winds, officials said on Tuesday. The children, who have been stranded since 7 a.m. time (0200 GMT), were using the gondola to get to school in a mountainous area in Battagram, about 200 km (125 miles) north of Islamabad, officials said. Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority said in a statement that a cable had broken in the lift service and two army helicopters had been dispatched for a rescue operation after attempts at fixing the fault had been unsuccessful. The gondola became stranded half way across a ravine and was dangling by a single cable after the other snapped, Shariq Riaz Khattak a rescue official at the site told Reuters. One child has fainted due to heat and fear, Khattak said. The rescue mission is complicated due to gusty winds in the area and the fact the helicopters rotor blades risk further destabilising the lift, he said. The military helicopters are both hovering near the stranded cable car, he added. One security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said special services troops, trained in sling operations, are involved in this extremely dangerous and risky operation. Sling operations are aerial operations where large loads are moved in geographically difficult terrains. All efforts are being made by Pakistan army to rescue the stranded people in the lift. People who live in the northern mountainous regions of Pakistan often use chair lifts for transport from one village to another. Abdul Nasir Khan, a local resident, said the children were going to a high school in Batangai in Alai. Pakistans caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar expressed concern in a post on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter. I have also directed the authorities to conduct safety inspections of all such private chair lifts and ensure that they are safe to operate and use, he said in a post. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 22, 2023 03:45 pm",
        "content": "Srettha Thavisin from the populist Pheu Thai party secured enough votes in parliament to become the countrys 30th prime minister Tuesday. While the vote was still ongoing, his supporters celebrated an end to months of post-election uncertainty in which the winning progressive Move Forward Party was blocked from taking power by conservative senators. Srettha, a real estate tycoon, will lead a coalition of 11 parties assembled by Pheu Thai that includes two pro-military parties affiliated with outgoing Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. Move Forward was excluded from the coalition. Critics called the new government a betrayal of the election results, but Pheu Thai leaders defended it as a necessity for ending the political deadlock and creating reconciliation. The vote came hours after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra began an eight-year prison sentence after returning from years of self-imposed exile. Many have speculated that the party embraced its former enemies in an effort to reduce or cancel Thaksins prison sentence, something the party denies. Source - AP News - Agencies",
