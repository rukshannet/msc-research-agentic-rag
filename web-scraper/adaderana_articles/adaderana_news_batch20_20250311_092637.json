        "date": "June 28, 2024 10:18 am",
        "content": "Former Member of Parliament Hirunika Premachandra has been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court. The former SJB parliamentarian was sentenced after being found guilty of being involved in the abduction of a youth in the Dematagoda area on December 21, 2015 using a Defender and his wrongful detention. The sentencing was delivered by Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja on Friday (28). Accordingly, Premachandra was found guilty of 18 charges and the court ordered that a fine of Rs. 20,000 be imposed for each charge. The order also stated that if the payment of the fines is defaulted, an additional 06 months imprisonment will be imposed for each charge. When the case was taken up, Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja declared in open court that the defendant was found guilty of conspiracy and aiding and abetting the abduction of a youth. Before the sentencing, Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara, who represented the plaintiff, recalled that the Colombo High Court had previously handed suspended prison sentences and imposed fines on eight supporters of the defendant who pleaded guilty before the court in connection with the abduction incident. Presidents Counsel Anura Maddegoda, who appeared for the defendant Hirunika Premachandra, informed the court that the defendant will file an appeal against this decision. Accordingly, former MP Hirunika Premachandra, who was sentenced to prison, is currently in the custody of prison officials. Premachandra had been accused of involvement in abducting, assaulting and wrongfully detaining the youth, identified as Amila Priyanka Amarasinghe, who had been employed at a shop in the Dematagoda area. The youth had revealed that while he was employed at a textile shop in the Dematagoda area in 2015, a female named Chamila Geethani often visited the shop, following which the two got involved in a relationship. It was subsequent to this incident that he was abducted by individuals who had arrived in a Defender, Amarasinghe had told the court. In 2017, seven persons identified as supporters of Premachandra pleaded guilty before the court, however, the former Parliamentarian did not plead guilty to any of the charges levelled against her.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has called for payment of compensation for 17 Sri Lankans killed in action in Russia, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Russia said on Thursday (27). The issue was a key focus during a high-level visit by a parliamentary delegation led by State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya, who held two days of discussions with Russian officials, including Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Rudenko and Deputy Minister of Defence Colonel General A. V. Fomin. The interactions centred on the 17 Sri Lankans killed in action, payment of compensation for the deceased and the wounded, the plight of the uncontactable Lankans, possibility of voluntary returns, early termination of contracts and regularisation of remuneration, it said in a statement. During the meeting, Sri Lanka has proposed to establish a joint working committee comprising of officials from the two sides to meet regularly to address issues and concerns of the Sri Lankans, who have been deployed. Both sides agreed to continue the engagements on the matters at hand. The delegation led by Minister Balasuriya included Members of Parliament Dayasiri Jayasekera and Gamini Waleboda, Secretary of the Ministry of Defence General G. D. H.

        "title": "Biden falters in fiery debate with Trump",
        "date": "June 28, 2024 11:56 am",
        "content": "A halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday to allay concerns he is too old for a second term in the White House in a fiery debate with Donald Trump marked by personal insults. A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was faltering as he spoke rapidly in a raspy, trailing-off voice, stumbled on his words and stared open-mouthed. His performance, after he spent the week secluded in preparation, sparked new concern within his Democratic Party as polls show Trump is tied or ahead for the November election. It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being historys worst. Trump and Biden, who were each the oldest president when first elected, even accused each other of being childlike as they argued over their golf swings. Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. There was no live audience and their microphones were muted as the other spoke. Biden hit Trump with clearly rehearsed lines as he sought to remind millions of television viewers that Trump would be the first convicted felon in the White House. You have the morals of an alley cat, Biden said. Trump, a veteran of rallies and reality television, spoke loudly as he ran through a long list of complaints about Bidens record. Im friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. Were no longer respected, Trump said. Trump sought to seize on Bidens delivery, saying at one point, I really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence. I dont think he knows what he said either. - Slow start - Stopping by a Waffle House restaurant to pick up food after the debate, Biden told reporters he had soar throat but I think we did well. The White House was clearly in damage-control mode. Vice President Kamala Harris, in a live interview on CNN, said Bidens record was extraordinarily strong but acknowledged concerns about his debate performance. Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish, Harris said. Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden communications director, said on CNN that it was a really disappointing evening for the president. I dont think there is any other way to slice it, she said. A CNN poll found 67 percent of debate watchers thought Trump had won. Democrats are set formally to name Biden as their candidate in August in Chicago, with little way to change course unless the president himself withdraws. But Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, said Bidens supporters would be extremely concerned. Biden fueled the basic perception that has continued to overshadow him, he said. At a watch party in San Francisco, Hazel Reitz said she would still vote for Biden but added: I cant understand a word that he says. Isnt it sad? - Personal attacks - Neither candidate laid out new policies, with most of the exchanges consisting of attacks on the others record. In one of the most personal moments, Biden cited accounts that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as suckers and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer. My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. Youre the sucker. Youre the loser, Biden said. Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent. On foreign policy, Trump accused Biden -- who faces a backlash from parts of his Democratic base over his support for Israel -- of not helping Israel finish the job against Hamas. He doesnt want to do it. Hes become like a Palestinian -- but they dont like him because hes a very bad Palestinian, hes a weak one, Trump said. Trump described Bidens withdrawal from Afghanistan as the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. Biden, however, noted that he was the first recent president who has not had soldiers at risk overseas. Trump and Biden also locked horns over abortion and immigration, key issues for their respective bases. Biden, attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs. Wade, the decision that allowed abortion rights around the country, said: Its been a terrible thing, what youve done. One candidate not on the stage was anti-establishment activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet CNNs threshold of reaching 15 percent in four national polls. Kennedy instead spent the 90 minutes taking questions on a live stream. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 28, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday. Metas regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers all options are on the table when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees. Theres a large number of channels that people can get news content from, Garlick told the inquiry. She said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links. The comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws. Meta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024. It now falls on Australias assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits. Australias two largest free-to-air television broadcasters, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, meanwhile said this week they were cutting jobs, citing loss of revenue once their deals with Meta expire. Asked on Friday if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Metas Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it. Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with, she said. Its just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if its fully enacted. Garlick defended Metas processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries. Asked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but there are a lot of challenges. How could Meta call itself an advertising business when some ads sell lies, asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads, Garlick replied. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The quake hit 8 kilometers (5 miles) west of Atiquipa, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) south of the capital Lima. Some residents of Atiquipa said on social media they felt a very strong and long quake that caused their beds to shake. CCTV footage from the nearby town of Caraveli shows a residential street as the tremor shakes violently and people come out of their houses. The quake was felt as far as the capital. Video posted to social media shows lamps swaying inside houses in Lima. Eight people have been injured in the incident, according to authorities. Of those, five received medical attention in two hospitals in the Ica region and three were treated for minor injuries at a hospital in the neighboring Arequipa region, both in southwestern Peru, the ministry of health said Friday morning. No deaths have been registered following the quake, according to Prime Minister, Gustavo Adrianzen. We are just finishing analyzing the preliminary reports which tell us that there are no deaths, and we are monitoring the impact on infrastructures, Adrianzen told radio RPP, according to Andina, the Peruvian news agency. The Peruvian Presidency said on X that the government is monitoring the situation and evaluating any possible damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) initially issued an alert warning of possible tsunami waves reaching up to 1 to 3 meters along some coastal areas in Peru. But it later dropped the alert, saying there was no tsunami warning, advisory or threat. There is no longer a tsunami threat from this earthquake, the PTWC said. Peru, and most of the South American Pacific Coast, are on border of two tectonic plates: the South American plate, which includes most of the continent, and the Nazca plate, which extends across the Pacific along most of the coast.

        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs and Presidents Counsel Ali Sabri, has stated that the successful debt sustainability process with bilateral creditors will provide Sri Lanka with an advantage of approximately US  17 billion. The minister also stated that this situation will facilitate successful negotiations regarding international sovereign debts. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry revealed this addressing the Media briefing yesterday (28) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. The Minister further commented, On April 12, 2022, Sri Lanka decided to temporarily suspend the payment of a portion of its foreign debt. At that time, some parties predicted that the value of the rupee would surge to 600, 700, or even 1000 against the dollar. However, we managed to control the situation. Following an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we were instructed to restructure the debt. Lazard was appointed as our financial advisor, and Clifford Chance as our legal advisor for this process. Initially, we focused on restructuring domestic debt while continuing to meet our obligations to multilateral organizations. We have now successfully completed debt restructuring with bilateral creditor countries. India, Japan, and France formed an Official Creditor Committee (OCC) for managing bilateral debt and we also held talks with China. As a result of these efforts, Sri Lanka has achieved a sustainable debt repayment situation, gaining an advantage of approximately US  17 billion and numerous other benefits. Furthermore, this achievement is expected to facilitate successful negotiations with international sovereign bond holders. Discussions on this matter are currently on-going. Additionally, its important to note that the comprehensive debt restructuring must adhere to a specific timeline set by the International Monetary Fund. The total debt burden should be reduced to 95 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the current interest payments on foreign loans should be limited to 4.5 of the GDP. Source: PMD",

        "date": "June 29, 2024 11:00 am",
        "content": "Blue suede shoes worn by Elvis Presley have sold for 120,000 at auction. The singer, known as the king of rock and roll, wore the pair on and off stage during the 1950s, including during an appearance on the Steve Allen television show. They were sold by auctioneers Henry Aldridge  Son in Devizes, at a hammer price of 95,000, rising to 120,000 with fees and VAT. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: They are as iconic as they can be. Blue suede shoes, hound dog, these are things that you think of immediately when you talk about Elvis Presley, they almost transcend popular culture, added Mr Aldridge. They the shoes are just an exceptional piece of showbusiness, music and popular culture memorabilia. The shoes, size 10.5, were given to Alan Portas, a friend of Elvis, after the singer was called up to join the US Army. Mr Aldridge said: When Elvis was called up for the American Army he had a get-together at Graceland. He called some of the guests upstairs and gave away some of the clothes he didnt think hed need or want when he came back from the army. The legendary singer bought the shoes, which have been displayed in various museums over the years, after performing Blue Suede Shoes by Carl Perkins on his debut album, Elvis Presley. Mr Aldridge said the shoes had been verified by Jimmy Velvet, a close friend of Presley and a leading authority on the singer. Last year, the auction house sold a mink coat owned by the singer for 128,000 to a US collector. Also auctioned on Friday was a two-piece suit worn by Queens Freddie Mercury, fetching 47,000. The suit, alongside a pair of black velvet Churchs Crown loafers, was worn during the Im Going Slightly Mad music video, months before the Queen lead singer died in 1991. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "War and funding shortfalls have hampered progress toward the United Nations flagship development goals which include action to combat climate change, the organizations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Friday. In 2015, UN member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, 17 targets to transform the world by 2030 including by completely ending extreme poverty and eliminating hunger. But Guterres said Friday that the world is getting a failing grade. Our failure to secure peace, to confront climate change, and to boost international finance is undermining development, he told a briefing in New York, unveiling the latest progress check on the targets. We must accelerate action for the sustainable development goals, and we dont have a moment to lose  only 17 percent of the targets (are) on track. Efforts to devote money and attention to the goals have been repeatedly set back, including by the Covid-19 pandemic, the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, worsening climate catastrophes and sharp increases in the cost of living. While countries were lagging on progress in many areas, there were glimmers of hope in the reduction of new HIV infections, growing Internet access, and the booming use of renewables, Guterres said. But the denial of basic needs for so many is outrageous and inexcusable, he said. Guterres said action to bring peace to the major conflicts raging globally coupled with efforts toward a green transition were needed. It means multiplying the lending capacity of multilateral development banks to provide more resources for climate action and sustainable development, he added. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 29, 2024 12:39 pm",
        "content": "With fresh COVID-19 cases bubbling up in some parts of the country, health officials are setting course for a fall vaccination campaign. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended new shots for all Americans this fall. Officials acknowledged the need for shots is not as dire as it was only a few years ago. Most Americans have some degree of immunity from being infected, from past vaccinations or both. COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations last month were at about their lowest point since the pandemic first hit the United States in 2020. But immunity wanes, new coronavirus variants keep emerging and there are still hundreds of COVID-19-associated deaths and thousands of hospitalizations reported each week. Whats more, health officials have reported upticks this month in COVID-19-associated emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and a pronounced increase in positive test results in the southwestern U.S. Its not clear whether thats a sign of a coming summer wave  which has happened before  or just a blip, said Lauren Ancel Meyers of the University of Texas, who leads a research team that tracks COVID-19. Well have to see what happens in the coming weeks, she said. Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration  following the guidance of its own panel of expert advisers  told vaccine manufacturers to target the JN.1 version of the virus. But a week later, the FDA told manufacturers that if they could still switch, a better target might be an offshoot subtype called KP.2. At a Thursday meeting at the CDC in Atlanta, infectious disease experts unanimously recommended the updated vaccines for Americans age 6 months and older. The CDC director signed off on the recommendation later in the day. The shots are expected to become available in August and September. Health officials have told Americans to expect a yearly update to COVID-19 vaccines, just like they are recommended to get a new shot each fall to protect against the latest flu strains. But many Americans arent heeding the CDCs advice. As of last month, less than one-quarter of U.S. adults and 14 of children were up to date in their COVID shots. Surveys show shrinking percentages of Americans think COVID-19 is a major health threat to the U.S. population, and indicate that fewer doctors are urging patients to get updated vaccines. CDC officials on Thursday presented recent survey information in which about 23 of respondents said they would definitely get an updated COVID-19 shot this fall, but 33 said they definitely would not. Meanwhile, the CDCs Bridge Access Program  which has been paying for shots for uninsured U.S. adults  is expected to shut down in August because of discontinued funding. The program paid for nearly 1.5 million doses from September to last month. It is a challenge with this program going away, said the CDCs Shannon Stokley. About 1.2 million U.S. COVID-associated deaths have been reported since early 2020, according to the CDC. The toll was most intense in the winter of 2020-2021, when weekly deaths surpassed 20,000. About 1 out of every 100 Americans ages 75 and older were hospitalized with COVID in the last four years, CDC officials said Thursday. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

Ten Indian fishermen, arrested by Sri Lanka on June 24 for alleged illegal fishing, will face charges related to the death of a Sri Lankan Navy sailor who was killed during an operation to apprehend them, stated reports. Addressing a weekly press briefing on Friday, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, We have always attached the highest importance to the welfare of our fishermen who get caught abroad, and we have tried our best to bring them back. Further, the MEA said they are aware of the situation and have raised the issue with Sri Lankan authorities. On these ten fishermen, our high commission is aware of the matter. We are aware of the matter and we have taken up this issue with the Sri Lankan side. Hopefully, we will see how best to take it forward, said the MEA. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, MK Stalin, recently wrote a letter to Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar regarding the detention of Indian fishermen in Sri Lanka. In his letter directed to the EAM, Stalin said, The Sri Lankan Navy apprehended one mechanised fishing boat bearing registration number IND-TN-12-MM-5138 and ten fishermen from Nagapattinam Fishing Harbour on June 25, 2024. He underlined that in the year 2024 alone, 203 fishermen and 27 boats have been apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy. The frequent arrests of fishermen from Tamil Nadu by the Sri Lankan authorities have created an insecure atmosphere among the fishermen community, the Tamil Nadu CM had said. He requested Jaishankars immediate intervention to secure the release of 47 fishermen and 166 fishing boats currently in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. The Tamil Nadu CM requested the EAMs immediate intervention to convene the Joint Working Group to prevent further arrests and secure the release of all 47 fishermen and 166 fishing boats currently in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. Stalin said that such incidents disrupt the livelihood of the fishermen and instill a sense of fear and uncertainty in their entire community. The families of the fishermen had requested that the central and state governments take appropriate action to ensure the timely release of the fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. In response, Jaishankar said in his letter that the Indian High Commission in Colombo and the Consulate in Jaffna have been expeditiously and consistently taking up such cases for the early release of those detained. As of June 26, 34 Indian fishermen are under judicial remand in Sri Lanka, and six others are convicted and serving sentences in Sri Lankan jail. The Indian High Commission in Colombo and the Consulate in Jaffna have been expeditiously and consistently taking up such cases for the early release of those detained, Jaishankar wrote. Jaishankar assured Stalin that the efforts to address the interests of the Indian fishing community still continue. (ANI) --Agencies",

Below is the Full Statement by Minister Tiran Alles at the UN Chiefs of Police Summit: The threats to peace have become more diverse and complex than ever before. Violent conflicts have been on the rise during the last two decades. Protection of civilians has become a critical concern in many conflict-ridden areas with the humanitarian landscape becoming increasingly hostile with non-traditional threats. New Advanced technologies have opened new domains of security concerns, such as cyber security and autonomous weapon systems, together with the abuse of ICT for criminal purposes and the induction of mercenaries. Be that as it may, permit me the honor of congratulating the UN Peace operations that have effectively risen to meet the varying challenges in the theatres of conflict. In this backdrop, Sri Lanka appreciates the pit and substance of the Secretary Generals new agenda for peace. My delegation recalls with pride that Sri Lanka has been a committed contributor to UN Peacekeeping since the deployment of military observers at the end of the Suez War. More than 21,000 Sri Lankan peacekeepers have played an important role in many peacekeeping operations to date. I am confident that the Sri Lanka-formed police unit, which is at Readiness Level 3, stands by with the capacity to handle the emerging security landscape. Organized crime, gang violence and illicit economies are rapidly on the rise. This is becoming a growing challenge to international peace. It is therefore imperative that the United Nations consider deploying specialized police teams with experience and skills to counter this menace.

It said the accident took place in Saser Brangsa near the Line of Actual Control that divides India and China in the Ladakh region. Defense Minister Rajnath Singh called it an unfortunate accident.

The Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a standoff in Ladakh since May 2020, when they clashed along their land border in the region, with 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed. The skirmish turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel. New Delhi and Beijing have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve their worst military conflict in decades.

        "date": "June 30, 2024 08:18 am",
        "content": "India legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have retired from T20 internationals following their World Cup triumph in Barbados. Kohli was man of the match for his 76 and Rohit became the first India captain to lift a World Cup since 2011 following the captivating seven-run defeat of South Africa. Rohit, 37, and 35-year-old Kohli are number one and two respectively on the all-time list of T20 international run-scorers. Ive loved every moment of this, said Rohit. I started my India career playing this format. This is what I wanted. I wanted to win the cup and say thank you. On former captain Kohli, Rohit said: Hes been a champion player without a doubt. We all know what he has done for us. At some point everyone has to say goodbye to the game and Virat was very clear that this is what he wanted to do. Both men will continue to be available for India in Tests and one-day internationals. Kohli had endured a difficult World Cup, with only 75 runs in seven innings before his important knock in the final lifted India to 176-7. South Africa needed only 30 runs from the final five overs, but they wilted in the face of some superb India death bowling, and Suryakumar Yadavs all-time great catch to remove David Miller in the 20th over effectively sealed the match. Clearly emotional on receiving his player-of-the-match award, Kohli said: This is my last T20 game playing for India, my last World Cup I was going to play. I wanted to make the most of it. And this was our aim. We wanted to lift the cup. Im really grateful I was able to get the job done for the team when it mattered the most. Kohli ends with 4,188 runs from 125 T20 internationals, just behind Rohits tally of 4,231. Rohits 159 caps is also the most for any man and his five centuries is also a record, shared with Australias Glenn Maxwell. Rohit and Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan are the only men to feature in every T20 World Cup, the first edition of which was held in 2007, which India won. Indias last World Cup success in any format came in the 50-over version in 2011. They have lost two finals in the past year: the World Test Championship final to Australia at The Oval last summer, then the 50-over final on home soil in Ahmedabad to the same opponents in November. It was very emotional, I wanted this badly, said Rohit. I was very desperate for this in my life so Im happy we crossed the line this time. This has to be the greatest time, only because how of desperately I wanted to win this. All the runs that Ive scored in all these years, it does matter, but Im not big on stats and all of that. Winning games for India, winning trophies for India, that is what I look forward to all the time. BBC",

Meanwhile, the two fishermen who are critically ill have been taken aboard a Singaporean merchant vessel and emergency treatment is being provided, the navy spokesman said. The Singaporean vessel is expected to transfer the two fishermen to SLNS Vijayabahu at sea, he said. The Director General of the Department of Fisheries  Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatta, stated yesterday that the crew of the fishing boat named Devon 5, which had set out to sea from the Tangalle fisheries harbor, have faced this predicament after they had found several bottles containing an unknown liquid floating in the sea and consumed some of it assuming that it was alcohol. He said medical teams had provided instructions for emergency first aid via communications devices and that there was insufficient time to send another vessel out to sea to retrieve them as they are in the deep-sea area. He said that attempts were being made to board them into a nearby vessel and bring them ashore. Kahawatta stated that according to the information received thus far, the fishermen in question had found several bottles floating in the sea and that they have distributed a portion of the bottles to nearby fishing trawlers. He said steps are being taken to notify these other boats. Initially, it was reported yesterday that two out of the six crew members of a fishing vessel that set out from Tangalle have died, and the remaining four are in critical condition after consuming the contents of a bottle they found floating in the sea, assuming it was liquor. The incident has reportedly occurred while the boat was around 320 nautical miles (592.64 km) off the coast of Sri Lanka.

        "content": "At least 18 people were killed and 19 seriously wounded in a string of suicide attacks in northeastern Nigeria on Saturday, emergency services said. In one of three blasts in the town of Gwoza, a female attacker with a baby strapped to her back detonated explosives in the middle of a wedding ceremony, according to a police spokesman. The other attacks in the border town across from Cameroon targeted a hospital and a funeral for victims of the earlier wedding blast, authorities said. At least 18 people were killed and 42 others injured in the attacks, according to the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA). So far, 18 deaths comprising children, men, females and pregnant women have been reported, said Barkindo Saidu, the head of the agency, in a report seen by AFP. Nineteen seriously injured people were taken to the regional capital Maiduguri, while 23 others were awaiting evacuation, Saidu said in the report. A member of a militia assisting the military in Gwoza said two of his comrades and a soldier were also killed in another attack on a security post, though authorities did not immediately confirm this toll. Boko Haram militants seized Gwoza in 2014 when the group took over swathes of territory in northern Borno. The town was taken back by the Nigerian military with help from Chadian forces in 2015 but the group has since continued to launch attacks from mountains near the town. Boko Haram has carried out raids, killing men and kidnapping women who venture outside the town in search of firewood and acacia fruits. The violence has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around two million in Nigerias northeast. The conflict has spread to neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Chad, prompting the formation of a regional military coalition to fight the militants. Source: AFP --Agencies",

The operation kicked off following a crucial intelligence tip-off, resulting in the arrest of a shop-owner and his staff, allegedly part of the criminal enterprise. According to Principal Commissioner R Srinivasa Naik, the investigation began when customs officials flagged a sales executive at the Airhub shop for suspicious behavior. Upon personal search, three bundles of gold concealed in his body were discovered, which he had reportedly received from a transit passenger. Further inquiries revealed that the smugglers, all hailing from Sri Lanka, had rented the Airhub shop, employing eight individuals to receive contraband from transit passengers and smuggle it out of the airport under this sophisticated operation. Using this modus operandi, they managed to smuggle 267 kg of gold over two months, stated the official release. The implicated Sri Lankan national, the shop-owner, and staff members have been arrested and placed in judicial custody as the investigation continues. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "June 30, 2024 03:55 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe declared a Rs.25 million allocation for the restoration of tanks in the Divisional Secretariat Division, which issues the highest number of deeds under the Urumaya freehold land deeds program. He highlighted that these efforts are geared towards supporting farmers and advancing the countrys development, the Presidents Media Division said. The President made these remarks while addressing the symbolic ceremony for the distribution of freehold land deeds to the beneficiaries in 11 divisional secretariat divisions of Monaragala district under the Urumaya national program, which provides 02 million freehold land deeds. The ceremony took place at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Conference Hall in Wellawaya today (30), where approximately 600 out of 41,960 beneficiaries received their deeds. Continuing, the President noted that Wellassa, once a supplier of rice to the Kingdom of Kandy, was devastated after the 1818 battle. He highlighted that despite various governments efforts to develop the area, land rights remained elusive for its people. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also outlined plans for the extensive agricultural development of Udawalawa, Monaragala, Ampara, and the Mahaweli C Zone in the dry zone. During his visit to grant land deeds in Monaragala district, the President interacted with the residents, engaging them in friendly conversations while gathering information from them. The President further elaborated; According to the speakers preceding me, the Wellassa area supplied the rice required by the Kingdom of Kandy. However, after the 1818 battle, Wellassa was completely devastated, causing its inhabitants to relocate to other areas. Subsequently, the Monaragala district was established in 1960. When I first visited this area after the 1977 elections, it was severely underdeveloped. Since 1977, various governments have initiated development projects in the Monaragala district. People from surrounding provinces settled here, new houses were constructed, and the area gradually urbanized. Through the hard work of its people, Monaragala evolved into an agricultural hub. This area stands as a testament to the efforts of your ancestors, yet the residents lacked proper land rights. The contributions of Monaragala farmers to the country were historically overlooked. To express gratitude, we have now ensured that these farmers receive free land rights. We are delighted to make this contribution. To foster the development of the Monaragala district, we advocated for the provision of free land rights, despite opposition and legal challenges. Today, we have successfully granted these rights to the people. However, securing land rights alone is insufficient. It is crucial for everyone to participate in the governments agricultural modernization program. By rapidly advancing agriculture in these areas, we aim to transition towards an export-oriented economy. Essential infrastructure, including ports and airports, is already in place in these areas. Our vision is to transform Udawalawa, Monaragala, Ampara, and the Mahaweli C Zone into a major agricultural hub within the dry zone. Through the Urumaya program, we not only provide land rights to farmers but also equip them with tools to increase their incomes. Looking ahead, the global demand for food is expected to grow significantly in the next 30 to 40 years. It is imperative that we prepare to meet this challenge by establishing a comprehensive agricultural framework in these provinces. Additionally, we have strategized to establish large investment zones in Hambantota and Monaragala districts. Efforts are also underway to enhance the tourism and fishing industries, spanning from Galle to Ampara. These initiatives are slated for implementation over the next 20-30 years, ensuring a legacy for future generations. The development program has significantly boosted Wellawaya, serving as a pivotal access point to the upcountry. This progress extends through Passara via Ella and Bibila. To streamline the issuance of Urumaya freehold land deeds, measures have been taken to recruit necessary personnel. However, it is imperative to accelerate this program. The list of eligible recipients is available at each Divisional Secretariat Division. I urge all Divisional Secretariats to promptly summon beneficiaries to address any issues and expedite the distribution of these deeds. The Chairman of the Regional Development Committee is encouraged to collaborate with the Divisional Secretary in overseeing these tasks, ensuring their completion by the end of this month. I am actively pursuing funding of Rs.25 million for the restoration of tanks within the divisional secretariat that issues the highest number of freehold land deeds. It is crucial to note that the recipients of these land deeds will benefit significantly from both of these programs. We invite everyone to embark on a new journey with these land rights, fostering a fresh start in life. PMD",

I vividly recall spending the Sinhala New Year 2022 in Kamburupitiya, where a filling station near my hotel was constantly crowded with long queues of vehicles. Witnessing the peoples suffering and frustration, I resolved that such scenes must not recur in our country. Prior discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and exchanges with the World Bank underscored the urgency. Despite multiple notifications to former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, ultimately, I had to assume leadership of the country. I took charge of the country in an unprecedented manner in world history. When everyone else fled, I stepped up to lead. Constitutionally, when the President resigns and the ruling party fails to act, it falls upon the opposition to step in. Yet, everyone evaded responsibility. Our economic and political systems were shattered. Assuming the presidency, many doubted our ability to succeed. However, I maintained strong faith in the people of our country and myself. With aid from countries like India and Bangladesh, and by encouraging farmers to ensure a successful 2022-2023 Yala season, we achieved a bountiful harvest. This enabled our nation to celebrate the Sinhala New Year, Vesak Festival, and Poson Festival with great splendour. Additionally, the people of the south played a crucial role in boosting tourism and attracting visitors to our country, thereby securing vital foreign exchange. With the united support of these efforts, we propelled our country forward. We have partnered with the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the countrys economy, which means we cannot resort to printing money or taking loans from banks. This compelled us to explore new avenues for generating income, albeit making the tough decision to increase taxes. Today, as a result, our economy has stabilized, and we aim to relieve the common people from this tax burden in the future. In 2023, we launched the Aswesuma program that significantly benefited the people, providing triple benefits compared to previous efforts like Samurdhi. The number of beneficiaries increased from 1.6 million to 2.4 million. During the economic crisis, we achieved what was previously thought impossible. During the Sinhala New Year, each low-income family received 10 kilograms of rice monthly for two months, and government employees saw a Rs. 10,000 salary increase. Moreover, the Urumaya program was initiated to grant freehold land deeds to all occupants of government lands. In the upcoming week, a program will begin to grant ownership of apartments in Colombo to low-income residents. We undertook these efforts quietly but with significant benefits for the people. Moving forward, we have successfully steered clear of bankruptcy and continue to manage our debt responsibly. Through negotiations, we have secured concessions where our total debt, currently at 108 of GDP, will be restructured. Countries that provided loans have agreed to extend our repayment deadline until 2042 and have reduced the amounts due. In addition to official loans, we have also borrowed from private individuals through bonds. Following the agreement, discussions with bondholders representatives are progressing well. Initially estimated to take about a month, these negotiations are proceeding smoothly, and we anticipate completing them successfully by next week. We plan to present both agreements to Parliament for approval. I have informed the Chairman of the State Finance Committee Harsha De Silva about our intention to present all three agreements to Parliament for discussion. While I cant detail all aspects here, I plan to provide a thorough explanation. I have informed him that following discussions and scrutiny by the State Finance Committee, we will prepare a report for a parliamentary vote. It is crucial for all parties in Parliament to participate in this vote. The international community awaits our decision on these agreements. If any party proposes an alternative approach, I am willing to facilitate discussions with the International Monetary Fund for them. The government is willing to make arrangements to fund necessary travel permits and accommodation for these discussions. They can proceed with their talks, and if deemed beneficial, we will bring the matter to Parliament for consideration. We can no longer afford to revert to old politics. The choices we make today profoundly impact our future. Moving away from this path begs the question: do we have an alternative future? Can we afford to return to the days of long queues and traditional politics? We must decisively choose our course. Looking ahead, how will we sustain future fuel payments? Will borrowing become inevitable once more? Without embracing a new program, we risk facing a more severe economic crisis within the next 15 years. Therefore, transitioning to an export-driven economy is imperative. These decisions are made with everyones interests in mind. We must determine whether our youth will inherit recurring economic crises or thrive in a developed nation. That is why I urge every political leader to unite for the country. People often ask which party this cabinet belongs to, but today we have individuals who have come together solely for the country. Many former members of the SLPP have lost their ministerial positions, and although I cannot accommodate them currently, they have set aside personal interests to unite for the nation. Representatives from various parties are present here today; this is not about one party but about everyone uniting for the countrys benefit. Thus, we embark on a new political journey with the motto: country first, party second. Regardless of their political affiliations, everyone here is part of a team capable of working for our nation. Its crucial to sustain this political system and protect this journey together. I extend an invitation to the opposition to join us on this new path, where they can learn alongside us how to build our country. Today, our focus is not on individual interests or party politics; we prioritize the countrys interests as we move forward. I empathize deeply with the hardships faced by our people, and I request that everyone safeguard the strides we have made and continue advancing together. --PMD",

        "date": "July 1, 2024 10:08 am",
        "content": "Irans elections are not free and fair, the US State Department told Iran International on Sunday, in its first comments on the results of Fridays votes that led to a runoff between a moderate and a hardline candidate. The June 28 presidential election marked the lowest voter turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic, with only 39.92 percent participation. This breaks the previous record set during the last election, in which the late President Ebrahim Raisi won with a turnout of 48 percent. The elections in Iran are not free and fair, a State Department spokesperson said. Unfortunately, we have no expectation that these elections, whatever the outcome, will lead to fundamental change in Irans direction or more respect by the Iranian regime for the human rights of Irans citizens, the spokesperson added, as the Iranian government prepares for a runoff presidential election slated for July 5. Biden administrations Acting Special Envoy for Iran Abram Paley said two days before the Iranian elections that and candidates are handpicked by the Guardian Council, and voters lack access to the most basic freedoms; necessary features of any democracy. In the face of the authoritarian regimes long history of harassing and intimidating journalists, suppressing election coverage, and denying freedom of peaceful of assembly, we support the Iranian people, he said on his X account. Iranian candidates are vetted before they can stand for election. The 12-member Guardian Council, whose members are appointed or recommended by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, disqualifies anyone deemed insufficiently loyal to the system. The vetting process leaves voters with no real choice. Many Iranians seem indifferent to the vetting process itself, having lost faith in the systems willingness or ability to change through elections. Activists and officials have highlighted that the low turnout in Irans June 28 votes is a clear sign of the publics discontent with the ruling autocracy, demonstrated through the widespread boycott of the election. In 2021, voter turnout was 48 percent, the lowest for any presidential election in Irans history. This year, turnout has dropped further to less than 40 percent, marking an unprecedented trend since the Islamic Republics establishment in 1979. Additionally, the 2021 election saw the highest percentage of void and blank votes ever recorded, accounting for 13 percent of all ballots cast. The record-low voter turnout is a significant blow to Irans Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, who had repeatedly called for a high turnout in the election. We place great importance on high participation because the most significant effect of high participation is the honor of the Islamic Republic, Khamenei stated in a speech on Tuesday, calling high voter turnout crucial for the Islamic Republics survival. While the official voter turnout of 39.92 announced by Irans Interior Ministry is already a stark indicator of voter apathy among the population, many Iranians are now expressing suspicions that the Islamic Republic might be inflating these already low turnout figures. A recent analysis by United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) said that a covert arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) has been rigging elections and manipulating Irans political landscape through a clandestine network of cultural and political operations. Known as the Baqiatallah Headquarters, this apparatus works closely with the Intelligence Ministry to strategically influence the current snap election to replace former President Ebrahim Raisi, the NGO reports.

        "content": "A man in his 30s has been killed and several others wounded in a shooting at a Turkish wedding in north-east France, police have said. French media report that three armed, hooded men arrived at the reception venue in Thionville late on Saturday night before opening fire on guests. Quoting police sources, Le Figaro newspaper says the attackers came at 01:15am local time to settle scores between well-known gangs in Moselle. A pregnant woman was among the wounded, police said, and three of the injured are reportedly in a critical condition at the Bel-Air hospital nearby. Around 100 people were celebrating at Eden Palace when the gunmen arrived at the event in a 4x4 car, according to French media, in the region of Lorraine near the borders of Germany and Luxembourg. At a quarter past one in the morning, a group of people went outside to smoke in front of the hall, and then three heavily-armed men opened fire in their direction, a police source was quoted by AFP. The men reportedly used automatic weapons and shotguns. In a statement, prosecutor Nancy Francois Capin-Dulhoste said the men had fired several dozen times, adding four people had been hit by the bullets. The victims are said to be between 25 and 50 years old. When the emergency services arrived, the attackers had already fled the scene. Local newspaper Le Républicain Lorrain reports that police are investigating whether the vehicle came from Germany or Luxembourg - about 15km (9.3 miles) away. The border region of Lorraine has often seen violent incidents linked to drug trafficking. According to Le Parisien, the dead and the injured are known to the authorities for drug-related cases. In May 2023, in the neighbouring town of Villerupt, a shooting between rival gangs left five people injured. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The relevant appeal has been handed over to the Colombo High Court to forward it to the Court of Appeal, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, Premachandras lawyers have also filed a bail application before the Colombo High Court requesting to release her on bail, since an appeal has been filed against the relevant verdict. The bail application has been fixed for consideration before the Colombo High Court judge Amal Ranaraja on July 04, 2024, according to Ada Derana reporter.

The sentencing was delivered by Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja on Friday (28). Accordingly, Premachandra was found guilty of 18 charges and the court ordered that a fine of Rs. 20,000 be imposed for each charge. The order also stated that if the payment of the fines is defaulted, an additional 06 months imprisonment will be imposed for each charge.

        "date": "July 1, 2024 04:06 pm",
        "content": "Australia said on Monday it had more than doubled the visa fee for international students, the latest move by the government to rein in record migration that has intensified pressure on an already tight housing market. From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to A1,600 (1,068) from A710, while visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas are banned from applying onshore for a student visa. The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia, Home Affairs Minister Clare ONeil said in a statement. Official data released in March showed net immigration rose 60 to a record 548,800 people in the year to Sept. 30, 2023. The rise in fees makes applying for a student visa for Australia far more expensive than in competing countries like the U.S. and Canada, where they cost about 185 and C150 (110) respectively. The government said it was also closing loopholes in visa rules that allowed foreign students to continuously extend their stay in Australia, after the number of students on a second or subsequent student visa spiked by over 30 to more than 150,000 in 202223. The latest move follows a raft of actions since late last year to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 curbs in 2022 boosted annual migration to record levels. English language requirements were tightened in March, while the amount of savings international students need to get a visa was raised in May to A29,710 (19,823) from A24,505, the second increase in about seven months. Universities Australia CEO Luke Sheehy said the governments continued policy pressure on the sector would put the countrys position of strength at risk. This is not good for our economy or our universities, both of which rely heavily on international student fees, Sheehy said in an emailed response. International education is one of Australias largest export industries and was worth A36.4 billion to the economy in the 2022-2023 financial year.

        "title": "Palestinian militants fire rockets into Israel, tanks advance in Gaza",
        "date": "July 1, 2024 07:19 pm",
        "content": "The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to the crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people. The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it. Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member. In some parts of Gaza, militants continue to stage attacks on Israeli forces in areas that the army had left months ago. Israeli tanks deepened incursions into the Shejaia suburb of eastern Gaza City for a fifth day, and tanks advanced further in western and central Rafah, in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt, residents said. The Israeli military said it had killed a number of militants in combat in Shejaia on Monday and found large amounts of weapons there. Hamas, the militant Islamist group that governs Gaza, said its fighters had lured an Israeli force into a booby-trapped house in the east of Rafah and blown it up, causing casualties. The Israeli military announced the death of a soldier in southern Gaza without providing details. Israels Army Radio said the soldier was killed in Rafah in a booby-trapped house - a possible reference to the incident reported by Islamic Jihad. Also in Rafah, the Israeli military said that an airstrike killed a militant who fired an anti-tank missile at its troops. Israel has signalled that its operation in Rafah, meant to stamp out Hamas, will soon be concluded. After the intense phase of the war is over, its forces will focus on smaller scale operations meant to stop Hamas reassembling, officials say. The war began when Hamas-led fighters burst into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages, including civilians and soldiers, back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. The offensive launched by Israel in retaliation has killed nearly 38,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the heavily built-up coastal enclave in ruins. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of the dead are civilians. Israel says 317 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza and that at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters. CEASEFIRE EFFORTS STALLED Arab mediators efforts to secure a ceasefire, backed by the United States, have stalled. Hamas says any deal must end the war and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas is eradicated. Israeli authorities released 54 Palestinians it had detained during the war, Palestinian border officials said. Among them was Mohammad Abu Selmeyah, the director of Al Shifa Hospital, arrested by the military when its forces first stormed the medical facility in November. Israel said Hamas had been using the hospital for military purposes. The military has released the hospitals CCTV footage from Oct. 7 showing gunmen and hostages on the premises and has taken journalists into a tunnel found at the complex. Hamas has denied using hospitals for military purposes. Abu Selmeyah rejected the allegations on Monday and said detainees had been abused during their detention, including being deprived of food and medicine, and that some had died. I was subjected to severe torture, my little finger was broken, and I was beaten in the head until blood came out, more than once, Abu Selmeyah told a press conference at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Israel in May said it was investigating the deaths of Palestinians captured during the war as well as a military-run detention camp where released detainees and rights groups have alleged abuse of inmates. The military did not immediately comment on Abu Selmeyahs remarks. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "US Supreme Court rules Trump has immunity for official, not private acts",
        "date": "July 1, 2024 09:19 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court found on Monday that Donald Trump cannot be prosecuted for official actions taken as president, but can for private acts, in a landmark ruling recognizing for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution. The justices, in a 6-3 ruling written by Chief Justice John Roberts, threw out a lower courts decision rejecting Trumps claim of immunity from criminal charges involving his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The six conservative justices were in the majority. Its three liberals dissented. We conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office, Roberts wrote. At least with respect to the presidents exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity, Roberts added. Trump hailed the ruling in a social media post, writing: BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN! Roberts said Trumps case will be sent back to the lower courts for further review. The Supreme Courts slow handling of the blockbuster case already had helped Trump by making it unlikely that any trial on these charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith could be completed before the election. The court analyzed four categories of conduct contained in Trumps indictment: his discussions with Justice Department officials following the 2020 election, his alleged pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to block certification of Bidens election win, his alleged role in assembling fake pro-Trump electors and his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court found Trump was absolutely immune for conversations with Justice Department officials but returned the case to lower courts to determine whether Trump has immunity for the other three categories. The ruling marked the first time since the nations 18th century founding that the Supreme Court has declared that former presidents may be shielded from criminal charges in any instance. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election in a 2020 rematch. The decision came in Trumps appeal of a lower court ruling rejecting his immunity claim. The court decided the case on the last day of its term. Trump, 78, is the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted as well as the first former president convicted of a crime. Smiths election subversion charges embody one of the four criminal cases Trump has faced. MISGUIDED WISDOM Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivered a sharply worded dissent, saying the ruling makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law. Sotomayor added: Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for bold and unhesitating action by the president, the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more. Sotomayor said the ruling reshapes the institution of the presidency. Trump had argued that he is immune from prosecution because he was serving as president when he took the actions that led to the charges. Smith had opposed presidential immunity from prosecution based on the principle that no one is above the law. Rick Hasen, a professor of law at the UCLA School of Law and a critic of Trumps efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, said: The Supreme Court has put out a fact-intensive test on the boundaries of the presidents immunity - with a huge thumb on the scale favoring the presidents immunity - in a way that will surely push this case past the election. During April 25 arguments in the case, Trumps legal team urged the justices to fully shield former presidents from criminal charges - absolute immunity - for official acts taken in office. Without immunity, Trumps lawyer said, sitting presidents would face blackmail and extortion by political rivals due to the threat of future prosecution. The courts conservative majority includes three justices Trump appointed. In the special counsels August 2023 indictment, Trump was charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote. He has pleaded not guilty. Trumps trial had been scheduled to start on March 4 before the delays over the immunity issue. Now, no trial date is set. Trump made his immunity claim to the trial judge in October, meaning the issue has been litigated for about nine months. In a separate case brought in New York state court, Trump was found guilty by a jury in Manhattan on May 30 on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal before the 2016 election. Trump also faces criminal charges in two other cases. He has pleaded not guilty in those and called all the cases against him politically motivated. A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment on Mondays ruling. A lawyer for his office told the Supreme Court during arguments that the absolute immunity sought by Trump would shield presidents from criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder and, as in this case, trying to overturn the proper results of an election and stay in power. During the arguments, justices asked hypothetical questions involving a president selling nuclear secrets, taking a bribe or ordering a coup or political assassination. If such actions were official conduct, Trumps lawyer argued, a former president could be charged only if first impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate - something that has never happened in U.S. history. In a May ReutersIpsos poll, opens new tab, just 27 of respondents - 9 of Democrats, 50 of Republicans and 29 of independents - agreed that presidents should be immune from prosecution unless they have first been impeached and convicted by Congress. A PLODDING TIMELINE Smith, seeking to avoid trial delays, had asked the justices in December to perform a fast-track review after Trumps immunity claim was rejected by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that month. Trump opposed the bid. Rather than resolve the matter promptly, the justices denied Smiths request and let the case proceed in a lower court, which upheld Chutkans ruling against Trump on Feb. 6. The immunity ruling comes 20 weeks after Trump on Feb. 12 sought relief from the Supreme Court. By contrast, it took the court less than nine weeks in another major case to reinstate Trump to the presidential primary ballot in Colorado after he appealed a lower courts ruling that had disqualified him for engaging in an insurrection by inciting and supporting the attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. The timeline of the courts immunity ruling likely does not leave enough time for Smith to try Trump on federal election subversion charges and for a jury to reach a verdict before voters head to the polls. Trump took numerous steps to try to reverse his 2020 loss to Biden. Federal prosecutors have accused Trump of pressuring government officials to overturn the election results and encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to push Congress not to certify Bidens victory, based on false claims of widespread voting fraud. Trump supporters attacked police and stormed the Capitol, sending lawmakers and others fleeing. Trump and his allies also are accused of devising a plan to use false electors from key states to thwart certification. Not since its landmark Bush v. Gore decision, which handed the disputed 2000 U.S. election to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore, has the Supreme Court played such an integral role in a presidential race. Trump also faces election subversion charges in state court in Georgia and federal charges in Florida brought by Smith relating to keeping classified documents after leaving office. If Trump regains the presidency, he could try to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 2, 2024 10:49 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that Sri Lanka is among the first middle-income countries to utilize the new debt sustainability analysis framework, introduced specifically for middle-income nations, to undertake debt restructuring. Delivering a special statement in Parliament today (02), the President further stated that Sri Lankas foreign debt totals USD 37 billion. He mentioned that this includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral debt, USD 11.7 billion in multilateral debt, USD 14.7 billion in commercial debt and USD 12.5 billion in sovereign bonds. In his special statement, President Wickremesinghe also announced to the Parliament that that an agreement was reached on June 26th with Sri Lankas official creditors concerning debt repayment. Wickremesinghe said that authorized Cabinet officials have signed these agreements on behalf of Sri Lanka. Highlighting the specific details of the agreements reached with the official creditor committee co-chaired by India, Japan and France and China Exim Bank on debt restructuring, the President noted that the agreements include a grace period for principal repayment extended until 2028. He further pointed out that the interest rates have been maintained at or below 2.1 and a full debt repayment grace period was extended until 2043. Additionally, the Head of the State noted that based on the agreements reached on debt restructuring, the repayment of the principal loan amount can be incrementally increased, thereby deferring debt servicing costs. Consequently, the President mentioned that Sri Lanka will have remaining debt service of USD 5 billion. Following is the full statement delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament: Honourable Speaker, Last week, we were able to achieve another significant milestone in the challenging journey of restoring economic stability to a country that defaulted on its debts in 2022. On June 26, we reached an agreement with our official creditors regarding the repayment of the loan. Representing our country, officials authorized by the Cabinet signed these agreements and contracts. That same night, I addressed the nation through electronic media to share these developments. From the beginning of this arduous journey to rebuild the economy, I have consistently presented updates to Parliament. Initially, we outlined our plans before Parliament, and subsequently, we reported on the progress we have made. Therefore, I would like to present the information about the current situation to the Parliament today. Honourable Speaker, About two years ago, after accepting the challenge of restructuring the countrys economy, I presented our four-step work plan to this Parliament: 1. Obtain extended credit facilities in consultation with the International Monetary Fund and establish financial discipline in the country. 2. Collaborate with international financial and legal experts Lazard and Clifford Chance to prepare the debt stabilization plan in coordination with the IMF and reach an agreement with the creditors. 3. Establish policies, rules, and programs to secure foreign investment, strengthen the export economy, and create a digital green economy. Prepare and present the necessary reforms to promote the countrys economy. 4. Achieve developed country status through a debt-free economy by 2048 through this program. Since then, we have embarked on a challenging journey, knowing that success was achievable step by step. We forged ahead step by step. The 2023 and 2024 budgets further strengthened our program. By March 2023, we secured approval for the IMF Extended Credit Facility and received the first instalment on March 20, 2023. Following a review of our progress, we received the second instalment on December 12, 2023, and the third instalment on June 12, 2024. From the start of the IMF program, we initiated discussions on debt restructuring, continuing to rely on the expertise of international organizations Lazard and Clifford Chance. Our foreign debt amounts to USD 37 billion, comprising USD 10.6 billion in bilateral debt, USD 11.7 billion in multilateral debt, and USD14.7 billion in commercial loans, including USD 12.5 billion in sovereign bonds. There are various opinions expressed inside and outside this council regarding debt write-off, loan grace periods, extension of repayment periods, restructuring, and related matters. Some of these opinions are not true, and some are half-truths. Therefore, I would like to clarify the international practices and facts of debt restructuring at this time. What constitutes this foreign loan? Where do lending countries get the money? They lend us the tax money and the savings of their citizens. Many people in our country suggest that we should seek concessions on foreign loans without making any commitments. However, this is neither practical nor feasible according to international practices. Just as we must be responsible with the tax money and savings of our own citizens, we must also make commitments when borrowing the tax money and savings of other countries. If we fail to make a commitment, the citizens of those countries will not support us. Not only that, debt restructuring is also a challenging endeavour. International economic experts agree that it is a difficult and painful process for creditors, debtors, citizens of the debtor country, and mediators alike. Official bilateral creditors never reduce the principal amount of a loan. What we can obtain are concessions such as extended loan repayment periods, grace periods, and reduced interest rates. However, not understanding this reality, some blame the Sri Lankan government for not requesting a basic debt write-off. Others claim that if they come to power, they will negotiate with creditor countries to cut 50 of the initial loan amount. We must recognize that such actions require mutual agreement. Creditors will not simply comply with our demands. These statements reveal a lack of understanding of international economic systems. Neither the creditor nor the borrower has the authority to make the final decision on the extent of debt restructuring. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes that decision. They determine what kind of restructuring plan is necessary to make a countrys debt sustainable, based on an independent assessment of the economic strength of each country. The IMF warned us long before our 2022 crisis that our countrys debt was unsustainable. Furthermore, the methodology the IMF follows varies by country. There is one approach for low-income countries and another for middle-income countries. Let me provide an example. Sri Lanka, being a middle-income country, was among the first to implement debt restructuring using the new debt sustainability analysis framework tailored for middle-income countries. According to the plan set for Sri Lanka, public debt must be reduced to below 95 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2032. In contrast, the plan presented for Ghana, a low-income country, required them to reduce the present value of their public debt to below 55 of GDP by 2028. Low-income countries follow a common action framework, which allows them to convene all their creditors on one platform to make decisions. However, this does not apply to us since we are a middle-income country. Therefore, debt restructuring in Sri Lanka is a more complex process. Within this background, we had to negotiate separately with the Paris Club and India as members of the official creditor committee, as well as with Chinas Exim Bank. However, we do not have the authority to offer special terms to any of these parties. Our greatest challenge has been to establish a set of common conditions that are treated equally by both parties involved. Navigating this complex landscape amidst current geopolitical trends has not been easy, hindering our progress toward our goals. Despite these formidable difficulties, we successfully reached an agreement with our foreign bilateral official creditors within just 15 months of initiating the IMF program. We are among the middle-income countries that have efficiently completed the debt restructuring process within a short timeframe, marking a significant achievement. This is indeed promising news. Honourable Speaker, I would like to update this House on the agreements reached with the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by India, Japan, and France, as well as the Exim Bank of China, regarding debt restructuring:  We have secured a grace period until 2028 for repaying the principal loan.  Significant reductions have been made to the interest rates, with the new rate set at 2.1 or lower.  The repayment period for clearing the entire loan has been extended by 8 years, meaning our debt should now be fully settled by 2043.  There is flexibility to gradually increase principal loan repayments, allowing us to defer loan servicing costs. This has resulted in Sri Lanka retaining a debt service of USD 5 billion.  Through economic restructuring, rebuilding reserves, creating fiscal buffers, and enhancing debt repayment capacity, we aim to position the economy strongly for future debt repayments. This approach is creating considerable financial flexibility. Honourable Speaker, In 2023, we successfully finalized Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) operations. Throughout this process, we took great care to ensure the stability of our countrys financial institutions, prevent any institutional challenges, and safeguard our depositors from risks. Subsequently, we have successfully completed the restructuring of foreign bilateral debts amounting to USD 10 billion. According to international conventions on debt restructuring, multilateral debts are not included in this arrangement. Next, we are in the process of finalizing the restructuring plan for commercial debts totalling USD 14.7 billion. Discussions on this matter are currently progressing successfully. We anticipate completing all these tasks within a short timeframe. Following this, I will submit all agreements and documents related to debt restructuring to the Committee on Public Finance of Parliament. I urge the Public Finance Committee to give careful and thorough consideration to these matters. Honourable Speaker, We were able to achieve such progress in a short period due to the strategic path we have followed. I would also like to highlight the benefits to our country resulting from these successful outcomes. Since announcing our inability to repay debts in April 2022, no foreign country has provided us with loan assistance, as they are legally unable to do so under these circumstances. However, during this time, India and Bangladesh, as friendly nations, offered us short-term loan assistance. International organizations like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also provided concessional loans through various channels. Apart from these efforts, no other country had the capability or authorization to offer us long-term loans. Certain political groups have been spreading misinformation about our foreign debt on social media. A post shared by a supporter of our MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake claimed the following: Good News. When Pina took the country, the total foreign debt was USD 71 billion. Now it is USD 100 billion. We have debated with MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and there have been disagreements. But he has not insulted me directly in such a manner. However, some of your supporters are also actively working against you. Let me clarify the relevant points through this post. The total foreign debt of our country is USD 37 billion, not 71 billion as claimed by this individual, which is a false statement. Moreover, they suggest that we have borrowed up to USD 100 billion in the last two years, but its widely known that no country has provided us with loans since we declared default. Legally, no country has the authority to lend to us under these circumstances. What is the purpose of spreading such misinformation? Are these actions intended to bolster support for your party in the future? Its worth reflecting on these questions. Honourable Speaker, Following this MoU, the possibility of bilateral foreign loans has reopened for us. We now have the opportunity to receive loan assistance again from our official creditors such as the Paris Club and the Exim Bank of China. Additionally, several projects that were initiated with foreign loan assistance and halted projects can now be resumed. Being categorized as a country unable to meet its debt obligations led to the suspension of many development projects funded by various countries, particularly in the construction sector. Now, we can restart these projects anew. This marks a significant advancement for our construction industry, contributing greatly to our economic strength and expanding job opportunities. Another consequence of halting foreign projects was a decline in our economic growth rate. Despite this setback, we have made some progress. Once these projects are resumed with international assistance, we will be able to accelerate our development even further. Honourable Speaker, I would like to address some of the myths circulating in society regarding foreign loans. A developing country like Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on its own resources, as we do not yet generate sufficient income to be self-sustaining. Therefore, we must seek loans and grants. However, it is crucial that we invest these funds wisely, rather than using them for daily expenses or salary increases. This has been one of the primary mistakes our country has made since gaining independence. Loans were used to increase wages, create government jobs, provide free food, reduce the costs of food, fuel as well as electricity, and also to cover the losses of public enterprises. Some political groups promise to continue this approach, pledging wage increases, tax reductions, and various concessions without addressing how they will fund these initiatives. They make numerous promises but fail to explain how they will generate the necessary revenue. Since assuming my responsibilities, I have put an end to this unsustainable practice, which has been perpetuated by many previous governments. Honourable Speaker, I will now highlight the financial benefits expected from restructuring our foreign debt. By 2022, our expenditure on debt payments denominated in foreign currency amounted to 9.2 of GDP. It is projected to be reduced to 4.5 between 2027 and 2032. Additionally, 34.6 of GDP was allocated for gross financial needs by 2022. It is expected to be maintained at less than 13 between 2027 and 2032. This strategic adjustment will enable greater funding allocation to government services, alongside potential reductions in domestic interest rates. Honourable Speaker, I have consistently urged members of this House to unite in rebuilding our countrys economy, setting aside political differences. Even longstanding political adversaries have openly supported these efforts, considering the national interest, while others have quietly offered their backing. However, there remains a group that continues to criticize and disrupt. During this economic crisis, I advocated for immediate IMF assistance. When certain opposition groups boycotted President Gotabaya Rajapaksas all-party discussion, I participated alone as a Member of Parliament and firmly voiced my stance. I emphasized that seeking IMF assistance is the only viable path forward for us. Several months later, in a context where no one else stepped up to the challenge of revitalizing the countrys economy, I took on that daunting task. I embraced this risky challenge for the sake of my country, my homeland, and its future. I committed publicly to overcoming these challenges, akin to traversing a perilous vine bridge. I extend my appreciation to all those who rallied behind this initiative, and I express my gratitude once more for their unwavering support. Despite numerous challenges, we pushed forward with negotiations with the IMF. Critics initially claimed that our negotiations with the IMF would fail. However, we proved successful in these negotiations. Subsequently, critics shifted their stance. Some argued that no country had ever fully recovered from IMF interventions, while others declared their intention to disregard IMF agreements upon assuming power. Despite these challenges, we persevered and continued to achieve success. Critics then changed their approach once more, referencing survey reports to highlight perceived shortcomings in meeting IMF conditions. They labelled our program a failure and asserted they would refuse the second instalment despite accepting the first. Yet, we successfully secured the second instalment as well. At that point, critics altered their stance once more. A survey agency reported that we had fulfilled less than 18 of the IMF conditions, attempting to unsettle the country by suggesting we might not receive the third instalment. Despite this, we successfully secured the third instalment. Critics then shifted their focus, asserting doubts about our ability to effectively restructure our debt even after receiving the third instalment. Additionally, they endeavoured to influence creditor countries against agreeing to our restructuring efforts. Nonetheless, we achieved success in restructuring our debt. Once again, the critics changed their narrative. It is now being argued that debt restructuring holds no value since our credit ratings have not improved, leaving us classified as a financially bankrupt nation. Allow me to elaborate on this matter. As of 2019, our international credit rating stood at level B. By 2020, Sri Lanka had been downgraded to level C. This downgrade occurred well before any debt default declaration, indicating that credit ratings are influenced by various factors beyond debt solvency alone. We have achieved several notable successes: successfully completing domestic debt restructuring, restructuring foreign bilateral debt, and progressing swiftly with the remaining commercial debt restructuring. As a result, our economic indicators are improving. International financial institutions will likely work towards upgrading our credit ratings based on these indicators in due course. Thats when our critics change their stance once more. Honourable Speaker, There exists a distinction between us, the government and these critics. There is a difference between us, the government, and these boastful individuals. There is a distinction between us and these opportunists. We are steadfastly advancing with policies and actions that serve the best interests of our country. They fabricate stories day after day to gain power. In this parliament, there is a group attentively and vigilantly observing these developments. Hailing from various political parties, they maintain independent and impartial oversight. They are patiently assessing whether their allegiance lies with a party or an individual, or if it truly stands with the countrys interests. Honourable Speaker, Reflecting on the situation two years ago, can we afford to forget its impactnot only economically, but also socially and politically? Some responded unfavourably to the positive news of debt restructuring, exhibiting unwarranted hostility akin to a serpent doused with kerosene. In the context of social media, it resembled porcupines bristling with defensive reactions. Why is this so? Is the success of the IMF program seen as good or bad news? Is it good or bad news that queues for fuel, gas, and kerosene have vanished? Is the reduction of bank interest rates from over 30 to 9 considered a good news or bad news? Is the significant drop in inflation from 70 to 1.7 by last month seen as a Good news or bad news? Is the reversal from six consecutive quarters of economic contraction to growth considered a Good news or bad news? Is the increase in foreign reserves from a low point in May 2022 to  5410 million, Good news or bad news? Is the strengthening of the rupee seen as a Good news or bad news?? Is the shift from a primary account deficit to a surplus considered a Good news or bad news? Covering the budget deficit without resorting to printing money is it a good news? or bad news? Is a current account surplus in our balance of payments considered a good news? or bad news? The party leaders, who previously faced a risk of violence just for visiting Galle face, can now travel safely from the Southern to the Northern tip of the country, is it good news or bad news ? Has the transformation of a country once plagued by terror, where parliamentarians feared attending parliament or staying in their homes, into a place where fear has significantly diminished, good news or a bad news? Beneficial for the nation, is it good news or a bad news?  Honourable Speaker, This path is our only viable option. It is the only route to ensure that this good news resonates into the future. Our past achievements underscore this necessity repeatedly. We must persevere through the challenging journey ahead, akin to crossing a precarious vine bridge. There can be no turning back, regardless of who assumes power. Any deviation from this path would lead to dire consequences within a month or twoshortages of gas and electricity loom ominously. The country faces the risk of a severe calamity, one that could set us back irreparably for 25 to 30 years. Honourable Speaker, In the Caucasian Chalk Circle, (Hunuwataye kathawa) Grusha faces a critical decision: to carry the child and journey over the vine bridge, her only viable option at the time. Despite nearby scepticism and fearful inquiries about her fate, Are you going to die? Do you see the precipice! Like the underworld!! However, Grusha makes a daring decision. She bravely chooses to undertake this risky path. Many anticipate her failure as she crosses the precarious vine bridge. However, against all odds, Grusha successfully reaches safety with the child. An onlooker, reflecting on their initial doubt, exclaims in frustration: I thought she was going to fall. damn it Even today, such pessimism persists in our society. I urge those with such despairing thoughts to change their mind-set for the betterment and future of our nation. Instead of waiting for failure to happen, let us focus on proactive efforts to build and uplift our country. Let us dedicate ourselves to this endeavour with diligence and determination. Honourable Speaker, I urge all esteemed members of this assembly, whether they support, oppose, respect, or admire me, to prioritize the welfare of our nation. Let us all remember one thing: my decisions are not driven by political power or popularity. They are made solely for the countrys benefit. Over the past two years, my actions have been devoid of political manoeuvring. Every decision has been aimed at national progress, not personal gain. I know there are many others in this chamber who share my deep love for our country, placing its interests above all else. I call upon each of them to join hands in the arduous task of rebuilding our nation, akin to nurturing these blossoming flowers. Together, let us unite and lift up our motherland once more.",

Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order revoking the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party. Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the partys General Secretary and a letter directed by the partys then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself. On September 05, 2023, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was ousted from the SLFP with immediate effect and he was stripped of his position as the partys general secretary. The then SLFP chairman, former President Maithripala Sirisena communicated this to MP Jayasekara in a letter, adding that a disciplinary inquiry would also be initiated against the parliamentarian pursuant to the provisions of the partys constitution.

        "content": "Australian police said it had arrested a 14-year-old boy after a stabbing at the University of Sydney on Tuesday morning, which triggered a lockdown of the university buildings. Emergency crews treated a 22-year-old man, who was taken to a hospital in a serious but stable condition, New South Wales state police said in a statement. New South Wales Police Assistant Commissioner of counter terrorism Mark Walton told a news conference the boys motive or ideology had not yet been determined, but expressed concern at increasing evidence young people were being radicalised online. They are embracing violent extremist ideologies and moving towards violence, he said. The attacker was known to police and government agencies, he added. The alleged attacker boarded a bus after the incident and was arrested near a hospital, police said. There is no ongoing risk to the community, and the victim and the alleged attacker were not known to each other. A University of Sydney spokesperson said a police operation was underway at its Camperdown campus and that police would remain on campus while investigations continue. Police have cordoned off the crime scene. The attack comes about two months after six people were killed and 12 injured in a knife attack at a mall in Sydneys Bondi area, and an Assyrian church bishop was wounded in an unrelated stabbing attack during a service in Sydneys west. A 16-year-old boy was charged with a terrorism offence over the stabbing of the bishop, while the attacker at the mall was shot dead by police. The two attacks had prompted the New South Wales state government to toughen its knife laws. The state parliament passed laws in June giving police electronic metal-detecting scanners to check people without a warrant at shopping centres, sporting venues and public transport stations. The law also raised the maximum penalty for selling a knife to a child under the age of 16 to A11,000 (7,314), imprisonment for 12 months, or both. It also prohibited selling a knife to a child aged 16 or 17 without a reasonable excuse. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The six fishermen, who were apprehended aboard a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying 131kg of heroin in the seas off Galle, have been ordered to be further remanded until July 16. This order was issued when the suspects were produced before the Colombo Magistrates Court once again today (02). The stock of heroin seized within their fishing vessel has also been presented before the court during todays hearing, Ada Derana reporter said. In a recent operation, the Sri Lanka Navy apprehended six suspects aboard a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying 131 kg of heroin, estimated to be valued at over Rs. 3,250 million. The interception took place on June 14 on the high seas off Galle. During the initial inspection, security forces have not found anything suspicious. However, further investigation had revealed several areas of the boat were suspiciously made with fiber. Later on the night of June 14, the vessel was brought to Galle Port, where a detailed scan was conducted. The scan uncovered a stock of suspicious parcels in a compartment sealed with fiber in the front section of the boat, the navy said. The suspects had later confessed that a fiber boat builder, who was with them, had hidden the parcels by integrating them into the boats structure and sealing them with fiber. The suspects, who are residents of Gandara and Devundara, have stated that they embarked on the trip from Devundara on May 15. The journey was planned by the boats skipper and coordinated by an individual known to them only as Aiya, who communicated with them via a satellite phone. The suspects revealed that they had received initial payments between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000 for their involvement in this activity, according to police.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted today in Parliament that false propaganda regarding debt restructuring and related matters are being spread by various individuals both inside and outside the parliament. He emphasized that while the government pursues policies beneficial for the country, critics continue to fabricate different narratives solely for political gain. The President underscored that Sri Lanka has achieved a significant milestone among middle-income countries by successfully navigating the debt restructuring process, which he described as a notable accomplishment and good news for the nation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a special statement in Parliament aimed at informing about the on-going debt restructuring efforts. To ensure the continued success of the governments initiatives and to carry this Good News into the future the President called upon all parliamentarians to unite in the collective endeavour of advancing the country, transcending political affiliations. He stressed the importance of continuing the governments program without turning back, irrespective of future changes in leadership. The President emphasized his non-involvement in politics over the past two years, highlighting his commitment to making decisions solely for the benefit of the country rather than for political gain or popularity Following is the full statement delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament: Honourable Speaker, Last week, we were able to achieve another significant milestone in the challenging journey of restoring economic stability to a country that defaulted on its debts in 2022. On June 26, we reached an agreement with our official creditors regarding the repayment of the loan. Representing our country, officials authorized by the Cabinet signed these agreements and contracts. That same night, I addressed the nation through electronic media to share these developments. From the beginning of this arduous journey to rebuild the economy, I have consistently presented updates to Parliament. Initially, we outlined our plans before Parliament, and subsequently, we reported on the progress we have made. Therefore, I would like to present the information about the current situation to the Parliament today. Honourable Speaker, About two years ago, after accepting the challenge of restructuring the countrys economy, I presented our four-step work plan to this Parliament: 1. Obtain extended credit facilities in consultation with the International Monetary Fund and establish financial discipline in the country. 2. Collaborate with international financial and legal experts Lazard and Clifford Chance to prepare the debt stabilization plan in coordination with the IMF and reach an agreement with the creditors. 3. Establish policies, rules, and programs to secure foreign investment, strengthen the export economy, and create a digital green economy. Prepare and present the necessary reforms to promote the countrys economy. 4. Achieve developed country status through a debt-free economy by 2048 through this program. Since then, we have embarked on a challenging journey, knowing that success was achievable step by step. We forged ahead step by step. The 2023 and 2024 budgets further strengthened our program. By March 2023, we secured approval for the IMF Extended Credit Facility and received the first instalment on March 20, 2023. Following a review of our progress, we received the second instalment on December 12, 2023, and the third instalment on June 12, 2024. From the start of the IMF program, we initiated discussions on debt restructuring, continuing to rely on the expertise of international organizations Lazard and Clifford Chance. Our foreign debt amounts to USD 37 billion, comprising USD 10.6 billion in bilateral debt, USD 11.7 billion in multilateral debt, and USD14.7 billion in commercial loans, including USD 12.5 billion in sovereign bonds. There are various opinions expressed inside and outside this council regarding debt write-off, loan grace periods, extension of repayment periods, restructuring, and related matters. Some of these opinions are not true, and some are half-truths. Therefore, I would like to clarify the international practices and facts of debt restructuring at this time. What constitutes this foreign loan? Where do lending countries get the money? They lend us the tax money and the savings of their citizens. Many people in our country suggest that we should seek concessions on foreign loans without making any commitments. However, this is neither practical nor feasible according to international practices. Just as we must be responsible with the tax money and savings of our own citizens, we must also make commitments when borrowing the tax money and savings of other countries. If we fail to make a commitment, the citizens of those countries will not support us. Not only that, debt restructuring is also a challenging endeavour. International economic experts agree that it is a difficult and painful process for creditors, debtors, citizens of the debtor country, and mediators alike. Official bilateral creditors never reduce the principal amount of a loan. What we can obtain are concessions such as extended loan repayment periods, grace periods, and reduced interest rates. However, not understanding this reality, some blame the Sri Lankan government for not requesting a basic debt write-off. Others claim that if they come to power, they will negotiate with creditor countries to cut 50 of the initial loan amount. We must recognize that such actions require mutual agreement. Creditors will not simply comply with our demands. These statements reveal a lack of understanding of international economic systems. Neither the creditor nor the borrower has the authority to make the final decision on the extent of debt restructuring. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes that decision. They determine what kind of restructuring plan is necessary to make a countrys debt sustainable, based on an independent assessment of the economic strength of each country. The IMF warned us long before our 2022 crisis that our countrys debt was unsustainable. Furthermore, the methodology the IMF follows varies by country. There is one approach for low-income countries and another for middle-income countries. Let me provide an example. Sri Lanka, being a middle-income country, was among the first to implement debt restructuring using the new debt sustainability analysis framework tailored for middle-income countries. According to the plan set for Sri Lanka, public debt must be reduced to below 95 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2032. In contrast, the plan presented for Ghana, a low-income country, required them to reduce the present value of their public debt to below 55 of GDP by 2028. Low-income countries follow a common action framework, which allows them to convene all their creditors on one platform to make decisions. However, this does not apply to us since we are a middle-income country. Therefore, debt restructuring in Sri Lanka is a more complex process. Within this background, we had to negotiate separately with the Paris Club and India as members of the official creditor committee, as well as with Chinas Exim Bank. However, we do not have the authority to offer special terms to any of these parties. Our greatest challenge has been to establish a set of common conditions that are treated equally by both parties involved. Navigating this complex landscape amidst current geopolitical trends has not been easy, hindering our progress toward our goals. Despite these formidable difficulties, we successfully reached an agreement with our foreign bilateral official creditors within just 15 months of initiating the IMF program. We are among the middle-income countries that have efficiently completed the debt restructuring process within a short timeframe, marking a significant achievement. This is indeed promising news. Honourable Speaker, I would like to update this House on the agreements reached with the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by India, Japan, and France, as well as the Exim Bank of China, regarding debt restructuring:  We have secured a grace period until 2028 for repaying the principal loan.  Significant reductions have been made to the interest rates, with the new rate set at 2.1 or lower.  The repayment period for clearing the entire loan has been extended by 8 years, meaning our debt should now be fully settled by 2043.  There is flexibility to gradually increase principal loan repayments, allowing us to defer loan servicing costs. This has resulted in Sri Lanka retaining a debt service of USD 5 billion.  Through economic restructuring, rebuilding reserves, creating fiscal buffers, and enhancing debt repayment capacity, we aim to position the economy strongly for future debt repayments. This approach is creating considerable financial flexibility. Honourable Speaker, In 2023, we successfully finalized Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) operations. Throughout this process, we took great care to ensure the stability of our countrys financial institutions, prevent any institutional challenges, and safeguard our depositors from risks. Subsequently, we have successfully completed the restructuring of foreign bilateral debts amounting to USD 10 billion. According to international conventions on debt restructuring, multilateral debts are not included in this arrangement. Next, we are in the process of finalizing the restructuring plan for commercial debts totalling USD 14.7 billion. Discussions on this matter are currently progressing successfully. We anticipate completing all these tasks within a short timeframe. Following this, I will submit all agreements and documents related to debt restructuring to the Committee on Public Finance of Parliament. I urge the Public Finance Committee to give careful and thorough consideration to these matters. Honourable Speaker, We were able to achieve such progress in a short period due to the strategic path we have followed. I would also like to highlight the benefits to our country resulting from these successful outcomes. Since announcing our inability to repay debts in April 2022, no foreign country has provided us with loan assistance, as they are legally unable to do so under these circumstances. However, during this time, India and Bangladesh, as friendly nations, offered us short-term loan assistance. International organizations like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also provided concessional loans through various channels. Apart from these efforts, no other country had the capability or authorization to offer us long-term loans. Certain political groups have been spreading misinformation about our foreign debt on social media. A post shared by a supporter of our MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake claimed the following: Good News. When Pina took the country, the total foreign debt was USD 71 billion. Now it is USD 100 billion. We have debated with MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and there have been disagreements. But he has not insulted me directly in such a manner. However, some of your supporters are also actively working against you. Let me clarify the relevant points through this post. The total foreign debt of our country is USD 37 billion, not 71 billion as claimed by this individual, which is a false statement. Moreover, they suggest that we have borrowed up to USD 100 billion in the last two years, but its widely known that no country has provided us with loans since we declared default. Legally, no country has the authority to lend to us under these circumstances. What is the purpose of spreading such misinformation? Are these actions intended to bolster support for your party in the future? Its worth reflecting on these questions. Honourable Speaker, Following this MoU, the possibility of bilateral foreign loans has reopened for us. We now have the opportunity to receive loan assistance again from our official creditors such as the Paris Club and the Exim Bank of China. Additionally, several projects that were initiated with foreign loan assistance and halted projects can now be resumed. Being categorized as a country unable to meet its debt obligations led to the suspension of many development projects funded by various countries, particularly in the construction sector. Now, we can restart these projects anew. This marks a significant advancement for our construction industry, contributing greatly to our economic strength and expanding job opportunities. Another consequence of halting foreign projects was a decline in our economic growth rate. Despite this setback, we have made some progress. Once these projects are resumed with international assistance, we will be able to accelerate our development even further. Honourable Speaker, I would like to address some of the myths circulating in society regarding foreign loans. A developing country like Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on its own resources, as we do not yet generate sufficient income to be self-sustaining. Therefore, we must seek loans and grants. However, it is crucial that we invest these funds wisely, rather than using them for daily expenses or salary increases. This has been one of the primary mistakes our country has made since gaining independence. Loans were used to increase wages, create government jobs, provide free food, reduce the costs of food, fuel as well as electricity, and also to cover the losses of public enterprises. Some political groups promise to continue this approach, pledging wage increases, tax reductions, and various concessions without addressing how they will fund these initiatives. They make numerous promises but fail to explain how they will generate the necessary revenue. Since assuming my responsibilities, I have put an end to this unsustainable practice, which has been perpetuated by many previous governments. Honourable Speaker, I will now highlight the financial benefits expected from restructuring our foreign debt. By 2022, our expenditure on debt payments denominated in foreign currency amounted to 9.2 of GDP. It is projected to be reduced to 4.5 between 2027 and 2032. Additionally, 34.6 of GDP was allocated for gross financial needs by 2022. It is expected to be maintained at less than 13 between 2027 and 2032. This strategic adjustment will enable greater funding allocation to government services, alongside potential reductions in domestic interest rates. Honourable Speaker, I have consistently urged members of this House to unite in rebuilding our countrys economy, setting aside political differences. Even longstanding political adversaries have openly supported these efforts, considering the national interest, while others have quietly offered their backing. However, there remains a group that continues to criticize and disrupt. During this economic crisis, I advocated for immediate IMF assistance. When certain opposition groups boycotted President Gotabaya Rajapaksas all-party discussion, I participated alone as a Member of Parliament and firmly voiced my stance. I emphasized that seeking IMF assistance is the only viable path forward for us. Several months later, in a context where no one else stepped up to the challenge of revitalizing the countrys economy, I took on that daunting task. I embraced this risky challenge for the sake of my country, my homeland, and its future. I committed publicly to overcoming these challenges, akin to traversing a perilous vine bridge. I extend my appreciation to all those who rallied behind this initiative, and I express my gratitude once more for their unwavering support. Despite numerous challenges, we pushed forward with negotiations with the IMF. Critics initially claimed that our negotiations with the IMF would fail. However, we proved successful in these negotiations. Subsequently, critics shifted their stance. Some argued that no country had ever fully recovered from IMF interventions, while others declared their intention to disregard IMF agreements upon assuming power. Despite these challenges, we persevered and continued to achieve success. Critics then changed their approach once more, referencing survey reports to highlight perceived shortcomings in meeting IMF conditions. They labelled our program a failure and asserted they would refuse the second instalment despite accepting the first. Yet, we successfully secured the second instalment as well. At that point, critics altered their stance once more. A survey agency reported that we had fulfilled less than 18 of the IMF conditions, attempting to unsettle the country by suggesting we might not receive the third instalment. Despite this, we successfully secured the third instalment. Critics then shifted their focus, asserting doubts about our ability to effectively restructure our debt even after receiving the third instalment. Additionally, they endeavoured to influence creditor countries against agreeing to our restructuring efforts. Nonetheless, we achieved success in restructuring our debt. Once again, the critics changed their narrative. It is now being argued that debt restructuring holds no value since our credit ratings have not improved, leaving us classified as a financially bankrupt nation. Allow me to elaborate on this matter. As of 2019, our international credit rating stood at level B. By 2020, Sri Lanka had been downgraded to level C. This downgrade occurred well before any debt default declaration, indicating that credit ratings are influenced by various factors beyond debt solvency alone. We have achieved several notable successes: successfully completing domestic debt restructuring, restructuring foreign bilateral debt, and progressing swiftly with the remaining commercial debt restructuring. As a result, our economic indicators are improving. International financial institutions will likely work towards upgrading our credit ratings based on these indicators in due course. Thats when our critics change their stance once more. Honourable Speaker, There exists a distinction between us, the government and these critics. There is a difference between us, the government, and these boastful individuals. There is a distinction between us and these opportunists. We are steadfastly advancing with policies and actions that serve the best interests of our country. They fabricate stories day after day to gain power. In this parliament, there is a group attentively and vigilantly observing these developments. Hailing from various political parties, they maintain independent and impartial oversight. They are patiently assessing whether their allegiance lies with a party or an individual, or if it truly stands with the countrys interests. Honourable Speaker, Reflecting on the situation two years ago, can we afford to forget its impactnot only economically, but also socially and politically? Some responded unfavourably to the positive news of debt restructuring, exhibiting unwarranted hostility akin to a serpent doused with kerosene. In the context of social media, it resembled porcupines bristling with defensive reactions. Why is this so? Is the success of the IMF program seen as good or bad news? Is it good or bad news that queues for fuel, gas, and kerosene have vanished? Is the reduction of bank interest rates from over 30 to 9 considered a good news or bad news? Is the significant drop in inflation from 70 to 1.7 by last month seen as a Good news or bad news? Is the reversal from six consecutive quarters of economic contraction to growth considered a Good news or bad news? Is the increase in foreign reserves from a low point in May 2022 to  5410 million, Good news or bad news? Is the strengthening of the rupee seen as a Good news or bad news?? Is the shift from a primary account deficit to a surplus considered a Good news or bad news? Covering the budget deficit without resorting to printing money is it a good news? or bad news? Is a current account surplus in our balance of payments considered a good news? or bad news? The party leaders, who previously faced a risk of violence just for visiting Galle face, can now travel safely from the Southern to the Northern tip of the country, is it good news or bad news ? Has the transformation of a country once plagued by terror, where parliamentarians feared attending parliament or staying in their homes, into a place where fear has significantly diminished, good news or a bad news? Beneficial for the nation, is it good news or a bad news?  Honourable Speaker, This path is our only viable option. It is the only route to ensure that this good news resonates into the future. Our past achievements underscore this necessity repeatedly. We must persevere through the challenging journey ahead, akin to crossing a precarious vine bridge. There can be no turning back, regardless of who assumes power. Any deviation from this path would lead to dire consequences within a month or twoshortages of gas and electricity loom ominously. The country faces the risk of a severe calamity, one that could set us back irreparably for 25 to 30 years. Honourable Speaker, In the Caucasian Chalk Circle, (Hunuwataye kathawa) Grusha faces a critical decision: to carry the child and journey over the vine bridge, her only viable option at the time. Despite nearby scepticism and fearful inquiries about her fate, Are you going to die? Do you see the precipice! Like the underworld!! However, Grusha makes a daring decision. She bravely chooses to undertake this risky path. Many anticipate her failure as she crosses the precarious vine bridge. However, against all odds, Grusha successfully reaches safety with the child. An onlooker, reflecting on their initial doubt, exclaims in frustration: I thought she was going to fall. damn it Even today, such pessimism persists in our society. I urge those with such despairing thoughts to change their mind-set for the betterment and future of our nation. Instead of waiting for failure to happen, let us focus on proactive efforts to build and uplift our country. Let us dedicate ourselves to this endeavour with diligence and determination. Honourable Speaker, I urge all esteemed members of this assembly, whether they support, oppose, respect, or admire me, to prioritize the welfare of our nation. Let us all remember one thing: my decisions are not driven by political power or popularity. They are made solely for the countrys benefit. Over the past two years, my actions have been devoid of political manoeuvring. Every decision has been aimed at national progress, not personal gain. I know there are many others in this chamber who share my deep love for our country, placing its interests above all else. I call upon each of them to join hands in the arduous task of rebuilding our nation, akin to nurturing these blossoming flowers. Together, let us unite and lift up our motherland once more. --PMD--",
