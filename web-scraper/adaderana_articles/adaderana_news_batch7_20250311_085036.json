        "title": "State revenue surged by 6 in Q1 2024 exceeding expectations - Siyambalapitiya",
        "date": "April 26, 2024 09:08 am",
        "content": "In the first quarter of 2024, state revenue has reached an impressive Rs. 834 billion, says State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. This achievement not only surpasses the projected revenue but also indicates a growth of 6, he added. The lawmaker emphasized that with prudent financial management and a consistent revenue pattern, 2024 promises to be a year where revenue targets can be successfully attained. Siyambalapitiya made these remarks during his participation in a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (25), under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views, State Minister Siyambalapitiya further commented: The Department of Treasury Operations is encountering a challenging task in handling cash flow this year. This difficulty arises from the limitations imposed by existing laws, which prohibit obtaining loans and printing money. Moreover, government spending has escalated, attributed to both welfare and recurrent expenses. However, it is noteworthy that effective financial management practices are underway in the country. In comparing recurring expenses between the first quarters of 2020 and 2024, there has been a substantial increase of 35 in the latter period. Notably, there is a significant surge of 114 in loan interest repayment and a noteworthy uptick of 60 in capital expenditure. Furthermore, the capital repayment of public debt has escalated by 177, indicating substantial financial commitments. Shifting focus to welfare expenditure, in the first quarter of 2020, Rs. 93,670 million was allocated for Samurdhi. However, in the corresponding period of 2024, this figure has risen to Rs. 117,107 million, reflecting a notable growth of 25 compared to 2020. These figures underscore the evolving financial landscape and the increasing demands on government resources for welfare provisions. In the first quarter of this year, state revenue surged by 6 while beating initial expectations, with anticipated revenue of Rs. 787 billion. However, the actual revenue collected reached an impressive Rs. 834 billion, showcasing a remarkable achievement. The Inland Revenue Department led the charge, contributing Rs. 430 billion during the first quarter of the year. During the same quarter, Sri Lanka Customs and the Excise Department of Sri Lanka added nearly Rs. 354 billion and about Rs. 51 billion, respectively. This notable increase in revenue serves as a significant victory for a nation that has grappled with economic challenges, marking a positive milestone on its journey forward. This success can be attributed to effective financial management practices implemented across the country. Looking at the income trend, theres reason to anticipate that 2024 could be a year where income targets are achievable. Moreover, the National Consumer Price Index indicates a positive shift: external inflation dropped from 5.1 in February to 2.5 in March, and non-food category inflation plummeted from 5.1 to 0.7 over the same period. These numbers collectively suggest an improving economic landscape for the country.",

        "title": "Haitis Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns, transitional council takes power",
        "date": "April 26, 2024 09:51 am",
        "content": "Haiti opened a new political chapter Thursday with the installation of a transitional council tasked to pick a new prime minister and prepare for eventual presidential elections, in hopes of quelling spiraling gang violence that has killed thousands in the Caribbean country. Ariel Henry, the prime minister who had been locked out of the country for the past couple of months due to the violence, cleared the way for the transition by presenting his resignation in a letter signed in Los Angeles. The document was released Thursday in Haiti on the same day as the new transitional council was sworn in to choose a new prime minister and Cabinet. Henrys outgoing Cabinet chose Economy and Finance Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert as interim prime minister in the meantime. It was not immediately clear when the transitional council would name its own choice for interim prime minister. The council was officially sworn in at the National Palace in downtown Port-au-Prince early Thursday as the pop of sporadic gunfire erupted nearby, prompting some officials to look around the room. The council had been urged to seek a safer venue because gangs have launched daily attacks in the area. Addressing a crowded and sweaty room in the prime ministers office hours later in Pétion-Ville, Boisvert said that Haitis crisis had gone on too long and that the country now found itself at a crossroads. The members of the transitional council stood behind him, and before him, the countrys top police and military officials as well as ambassadors and well-known politicians. After long months of debate ... a solution has been found, Boisvert said. Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic. He called the transitional council a Haitian solution and directing his remarks toward them, Boisvert wished them success, adding, You are to lead the country to peace, to economic and social recovery, to sacred union, to participation. After the speeches, the soft clink of glasses echoed in the room as attendees served champagne flutes toasted with a somber To Haiti. The council was installed earlier Thursday, more than a month after Caribbean leaders announced its creation following an emergency meeting to tackle Haitis spiraling crisis. Gunfire heard as the council was sworn in at the National Palace prompted worried looks. The nine-member council, of which seven have voting powers, is also expected to help set the agenda of a new Cabinet. It will also appoint a provisional electoral commission, a requirement before elections can take place, and establish a national security council. The councils non-renewable mandate expires Feb. 7, 2026, at which date a new president is scheduled to be sworn in. The council members are Emmanuel Vertilaire for Petit Desalin, a party led by former senator and presidential candidate Jean-Charles Moïse; Smith Augustin for EDERED, a party led by former Prime Minister Claude Joseph; Fritz Alphonse Jean for the Montana Accord, a group of civil society leaders, political parties and others; Leslie Voltaire for Fanmi Lavalas, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; Louis Gérald Gilles for the Dec. 21 coalition that backs former Prime Minister Ariel Henry; Edgard Leblanc Fils for the Jan. 30 Collective, which represents parties including that of former President Michel Martelly; and Laurent Saint-Cyr for the private sector. The two non-voting seats were awarded to Frinel Joseph, a pastor, and Régine Abraham, a former World Bank and Haitian government official. Augustin, one of the councils voting members, said that it was unclear if the council would decide to keep Boisvert on as interim prime minister or choose another. He said it would be discussed in the coming days. The crisis is unsustainable, he said. Abraham, a nonvoting member, recalled the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, explaining that that violence had a devastating impact. Abraham said that gangs now controlled most of Port-au-Prince, tens of thousands of the capitals residents have been displaced by violence and more than 900 schools in the capital have been forced to close. The population of Port-au-Prince has literally been taken hostage, she said. Gangs launched coordinated attacks that began on Feb. 29 in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and surrounding areas. They burned police stations and hospitals, opened fire on the main international airport that has remained closed since early March and stormed Haitis two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. Gangs also have severed access to Haitis biggest port. The onslaught began while Prime Minister Henry was on an official visit to Kenya to push for a U.N.-backed deployment of a police force from the East African country. In his resignation letter, Henry said Haiti would be reborn. We served the nation in difficult times, he wrote. I sympathize with the losses and suffering endured by our compatriots during this period. He remains locked out of Haiti. Port-au-Prince is now almost completely sealed off because of air, sea and land blockades, Catherine Russell, UNICEFs director, said earlier this week. The international community has urged the council to prioritize Haitis widespread insecurity. Even before the attacks began, gangs already controlled 80 of Port-au-Prince. More than 2,500 people were killed or injured from January to March, up by more than 50 compared with the same period last year, according to a recent U.N. report. It is impossible to overstate the increase in gang activity across Port-au-Prince and beyond, the deterioration of the human rights situation and the deepening of the humanitarian crisis, María Isabel Salvador, the U.N. special envoy for Haiti, said at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday. On Thursday, some Haitians said they didnt know that the country had a new prime minister and a transitional council in place. Others warily celebrated the new leadership. We dont ask for much. We just want to move about freely, said Guismet Obaubourg, owner of a dusty convenience story who lamented that his merchandise has been stuck at the port for two months. As for Boisvert: I dont know him personally, but as long as he does what hes supposed to do, provide security to the country, thats all that matters. In attendance at Boisverts swearing in Thursday was Dennis Hankins, the newly installed U.S. ambassador. He said Thursdays events were an important step for Haiti. In crisis, the Haitians are able to do tremendous things, so were here to help them, Hankins said. We wont be the solution, but hopefully we will be part of helping those finding the solution. As part of that, he said the U.S. government was working to enforce export controls on weapons, many of which have found their way to Haiti, fueling the violence. The fact that many of the arms that come here are from the United States is indisputable and that has a direct impact, Hankins said. It is something we recognize is a contributing factor to instability. Nearly 100,000 people have fled the capital in search of safer cities and towns since the attacks began. Tens of thousands of others left homeless after gangs torched their homes are now living in crowded, makeshift shelters across Port-au-Prince that only have one or two toilets for hundreds of residents. At the United Nations Thursday, World Food Program Deputy Executive Director Carl Skau said Haiti is suffering from a security, political and humanitarian crisis that is causing acute food insecurity for some 5 million people, or about half the population. The U.N. defines that as when a persons inability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger. The situation is dramatic, Skau told reporters. Devastating crisis, a massive humanitarian impact, the worst humanitarian situation in Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. Rachel Pierre, a 39-year-old mother of four children, living in one of the capitals makeshift shelters, said, Although Im physically here, it feels like Im dead. There is no food or water. Sometimes I have nothing to give the kids, she said as her 14-month-old suckled on her deflated breast. Many Haitians are angry and exhausted at what their lives have become and blame gangs for their situation. Theyre the ones who sent us here, said Chesnel Joseph, a 46-year-old math teacher whose school closed because of the violence and who has become the shelters informal director. They mistreat us. They kill us. They burn our homes. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Accordingly, the case filed against Harak Kata and two others will be taken up on 15 May, on the orders of High Court Judge Damith Thotawatta. The accused is being held at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which currently operates as a detention centre. On 10 September 2023, Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody.",

        "title": "Top New York court overturns Harvey Weinsteins 2020 rape conviction",
        "date": "April 26, 2024 11:49 am",
        "content": "New Yorks highest court has overturned disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinsteins 2020 conviction for rape and sexual assault, highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men to account. The Court of Appeals found on Thursday that the landmark trial was unfair because the judge allowed women whose accusations were not part of the charges Weinstein faced to give evidence in court. Judge Jenny Rivera called for a new trial following the 4-3 decision. The ruling does not affect a separate 16-year rape sentence handed down in California, so the 72-year-old will remain behind bars. Bombshell allegations against the Oscar-winning producer broke into the open in 2017 and led to a flood of allegations against other powerful men as women fought back against sexual violence in what became known as the MeToo movement. Three years later, a New York court found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. He was jailed for 23 years in a case that was considered a landmark for the MeToo movement. Following his conviction, a civil trial awarded 17m to dozens of other women who had accused Weinstein of abuse. Many of his accusers condemned Thursdays decision, with actress Ashley Judd calling it an act of institutional betrayal. The office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg signalled it planned to put Weinstein back on trial. Stinging dissent At a news conference, Weinsteins lawyer Arthur Aidala called the ruling a tremendous victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York and said Weinstein was ready to testify in his own defence at a retrial. Hes been dying to tell his story from day one, Aidala said. Weinstein has contended that any sexual activity was consensual. Any retrial would be overseen by a different judge. The term of the judge in the original trial, James Burke, expired at the end of 2022. In its ruling on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial court erred in allowing testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts and saying it would permit questions about Weinsteins bad behaviour if he had testified. The producer did not take the stand in his own defence. In a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the court was continuing a disturbing trend of overturning juries guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence. She said the ruling came at the expense and safety of women. In another dissent, Judge Anthony Cannataro wrote that the decision was endangering decades of progress in this incredibly complex and nuanced area of law regarding sex crimes after centuries of deeply patriarchal and misogynistic legal tradition. The reversal of Weinsteins conviction is the second major MeToo setback in recent years. In 2021, a court in Pennsylvania threw out Bill Cosbys conviction on sexual assault and he was freed from prison. The Supreme Court declined to take up the case. --With agencies inputs",

Speaking during todays parliamentary session, Premajayantha expressed that the 2023 (2024) G.C.E OL examination is scheduled to be commenced in the second week of May. The G.C.E OL examination will commence in the second week of May. The Commissioner General of Examinations informed that all re-scrutinized results will be released before that, he said. Meanwhile, MP Gamini Waleboda recently raised concerns that due to the delay in re-scrutiny of the 2022(2023) OL examination, students are facing issues with commencing their academic activities in the AL classes. In a letter to the Minister Premajayantha, the parliamentarian had pointed out that the appeals were called for the re-scrutiny of the OL examination results in December last year. Despite four months having passed, the Commissioner General of Examinations has yet to release the re-corrected results, he added. The MP stressed that around 200,000 students, who had submitted applications for re-scrutiny, have encountered various issues concerning the AL subject stream selection as they are still awaiting the finalized results. Thus, Waleboda has requested the Education Minister to order the Examinations Commissioner General to take measures for expedite the release of the re-scrutinized results. Against this backdrop, the Department of Examinations announced that conducting and organizing tuition classes and seminars aimed at students scheduled to sit for the upcoming 2023 G.C.E. OL examination, which is scheduled to be held from 06 May to 15 May 2024, would be banned from midnight on Tuesday (April 30).

        "date": "April 26, 2024 02:16 pm",
        "content": "China and the US face a choice between stability and a downward spiral, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told counterpart Antony Blinken on Friday in Beijing, as the American diplomat kicked off a day of meetings with top Chinese officials. Blinkens trip to China  his second in the space of a year  comes as the two global powers seek to expand communication and stabilize rocky ties, while also navigating a host of thorny issues from Chinas support for Russia to its aggression in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan. Should China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral? This is a major question before our two countries, and tests our sincerity and ability, Wang told Blinken during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, after saying US-China ties were beginning to stabilize. Should our two sides lead international cooperation against global issues and achieve win-win for all? Or engage in rivalry and confrontation  or even slide into conflict, which would be a lose-lose for all? he said, speaking through an interpreter. Wangs comments come as Chinese officials bristle at actions Washington has taken in the name of national security, which Beijing sees as meant to suppress its development. Those have included US controls on the export to China of high-tech goods that could have military uses, as well as curbs on US investment in certain high-tech sectors in China. On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden signed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on the social media platform TikTok if the companys Chinese parent ByteDance doesnt sell it  legislation Beijing has previously decried. In his comments to Wang, Blinken pointed to a shared responsibility between the two countries to make sure that were as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least, to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations. I hope we can make some progress on the issues that our presidents agreed we should cooperate on, but also clarify our differences, our intents, and make very clear to each other where we stand, Blinken said. The trip is the latest in a string of high-level engagements that included a summit meeting between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California in November, following a period of immense tension. Officials from both nations suggested ahead of the trip that the visit would be focused on managing the relationship and communicating concerns. The two sides are also expected to discuss areas of contention. Blinken is expected to raise the issue of Chinas industrial and economic support for Russia, which the White House says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine, and press China to use its relationship with Iran to push it to be less provocative in the Middle East. In a briefing with reporters earlier this week ahead of the meeting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Beijing has been playing a constructive role as a responsible major country on issues related to the Middle East, Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula and expects the US side to do the same. In addition to concern about US technology curbs, Wang will likely continue to stress Chinas so-called red lines in the relationship, the foremost of which being how the US maintains its unofficial relationship with Taiwan. Chinas ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up its military intimidation of the democratic island in recent years. We always call for respecting each others core interests and urge the United States not to interfere in Chinas internal affairs, not to hold Chinas development back, not to step on Chinas red lines on Chinas sovereignty, security and development interests, Wang told Blinken ahead of the meeting.

The proposed panel will be headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy. In a statement, the government said that although the import, refining, distribution and sale of petroleum products including petrol, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and lubricating oil are carried out within the existing legal framework, the sector is not subjected to a wide range of regulation or a petroleum mechanism. Meanwhile, as private entities are involved in the import and distribution of products, the need for an independent, dynamic, effective and efficient regulatory mechanism has been identified to find solutions to problems, address challenges in the sector and safeguard the interests of consumers, investors and other stakeholders.",

        "content": "Alexis Taylor, Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday (26) called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe and other senior government officials to discuss USDA support for Sri Lankas agricultural sector. She was accompanied by the U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung. Under Secretary Taylors visit underscored the American peoples ongoing commitment to supporting the agricultural development and economic growth of Sri Lanka, promoting greater food security and enhancing resilience against climate challenges, the U.S. Embassy in Colombo said in a statement. The Under Secretarys discussions affirmed Sri Lankas key role as a priority country in the 2024 Food for Progress initiative, which focuses on enhancing food security and climate resilience through environmentally friendly practices and improved market linkages. A primary focus was the ongoing USD 27.5 million Market-Oriented Dairy Project which has helped improve milk productivity for over 15,000 dairy farmers in Sri Lanka, with many reporting doubling production thanks to the project. USDAs dairy project also seeks to help improve climate adaptivity among the dairy farmers by providing comprehensive training on cattle herding and feed consumption strategies that reduce unnecessary energy consumption. Additionally, since 2018 the USDAs McGovern-Dole project implemented by Save the Children in partnership with the Ministry of Education has provided daily meals to close to 100,000 Sri Lankan primary schoolchildren throughout the country. Building on this success, USDA embarked on a new five-year, 32.5 million project expansion to further boost school meal provisions across eight districts, including Badulla, Colombo, Kilinochchi, Monaragala, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, and Trincomalee. The project now aims to provide meals to close to 200,000 students covered under Sri Lankas national school meal program.",

        "title": "Venice introduces entry fee for day-trippers to tackle mass tourism",
        "date": "April 26, 2024 09:10 pm",
        "content": "After many years of preparation, Venice has finally debuted its controversial five-euro entry toll for tourists without a hotel reservation this Thursday (25). This unprecedented measure  being the first city in the world to impose such a fee  has a clear objective: to confront mass tourism that has threatened the fragile balance of the city of canals for too many years, relentlessly driving out its residents. The figures are quite graphic because, even though there are only about 50,000 residents living in the islands of Venice  not counting those living on the mainland  on days of high pressure, there can be up to 40,000 visitors in Venice at once. Just last year, 20 million tourists came to walk through its alleyways. After having banned large cruise ships from the historic center in 2021, the City Council of La Serenissima has now decided to opt for an original measure after UNESCO threatened to include the municipality in the blacklist of endangered World Heritage Sites. At the moment, this is all part of an experiment that will be in effect on 29 specific dates in 2024, until July 14. It all started April 25, a public holiday in Italy commemorating the liberation from Nazi-Fascism, and will continue for the next 10 days. The goal is to gather more information on tourist flows to better manage services and, at the same time, dissuade visitors from traveling to Venice during peak crowded dates. All the dates are marked in red on an online platform set up by the City Council, where visitors can reserve their entry and obtain a QR code necessary to stroll along the canals during these days. Even parishioners attending on Sunday, when Pope Francis will hold a mass in St. Marks Square, will need to download it. I have the honor of being the mayor of the most beautiful city in the world, but in recent years it has had a problem with the quality of life of the people, with civility, and with respect for the rules, defended Mayor Luigi Brugnaro during a press conference with correspondents in Rome. No politician takes such a measure because it is easier to remain still and not try to find a solution. We are trying to make the city more usable and livable. The mayor has insisted that they do not intend to close the city as if it were an amusement park, and in fact, they do not plan to introduce barriers or turnstiles at the entrances like the Santa Lucia train station, Marco Polo airport, or Piazzale Roma, which are accessed by car or bus. Six years ago, a test was carried out with turnstiles to regulate access flows, and it turned out to be a complete disaster: they barely lasted half an hour after a group of protesters ripped them out in front of the cameras. For now, the officials in charge of controlling access will be a team of 180 people, including volunteers and municipal workers, who will be able to request the QR code from tourists. Those who are not in compliance risk a fine ranging from 50 to 300 euros. This is not a measure that I take lightly, but if we continue talking, we will never do anything to preserve the delicacy and beauty of Venice, Mayor Brugnaro insisted. At the end of the experimental period, the intention is to open a period of reflection to study how the measure has progressed and to introduce any necessary improvements. There are no plans to reduce the amount of 5 euros - initially, the idea of imposing a price of 10 euros was considered - but there is a long list of exemptions. Starting with children under 14, Venetians, or those who come to work or study at the universities every day. Neither will their relatives up to the third degree or friends have to pay - they can prove this with a voucher provided by their acquaintances - nor the residents of the Veneto region, or those who come to participate in sports competitions or go to the hospital. Those with a hotel reservation or other tourist accommodation structure just need to enter it into the system, as they already pay the municipal tourist tax there. The idea is that only day visitors to Venice will need the ticket, contributing to the citys municipal coffers under tremendous tourist pressure. Source: La Vanguardia",

        "date": "April 27, 2024 01:56 pm",
        "content": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Friday a 6 billion long-term military aid package for Ukraine  the largest to date  which will allow the US to purchase new equipment produced by the American defense industry for the Ukrainian military. This is the largest security assistance package that weve committed to date. It will include critical interceptors for Ukraines patriot and NASAMS air defense systems, more counter drone systems and support equipment, significant amounts of artillery ammunition, and air to ground munitions and maintenance and sustainment support, Austin said during a press conference on Friday. The announcement comes just days after the US announced a 1 billion package that would quickly provide equipment to Ukraine from US stocks, following President Joe Bidens signing of a much delayed 95 billion supplemental aid package on Wednesday. Biden said moments after signing the legislation that shipments of aid to Ukraine would begin within hours. Equipment under the 6 billion package announced Friday, however, will take much longer to arrive. Unlike drawdown packages which pull military equipment directly from US stocks, Fridays aid announcement falls under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts with industry to procure the equipment. The USAI is intended to provide Ukraine with a long-term supply of weapons and equipment. Austin said Friday that the timeline for delivery would depend on what systems are purchased, but that the Pentagon is going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, speaking alongside Austin on Friday, said that the USAI package would provide Ukraine with more flexibility. Theyve had to actually ration conserve munitions over time, Brown said. And so with this package, and the follow-on factors because of the supplemental, gives them a bit more flexibility to be able to operate and use that capability effectively against the Russian threat. Austin and Browns press conference followed the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on Friday morning, held two years to the day since the very first meeting in Germany. Ahead of the meetings start, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the group of allies, thanking them for their support but also urging them to send more assistance, particularly with air defense. Austin commended the Ukrainians during Fridays press conference for being able to hold their own without significant support from the US over the last few months, and said the capabilities that will start flowing in will help them do a lot better. As I talked to Ukrainian leadership, they are confident that they can continue to hold their own and then and then, as they get a bit stronger, theyll have options available, he said.

        "date": "April 27, 2024 04:05 pm",
        "content": "The Committee of Public Finance (COPF), at its most recent meeting, has examined the effectiveness of recent tax increases on tobacco and liquor, aimed at discouraging consumption and boosting government revenue. Drawing attention to the Laffer curve in taxation, the COPF observed a decline in government revenue over the past two months compared to the same period last year, attributing it to higher taxes that have led to increased smuggling and the adoption of alternative measures. At the meeting held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of MP Harsha de Silva, the COPF members recommended a thorough analysis of the inflation index to guide tax adjustments and research into existing tax systems to prevent revenue loss. The COPF also raised concerns about the failure of the Excise Department to address issues such as non-payment of taxes and the use of fake stickers by liquor license holders, despite instructions from the Ministry of Finance. Expressing dissatisfaction over the lack of action, the Committee emphasized the urgency of implementing recommendations to safeguard government revenue. Questions were raised regarding the Ministry of Finances decision-making process on taxing essential goods, given inefficiencies in revenue collection from liquor license holders. It was revealed that the Excise Department continues to operate manually, hindering efficient revenue collection and enforcement against illegal activities. The COPF emphasized the need for digitalization to address these challenges, expressing surprise at delays attributed to cost concerns. They urged immediate measures to solicit quotations for digital software to prevent corruption within the Excise Department. Further, COPF approved three Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, as detailed in Gazette No. 236436, Gazette No. 236144, and Gazette No. 236435. These Orders, effective from 01 January 2024, amend business hours for liquor licensed establishments and revise excise duties on various tabocco and alcoholic products. The approval came following extensive discussions during COPF meeting. MPs Patali Champika Ranawaka, U. K. Sumith Udukumbura, Mayantha Dissanayake, Chandima Weerakkody, Madhura Withanage, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Isuru Dodangoda, and officials representing the Excise department and the Department of fiscal policy were present at the Committee meeting held.",

        "title": "Indian govt allows 99.5k MT of onion exports to 6 countries including Sri Lanka",
        "date": "April 27, 2024 08:34 pm",
        "content": "The Indian Government on Saturday said it has allowed exports of 99,500 tonnes of onions, mainly sourced from Maharashtra, to six neighbouring countries despite the ban on shipments. The Indian Government has also allowed exports of 2,000 tonnes of white onion cultivated, especially, for export markets in the Middle East and some European countries. On December 8, 2023, India banned export of onions. In an official statement, Indias Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food  Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka. The export prohibition has been imposed to ensure adequate domestic availability against the backdrop of estimated lower Kharif and Rabi crops in 2023-24 compared to the previous year. The ban was imposed amid an increase in demand in the international market, it added. The National Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), the agency for the export of onion to these countries, sourced the domestic onions to be exported through e-platform at L1 prices. NCEL has supplied to the agency or agencies nominated by the government of the destination country at the negotiated rate on a 100 per cent advance payment basis. The offer rate of NCEL to the buyers takes into account the prevailing prices in the destination market and also international and domestic markets. The quota allocated for export to the six countries is being supplied as per requisition made by the destination country. As the largest producer of onion in the country, Maharashtra is the major supplier of onions sourced by NCEL for export, the statement said. The government had also allowed the export of 2,000 tonnes of white onion cultivated, especially for export markets in the Middle East and some European countries. Being purely export-oriented, the production cost of the white onion is higher than other onions due to higher seed cost, adoption of good agricultural practice (GAP) and compliance to strict maximum residue limits (MRL) requirements, the statement said. The procurement target for onion buffer out of Rabi crop 2024 under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of Indian Department of Consumer Affairs has been fixed at 5 lakh tonnes this year. The Central agencies, like NCCF and NAFED are tying up local agencies like FPOsFPCsPACs to support the procurement, storage and farmers registration to begin the procurement of any store-worthy onion. A high-level team of the Department of Consumer Affairs, NCCF and NAFED visited Nashik and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra from April 11-13, 2024, to create awareness among the farmers, FPOsFPCs and PACs about the procurement of 5 lakh tonnes of onion for buffer stock. To reduce the storage loss of onions, the department has decided to enhance the quantum of stocks to be irradiated and cold stored from 1,200 tonnes last year to over 5,000 tonnes this year, with technical support from BARC, Mumbai. The pilot of onion irradiation and cold storage taken up last year has been found to have resulted in the reduction of storage loss to less than 10 per cent, the statement said. In March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production. As per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonne output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonne in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonne in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonne in Rajasthan, the data showed.

        "title": "If we desire a competitive economy, we must embrace competition - President",
        "date": "April 27, 2024 10:17 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the governments aim to create a highly competitive, export-oriented economy based on market economy, expressing full faith in the business community of the country. He pointed out that the current challenge facing the nation is not about maintaining the executive presidential system but rather about building a robust economic framework. The President underscored the importance of allowing the people to decide the countrys economic trajectory, highlighting that this opportunity should not be missed by anyone. These remarks were made during his presence at the International Rotary District Conference 202324 of the District 3220 Club for Sri Lanka and Maldives held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo yesterday (26). The district conference featured a keynote address by Mr. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, Minister of Information Technology and Digital Services of Tamil Nadu, India. District 3220 Rotary International for Sri Lanka and Maldives, established in 1929, comprises over 17,000 members. The club has been actively involved in numerous community and social welfare initiatives, as well as projects aimed at fostering social and economic development across the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a member of the District 3220 Colombo West International Rotary Club since 1994. Addressing the gathering the President further said, We are living at a time when Sri Lanka has reached a crossroads, deciding which path to take. This decision lies in the hands of the people of this country. Are we moving forward? Are we staying stagnant? Or do we wish to regress? Allow me to recount an incident today when a young person asked me, What plans do you have for the country? What plans do you have for the educated people? What plans do you have to develop the physical infrastructure? To which I replied, I have no fixed plans. I can only envision a market economy where market forces will determine the course. Within that framework, we can establish policy guidelines, outline three or four-year programs, and adapt as needed. Thinking of a rigid plan to spur growth seems implausible to me. We must understand how to influence market forces, perhaps even manipulate or direct them. If we aim to progress, we must first decide on the economic system we desire. Do we want a government-led approach, following a five-year plan? Weve tried numerous plans in the past, yet remained impoverished. Vietnam, once poorer than us, changed its course after the war. The Minister of Industries from Vietnam sought advice on promoting foreign investment, a scenario I now find myself reversing. We often aspire to emulate countries like Malaysia or Singapore, yet hesitate to make the necessary decisions. Its time to confront our reality. We must decide on the type of economy we want. For me, only one model is viable: a highly competitive, export-oriented economy. Despite lacking the vast markets or mineral wealth of other nations, were strategically positioned in the Indian Ocean, regaining significance as an economic hub. We cannot afford to dwell in illusions. Economic stabilization measures undertaken will soon be finalized. Are we continuing with an import-dependent economy, rendering past efforts futile? This is the decision we must all make; theres no escaping it. Todays decision for the country isnt about retaining or abolishing the executive presidency; those are secondary concerns. Issues like educational reform are important. What matters most is our future trajectory. If we desire a competitive economy, we must embrace competition. I have faith in Sri Lankan businesses; we can overcome challenges. Its with this confidence that I advocate for our ability to succeed. At the event, distinguished guests including Mr. Per Hoyen, representing the President of the Rotary International and conference president Mr. Kumar Sundararaja, alongside District 3220 Rotary International District Adviser Mr. Pradeep Amirthanayagam, Past Presidents including Mr. R. Ravindran, representatives of Rotary International, office bearers of the District 3220 Rotary International, members and a gathering of esteemed guests graced the occasion. --PMD--",

        "date": "April 27, 2024 10:22 pm",
        "content": "An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia on Saturday afternoon killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said. Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was deeply shocked when he received the news of the blast at the base in Kampong Speu province. It wasnt immediately clear what caused it. Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital. Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs. Four buildings  three for storage and one work facility  were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Col. Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief Gen. Mao Sophan, posted on social media. He added that 25 villagers homes were damaged as well. Cambodia, like many countries in the region, has been suffering from an extended heat wave, and the province where the blast took place registered a high of 39 C (102 F) on Saturday. While high temperatures normally cant detonate ammunition, they can degrade the stability of explosives over a period of time, with the risk that a single small explosion can set off a fire and a chain reaction. Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2:30 p.m., followed by smaller blasts for another hour. Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometer (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by. Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he was army commander before he was elected last year to serve as prime minister, succeeding his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for 38 years before stepping down.

        "content": "Pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on a handful of U.S. university campuses on Saturday, as activists vowed to keep up the movement seeking a ceasefire in Israels war with Hamas among other demands. The Indiana University police department in Bloomington said in an emailed statement that 23 protesters were arrested there. Indiana State Police along with Indiana University police told demonstrators they could not pitch tents and camp on campus. When the tents were not removed, police arrested and transported protesters to the Monroe County Justice Center on charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest. The Indiana University Police Department continues to support peaceful protests on campus that follow university policy, the police statement read. Pro-Palestinian protests have spread to college campuses across the U.S., stoked by the mass arrest of over 100 people on Columbia Universitys campus last week. In addition to a ceasefire, protesters are demanding that their schools divest from companies involved with Israels military and seeking an end to U.S. military assistance for Israel along with amnesty for students and faculty members who have been disciplined or fired for protesting. School leaders at several universities have responded in the past week by asking police to clear out camps and arrest those who refuse to leave. While saying they defend free speech rights to protest, the leaders say they will not abide activists infringing on campus policies against hate speech or camping out on university grounds. Massachusetts State Police said in statement that they helped cleared out a protest encampment at Northeastern University in Boston and that 102 protesters who refused to leave were arrested and will be charged with trespassing. Northeastern University said in a statement on social media that it decided to call in police as what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organizers with no affiliation to Northeastern. At Arizona State University, campus police arrested 69 protesters early Saturday, the school said in a statement. The university said a group of people  most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff  created an encampment and demonstration and were arrested and charged with criminal trespass after refusing to disperse.

Accordingly, the payment of 13 interest rate for the EPF will be ensured for the year 2023, due to good investment performance of the fund, according to the minister. The Finance State Minister made these comments in response to a question raised by a journalist while attending a meeting held in Yatianthota area of Kegalle district. Thus, Siyambalapitiya further clarified that the accusations raised by some stakeholders that the Employees Provident Fund is being destroyed in the past period are meaningless and that the government has decided to increase the amount from 9 to 13 for the year 2023, exceeding the interest rate that was adopted by the Parliament. The largest fund in the country is the EPF with 2.7 million active members, the State Minister mentioned, pointing out that the biggest challenge in the debt restructuring was related to the debts with the EPF. Many people in the Parliament as well as through the media and in the society accused the Employees Provident Fund of a huge loss during the debt restructuring, but the government has given a very reasonable solution for this, he added. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has given its approval for the application of 13 as the interest rate on EPF member balances as of 31 December 2023.",

The unidentified 30-year-old man allegedly bolted through the screening area to breach security at the Sydney International Airport on Friday, 9 News reported. The Australian Federal Police say they were able to stop the man as he was moseying his way toward the tarmac. AFP officers arrested a man, 30, who allegedly ran through the main screening area and gained access to restricted areas, including the apron, said in a statement to the outlet. An apron connects the terminal buildings with the airfield, where baggage and passengers board a plane. Witnesses claimed they saw the man run through the airports immigration control area and onto the airports apron, the Daily Telegraph reported. He had allegedly tried to jump on board the cargo hold of a Sri Lanka-bound flight but was thwarted by baggage handlers. The man is seen walking leisurely across the top of the apron, looking out toward the tarmac, shocking video obtained by 9 News showed. The clip then shows him confronting baggage handlers as they were loading up the Sri Lanka-bound flight, who appeared to be trying to claim him and look around for help. Moments later, police are seen ripping the man off a lift near the cargo hold. As hes slammed to the ground, the suspect is seen resisting three officers who eventually slapped cuffs on him. The intruder was charged with a court attendance notice for breaching restricted areas of the airport. Its suspected the man was experiencing a mental health issue. In February, a man was captured on dramatic video running across the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport and suffered minor injuries when cops collared him. Authorities believe he was under the influence of a substance during the incident. Similarly, in 2021, a woman was captured on video being tackled to the ground as she tried to wave down a plane at LAXs Southwest Airlines gate. She was taken to a local hospital for minor injuries and a mental health evaluation. Source: New York Post --Agencies",

Rival Chinese automakers such as Xpeng have been seeking to gain an advantage over Tesla by rolling out similar software. Musk is looking to obtain approval to transfer data collected in the country abroad to train algorithms for its autonomous driving technologies, the person said. Tesla has since 2021 stored all data collected by its Chinese fleet in Shanghai as required by Chinese regulators and has not transferred any back to the United States. Musks visit to China, first reported by Reuters, was not flagged publicly and the person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak with media. Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, in its report about Musks meeting with Li, did not say whether the two had discussed FSD, or data. Earlier in the day, a separate report carried by state radio said Li had visited the ongoing Beijing auto show and had commented about how Chinas smart new energy vehicle (NEV) sector had gained a leading position in the market and that the country had to work hard and maintain its advantages. Musk also met with Ren Hongbin, a government official who heads the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the organiser of the Beijing auto show, state media reported. It is good to see electric vehicles making progress in China. All cars will be electric in the future, Musk said in a video posted on social media by a user affiliated with state media. Musks trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned visit to India to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing very heavy Tesla obligations. The company said this month it would lay off 10 of its global workforce as it grapples with falling sales and an intensifying price war for EVs led by Chinese brands. U.S. auto safety regulators said on Friday they had opened an investigation into whether Teslas recall of more than 2 million vehicles in the U.S. announced in December to install new Autopilot safeguards was adequate following a series of crashes. LANDED IN BEIJING A Gulfstream private jet with tail number N272BG, which is registered to Falcon Landing, a company connected to SpaceX and Tesla, landed at Beijing Capital Airport on Sunday at 0603 GMT, according to Chinese flight tracking app Flight Manager. The other jet registered under Falcon Landing is N628TS, which is Musks main jet that he used to travel to China on his last trip nearly a year ago, when he met with Chinese government officials in Beijing and visited Teslas Shanghai factory. Tesla has sold more than 1.7 million cars in China since it entered the market a decade ago and the Shanghai factory is its largest globally. Musks visit coincides with the Beijing auto show, which opened last week and ends on May 4. Tesla does not have a booth at Chinas largest auto show and last attended in 2021. GM CEO Mary Barra made an unannounced visit to the show in the worlds biggest auto market on Friday, according to two people with knowledge of her schedule. GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also on Friday, Grace Tao, Teslas vice president in charge of external relations in China, published a commentary on the social media account of state media outlet Peoples Daily, arguing that autonomous driving technologies would be the new growth engine for EV industry. Tao said in the article that Tesla was leading autonomous driving research and development with its end-to-end neural network technology and data collected from millions of cars on the road. Chinas complicated traffic conditions with more pedestrians and cyclists than in many other markets provide more scenarios that are key for training autonomous driving algorithms at a faster pace, according to industry experts. Musk said last week Tesla would introduce new, cheaper models using its current EV platforms and production lines and would offer a new robotaxi with self-driving technology. He said in a post on X this month that he would unveil the robotaxi on Aug. 8. Tesla shares are down almost a third since the start of the year as concerns have grown about the EV makers growth trajectory. Last week, Tesla reported its first decline in quarterly revenue since 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic slowed production and deliveries. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Leader of the National Peoples Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayaka states that opposing political factions might unite in order to ensure that the NPP will not come into power. Addressing a gathering in Stockholm, Sweden, he also stated that Sri Lanka will continue to be unstable until questions regarding the Easter Sunday attacks are clarified and resolved. All opposing factions including Chandrika, Mahinda and Ranil will be joining one platform in the upcoming presidential election. They are already making plans to unite, Dissanayake said. However, personal disputes between Ranil and Sajith will be an obstacle. There wont be any concerns in terms of policies for this unification. They must unite in order to hinder the development of the NPP as well as to prevent the NPP from coming into power, he added. Speaking further, the NPP leader also hinted that the Presidential Election is likely to be held either on September 28 or October 05, 2024. Firstly, we are extending an invitation to you all to come to Sri Lanka during this period. Secondly, we request you to promote our views through social media. Thirdly, we request you all to speak to your relatives regarding the crucial need for an attractive country, he expressed. Dissanayake, who also commented regarding the Easter Sunday attacks, mentioned that it is questionable if those who executed these attacks and those who are supposed to prevent such attacks worked together. If this is the case, then it leads to a critical situation. Many concerns have been raised, he said. Jameel who was at the Taj Hotel went to Dehiwala upon his failure to detonate the bomb. Intelligence officials arrived at his residence on time before he was able to detonate the bomb once again. How is this possible? An individual called Podi Zahran was arrested in the Matale area. Podi Zahran was persuaded to believe that this was an attack conducted by ISIS. Who did this?, the NPP leader questioned. Did Sarah (Jasmine) die or is she missing? These concerns must be clarified, he said, adding that the country will continue to be unstable until these matters are resolved.",

        "date": "April 29, 2024 08:01 am",
        "content": "Tornadoes killed four people in Oklahoma, including an infant, and left thousands without power Sunday after a destructive outbreak of severe weather flattened buildings in the heart of one rural town and injured at least 100 people across the state. More than 20,000 people were still without electricity hours after tornadoes began late Saturday night. The destruction was extensive in Sulphur, a town of about 5,000 people, where a tornado crumpled many downtown buildings, tossed cars and buses and sheared the roofs off houses across a 15-block radius. You just cant believe the destruction, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said during a visit to the hard-hit town. It seems like every business downtown has been destroyed. Stitt said about 30 people were injured in Sulphur, including some who were in a bar as the tornado struck. Hospitals across the state reported about 100 injuries, including people apparently cut or struck by debris, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. An infant was among those killed, Hughes County Emergency Management Director Mike Dockrey told Oklahoma television station KOCO. White House officials said President Joe Biden spoke to Stitt on Sunday and offered the full support of the federal government. The deadly weather in Oklahoma added to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nations midsection since Friday. Another death was reported Sunday in Iowa, where officials in Pottawattamie County said a man critically injured during a tornado Friday had died. In Oklahoma, authorities said the tornado in Sulphur began in a city park before barreling through the downtown, flipping cars and ripping the roofs and walls off of brick buildings. Windows and doors were blown out of structures that remained standing. How do you rebuild it? This is complete devastation, said Kelly Trussell, a lifelong Sulphur resident as she surveyed the damage. It is crazy, you want to help but where do you start? Carolyn Goodman traveled to Sulphur from the nearby town of Ada in search of her former sister-in-law, who Goodman said was at a local bar just before the tornado hit the area. Stitt said one of the victims was found inside a bar but authorities had not yet identified those killed. The bar was destroyed, Goodman said. I know they probably wont find her alive ... but I hope she is still alive. Farther north, a tornado near the town of Holdenville killed two people and damaged or destroyed more than a dozen homes, according to the Hughes County Emergency Medical Service. Another person was killed along Interstate 35 near the southern Oklahoma city of Marietta, state officials said. Heavy rains that swept into Oklahoma with the tornadoes also caused dangerous flooding and water rescues. Outside Sulphur, rising lake levels shut down the Chickasaw National Recreation Area, where the storms wiped out a pedestrian bridge. Stitt issued an executive order Sunday declaring a state of emergency in 12 counties due to the fallout from the severe weather. At the Sulphur High School gym, where families took cover from the storm, Jackalyn Wright said she and her family heard what sounded like a helicopter as the tornado touched down over them. Chad Smith, 43, said people ran into the gym as the wind picked up. The rain started coming faster and the doors slammed shut. Just give me a beer and a lawn chair and I will sit outside and watch it, Smith said. Instead, he took cover. Residents in other states were also digging out from storm damage. A tornado in suburban Omaha, Nebraska, demolished homes and businesses Saturday as it moved for miles through farmland and into subdivisions, then slammed an Iowa town. The tornado damage began Friday afternoon near Lincoln, Nebraska. An industrial building in Lancaster County was hit, causing it to collapse with 70 people inside. Several were trapped, but everyone was evacuated, and the three injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said. One or possibly two tornadoes then spent around an hour creeping toward Omaha, leaving behind damage consistent with an EF3 twister, with winds of 135 to 165 mph (217 to 265 kph), said Chris Franks, a meteorologist in the National Weather Services Omaha office. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spent Saturday touring the damage and arranging for assistance for the damaged communities. Formal damage assessments are still underway, but the states plan to seek federal help. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "10 of Sri Lankas population afflicted with Chronic Kidney Disease - report",
        "date": "April 29, 2024 10:23 am",
        "content": "Around 10 of Sri Lankas population is afflicted with Chronic Kidney Disease, the Chief Patron of All-island Kidney Patients Association Nephrologist Sanjaya Heiyanthuduwa says. Dr. Heiyanthuduwa expressed that the increase in diabetes among the population is the major cause of the increased figures of kidney patients. Especially, diabetes is the main factor affecting kidney damage in Sri Lanka. Better diabetes control should be done to prevent kidney disease in these patients, he said. Additionally, adherence to medical advice and proper attendance at clinics are very important. The intake of excessive salt, sugar, and oil in food should be reduced. A healthy person should consume around three and a half liters of water per day in order to avoid this disease, Dr. Heiyanthuduwa added. According to statistics from the National Kidney Foundation in the United States, 10 percent of the worlds population is affected by chronic kidney disease and it is the 12th most common cause of death. Millions die annually due to a lack of access to affordable treatment. Furthermore, according to an analysis by the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2019, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased by 40 percent over the past 30 years and is one of the fastest-rising major causes of death. Common precursors to CKD include diabetes and hypertension  diseases increasingly endemic to urbanising populations. But across rural Sri Lanka, theres a relatively new phenomenon; chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (cause) (CKDu). A flurry of scientific research studies has provided no concrete reason as to why as many as 22.9 percent of residents in several hotspot areas in the north-central districts of Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura, plus some neighbouring districts, are suffering from acute kidney damage or failure, a recent report published on Al Jazeera news mentioned. On a national level, 10 to 15 percent of Sri Lankans are impacted by kidney diseases, according to Nishad Jayasundara, who is from a farming community in Sri Lanka and now works as an environmental toxicologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, US, and specifically researches the causes of CKDu, it added. The disease disproportionately impacts farming communities, Jayasundara tells Al Jazeera. The current estimates indicate that more than 20,000 people in Sri Lanka are at end-stage kidney failure, with no alternatives left, while 6 to 10 percent of the population in impacted communities are diagnosed with CDKu. A lack of early symptoms While CKD has identifiable symptoms, such as weight loss and poor appetite, swollen ankles or hands, shortness of breath and itchy skin, early on, CKDu is asymptomatic until the latter stages of the disease, so early detection is nearly impossible, say doctors. By the time a patient receives a diagnosis, the disease is usually untreatable. Even when symptoms do appear, they usually include back pain, swelling in the arms and legs and body aches, not uncommon for farmers and fishermen used to hard manual labour. Dr S B A M Mujahith is a nephrologist  a doctor who specialises in treating kidney diseases  at Batticaloa Teaching Hospital on Sri Lankas eastern coast. He grew up just 50km down the coast from Batticaloa in the town of Nintavur and this played an important role in his career choice: It was a community investment, he tells Al Jazeera. CKDu was first identified as an issue in Sri Lanka in the 1990s. Theres a geographical link, says Mujahith  some parts of the eastern and north-central provinces seemed especially hard hit. Many, like himself, wanted to investigate further and identify the causes. A World Health Organisation (WHO) team even came to investigate the causes of CKDu in the 2010s, but ultimately the study was inconclusive. Mujahith likes to use the term chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities (CINAC) since the disease is rather specific to the nations agricultural workers. It affects mainly men  most patients live and work in poor agricultural communities and may be exposed to toxic agrochemicals through work, inhalation, and ingesting contaminated water and food, explains Mujahith. Sri Lanka, a small tropical nation with a population of about 22 million people, is undergoing the fifth year of the worst economic crisis in its history. The result has been limited access to medicine and food which hinders treatment and management of the disease, particularly in remote and under-served places such as Ambagaswewa, the report said. --With agencies inputs",

        "content": "The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) seized 86 kg of suspected heroin worth INR 6.02 billion from a Pakistani boat, which was on its way to Sri Lanka via Tamil Nadu, off the Porbandar coast in Gujarat and arrested 14 crew members on Sunday. The drugs were seized during a joint ICG operation with the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) during which the Indian side opened fire injuring one of the crew members. According to an official release, ATS Superintendent of Police KK Patel received information that Haji Aslam alias Babu Balock, a drug operative from Pakistan, would be sending a boat named Alraza from the Karachi harbour to deliver narcotic substances like heroin and methamphetamine in the intervening night of April 25 and 26 near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) off Porbandar. The said contraband would be delivered to a dhow from Tamil Nadu to be further delivered to Sri Lanka-based drug operatives, the release stated. Later, the joint team of Gujarat ATS and ICG identified a suspicious vessel in the Indian waters 180 nautical miles off Porbandar. The Indian Coast Guard and Gujarat ATS team that had tried to board the vessel for checking was obstructed by the crew of the suspect boat and to restrain the crew and to stop the fleeing vessel, firepower was used in which one member of the crew of the vessel sustained bullet injuries, the ATS stated. A search on the suspect fishing boat, which was carrying 14 crew members  all Pakistan nationals, revealed contraband material. This is the biggest Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance seizure in the country during the current Lok Sabha Elections, said the official statement. All the 14 accused are residents of Lasbela in Pakistans Balochistan. The master of the boat, 62-year-old Nazir Hussain Azam Khan who suffered the bullet injury, was evacuated for further medical care. He has been operated upon and is currently stable. Meanwhile, the boat and its crew members are being brought to Porbandar for further probe. This is the second operation this week after the NCB and ATS seized mephedrone and other chemical drugs worth INR 3 billion from laboratories in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

        "date": "April 29, 2024 01:50 pm",
        "content": "A gold pocket watch worn by the wealthiest passenger on the Titanic has sold for six times the asking price, fetching 900,000. The watch belonged to businessman John Jacob Astor and was estimated to sell for 150,000 when it went under the hammer in Wiltshire. It equalled another Titanic artefact but when taxes and fees are taken into account, the buyer will pay 1.175m. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described the total cost as a world record. The previous highest amount paid for a Titanic artefact was for a violin that also sold for 900,000, but which with taxes and fees at the time took it up to 1.1m. This means the watch is now the highest amount ever paid for a single item from the doomed liner. Titanic folklore A violin case belonging to the man who led the orchestra on the deck as the ship went down in 1912 also fetched 290,000, or 366,000 when taxes and fees are added, at the auction earlier. The two pieces of maritime memorabilia were part of a sale in Devizes of more than 280 lots relating to ocean liners. Titanic was sailing from Southampton to New York when it hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic on the night of 14 April 1912. It sank with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. The disaster is one of the most infamous in maritime history, inspiring books, plays, songs and Hollywood films. The watch and the brown leather violin bag belonged to two people who became enshrined in Titanic folklore. Mr Astor, 47, went down with the ship, after putting his young wife Madeleine into a lifeboat and smoking a last cigarette. While Wallace Hartley, from Colne in Lancashire, and his eight-piece band famously played on to calm passengers as the disaster unfolded around them. Both items were retrieved when the bodies of their owners were recovered from the water. Unlike many timepieces from the Titanic, which are frozen in time on the fateful night, the watch was restored and worn by Mr Astors son, Vincent, said David Beddard, chairman of the British Titanic Society. To be able to see J.J. Astors watch, knowing it was in his pocket as he put his young, pregnant bride in a lifeboat and stepped back, knowing he wasnt going to survive, is remarkable, he added. Mr Hartley went down with the ship, but not before he put his violin back in its leather valise, which he strapped to himself, possibly for buoyancy. Days after the sinking, Mr Hartleys body was recovered with the bag still attached to him. The valise survived quite well, although water-damaged, said Mr Beddard. Many tests were carried out over the course of about five or six years before the violin and case were validated. The recovery of items from victims bodies is always a contentious issue when it comes to collecting. However, were very lucky with the Titanic community that even when items such as these are purchased by individuals, be they millionaires or just ordinary people, they seem to be very generous and they lease or loan these artefacts to go on display. Mr Aldridge, managing director at Henry Aldridge  Son in Devizes, said: Youve got over 2,200 people on that ship, so you have over 2,200 subplots and 2,200 chapters to the story. Each one of those people had an individual tale to tell. We are fascinated in her because of who was on board. You could argue that Titanic is the most famous ship thats ever sailed. The violin, considered to be the rarest and most iconic piece of Titanic memorabilia, according to Mr Aldridge, was auctioned separately in 2013 and sold for a then record price of 900,000. The bag and watch were auctioned alongside a rare order of service for Mr Hartleys funeral that was held on 18 May 1912 in Colne, Lancashire. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The deadline for the Children of Gaza Fund, initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to aid those affected by conflicts in Gaza, has now been extended until May 31, 2024. Originally scheduled to conclude on April 30, 2024, the extension follows a widespread appeal from across the island. Irrespective of background, citizens have rallied behind the Presidents call to support this cause, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. In the initial phase, on behalf of the government, President Ranil Wickremesinghe handed over US 01 million to the Palestinian government through the United Nations from the allocations set aside by ministries and government institutions to hold this years Iftar celebration. Subsequent donations will also be formally transferred to the Palestinian government. Donors are encouraged to continue their contributions until May 31, 2024. Those wishing to donate should deposit their contributions to Bank of Ceylon (7010), Taprobane Branch (747), account number 7040016 before the deadline. Donors are also requested to forward the receipt of their deposit to 077-9730396 via WhatsApp, as per the instructions from the Presidential Secretariat. Meanwhile, in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), expressed sincere appreciation for Sri Lankas substantial financial contribution towards addressing the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Lazzarini emphasized the dire situation faced by over two million Palestinians in Gaza, particularly the majority who are Palestine Refugees under UNRWAs mandate. Despite formidable challenges, UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) staff remains steadfast in delivering essential aid, advocating for adherence to international humanitarian law, and ensuring continuous humanitarian support across Gaza. The contribution from Sri Lanka to the UNRWA Flash Appeal will significantly bolster efforts to address critical humanitarian needs, especially for the more than a million individuals seeking shelter in UNRWA facilities. Highlighting the longstanding underfunding of UNRWAs program budget, Lazzarini underscored the vital role of contributions from partners in enabling the agency to fulfil its mandate effectively. Expressing gratitude for Sri Lankas unwavering commitment to Palestine Refugees and to UNRWA, Lazzarini conveyed confidence in continued support from the Sri Lankan government, it added.",

        "date": "April 29, 2024 04:58 pm",
        "content": "Scotlands leader Humza Yousaf resigned on Monday, further opening the door to the UK opposition Labour Party to regain ground in its former Scottish heartlands in a national election expected later this year. Yousaf quit as head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) after a week of chaos triggered by his scrapping of a coalition agreement with Scotlands Greens. He then failed to secure enough support to survive votes of no confidence against him expected later this week. Resigning little over a year after he replaced Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and SNP leader, Yousaf said it was time for someone else to lead Scotlands devolved government. The SNPs fortunes have faltered over a funding scandal and the resignation of Sturgeon as party leader last year. There has also been infighting over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters. Caught between defending the progressive record of the coalition government and some nationalists demands to jettison gender recognition reforms and refocus on the economy, Yousaf was unable to strike a balance that would ensure his survival. The SNP is losing popular support after 17 years of heading the Scottish government. Earlier this month, polling firm YouGov said the Labour Party had overtaken the SNP in voting intentions for a Westminster election for the first time in a decade. Labours resurgence in Scotland adds to the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks Conservative Party which is lagging far behind Labour in UK-wide opinion polls. The Scottish parliament now has 28 days to choose a new first minister before an election is forced, with former SNP leader John Swinney and Yousafs former leadership rival Kate Forbes seen as possible successors. If the SNP is unable to find a new leader to command support in parliament, a Scottish election will be held. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Immigration and Emigration Department officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake have apprehended two women over their alleged involvement in an attempt to send a Sri Lankan teenage boy to London using forged documents. One of the suspected women had attempted to take the teenager with her to London on Friday (26), using forged documents bearing the details of a Sri Lankan mother currently residing in UK along with her son. The teenager in question has been identified as a 17-year-old boy, Ada Derana reporter said. The woman, who is a resident of the Mullaitivu area, had arrived at the BIA at around 1.30 p.m. on Friday, with intentions to board a SriLankan Airlines flight bound for London accompanied by the boy in question. Upon inspection, a ground staff officer raised suspicions regarding their documents and subsequently referred the matter to the officials of the Border Management Unit of the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Technical inspections had confirmed that the documents were forged. Later, during the interrogations of the teenage boy in question, the officers have uncovered that the documents were indeed forged. He has further admitted that his actual mother was waiting at the departure terminal of the airport. Subsequently, the officers have taken steps to also apprehend the boys biological mother. The trio has been handed over to the custody of officers of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the airport for onward investigations.",

        "date": "April 29, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "Since there is no transparency in the scheme of providing fully electric vehicle licenses to Sri Lankans working abroad and it appears that there are many issues pertaining to the matter, the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance Dr. Harsha de Silva instructed that a full analysis is needed to be carried out jointly with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, Sri Lanka Customs and the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment. He further instructed that a report be submitted within two weeks on the said. Furthermore, until the analysis is received, it is not possible to give approval to the relevant gazette extending the period of licensing, the Chairman of the Committee said. It was also instructed to find out whether foreign remittances, which is the desired objective, have been received at a significant level through this system, or if some persons have misused this facility when preparing this analytical report, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. The Committee Chair stated the said when the Committee on Public Finance took into discussion the Gazette No. 236824 published to extend the period of the scheme for providing fully electric vehicle license to Sri Lankans employed abroad until September 30, 2024, the statement mentioned. According to the circular issued by the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment, the scheme of providing fully electric vehicle licenses to Sri Lankans employed abroad was implemented and luxury car tax concessions of up to Rs 12 million were given to workers who have remitted 20,000 or more to the country. The period of this scheme, which was implemented for the first time from the gazette published on the 10th February 2023, has been extended by the gazette issued on 31st May 2023 and further extended by the gazette of 24.01.2024. The Committee Chair further stated that although the Ministry of Finance had requested the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment to provide all relevant information including the persons whose vehicles were brought from the beginning of this process, the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment has informed that the Attorney General should be inquired about the provision of confidential and private information. However, the Committee pointed out that there is no transparency or proper regulation here, it added. In this context, the Chair stated that many allegations of various irregularities have been reported to the Committee and also stated that through this, vehicles with a tax relief amounting to Rs. 100 million have been imported. It was disclosed that 1,019 licenses have been granted so far and 109.8 million USD remittances have been received through this. The officials also said that the value of the licenses granted so far amounts to 46 million dollars. The Committee Chair pointed out that even if these remittances are added to the account at once, irregularities may occur in the qualification of a foreign worker for this facility and through this system various smugglers will also be given space for money laundering. Furthermore, it was discussed during the Committee that there is a doubt whether the workers who do normal jobs have brought such valuable vehicles. It was also emphasized here that irregularities should not be allowed to happen as this is the only opportunity available for importing vehicles in a background where the import of vehicles is prohibited. Furthermore, the Chair pointed out that there is a group called Facilitator in this process and no information about them has been given. Accordingly, the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment was instructed to provide the same information immediately. Accordingly, the Committee Chair stated that he will have to consider all the information in the future and take a decision on giving approval to this gazette. In addition, three orders published in Special Gazette Nos. 237148, 237149 and 237150 under the Foreign Exchange Act, Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 236927 and 237419 published under the Finance Act No. 25 of 2003 were also considered to which approval was given. State Minister Diana Gamage, Members of Parliament Chandima Weerakkody, Wajira Abeywardana, Mayantha Dissanayake and Dr. Nalaka Godahewa were also present at this Committee meeting held, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "date": "April 29, 2024 10:13 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated the governments commitment to maximizing the contribution of agriculture to the countrys economic advancement. He highlighted the implementation of programs aimed at popularizing cinnamon cultivation, a significant export crop in the countrys history, as part of the agricultural modernization initiative. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending the Dilmah Cinnamon launching ceremony held yesterday (28) at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, the PMD reported. The Dilmah brand, renowned for elevating Ceylon Tea in the global market, has ventured into the Sri Lankan cinnamon industry by expanding its domestic exports through the company, introducing high-quality cinnamon products to the global market. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, alongside President of the World Association of Chefs Societies Master Chef Thomas Gugler, symbolically unveiled Dilmah Cinnamon products. Expressing appreciation for the resurrecting of Ceylon Cinnamon akin to Dilmahs success with Ceylon Tea, the President expressed confidence that this initiative would mark the inception of a new era in the countrys economy. Addressing the gathering the President further said, What you dont realize is that cinnamon is a part of our history. When the Polonnaruwa kingdom collapsed and we moved into the southwest wet zone, the only thing that kept the economy going was cinnamon. If we had no cinnamon, we wouldnt have had the kingdoms of Dambadeniya or Yapahuwa or Gampola or Raigama or Kotte. Thats how closely tied cinnamon is to our history. The ruler of Jaffna was luckier. He had elephants and pearls. But he got ambitious. He got greedy. He thought that he should also get a share of the cinnamon. So, he came, he conquered, he captured Puttalam, got the rulers to pay tribute, but he said that wasnt enough, he must control the trade. So, he decided to come and take over Raigama and Kotte. The Kerala merchants who controlled the trade thought we cant let him go any further. So, they got Alakeshwara, the top man in their number, to build a fort and defeat Arya Chakrawarthi. So thats another part of our history. Why did Parakramabahu VI take over the Kandyan kingdom? Because then he could control all the cinnamon. And the splendor of that kingdom is depicted in the Sela Lihini Sandeshaya. Take the example of Rajasinghe of Sitawaka who fought the Portuguese. He confined them to the forts of Colombo and Negombo. He took over all the cinnamon that was collected in his kingdom and the areas under Kotte. Then he took all the cinnamon and burnt all the low-quality cinnamon, leaving only the high-quality ones. I dont know whether Dilmah has been paying copyrights or royalties to his descendants. So this is how much cinnamon is tied up with our kingdoms. And that provided the money for the Kandyan kingdom to exist. But as cinnamon gave way to coffee and tea, when the price of cinnamon came down, the whole situation changed. But now we see that Sri Lankan cinnamon is still the best in the world. And thank you, Dilmah, for resurrecting the name Ceylon tea, just as you have resurrected the name Ceylon cinnamon. So I hope this is the beginning of our journey. Because we, the government, have also decided that if we are to go ahead with economic transformation, why dont we make use of agriculture? From the time of the Sinhala kings until the British left us in 1948, agriculture was our mainstay. I am not saying to do away with others; all that is essential. But we forgot about agriculture. So, the whole plan for modernization is being discussed. New legislation is being brought in. But it has to be a beneficiary-centric process in which the government and the private sector join together. So as far as cinnamon is concerned, I think youve set the way, and we are here to help you. So, this is the beginning of another chapter in cinnamon, which will see it coming back to its glory. Thanks to Dilmah and whatever support you need, we are here to give it to you. So, all the best to Dilmah and to all of you. Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe, Minister of Health and Industries Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, along with high commissioners and ambassadors, Chairman of the Dilmah Group Mr. Dilhan Fernando  the family including a distinguished gathering graced the occasion. --PMD",

        "date": "April 29, 2024 10:45 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has denounced the recent statement issued by the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles at the Katukurunda STF training camps passing out parade, which garnered widespread attention across various media platforms. According to media reports, the Minister asserted, Eliminating criminals from the country is not a sin. Dont be afraid to use the weapon in your hand for the right thing, and we stand by you. Issuing a statement today (29), the BASL expressed grave concern over the aforementioned statement, deeming it in direct contradiction to the fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution and the established procedures governing the criminal justice system. It said the dispensation of justice, including the imposition of penalties upon wrongdoers, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts as mandated by the Constitution and that such actions must adhere strictly to due process, including thorough investigations and fair trials conducted in accordance with the law. Given the alarming increase in extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, and incidents of torture perpetrated by law enforcement in recent times, the Ministers statement perpetuates a dangerous misconception that justice, sentencing, and punishment lie beyond the purview of the judiciary and can be administered arbitrarily, without adherence to due process, the BASL said. The Bar Association further stressed that the recurring pattern of irresponsible, arbitrary, and misleading remarks by the Minister underscores the urgent need for corrective action. As a custodian of public security, the Minister is duty-bound to serve the interests of the populace. However, the repeated dissemination of such misguided messages not only undermines public trust but also misguides law enforcement personnel, it said. Therefore, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka emphatically called for the immediate retraction of the Ministers statement. The BASL also called upon the President to forthwith remove Minister Tiran Alles from the portfolio of Public Security as he, by his repeated statements encouraging impunity and callous disregard for the rule of law, demonstrates that he is no longer suitable to hold that office. Furthermore, the BASL reaffirmed the sacrosanct principle that the authority to mete out punishment must remain vested solely in the courts, operating within the bounds of established legal procedures. Additionally, the BASL reiterated the fundamental right of every individual accused of an offence to undergo a fair and diligent investigation and to receive a fair trial, as guaranteed by the law and international conventions adhered to by any civilized legal system.",

        "date": "April 30, 2024 09:47 am",
        "content": "Four officers were fatally shot as a U.S. marshals task force was serving a warrant at a home Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, officials said. A suspected shooter was also dead. A marshal and two local officers working with the fugitive task force were killed in the gunfire around 1:30 p.m. Gov. Roy Cooper said that two state Department of Adult Correction officers had died. The citys police chief announced Monday night that a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer who had been wounded, Joshua Eyer, had also died. It was just last month I was in this very room congratulating Officer Eyer for becoming officer of the month in April, Police Chief Johnny Jennings said. And he certainly dedicated his life and gave his life to serve our citizens. The secretary of the state Adult Corrections Department identified two of the other people killed as Samuel Poloche and William Alden Elliott, both of whom had been with the department for 14 years and were on the marshals task force. In total, eight law enforcement officers were shot. The deadly violence happened as a fugitive task force was serving a warrant on a suspect in possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Jennings said the fallen officers were heroes that were just simply trying to keep our community safe. As the task force attempted to serve the warrant, the subject of the warrant, who was not publicly identified, began shooting with a high-powered rifle, Jennings said. Task force members returned fire and killed the suspect in the homes front yard, he said. A Charlotte-Mecklenburg police sergeant was on the task force but was not struck by gunfire, Jennings said. The sergeant called for backup, and thats when the four responding Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers were shot, Jennings said. Police were eventually able to clear the home, Jennings said. Two people inside, one of them 17 years old, were detained as persons of interest. Officials believe two people fired at law enforcement, Jennings said. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, who spoke at Mondays news conference, said the community must honor the deputy marshals who lost their lives and the wounded officers. These are people that cared deeply about what theyve done for our profession, and now today, we have to say to them how much we are grateful for what they have done, Lyles said. Three people lost their lives today. And the most I can ask the community is that we honor and respect them for all the work theyve done. Cooper, the governor, called the incident tragic and said the state is offering assistance. He later offered his condolences to the families and co-workers in the brutal attack. President Joe Biden said Monday night of the slain officers: They are heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice, rushing into harms way to protect us. We mourn for them and their loved ones. And we pray for the recoveries of the courageous officers who were wounded, the president said in a statement. He also called for more funding for law enforcement and for Congress to do more to combat gun violence. Eyer, the CMPD officer whose death was announced Monday night, is survived by his wife and a 3-year-old son, the police chief said. Poloche is survived by a wife and two children, and Elliot and his wife were parents to one child, state Adult Correction Secretary Todd Ishee said in a statement. Source: NBC News -Agencies",

        "title": "Samsung says AI to drive technology demand in second half after strong Q1",
        "date": "April 30, 2024 12:16 pm",
        "content": "Samsung Electronics forecast demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten supply of some high-end chips, joining rivals in benefiting from a solid rebound in the battered global memory chip market. The upbeat outlook from the worlds largest memory chip maker sent its shares 1.8 higher on Tuesday after it reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit. But so far this year Samsung shares are down 0.8, lagging SK Hynixs 24 gain, as it seeks to catch up with its smaller rival in the supply of top-end chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) to AI leader Nvidia. We plan to increase supply of HBM-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year, Jaejune Kim, a Samsung vice president in charge of the memory division, said on an earnings call. Samsung said it began mass production this month of the latest HBM chips for use in generative AI chipsets, called 8-layer HBM3E. It is seeking to capitalise on the AI boom that has benefited SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia. Samsung said it planned to start making the 12-layer version during the second quarter, and expected the latest HBM3E products to account for two-thirds of its HBM output by year-end. Analysts said the targets were aggressive. Samsungs 8-layer HBM3E appears to be supplying Nvidia, while the 12-layer may go to AMD and Nvidia, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. As Samsungs technology is advantageous for high-stacking, while SK Hynix has its advantages in the 8-layer, there may be a segmentation where Nvidia gets 12-layer products from Samsung and most 8-layer products from SK Hynix, Kim said. Samsung is working hard to improve the yield of its 12-layer product. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment on its HBM customers. Samsung also said it will step up offerings of high-end solid-state drive (SSD) products to meet AI server demand, and expected high-end memory chip supply to become tighter toward year-end due to capacity being focused on HBM, echoing comments from SK Hynix last week. MEMORY CHIP PROFIT The South Korean companys first-quarter revenue rose 13 to 71.9 trillion won (52.14 billion), including a 96 increase in memory chip revenue to 17.49 trillion won as prices rose steeply from a severe downturn, partly thanks to the boom in AI. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won in January-March, up from 640 billion won a year earlier. It was the companys highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. The chip division, historically Samsungs cash cow business that used to account for two-thirds of its operating profit, swung to a profit of 1.91 trillion won in the March quarter from a 4.58 trillion won loss a year earlier. It was the first profit since the third quarter of 2022. Prices of NAND flash chips used to store data increased by 23 to 28 during the first quarter versus the previous quarter, while prices of DRAM chips used in tech devices rose by about 20, according to data provider TrendForce. Samsungs mobile devices business booked a 3.51 trillion won operating profit in the first quarter, down from 3.94 trillion won a year earlier. It shipped about 60 million smartphones during the quarter, in line with a year earlier but retaking its title as the worlds top smartphone vendor from Apple, which is suffering a sales decline in China. Rising costs, including increased memory chip prices, dented margins from its flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones launched during the quarter. Samsung said AI functions were driving sales of S24 phones, allowing the division to maintain double-digit profitability in the first quarter. About 50 of customers said they bought S24 phones for the AI functions, and 60 were regularly using the AI functions, the company said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 30, 2024 12:54 pm",
        "content": "At least four people have been killed in a Russian missile strike that hit a Gothic-style building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa. Known to locals as the Harry Potter Castle, its turrets were still burning at nightfall and emergency services graded the blaze severe. Residents reportedly did not have enough time to take shelter as air raid alerts only happened a few minutes before the strike. The type of missile is currently being checked; forensic specialists are carrying out the appropriate evaluations to this end, said a spokesperson for Ukraines Southern Defense Forces, Dmytro Pletenchuk. All services, including the State Emergency Service, are currently working to eliminate the consequences of the missile strike - yet another war crime. Support on its way, vows NATO chief Visiting the capital Kyiv earlier on Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliances members had failed to deliver what they promised to Ukraine in good time, allowing Russia to exploit battlefield advantages. But he did tell Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that support is on the way. Those comments come as Ukrainian forces struggle against Russia on the battlefield, with commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi saying the situation on the frontline had worsened and that his forces had withdrawn from some positions in the Donetsk region. Meanwhile, at a gathering of the 27th International Meeting of Mine Action in Geneva, officials outlined the challenges civilians living in conflict or post-conflict environments face. In Ukraine, because of the nature and the intensity of the conflict, were often seeing double or triple or even quadruple amputees, and a lot of the those injured are in their 20s and 30s, said Paul Heslop, the Programme Manager for Mine Action at UNDP Ukraine. The UN says around 60 million people in 60 countries live from one day to the next unsure if they will step on a landmine or unexploded ordnance left over from a conflict.

        "date": "April 30, 2024 02:05 pm",
        "content": "The government plans to designate 49 more destinations as official tourist zones, says State Minister Diana Gamage. Addressing a press conference on Monday (29), the State Minister for Tourism revealed that these locations would be published in a gazette notification within a month as part of the ongoing efforts to boost tourism. Speaking further, she announced that plans are underway to establish a dedicated committee tasked with preventing and monitoring fraud and corruption within the tourism sector. The State Minister further elaborated, We have received numerous complaints regarding tourist harassment in our country. Ive spoken out about this issue before. Complaints range from overcharging for food to inflated prices for train tickets to tourist spots, and even instances of sexual harassment against a tourist promoting Sri Lanka. We are implementing measures to combat these activities. We cannot afford to let the reputation of our country suffer due to the actions of a few individuals who make mistakes. It is worth noting that the higher prices of railway tickets are often facilitated by corrupt officials. To address this, we are streamlining the process of purchasing tickets online and taking further steps to enhance this system. Such measures can help in controlling corruption and fraud. Similarly, due to the illegal sale of alcohol, our country is losing huge revenue of tax. As a Buddhist country, it is essential to close liquor shops on Poya Days as a mark of respect for Buddhism. However, even on such sacred days, alcohol continues to be sold illegally within our borders. Some officials tasked with preventing such activities have succumbed to bribery. These corrupt actions by a minority hinder the enforcement of law and order in our nation. That is why I have proposed the establishment of a dedicated committee to combat and monitor such fraudulent and corrupt practices. Furthermore, we have identified 49 additional tourist destinations for the advancement of our tourism industry. These sites will be designated as tourism zones and will be officially published in the gazette within a month. Through this initiative, we aim to bolster tourist arrival into our country and promote its diverse attractions. In the past, there have been numerous criticisms regarding the operation of SPAs in our country. While these establishments function as wellness centres in other countries, ensuring the health and safety of our citizens is paramount. Currently, we are engaging in discussions with the Ministry of Health to streamline SPA operations and establish robust monitoring mechanisms.",

We do not believe there is any ongoing threat to the wider community, a spokesperson said. Eyewitness Peter Kingdom says he was outside Hainault station as emergency services arrived, adding he was anxious to get home after finding out what had been happening. The 56-year-old IT analyst from Hainault, said: As I was walking to the station, I saw an ambulance heading towards the scene and another leaving. The road was blocked either side of the station entrance and all transport in the area was suspended. There was a helicopter circling the area. I didnt see the man, just the ambulances, police, etc. I wasnt concerned at first, but was a bit anxious to get back home after finding out what had happened. Wes Streeting, MP for Ilford North, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: A critical incident has been declared in Hainault. There are station and road closures in place.

        "date": "May 1, 2024 12:05 pm",
        "content": "Today is International Workers Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large. The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement. May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers. The date was chosen to be International Workers Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers. While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as Haymarket Martyrs. In Sri Lanka, the holiday is tied to labour movements for trade unions and political parties. The first May Day rally in Sri Lanka was held in 1933 under the leadership of A.E. Gunasinghe, who formed the Labour Party to ensure workers rights. May Day was declared an official holiday in Sri Lanka in 1956 under the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna government, led by former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Labour Day commemorates past labour struggles against workers rights violations, including lengthy workdays and weeks, poor conditions and child labour. Several political parties and trade unions in Sri Lanka are preparing to mark International Workers Day, with various events including rallies and processions organized in towns across the country today.

        "content": "The Vehicle Importers Association insists on the necessity of a proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports in Sri Lanka. President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their associations representatives to make decisions on this matter. When importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85 of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15 new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95 of the vehicles were sourced from Japan, he added. In the future, it is imperative to prioritize the preferences of the people when importing vehicles. If the agents prioritize matters that are not aligned with the requirements of the people, there will likely be a decline in demand, Merinchige said.",
