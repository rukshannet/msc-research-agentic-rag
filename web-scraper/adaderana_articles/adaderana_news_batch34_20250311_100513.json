        "title": "Jay Shah elected unopposed as new International Cricket Council chairman",
        "date": "August 27, 2024 08:40 pm",
        "content": "Jay Shah, the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), was elected unopposed as the new chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday, August 27. At 35, Shah is set to become the youngest person to lead the global cricket governing body after submitting his nomination on the deadline day. He will succeed Greg Barclay, who chose not to seek a third term after assuming the role in 2020. Shah will officially take over as the ICC chair on December 1, 2024. Earlier this month, the ICC announced that elections for the chairman position would only be held if more than one candidate was nominated. On Tuesday, it was confirmed that Shah was the sole nominee for the top job. It remains to be seen who will assume the role of BCCI secretary when Shah vacates the position at the end of November. Shahs election comes at a pivotal time as cricket aims to become a more inclusive global sport. The inclusion of cricket in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 is viewed as a potential turning point in the sports global expansion. Shah has also served as the chair of the ICCs Finance and Commercial Affairs subcommittee, a crucial body responsible for managing the sports financial affairs. Jay Shah has been elected unopposed as the next Independent Chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Shah, who has served as the BCCI Honorary Secretary since October 2019 and Chair of the Asian Cricket Council since January 2021, will assume this prestigious role on December 1, 2024. Shah was the sole nominee for the chairmanship after current Chair Greg Barclay decided not to seek a third term, the ICC said in a statement. Jay Shah will be the fifth man from India after Jagmohan Dalmiya, Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan and Shashank Manohar to lead the ICC. The BCCI secretary, who is also the chief of the Asian Cricket Council, spoke about the need to embrace fresh thinking in a bid to make cricket a truly global sport. We stand at a critical juncture where it is increasingly important to balance the coexistence of multiple formats, promote the adoption of advanced technologies, and introduce our marquee events to new global markets. Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before, Shah said in a statement. While we will build on the valuable lessons learned, we must also embrace fresh thinking and innovation to elevate the love for cricket worldwide, he added. Jay Shah has rapidly risen through the ranks of cricket administration, from his early days at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA). Shahs journey began in 2009 when he became an executive board member of the Central Board of Cricket, Ahmedabad. In September 2013, he was appointed joint secretary of the GCA, where he played a crucial role in the development of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, currently the worlds largest cricket stadium. Shahs success at the GCA laid the foundation for his rise within the administrative ranks of Indian cricket. In 2015, he joined the BCCI, becoming a member of the finance and marketing committees. His influence within the BCCI grew, and in 2019, he was elected as the youngest secretary of the BCCI at the age of 31. During his tenure as BCCI secretary, Shah has achieved significant milestones. One of his most notable accomplishments was the 2022 Indian Premier League broadcasting rights agreement, which broke all previous records, selling for Rs 48,390 crore and making the IPL the second most lucrative sporting event in the world in terms of value per match. Under his leadership, the Indian cricket team has consistently performed well, winning the T20 World Cup earlier this year, and the Asia Cup in 2023, reaching the finals of the 50-over World Cup. Shah, along with former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, won praise for successfully hosting the IPL in 2020 in the UAE in a controlled environment amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

        "date": "August 27, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "A hardline Tamil nationalist party has launched a campaign to boycott the September 21 presidential election, saying that no major candidate has pledged for the federal set-up for political autonomy for Tamils in the North and East of the country, local election monitoring groups said on Tuesday. Moreover, Selvaraja Kajendran, the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) general secretary, has lodged a complaint against the police for obstructing their leaflets distribution campaign on Saturday in the eastern region of Thirukkovil. The TNPF has also urged action by the Elections Commission and the Human Rights Commission against the police for obstructing them. Kajendran said they have called for a boycott of the election as no major candidate has so far pledged to set up a federal set-up for Tamil regions in the north and east to cater to the Tamil demand for political autonomy. We will stop this boycott campaign if anyone offers a federal solution to Tamils, the monitoring group quoted Kajendran as saying. Meanwhile, the Tamil votes in the next months election have been sent into turmoil with different Tamil groups pulling in different directions. The main Tamil party Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is yet to make its position official on supporting which of the front runners from the majority Sinhalese community. A section of TNA has also expressed support for a common Tamil candidate fielded against the partys wishes. The votes of 2.2 million registered voters from the Tamil regions would be crucial for any front-runner to gain the 50 per cent plus one vote required to be declared the winner.

        "date": "August 28, 2024 10:05 am",
        "content": "Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position and that he would present a plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and his two potential successors. The Ukrainian leader, addressing a news conference, said Kyivs three-week-old incursion into Russias Kursk region was part of that plan, but that it also comprised other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts. The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war. And I want that very much - (that it would be) fair for Ukraine, he told reporters in Kyiv of the war launched by Russias full-scale invasion in February 2022. He did not elaborate further on the next steps, but said he would also discuss the plan with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and probably also with Republican Donald Trump, the two nominees for the U.S. presidential election Zelenskiy said he hoped to go to the United States in September to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York and that he was preparing to meet Biden. His remarks indicated that he sees the main potential forum for talks as a follow-up international summit on peace, at which Ukraine has said it wants Russia to have representatives. The first summit to advance Kyivs vision of peace, held in Switzerland in June, pointedly excluded Russia, while attracting scores of delegations, but not from China, the worlds second largest economy, despite Kyivs push to win over the global south. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Aug. 19 that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched a major cross-border incursion into Russias Kursk region on Aug. 6. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Kyiv last week, spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and told him he supported an early and peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict. No compromises with Putin Zelenskiy has been adamant that Russia wants to dictate terms to Ukraine in any settlement of the war, something that Kyiv sees as unacceptable. Putin has said any deal needs to start with Ukraines acceptance of realities on the ground, that would leave Russia with possession of substantial chunks of four Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea. Now Ukraine says it controls more than 1,200 square km (463 sq miles) of Russias Kursk region. There can be no compromises with Putin, dialogue today is in principle empty and meaningless because he does not want to end the war diplomatically, Zelenskiy said at the news conference. He said the offensive into the Kursk region had reduced the number of governments around the world calling for Ukraine to make compromises with Russia to end the war and give up swathes of territory. On the battlefield, Zelenskiy mocked Putin, who he said was prioritising the capture of Ukrainian land over the defence of Russias own territory. He pointed to Kursk region where Ukraine has claimed the capture of 100 settlements, while Russian forces continue to inch forward in the eastern Donetsk region. The Ukrainian leader also said that Kyiv was continuing to make progress on its domestic weapons production and that it had conducted its first test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile.

        "title": "South Asia air pollution fell in 2022, but remains major killer: report",
        "date": "August 28, 2024 10:14 am",
        "content": "A surprise improvement in air quality in South Asia in 2022 drove a decline in global pollution, with favourable weather a likely factor, a new report said Wednesday. But the region continues to breathe the worlds most-polluted air, with its residents losing more than 3.5 years of life expectancy on average, the annual Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) warned. And globally, most countries have either no pollution standards or are failing to meet what they have set, subjecting their citizens to air quality that causes a broad range of health problems. For two decades, air pollution has increased annually in South Asia, but satellite data for 2022 -- the most recent year available -- showed a surprise 18 percent fall. The declines were recorded in every country in the region apart from Sri Lanka, according to the report, produced by the University of Chicagos Energy Policy Institute (EPIC). While it is difficult to conclusively determine what reduced PM2.5 levels across South Asia, it is safe to posit that favourable meteorological conditions may have played a part, the report said, referring to tiny particulates that can travel deep into the body. The widespread nature of the decline, along with the above-average rainfall across the region in 2022, lend support to that theory. Only time will tell whether policy changes are having an impact, the report added, warning that people in South Asia are still breathing air eight times more polluted than the World Health Organization deems safe. Continued observations, efforts towards policy enforcement and monitoring impacts of policy interventions will be critical for understanding and sustaining these reductions, the report said. The decline in South Asia led to a nine percent global drop in air pollution, even as poor air quality spiked elsewhere, including in the Middle East and North Africa, with concentrations up 13 percent from a year earlier. The report warned an ongoing lack of air quality data on the ground is hampering policy-making and implementation. Highly polluted countries that have little or no air quality data often fall into a bad feedback cycle where having little data leads to little attention or policy investment in the issue, which reinforces little demand for data, said Christa Hasenkopf, director of EPICs Clean Air Program. Earlier this year, the centre launched a 1.5 million fund to finance the installation of air quality monitors that offer open data worldwide. Air pollution as a whole receives relatively little funding despite its outsized impact on human health. For example, in some of Africas most-polluted nations, air pollution is a more serious threat to life expectancy than HIVAIDS, tropical diseases, malaria or water, sanitation and handwashing, the report said. There are bright spots, however, including Chinas remarkably successful efforts to combat dirty air. It took measures including restricting the number of cars in big cities, reducing heavy industry capacity and banning new coal plants from certain regions. It has reduced air pollution by 41 percent since 2013, meeting its national standards and adding an average of two years of life expectancy for its citizens, AQLI said. Still, even in China, pollution remains more than five times higher than WHO guidelines, and the benefits of Beijings measures are unevenly spread. Air quality remains poor across several major provinces, and in some prefectures has actually increased since 2013. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Police fired tear-gas and water cannon to disperse protesters marching towards the state secretariat on Tuesday, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in opposition in the state, to call for a 12-hour state-wide strike on Wednesday, to protest against what it said were police atrocities. Thousands of protesters, most of them BJP workers, blocked roads and railway tracks and forced shops to shut down on Wednesday, while authorities braced for more protests through the day. A top police official said 5,000 police personnel were deployed to quell any violence across West Bengal. The protesters on Tuesday, many of them university students, were demanding the resignation of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, a staunch opponent of Modi, for her handling of Aug. 9 rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in a government-run hospital in the state capital, Kolkata. The attack on the 31-year-old doctor has caused nationwide outrage, similar to the widespread protests witnessed after a 2012 gang-rape of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi, with campaigners saying women continue to suffer from high levels of sexual violence despite tougher laws. A police volunteer has been arrested for the crime and the federal police have taken over the investigation. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Speaking during Ada Deranas current affairs programme Big Focus, Gajanayake pointed out that 39 candidates have entered the presidential race, with one of them recently passing away. However, he also raised concern about no official replacement been named for the deceased candidate. I see a weakness in not naming an official replacement for the candidate who passed away, Gajanayake stated. If the process was organized, there would have been a replacement. There should be a Plan A and a Plan B. The lack of transparency is dishonest. Meanwhile, he went on to highlight multiple issues among the remaining candidates as well. Out of the 38 remaining candidates, only 15 have at least organized meetings. Of the 23 who havent, at least a meeting of 10 people has not taken place. I am very responsible in making this statement; only 15 candidates have organized at least a pocket meeting. After calling the phone numbers provided to the Election Commission by them, we found that two of the contact numbers were incorrect, and one candidate just hung up, Gajanayake added. Additionally, the IRES Executive Director said: Five of the 23 candidates dont even have a Facebook account. At least three of the candidates have not made any public statements about their candidacy. Although theyve signed nomination papers and deposited bonds, they have not introduced themselves as candidates anywhere. Furthermore, Gajanayake expressed displeasure that the efforts of relevant authorities to obtain at least the basic information of the aforesaid candidates have been hindered, highlighting that We wanted to upload a passport-sized photograph of each candidate on our website, but for the said 24 of the 39 candidates, it has been impossible to even get a picture of them, Gajanayake signed off.",

The concentrations we saw in the brain tissue of normal individuals, who had an average age of around 45 or 50 years old, were 4,800 micrograms per gram, or 0.5 by weight, said lead study author Matthew Campen, a regents professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Compared to autopsy brain samples from 2016, thats about 50 higher, Campen said. That would mean that our brains today are 99.5 brain and the rest is plastic. That increase, however, only shows exposure and does not provide information about brain damage, said Phoebe Stapleton, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, who was not involved in the preprint. It is unclear if, in life, these particles are fluid, entering and leaving the brain, or if they collect in neurological tissues and promote disease, she said in an email. Further research is needed to understand how the particles may be interacting with the cells and if this has a toxicological consequence. The brain samples contained 7 to 30 times more tiny shards of plastic than samples from the cadavers kidneys and liver, according to the preprint. Studies have found these plastics in the human heart, the great blood vessels, the lungs, the liver, the testes, the gastrointestinal tract and the placenta, said pediatrician and biology professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health at Boston College. Its important not to scare the hell out of people, because the science in this space is still evolving, and nobody in the year 2024 is going to live without plastic, said Landrigan, who was not involved with the preprint. I say to people, Listen, there are some plastics that you cant escape. Youre not going to get a cell phone or a computer that doesnt contain plastic. But do try to minimize your exposure to the plastic that you can avoid, such as plastic bags and bottles. The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN that while some studies on microplastics have recently garnered headlines, just last month the FDA noted, Current scientific evidence does not demonstrate that levels of microplastics or nanoplastics detected in foods pose a risk to human health. Research underway not only helps address current data gaps in our understanding of exposure to microplastics but it also aims to develop improved tools to measure the toxicity of microplastics to humans, said Kimberly Wise White, the councils vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. This work is important given the unvalidated methods often applied by researchers which can lead to unreliable or misleading outcomes, the complex nature of microplastics, and the many variables that can affect human health, she said. Nanoplastics hijack their way into the brain For the study, researchers examined brain, kidney and liver tissues from 92 people who underwent a forensic autopsy to verify cause of death in both 2016 and 2024. Brain tissue samples were gathered from the frontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with thinking and reasoning, and which is most affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and later stages of Alzheimers disease. Based on our observations, we think the brain is pulling in the very smallest nanostructures, like 100 to 200 nanometers in length, whereas some of the larger particles that are a micrometer to five micrometers go into the liver and kidneys, Campen said. Microplastics are fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) or about the size of a pencil eraser, to 1 nanometer. A strand of human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. Nanoplastics are the most worrisome plastics for human health, experts say, because the minuscule pieces can take up residence inside individual cells. Somehow these nanoplastics hijack their way through the body and get to the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier, Campen said. Plastics love fats, or lipids, so one theory is that plastics are hijacking their way with the fats we eat which are then delivered to the organs that really like lipids  the brain is top among those. The human brain is about 60 fat by weight, far more than any other organ. Essential fatty acids, such as omega 3s, are key to the strength and performance of the brains cells. Since the human body cant produce essential fatty acids on its own, they must come from food or supplements. Diet is the main route of exposure for micro- and nanoplastics, said Landrigan, who is the lead author of a March 2023 report from the Minderoo  Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health, a global consortium of scientists, health-care workers and policy analysts charged with following plastics from creation to final product. In that report, the consortium determined plastics are associated with harms to human health at every single stage of the plastic lifecycle. Some microplastics are also airborne, Landrigan said. For example, when people are driving down the highway and their tires are abrading on the surface of the highway, a certain amount of microplastic particles are thrown into the air. If you live near the coast, some of the microplastic particles that are in the ocean get kicked into the air through wave action, he said. So ingestion is probably the dominant route, but inhalation is also an important route. Plastics with ties to cancer Polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags, films and bottles and is not biodegradable, was the predominant type of plastic found in tissue samples. It was found in greater quantities in the brain than in the liver or kidney, according to the preprint. Polyethylene was also the predominant type of polymer found in human and dog testicles, according to an August 2024 study by Campen and his team. The production of various forms of polyethylene, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics, are the biggest contributor to the release of the solvent 1,4-dioxane into the environment, according to industry data collected by Defend our Health, an environmental advocacy group. The US National Toxicity Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer considers 1,4-dioxane to be possibly carcinogenic to humans. In 2023, the EPA released a draft report saying that the solvent poses an unreasonable risk of injury to health for plastics workers and community residents whose drinking water has been polluted by discharges from PET plastics factories. The biggest question is, OK, what are these particles doing to us? Honestly theres a lot we still dont know, Landrigan said. What we do know with real certainty is that these microplastic particles are like Trojan horses they carry with them all the thousands of chemicals that are in plastics and some are very bad actors. By invading individual cells and tissues in major organs, nanoplastics can potentially interrupt cellular processes and deposit endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, heavy metals and per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. We have some pretty good indications that microplastics and nanoplastics cause harm, even though we are a long way from knowing the full extent of that harm, Landrigan said. I would say we have enough information here that we need to start taking protective action. Learn to use less plastic There are many steps individuals can take to reduce their exposure to plastics and their plastic footprint, experts say. Its hard to avoid foods wrapped in plastic film but be sure to take the food out of the plastic wrapping before you cook it or put it in the microwave, Landrigan said. When you heat plastic, that accelerates the movement of the microplastics out of the wrapping into the food. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic, suggested the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office to cut back on plastic cups and utensils. Dont use plastic bags when you go shopping. Use a cloth bag or a paper bag or a recycle bag. Try to avoid plastic water bottles, if you can possibly do so, Landrigan said. A March 2024 study found 1 liter of bottled water the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters typically purchased by consumers contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics. Some 90 of those were nanoplastics. Use a metal or glass drinking cup instead of a plastic cup. Store your food in glass containers instead of in plastic ones, Landrigan said. Work in your local community to ban plastic bags, as many communities around the United States have now done. There is a lot you can do. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "August 28, 2024 05:02 pm",
        "content": "Refugee advocates have gathered to protest the death of a 23-year-old Tamil asylum seeker who died after setting himself on fire in Melbournes south-east. Friends of Mano Yogalingam told the ABC he had arrived in Australia from Sri Lanka in 2013 and had been on a bridging visa for roughly 11 years. A Victoria Police spokesperson said emergency services were called to a skate park in Noble Park on Tuesday night. A man with life-threatening injuries was taken to hospital, where he died on Wednesday, they said. The Tamil Refugee Council said it believed the time Mr Yogalingham had spent on a bridging visa had been a contributing factor to his death. A council spokesperson told the ABC Mr Yogalinghams claim for refugee status was previously rejected under the controversial fast-track system introduced in 2014, an outcome he had been seeking to appeal. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has been contacted for comment and his department has been asked about the status of Mr Yogalinghams visa application. In a brief statement, a Home Affairs spokesperson said the departments condolences were with family members and other people affected at this difficult time. For privacy reasons, the department cannot comment on individual cases, they said. The Tamil community is a minority group in Sri Lanka and its members are largely Hindu or Christian. In recent years, Australian authorities have found Tamils in Sri Lanka face a low risk of official or societal discrimination and a low risk of torture overall  an assessment at odds with some international bodies and the United States. Community in shock at young fathers sudden death Friend Rathy Barthlote said Mr Yogalingham was a strong person, very energetic, very lovely. That kind of strong person, its happened to him, its a shock for everyone, she said. Friends of Mr Yogalingham gathered outside the Home Affairs departments Docklands office on Wednesday to protest the young fathers death. Ms Barthlote said many of those present had also spent years on bridging visas like Mr Yogalingham. She urged the federal government to change its policies so that people who had lived in Australia for years on bridging visas could have certainty. Please, stop this limbo for all of our life, we dont want to lose anyone else anymore, Ms Barthlote said. Give us a permanent residency because we are living this life for more than a decade. We are contributing to this community as much as we can. We are the hard-working people, we are the carers and aged-care workers, we are doing business, everything we are doing our best for the government. Source: ABC News --Agencies",

        "date": "August 28, 2024 05:25 pm",
        "content": "A 4-year-old boy accidentally smashed a Bronze Age jar at an archeological museum in Haifa, Israel. The ancient artifact, which experts say was at least 3,500 years old, was on display without a glass case near the institutions entrance at the time of the incident. In a statement emailed to CNN on Wednesday, the Hecht Museum defended its decision to present certain objects without protective glass, adding that its founder Reuben Hecht had emphasized making artifacts accessible to the public. The museum believes there is a special charm in experiencing an archaeological find without any obstructions, the statement said, adding that the institution would continue this tradition despite the incident. Speaking to the BBC, the childs father said his son had pulled the jar slightly on a visit to the museum last Friday because he was curious about what was inside. The man added that he was shocked to see his son beside the broken artifact and had initially thought, It wasnt my child that did it. The boys parents could not be immediately reached by CNN. The museum believes the artifact dates from between 2200 BC and 1500 BC. Predating the reigns of King David and King Solomon, who ruled the kingdom of ancient Israel and Judah in the 10th century BC, it would have been used for storing and transporting liquids like wine or olive oil. While archaeologists have uncovered similar vessels in the past, most of them were broken or incomplete, according to the museum. The fact the displayed item was discovered intact made it an impressive find, the statement added. Speaking to Israeli news outlet Ynet Tuesday, the museums head Inbal Rivlin invited the boy and his mother, who was also present during the incident, back to the museum for a private tour. The museum is not a mausoleum but a living place, open to families (and) accessible, she told the news outlet, adding: We are appealing to parents: Dont be afraid. Things like this happen. We will fix (the jar) and put it back. Rivlin said the museum had printed new signs indicating which items can, or cannot, be touched. Opened on the grounds of the University of Haifa in 1984, the Hecht Museum contains archeological discoveries dating back to the Chalcolithic period (around 4500 BC to 3500 BC). A restoration expert has been approached to restore the broken jar with the help of photographs, the museum said. The jar will be returned to its place in a short time, the statement continued, adding that the museum would use the restoration as an opportunity to educate the public. The boys father meanwhile told the BBC he was sorry that the jar will no longer be the same item. Source: CNN --Agencies",

Paranawithana had previously served as Deputy Minister of Parliament Reforms and Mass Media and as the Deputy Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training. Prior to that he served as Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media before resigning to contest from the UNP-led alliance the UNFGG in the parliamentary polls in 2015. The Parliament on Friday (23) informed the Election Commission that a vacancy has been created in the House following the resignation of Thalatha Athukorala as a Member of Parliament. Accordingly, the Secretary General of the Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera had communicated to the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing that the Member of Parliament representing the Ratnapura Constituency, Thalatha Athukorala has tendered her letter of resignation as a Member of Parliament with effect from the 21 August 2024 and thus a vacancy has been created following the resignation. This has been informed in terms of the Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. Thalatha Athukorala, who was elected to the Parliament representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in the 2020 general election, informed parliament on August 21 that she will be resigning from her position as a Member of Parliament. Athukorala, the sister of the late United National Party (UNP) politician Gamini Athukorala, first entered Parliament in 2004. She has been re-elected in subsequent general elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020 from the Ratnapura District.

        "date": "August 29, 2024 09:15 am",
        "content": "The United Nations World Food Programme temporarily suspended movement of its employees across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, saying at least 10 bullets struck one of its clearly marked vehicles as it approached an Israeli military checkpoint. WFP said in a statement that a convoy of two armoured vehicles received multiple clearances by Israeli authorities to approach the Wadi Gaza bridge checkpoint on Tuesday evening. Bullets hit one of the vehicles, but no one in it was hurt. Though this is not the first security incident to occur during the war, it is the first time that a WFP vehicle has been directly shot at near a checkpoint, despite securing the necessary clearances, WFP said. It said the vehicle was a few metres from the Israeli checkpoint when it was hit. The Israeli military said in a statement on Wednesday that the incident was under review. The State of Israel is committed to improve coordination and security with humanitarian organizations to ensure the effective delivery of aid within the Gaza Strip, it said. There have been previous incidents of aid and humanitarian organizations coming under fire during the war. In April, three Israeli air strikes hit a convoy of aid vehicles travelling through Gaza, killing seven World Central Kitchen staff. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Wednesday said aid operations in Gaza were heavily restricted by hostilities, insecurity, and mass evacuation orders affecting aid transport routes and facilities. The U.N. Security Council will meet Thursday, at the request of Britain and Switzerland, on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Britains U.N. mission posted on X: The U.N. has warned aid operations and staff in Gaza are at risk, at a time when a vaccine campaign is urgently needed to stop a polio outbreak. The U.N. is preparing to vaccinate an estimated 640,000 children in Gaza, where the World Health Organization said a 10-month-old baby had been paralyzed by the type 2 poliovirus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies. The U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza during the war and distributing it amid total lawlessness in the enclave. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 29, 2024 11:46 am",
        "content": "Telegram founder Pavel Durov is under formal investigation and will not be allowed to leave France, a French prosecutor said in a statement released Wednesday night. The Russian-born billionaire is being investigated for several suspected offenses related to criminal activity on the platform, including complicity in illegal gang transactions, laundering of crimes in an organized gang, and refusal to communicate information to authorities, according to the French prosecutors statement. He must remain in the country under judicial supervision, with a bail set at 5.56 million (5 million euros), and is required to report to the French police station twice a week. Durov was released from police custody in France earlier in the day and transferred to court for questioning, prosecutors told CNN, days after his dramatic arrest at a Paris airport. The formal investigation announced Wednesday evening does not imply guilt in the French legal system, but indicates that prosecutors believe there is enough of a case to merit a serious official investigation. He has not yet been formally charged. Wednesdays prosecutors office statement added that the French National Office for Minors has reported to the prosecutors office the near absence of response from Telegram to court requests concerning offenses that include trafficking, online hate speech, and pedophilia crimes. The suspected acts being probed include complicity in the administration of a platform enabling an illegal transaction in an organized gang, an offense that can carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Durov, 39, was detained at Pariss Bourget Airport on Saturday on a warrant related to Telegrams lack of moderation. He was being investigated on charges relating to a host of crimes, including allegations that his platform was complicit in aiding fraudsters, drug traffickers and people spreading child pornography. Telegram, and its lack of content moderation, has also come under scrutiny for its use by terrorist groups and far-right extremists. He was placed in custody for up to 96 hours, the maximum amount of time someone can be held under French law before being charged. Durovs arrest started a row over freedom of speech, and caused particular concerns in both Ukraine and Russia, where it is extremely popular and has become a key communication tool among military personnel and citizens during Moscows war on its neighbor. Russia criticized Paris on Wednesday for its detention of Durov. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, It seems to me that all this has once again demonstrated the true attitude of the French leadership, which has blatantly trampled on international norms in the field of protecting freedom of speech and expression, for only one reason - because if they protect certain standards, they must not only comply with them, they must protect and implement them. The Kremlin has sought to calm fears in Russia about the future of the app, with Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov attempting to dispel calls for users to delete their sensitive messages on the app. No way political French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said the decision to bring charges against Durov was in no way political, a rare intervention by a French leader into a judicial matter. Telegram was launched in 2013 by Durov and his brother, Nikolai. The app now has more than 950 million users, according to a post from Durov last month, making it one of the most widely used messaging platforms in the world. Conversations on the app are encrypted, meaning that law enforcement agencies  and Telegram itself  have little oversight on what users post. Durov was born in the Soviet Union in 1984, and in his 20s became colloquially known as the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia. He left the country in 2014 and now lives in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered, while also holding French citizenship. He is worth an estimated 9.15 billion, according to Bloomberg, and has maintained a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle over the past decade. But while his app has won plaudits from free speech groups and enabled private communication in countries with restrictive regimes, critics say it has become a safe haven for people coordinating illicit activities - including the terrorists who planned the Paris terror attacks in November 2015. You cannot make it safe against criminals and open for governments, Durov told CNN in 2016. Its either secure or not secure. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 29, 2024 12:06 pm",
        "content": "China had been an easy source of money for past governments and the National Peoples Power (NPP) wants to ensure future investment isnt wasteful, said Harini Amarasuriya, a lawmaker and a member of the NPP. During an interview with the Bloomberg news in Colombo, Amarasuriya, an academic who has become one of the more public faces of the NPPs election campaign, has stated: We dont want easy money coming in to fund unproductive projects and not care about corruption. Thats what we expect of any country, and thats how we would want it to be with China, she assured. Amarasuriya said the NPP wants to maintain ties with China since the country had been one of the few to back Sri Lanka when it faced global scrutiny for human rights violations as the civil war drew to a close. We are cognizant of the fact that China has politically backed us in sensitive moments, she said. And we want to maintain those relations. Meanwhile, commenting to Bloomberg News, a senior economist at Frontier Research in Colombo, Thilina Panduwawela expressed Markets do not have past experience to make a judgment call on NPP policies. And the election itself is too close to call and that is why there is some uncertainty in markets, he added. Amarasuriya said her party was against some of the tax measures Wickremesinghes government was implementing to meet the IMF targets. Even so, she acknowledged that the conditions of the loan program, including the primary balance and the debt-to-GDP ratio, were fairly standard. NPPs presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayakes election manifesto, which was launched on August 26, proposes a number of tax amendments and more oversight on government spending. Hes pledged to increase the income tax-free threshold and equitably amend rates and tax brackets. He also wants to remove some essential health, education and food items from the 18 value-added tax to make them more affordable, Amarasuriya said. The tax threshold has had a huge impact on the middle class and professionals, she said, leading to a severe brain drain with over 3,000 doctors as well as IT and banking personnel having left the country. Amarasuriya added that the current administration has not paid enough attention to some other IMF conditions, including bolstering social security networks and eradicating graft. With corruption, the approach will be to clean it from the top where all elected representatives have to behave based on a code of conduct that is strictly enforced, she said. There will be restrictions on government appointments and the tender processes  two areas where corruption gets initiated, Amarasuriya said. Foreign investors have nothing to fear as the party will make it easier for business by eliminating corruption and putting in systems, she added. --With inputs from Bloomberg News--",

        "date": "August 29, 2024 12:51 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry assured that Sri Lanka will not accept any resolutions brought forward by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) regarding alleged human rights violations during the civil conflict that ended in 2009. Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday (28), he said that Western countries should not base their foreign policies towards Sri Lanka on vote-bank politics, aimed at securing the votes of the Sri Lankan diaspora residing in their nations. The Minister stated: In 2022, the UNHRC brought a resolution against Sri Lanka, and they have submitted a report on that resolution for September this year. We have rejected that resolution. As the period for the current resolution is ending, they would need to introduce a new resolution to continue it. We intend to respond accordingly However, it is important to state that we do not accept the UNHRCs approach, he added. Specifically, we completely disagree with the proposal to initiate a court case in a foreign country, as mentioned in the resolution. This is against our sovereignty and the sovereignty of our legal system. Our judiciary will not allow such interference, the Foreign Affairs Minister said. Commenting further, Ali Sabry highlighted that What we are telling these foreign powers is that we have implemented internal measures to find solutions to the conflict that ended 15 years ago. That is our process. We do not appreciate external forces attempting to create divisions within our communities.  The motivation behind this interference seems to be driven by electoral considerations in Western countries where Sri Lankan diasporas are part of the electorate. This is what we call vote-bank politics, and we reject the idea that these countries foreign policies towards Sri Lanka should be influenced by such considerations, the Minister assured. Furthermore, the Minister said: What does the Human Rights Council know about the economy? We are dealing with the IMF, World Bank, U.S. Treasury, and Japanese Foreign Ministry, who are experts on economic matters. If the Human Rights Council stays within its limits, we will cooperate with them as well, said Minister Ali Sabry. Meanwhile, commenting on the promises made by Presidential candidates to renegotiate with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Sabry warned that doing so could jeopardize approximately USD 1.3 billion in foreign exchange assistance expected in the coming months. The Minister further stated, In 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was assigned a crucial role due to the countrys challenging circumstances. We faced the task of rebuilding strained foreign relations, regaining the trust of the international community, and leveraging international relations to boost the countrys economy. After two and a half years of dedicated effort, we have successfully stabilized the country. Our international reputation now reflects the positive results achieved domestically. It is important to acknowledge that President Ranil Wickremesinghes leadership was instrumental in reaching these outcomes. Securing agreements with 17 countries for debt restructuring through international relations is a significant achievement for us. We have completed the debt restructuring process while upholding our foreign policy, local identity, and sovereignty. Our swift recovery from the economic crisis has set a global example. Currently, countries such as Pakistan, the Maldives, and Bangladesh are seeking our advice on economic revitalization. The leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in stabilizing the country has been recognized internationally. Among the five countriesLebanon, Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe and Greecethat faced similar economic crises, only Greece has managed to recover so far and it took 12 years for Greece to do so. Sri Lanka stands out as the only country to have overcome an economic crisis in such a short period. However, some individuals are misleading the public by advocating for renegotiations with the International Monetary Fund for narrow political objectives. For those considering pursuing this challenging and often unsuccessful process of renegotiation, I wish them good luck. In March 2022, we officially communicated the desire to apply for an extended-fund facility in March 2022. By the time we get the first tranche was March 2023. It took one year for us to agree on the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). The DSA is conducted based on five key parameters. First, the current national debt, which is 133 of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), must be reduced to 95. Additionally, 9.3 of the current payment of the GDP which is going for foreign loan settlement has to be brought down to 4.5. Moreover, the primary budget balance should achieve a surplus of 2.1. Furthermore, tax revenue should account for 15 of GDP. These goals are now legally established and cannot be easily altered. Any attempt to change them would require renegotiation, which would take at least another year. If this happens, the IMF is likely to withhold the next instalment of USD 400 million due in December. If the IMF does not release the funds, the WB will also withhold its USD 400 million tranche. Consequently, the ADB will not release their USD 500 million allocation. This would result in a loss of USD 1.2 billion to USD 1.3 billion between December and January. The loss of these funds would make it impossible to prevent the country from destabilizing again, leading to a potential devaluation of the rupee and a rise in inflation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has undertaken numerous initiatives to support and coordinate the countrys economic recovery. Additionally, it has played a significant role at the Ministerial level in advancing priorities for the Global South in multilateral forums and effectively addressing challenges related to multilateral human rights issues. It is also noteworthy that Sri Lanka has been elected to four mechanisms of the United Nations: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women for the period 2022-2024, the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the UNESCO Executive Board for the period 2023-2027, and the Economic and Social Council for the period 2025-2027.",

        "title": "iPhone 16 hype dims amid rumors of major iPhone 17 upgrade",
        "date": "August 29, 2024 05:06 pm",
        "content": "Apples iPhone 16 is due to launch in two weeks, but were already seeing rumors about its successor, the iPhone 17. On Wednesday, a Chinese leaker said that the iPhone 17 will be a huge upgrade compared to iPhone 16 when it comes to RAM. Apples iPhone 16 models will come with 8GB of RAM, he said, but iPhone 17 will have 12GB of RAM, which will apparently make it more capable to handle advanced AI applications. Then, Apple sleuth Ming-Chi Kuo chimed in in a tweet. According to Kuo only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will come with 12GB RAM, with the other models still limited to 8GB RAM. Enhanced on-device AI capabilities will likely be a major selling point for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, he wrote. Kuo also said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will have an upgraded cooling system combining vapor chamber (VC) technology and graphite sheets, while the other new iPhones launched in 2025 will use graphite sheets alone for thermal management. Theres a lot of assumptions here: We dont even know how much RAM the iPhone 16 will have, as this device hasnt come out. We do know, however, that the iPhone 15 models come with 6GB of RAM, while both the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max have 8GB of RAM. Artificial intelligence (or Apple Intelligence, as Apple calls it) can be resource hungry, so it makes sense for Apple to beef up RAM for next years models. This is not the first rumor weve heard about Apples iPhone 17. Previous reports said that Apple is working on a slim iPhone 17 variant; weve also heard that the iPhone 17 will have an upgraded, 24-megapixel selfie camera, and that the rear camera will be relocated to the top center of the phones back. Apple may shake up its iPhone lineup yet again next year with the introduction of the iPhone 17 Slim, according to analysts reports from tech business news outlet The Information. If true, the shift would be the latest design change Apple has made to its smartphone family in the last four years, coming after it introduced the now-extinct Mini and Plus-sized iPhones in previous years. With the rumored iPhone 17 Slim, Apple appears to be focusing on aesthetics above all else, reports and rumors indicate. As the name implies, the iPhone 17s thinness is expected to be its main draw, unlike the Pro models which rely more heavily on camera quality and processing power to distinguish themselves from Apples standard iPhones. Apple took a similar approach with the 2024 iPad Pro, which the company flaunts as being its thinnest product ever. The iPhone Plus, which Apple launched with the iPhone 14 lineup as a larger-sized base model option, may be phased out in favor of this new iPhone 17 Slim in 2025, says TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This suggests Apple is looking for new ways to get shoppers excited about its non-Pro iPhones, coming after its premium Pro options have been outshining sales of the regular iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The once flagship, now base iPhone 15, is no longer the leading-edge choice, as the Pro and Pro Max models take that role, wrote CIRPs Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz in a May report shared with CNET. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding reports about the iPhone 17 Slim. With the absence of a foldable phone, the iPhone 17 Slim could be a clever way for Apple to get customers excited about the iPhones design again. Heres what we know about it so far. iPhone 17 Slim release date and price If Apple does release a slimmer new iPhone, it will likely do so in 2025 as part of the iPhone 17 lineup, say reports from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu and co-founder and CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants Ross Young (as reported by 9to5Mac). Kuo, Bloomberg and The Information have reported similar findings. Even though Apple may cut the iPhone Plus from its lineup, dont expect the iPhone 17 Slim to be a direct replacement, says Kuo. Instead, its meant to be a new variant entirely rather than another flavor of the base iPhone. The Information reports that it could even be more expensive than the 1,200 iPhone Pro Max. iPhone 17 Slim to get slightly smaller display The iPhone 17 Slim may have a 6.6-inch screen, which would make it slightly smaller than the iPhone Plus and iPhone Pro Max, according to the analyst Pu and Kuo. Both analysts also foresee changes to the iPhone 17 Slims materials too, with Pu saying the iPhone 17 Slim (along with the base and Pro model) will be made of a more complex aluminum material and Kuo reporting the iPhone 17 Slim will have a titanium-aluminum alloy metal frame. The cutout for the Dynamic Island is expected to remain the same size, say both analysts. iPhone 17 Slim may have just one main camera Apple might make a bold choice with the iPhone 17 Slims camera. The companys super-slim iPhone may only have one main wide camera, reports Kuo, meaning it would lack the ultrawide and telephoto lenses that have been staples within Apples premium iPhone lineup for years. The only device in Apples current crop of iPhones to come with one rear camera is the 429 iPhone SE. If true, the move would further underscore that Apple is truly focusing on design above all else with the iPhone 17 Slim, hoping to attract users that want an iPhone that feels new and different rather than one with a souped-up camera. The choice to include just one rear camera would also likely help Apple maintain a trim build without raising the price too high. After all, camera modules, with their sensors and lens elements, can take up quite a bit of space. All iPhone 17 models, including the Slim, will get an upgraded 24-megapixel selfie camera, Pu reports. iPhone 17 Slim processor and other specs The iPhone 17 Slim will likely get other upgrades youd expect with a new phone, such as a new version of Apples mobile processor. Pus report suggests Apple could put an A18 or A19-branded chip in the iPhone 17 Slim, which would reportedly match the chip inside the regular iPhone 17. Other internal components for the iPhone 17 Slim could include 8GB of RAM and an Apple-developed 5G modem, which has been the subject of speculation ever since Apple acquired the majority of Intels smartphone modem business in 2019. What Im most curious about, however, is the iPhone 17 Slims battery. Sleeker designs mean less space for internal components, so Im hoping that battery life isnt the consequence of a significantly thinner design. Either way, its all speculation until Apple announces the iPhone 17 Slim -- if it does at all. But if the reports turn out to be true, the iPhone 17 Slim could signal a turning point for the iPhone, indicating that camera upgrades may no longer be the most exciting or significant annual change. Its fun to speculate about next years iPhone, but for now were far more interested in this years iPhone 16. Apple is scheduled to launch new iPhones, along with new Watches and perhaps a few other devices, on Sept. 9 --With agencies inputs",

Accordingly, the former Minister of Health is currently in remand custody in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate arrest of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

        "date": "August 29, 2024 06:49 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police says that more than 95 of the investigation activities into the recent killing of two persons including businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, also known as Club Wasantha, have been completed thus far. Speaking to the media, Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa stated that accordingly 17 individuals including a woman have been arrested so far, in connection with the shooting incident, which killed 2 persons, while injuring four others in the Athurugiriya area on July 08. Additionally, DIG Thalduwa also highlighted that all the main suspects including the two gunmen related to the case have already been identified, and taken into custody. The police media spokesman further expressed that however, further investigations are still underway regarding the case since a foreign involvement has been observed in connection to the incident. DIG Thalduwa elaborated that the individuals suspected to have been involved in this murder, who are currently hiding overseas, may have been linked with international crime gangs or drug networks. On Wednesday (28), the second gunman and the car driver wanted in connection with the murder, was arrested by the Panadura Police Divisional Crimes Detective Bureau at Pinwaththa in Panadura. The arrested suspects are reportedly aged 29 and 32 while they are residents of Nagoda and Ahugalla areas. The Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) on Friday (23) had arrested one of the suspected gunmen involved in the recent killing of Club Wasantha in the Athurugiriya area. The suspect, identified as 31-year-old Patty Arambage Ajith Rohana, was apprehended by the TID in the Kawdana area of Dehiwala. During the operation, a T-56 assault rifle, 120 rounds of ammunition, and a stock of 9mm pistol bullets were also seized, according to Police. Additionally, another suspect, 29-year-old Tharukara Varuna Indika de Silva, who had aided and abetted by renting a house in Athurugiriya and transporting the shooters to Kataragama in a bus, was also arrested. Police had previously arrested 11 suspects, including a female in connection with the shooting and killing of two persons including Club Wasantha at a tattoo studio in Athurigiriya, while they were further remanded until September 02 by the Kaduwela Magistrates Court recently. Police had arrested eleven suspects including the owner of the tattoo studio in Athurugiriya where the shooting incident took place on July 08 and a 21-year-old female on suspicion of having aided and abetted in the shooting incident.

The shocking shooting incident had occurred during the opening ceremony of a tattoo and piercing studio near the Clock Tower in Athurugiriya on July 08. Six people were rushed to the hospital following the incident. Police later confirmed that 55-year-old businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, popularly known as Club Wasantha, and a 38-year-old male had succumbed to their injuries. Popular singer K. Sujeewa and Wasanthas wife were reported to be among the four injured persons.

        "date": "August 29, 2024 07:22 pm",
        "content": "When a crate escorted by the FBI from New York was opened this week at the national museum of the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, Kaitip Kami instantly recognised the statue inside. It incorporated the skull of a male ancestor of the hill tribes of Malakula, his island home, said Kami, a curator at the Vanuatu Cultural Centre. By looking at it, I knew straight away, he said. I recognise it, where it belongs, up in the bush. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell attended a ceremony on Thursday in Port Vila, the capital, to repatriate five crates of human relics, in the biggest return of such sacred items, ending an eight-year FBI investigation. The contents were two skulls moulded with mud and three large effigies, called rambaramp, each containing the skull of a man, uniquely painted to depict the final stages of his life, Kami said. Probably stolen from a sacred mens house in a bush village, they were seized by the FBI in 2016 from the estate of a deceased New York collector who had amassed 200 sacred items from indigenous cultures around the world. New York is the art capital of the world, and because of that, is the art crime capital of the world, said Chris McKeogh, an agent in the FBIs art crimes team, who travelled to Vanuatu for Thursdays event. We dont know who looted them or took them out of the country, but there is a market in the world for human remains, they are trafficked unfortunately and they are collected, he said in an interview. The return of the Vanuatu effigies, the largest of them 11-12-ft (3.5-m) -long and weighs 700 pounds (318 kg), posed the biggest logistical challenge the art crime team has faced, McKeogh added. They are extremely fragile, probably, the most fragile, objects that we have ever come across, he said. Once seized, they sat in temperature-controlled storage facilities in New York as FBI investigators sought clues to their origin. In 2018, they contacted anthropology professor Holly Cusack-McVeigh at Indiana University to help with the massive, seized collection, she said. Cusack-McVeigh, who recruited her students to identify comparable items in museums worldwide, said the Museum of New Zealand was able to identify the Vanuatu items. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a robust trade in human skulls, funerary items (burial objects) and sacred items from cultural groups throughout the Pacific, she told Reuters. The FBIs Rapid Deployment Team designed a plan for officers to escort the five custom-built crates on a multi-leg journey from Washington to Vanuatu, where the U.S. opened an embassy this year. The Smol Nambas tribe in Malakula stopped practicing rambaramp 50 years ago, after converting to Christianity, said Kami. They can identify a man by his effigy. The tribe did not bury its dead, instead placing bodies on a platform for up to 50 days, before removing the bones. After a year they made a statue, moulding the skull with mud and plant materials and placing it in a sacred mens house. Thats where people go and steal all these things, Kami said. The rambaramp should not be displayed outside Vanuatu because it is part of a human being, Kami said. We are really glad to receive our ancestors - its a happy moment for us. The effigies are the museums biggest repatriation in its efforts to seek the return of relics including human remains from around the world, he said. We deeply respect cultural heritage, the sanctity of these artifacts, Campbell told reporters in Vanuatu. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has stated that there is immense potential for India and Sri Lanka to further strengthen economic cooperation, which would be mutually beneficial considering the complementarity in bilateral ties. He made these remarks during his meeting with Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo yesterday (29), said the Prime Ministers Media Division. Mr. Doval expressed Indias desire to expand cooperation with Sri Lanka further and sought the Prime Ministers views on priority areas. The Prime Minister has identified the energy sector as a key area for collaboration and thanked India for supporting both large-scale and small-scale alternative energy projects. He mentioned that the government has taken steps to amend the Ceylon Electricity Board regulations to facilitate private sector participation in electricity generation and distribution, which could lead to increased Indian investments in solar and wind power projects. Mr. Doval suggested that, in the long run, Sri Lanka could generate more power than its domestic requirements and sell the excess power to India, reaping substantial financial benefits. He highlighted that Bhutan sells a large amount of hydroelectric power to India, which constitutes the largest source of revenue for that country. The Prime Minister explained that Sri Lankas Theravada economic policy is rooted in economic practices from India 25 centuries ago during the time of Gautama Buddha, and these practices could complement modern economic growth. He also thanked India for providing training for members of the armed forces and public servants to enhance their skills and efficiency, said the PMs Media Division.

        "title": "Plot to attack Taylor Swifts Vienna shows was intended to kill thousands, CIA official says",
        "date": "August 30, 2024 08:52 am",
        "content": "The suspects in the foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna earlier this month sought to kill tens of thousands of fans before the CIA discovered intelligence that disrupted the planning and led to arrests, the agencys deputy director said. The CIA notified Austrian authorities of the scheme, which allegedly included links to the Islamic State group. The intelligence and subsequent arrests ultimately led to the cancellation of three sold-out Eras Tour shows, devastating fans who had traveled across the globe to see Swift in concert. CIA Deputy Director David Cohen addressed the failed plot during the annual Intelligence and National Security Summit, held this week in Maryland. They were plotting to kill a huge number tens of thousands of people at this concert, including I am sure many Americans and were quite advanced in this, Cohen said Wednesday. The Austrians were able to make those arrests because the agency and our partners in the intelligence community provided them information about what this ISIS-connected group was planning to do. Austrian officials said the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian man, was inspired by the Islamic State group. He allegedly planned to attack outside the stadium, where upwards of 30,000 fans were expected to gather, with knives or homemade explosives. Another 65,000 fans were likely to be inside the venue. Investigators discovered chemical substances and technical devices during a raid of the suspects home. Austrias interior minister, Gerhard Karner, previously said help from other intelligence agencies was needed because Austrian investigators, unlike some foreign services, cant legally monitor text messages. The 19-year-olds lawyer has said the allegations were overacting at its best, and contended Austrian authorities were presenting this exaggeratedly in order to get new surveillance powers. Swift broke her silence about the cancellations last week after her London shows had concluded. Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating, she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows. She thanked authorities thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives, she wrote and said she waited to speak until the European leg of her Eras Tour concluded to prioritize safety. Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows, she wrote. Swifts publicist did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday. Concert organizer Barracuda Music said it canceled the three-night Vienna run that would have begun Aug. 8 because the arrests made in connection to the conspiracy were too close to showtime. The main suspect and a 17-year-old were taken into custody on Aug. 6, the day before the cancellations were announced. A third suspect, 18, was arrested Aug. 8. Their names have not been released in line with Austrian privacy rules. The shows in London, the next stop after Vienna, came on the heels of a stabbing at a Swift-themed dance class that left three little girls dead in the U.K. In a statement issued after the Southport attack, Swift said she was just completely in shock and at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London. The Vienna plot also drew comparisons to a 2017 attack by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. The bomb detonated at the end of Grandes concert as thousands of young fans were leaving, becoming the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years. Cohen on Wednesday praised the CIAs work in preventing the planned violence, saying that other counterterrorism successes in foiling plots typically go unheralded. I can tell you within my agency, and Im sure in others, there were people who thought that was a really good day for Langley, he said, referring to the CIA headquarters. And not just the Swifties in my workforce. The record-smashing tour is on hiatus until the fall. Source: AP --Agencies",

According to the Election Commission, postal votes can be marked on September 4 at District Secretariats and the offices of the Election Commission. On September 4 and 6, postal votes can be marked at Senior DIG and DIG Offices, SP and ASP Offices, Police Stations, Special Task Force (STF) Camps, Special Police Units, and VIP Security Divisions by uniformed staff and civil workers attached to those offices. On September 5 and 6, postal votes can be marked in Tri-Forces camps and all other government institutions. Additionally, September 11 and 12 have been allocated as additional dates for postal voters who were unable to cast their vote on the initial dates. These voters can mark their postal votes at the District Election Offices in the district where their workplace is located. Proof of identity is mandatory for marking votes and can be provided through a National Identity Card, Valid Driving License, Valid Passport, or a Temporary Identity Card issued by the Election Commission. However, the Election Commission advises that if someone comes to mark postal votes using the official ID card, the officer appointed by the Returning Officer to supervise the marking of postal votes will verify the identity of the voter. In such cases, certifying officers have been instructed that voters presenting the official ID card should not be allowed to mark the ballot paper. Meanwhile, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Elections Asanga Karavita stated that nearly 54,000 police officers will be deployed for election duties. The Presidential Election is scheduled to be held on September 21.",

        "content": "Former Sri Lanka Test cricketer Dulip Samaraweera is facing a Cricket Australia probe amid allegations of serious misconduct towards a female player. As first reported by the Herald Sun, ex-Victoria womens cricket coach Samaraweera has been accused of alleged historic conduct relating to the woman, who played at a professional level. Cricket Australias integrity department is dealing with the matter, with the same outlet reporting that a code of conduct hearing will take place in due course. The 52-year-old former cricketer was in line to take up a coaching role with Australia A womens team during their series against India A, but was stood down once the allegations came to light. Cricket Victoria are unable to comment on the proceedings as they are currently underway, we will make comment on the proceedings at the appropriate time, Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins told the Herald Sun. After retiring as a player, Samaraweera moved to Australia where he has coached for more than a decade. He played five Test matches and seven one-day internationals for his country. Samaraweera worked as an assistant coach in the Victoria womens team as well as the Melbourne Stars in the WBBL. The 52-year-old was promoted to head coach of the Victoria womens team last year but left the role after just two weeks in charge. The Herald Sun reports that his exit was related to his desire to hire his brother - Thilan Samaraweera - as the teams batting coach, in breach of CVs conflict of interest rules. Andrew Christie is now the coach of Victorias womens team. Samaraweera, the same outlet reports, has a strong professional rapport with a number of the states top players, with some initially lobbying for him to keep his role as a batting coach when he departed. He has not publicly addressed the allegations at the time of publication. Source: Mail Online --Agencies",

The long-term observers are a vital element of our mission. Their observations and insights will form the foundation of our impartial and fact-based evaluation of the electoral process, said the Chief Observer, Mr. Nacho Sánchez Amor, a Member of the European Parliament. The EU will employ its robust and well-established methodology of long-term, nation-wide observation, providing a balanced and thorough analysis of the electoral process.

Long-term observers will closely follow key aspects of the election at regional level. Those include, work of local election administration, preparations of election day, campaign activities, as well as activities by civil society organisations and media in relation to the election. Their observation will be supporting the analysis of the core team experts of EU EOM based in Colombo. The observers are drawn from EU Member States and partner countries. Prior to deployment have received extensive briefings on election administration, the political environment, the legal framework, and the media and social landscapes in Sri Lanka. This mission was deployed following an invitation from the Election Commission of Sri Lanka. The EU EOM is led by Chief Observer Mr. Nacho Sánchez Amor, who will officially launch the mission at the press conference on 30 August, in Colombo. As election day approaches, the mission will be further strengthened with 32 short-term observers and observers from the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, as well as partner countries, all of whom will observe the voting, counting, and tabulation of results. The EU EOM will present its preliminary findings in a statement at a press conference two days after election day. A final report offering recommendations for future electoral processes will be published and presented to the authorities after the completion of the entire election process. The EU EOM is bound by a code of conduct, which requires strict neutrality and non-interference.

The violence erupted during a student-led movement against public sector job quotas, which later intensified into an uprising against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned and fled to India on Aug. 5 moments before her residence was stormed by hundreds of protesters. An interim government led by Nobel prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus replaced Hasinas administration, quelling the violence that had flared for weeks before her departure, as security forces cracked down on protests, and continued for some days after she fled. Over 1,000 people have been killed and over 400 students have lost their eyesight, a statement from the health ministry said, quoting its chief Nurjahan Begum. Many have become blind in one eye, many have lost sight in both eyes... many people have leg injuries and many of them had to get their legs amputated, the statement said. The ministry did not mention in its statement how it assessed the death toll, but a home ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he believed it was based on hospital records and information from local administration.

        "title": "Brazil blocks Musks X after company refuses to name local representative amid feud with judge",
        "date": "August 31, 2024 09:45 am",
        "content": "Brazil started blocking Elon Musks social media platform X early Saturday, making it largely inaccessible on both the web and through mobile apps after the billionaire refused to name a legal representative to the country. The move escalates a monthslong feud between Musk and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension on Friday. To block X, Brazils telecommunications regulator, Anatel, told internet service providers to suspend users access to the social media platform. As of Saturday after midnight local time, major operators had begun doing so. De Moraes had warned Musk on Wednesday night that X could be blocked in Brazil if he failed to comply with his order to name a representative, and established a 24-hour deadline. The company hasnt had a representative in the country since earlier this month. Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country, de Moraes wrote in his decision on Friday. The justice said the platform will stay suspended until it complies with his orders, and also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais (8,900) for people or companies using VPNs to access it. In a later ruling, he backtracked on his initial decision to establish a 5-day deadline for internet service providers themselves and not just the telecommunications regulator to block access to X, as well as his directive for app stores to remove virtual private networks, or VPNs. Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk purchased the former Twitter in 2022. Market research group Emarketer says some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month. This is a sad day for X users around the world, especially those in Brazil, who are being denied access to our platform. I wish it did not have to come to this it breaks my heart, Xs CEO Linda Yaccarino said Friday night, adding that Brazil is failing to uphold its constitutions pledge to forbid censorship. X had posted on its official Global Government Affairs page late Thursday that it expected X to be shut down by de Moraes, simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents. When we attempted to defend ourselves in court, Judge de Moraes threatened our Brazilian legal representative with imprisonment. Even after she resigned, he froze all of her bank accounts, the company wrote. X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to comply with orders to block users. Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaros right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. Xs lawyers in April sent a document to the Supreme Court in April, saying that since 2019 it had suspended or blocked 226 users. In his decision Friday, de Moraes cited Musks statements as evidence that Xs conduct clearly intends to continue to encourage posts with extremism, hate speech and anti-democratic discourse, and to try to withdraw them from jurisdictional control. In April, de Moraes included Musk as a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news and opened a separate investigation into the executive for alleged obstruction. Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, has repeatedly claimed the justices actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazils political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant. De Moraes defenders have said his actions aimed at X have been lawful, supported by most of the courts full bench and have served to protect democracy at a time it is imperiled. He wrote Friday that his ruling is based on Brazilian law requiring internet services companies to have representation in the country so they can be notified when there are relevant court decisions and take requisite action specifying the takedown of illicit content posted by users, and an anticipated churn of misinformation during October municipal elections. The looming shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil. Lone Brazilian judges shut down Metas WhatsApp, the nations most widely used messaging app, several times in 2015 and 2016 due to the companys refusal to comply with police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown, arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities requests to block profiles and provide information. He ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the company ultimately complied and stayed online. X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in several countries mostly authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the Twitter revolution, but it has since been restored. A search Friday on X showed hundreds of Brazilian users inquiring about VPNs that could potentially enable them to continue using the platform by making it appear they were logging on from outside the country. It was not immediately clear how Brazilian authorities would police this practice and impose fines cited by de Moraes. This is an unusual measure, but its main objective is to ensure that the court order to suspend the platforms operation is, in fact, effective, Filipe Medon, a specialist in digital law and professor at the law school of Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Rio de Janeiro, told The Associated Press. Mariana de Souza Alves Lima, known by her handle MariMoon, showed her 1.4 million followers on X where she intends to go, posting a screenshot of rival social network BlueSky. On Thursday evening, Starlink, Musks satellite internet service provider, said on X that de Moraes this week froze its finances, preventing it from doing any transactions in the country where it has more than 250,000 customers. This order is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied unconstitutionally against X. It was issued in secret and without affording Starlink any of the due process of law guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil. We intend to address the matter legally, Starlink said in its statement. The law firm representing Starlink told the AP that the company appealed, but wouldnt make further comment. Musk replied to people sharing the reports of the freeze, adding insults directed at de Moraes. This guy Alexandre is an outright criminal of the worst kind, masquerading as a judge, he wrote. Musk later posted on X that SpaceX, which runs Starlink, will provide free internet service in Brazil until the matter is resolved since we cannot receive payment, but dont want to cut anyone off. In his decision, de Moraes said he ordered the freezing of Starlinks assets, as X didnt have enough money in its accounts to cover mounting fines, and reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. While ordering Xs suspension followed warnings and fines and so was appropriate, taking action against Starlink seems highly questionable, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Getulio Vargas Foundations Technology and Society Center. Yes, of course, they have the same owner, Elon Musk, but it is discretionary to consider Starlink as part of the same economic group as Twitter (X). They have no connection, they have no integration, Belli said. Source: AP --Agencies",

This strategic plan is noted as a historic milestone, being recognized as Sri Lankas first Presidential Election Strategic Plan that was brought to life by the peoples opinions. This is the first time Sri Lanka has seen a strategic plan that was presented in draft form for public consultation and intellectual discourse; the final plan was arrived at after eight weeks of extensive feedback from stakeholders, the MJP leader said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). It was our intention that a sincere, sensible election manifesto must be devoid of empty rhetoric and vague promises, and instead be a set of practical strategies that enable us to achieve our objective of a Happy Nation for all Sri Lankans, he said.

        "content": "Former member of the Western Provincial Council, Amal Silva, who was arrested in connection with the investigation into the murder of two persons including businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, also known as Club Wasantha, has been remanded until September 02. This order was issued by the Kaduwela Acting Magistrate. Amal Silva had been arrested and questioned on Thursday (August 29) by the Western Province (South) Crimes Division. A former Western Provincial Councillor, he was arrested on charges of aiding and providing lodging to the second gunman and the car driver involved in the shooting and killing of Club Wasantha in Athurugiriya. Meanwhile, the second gunman and the car driver wanted in connection with the recent killing of two persons including businessman Club Wasantha, were arrested August 28 by the Panadura Police Divisional Crimes Detective Bureau at Pinwaththa in Panadura. The arrested suspects are reportedly aged 29 and 32 and are residents of the Nagoda and Ahugalla areas. According to the police, it has been revealed in the investigation so far that the suspects changed from the car to a van and travelled to Kadawata from there along the Southern Expressway to Matara after carrying out the shooting. The Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) on August 23 had arrested one of the suspected gunmen involved in the recent killing of Club Wasantha in the Athurugiriya area. The suspect, identified as 31-year-old Patty Arambage Ajith Rohana, was apprehended by the TID in the Kawdana area of Dehiwala. During the operation, a T-56 assault rifle, 120 rounds of ammunition, and a stock of 9mm pistol bullets were also seized, according to Police. Additionally, another suspect, 29-year-old Tharukara Varuna Indika de Silva, who had aided and abetted by renting a house in Athurugiriya and transporting the shooters to Kataragama in a bus, was also arrested. The shocking shooting incident had occurred during the opening ceremony of a tattoo and piercing studio near the Clock Tower in Athurugiriya on July 08. Six people were rushed to the hospital following the incident. Police later confirmed that 55-year-old businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, popularly known as Club Wasantha, and a 38-year-old male had succumbed to their injuries. Popular singer K.

        "title": "Japan wants its hardworking citizens to try a 4-day workweek",
        "date": "August 31, 2024 04:52 pm",
        "content": "Japan, a nation so hardworking its language has a term for literally working oneself to death, is trying to address a worrisome labor shortage by coaxing more people and companies to adopt four-day workweeks. The Japanese government first expressed support for a shorter working week in 2021, after lawmakers endorsed the idea. The concept has been slow to catch on, however; about 8 of companies in Japan allow employees to take three or more days off per week, while 7 give their workers the legally mandated one day off, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Hoping to produce more takers, especially among small and medium-sized businesses, the government launched a work style reform campaign that promotes shorter hours and other flexible arrangements along with overtime limits and paid annual leave. The labor ministry recently started offering free consulting, grants and a growing library of success stories as further motivation. By realizing a society in which workers can choose from a variety of working styles based on their circumstances, we aim to create a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution and enable each and every worker to have a better outlook for the future, states a ministry website about the hatarakikata kaikaku campaign, which translates to innovating how we work. The department overseeing the new support services for businesses says only three companies have come forward so far to request advice on making changes, relevant regulations and available subsidies, illustrating the challenges the initiative faces. Perhaps more telling: of the 63,000 Panasonic Holdings Corp. employees who are eligible for four-day schedules at the electronics maker and its group companies in Japan, only 150 employees have opted to take them, according to Yohei Mori, who oversees the initiative at one Panasonic company. The governments official backing of a better work-life balance represents a marked change in Japan, a country whose reputed culture of workaholic stoicism often got credited for the national recovery and stellar economic growth after World War II. Conformist pressures to sacrifice for ones company are intense. Citizens typically take vacations at the same time of year as their colleagues  during the Bon holidays in the summer and around New Years  so co-workers cant accuse them of being neglectful or uncaring. Long hours are the norm. Although 85 of employers report giving their workers two days off a week and there are legal restrictions on overtime hours, which are negotiated with labor unions and detailed in contracts. But some Japanese do service overtime, meaning its unreported and performed without compensation. A recent government white paper on karoshi, the Japanese term that in English means death from overwork, said Japan has at least 54 such fatalities a year, including from heart attacks. Japans serious, conscientious and hard-working people tend to value their relationships with their colleagues and form a bond with their companies, and Japanese TV shows and manga comics often focus on the workplace, said Tim Craig, the author of a book called Cool Japan: Case Studies from Japans Cultural and Creative Industries. Work is a big deal here. Its not just a way to make money, although it is that, too, said Craig, who previously taught at Doshisha Business School and founded editing and translation firm BlueSky Academic Services. Some officials consider changing that mindset as crucial to maintaining a viable workforce amid Japans nosediving birth rate. At the current rate, which is partly attributed to the countrys job-focused culture, the working age population is expected to decline 40 to 45 million people in 2065, from the current 74 million, according to government data. Proponents of the three-days-off model say it encourages people raising children, those caring for older relatives, retirees living on pensions and others looking for flexibility or additional income to remain in the workforce for longer. Akiko Yokohama, who works at Spelldata, a small Tokyo-based technology company that allows employees to work a four-day schedule, takes Wednesdays off along with Saturdays and Sundays. The extra day off allows her to get her hair done, attend other appointments or go shopping. Its hard when you arent feeling well to keep going for five days in a row. The rest allows you to recover or go see the doctor. Emotionally, its less stressful, Yokohama said. Her husband, a real estate broker, also gets Wednesdays off but works weekends, which is common in his industry. Yokohama said that allows the couple to go on midweek family outings with their elementary-school age child. Fast Retailing Co., the Japanese company that owns Uniqlo, Theory, J Brand and other clothing brands, pharmaceutical company Shionogi  Co., and electronics companies Ricoh Co. and Hitachi also began offering a four-day workweek in recent years. The trend even has gained traction in the notoriously consuming finance industry. Brokerage SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. started letting workers put in four days a week in 2020. Banking giant Mizuho Financial Group offers a three-day schedule option. Critics of the governments push say that in practice, people put on four-day schedules often end up working just as hard for less pay. But there are signs of change. A annual Gallup survey that measures employee engagement ranked Japan as having among the least engaged workers of all nationalities surveyed; in the most recent survey, only 6 of the Japanese respondents described themselves as engaged at work compared to the global average of 23. That means relatively few Japanese workers felt highly involved in their workplace and enthusiastic about their work, while most were putting in their hours without investing passion or energy. Kanako Ogino, president of Tokyo-based NS Group, thinks offering flexible hours is a must for filling jobs in the service industry, where women comprise most of the work force. The company, which operates karaoke venues and hotels, offers 30 different scheduling patterns, including a four-day workweek, but also taking long periods off in between work. To ensure none of the NS Groups workers feel penalized for choosing an alternative schedule, Ogino asks each of her 4,000 employees twice a year how they want to work. Asserting individual needs can be frowned upon in Japan, where you are expected to sacrifice for the common good. The view in Japan was: You are cool the more hours you work, putting in free overtime, Ogino said with a laugh. But there is no dream in such a life. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "An estranged husband who claimed he was acting in self-defence when he hacked his wife to death in the Melbourne suburb of Sandhurst has been found guilty of murder by an Australian court. A Victorian Supreme Court jury took less than three hours to deliberate before convicting Dinush Kurera, 47, of murder on Friday. He faced a month-long trial over the death of his wife Nelomie Perera. Kurera admitted to killing her on December 3, 2022, but pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder claiming he acted in self-defence. He took the stand during his trial, telling the jury Ms Perera had threatened him with a knife and bit his finger during a heated argument in their Melbourne home. He claimed to be scared she was going to attack him when he grabbed an axe and hit her only a couple of times. Ms Perera, 43, was found dead in a pool of blood with 35 separate wounds, prosecutors told the jury. Kurera also denied assaulting his 17-year-old son by striking him with an axe as the teen tried to flee the house during the altercation. The jury retired to consider their verdicts on Friday after hearing four weeks of evidence, including from Kureras teenage son and daughter. The girl, who was aged 16 when her mother died, said she saw her father repeatedly strike Ms Perera with a knife and axe, while the boy said Kurera chased him with an axe and hit him as he tried to find help. The jury returned their guilty verdicts at 2pm on Friday, after just under three hours of deliberation. Jurors also found Kurera was guilty of assaulting his son. Kurera blinked and looked straight ahead as the verdicts were handed down. He was returned to custody and will be sentenced at a later date. Source: AAP --Agencies",

        "content": "Three people were dead after a small plane crashed into a row of townhouses Saturday morning in a neighborhood east of Portland, setting the homes ablaze, authorities told KATU-TV. Officials earlier in the day had said the plane was carrying two people and that at least one resident had been unaccounted for. Photos and videos published by KGW-TV in Portland showed one of the townhomes engulfed in flames while black smoke poured out of the adjoining houses. Gresham Fire Chief Scott Lewis said the fire had spread to at least four of the homes, displacing up to six families. He said two people were treated at the scene, but he didnt describe the type or severity of injuries. The Federal Aviation Administration identified the aircraft as a twin-engine Cessna 421C, which it says went down around 10:30 a.m. near Troutdale Airport, about a 30-minute drive east of Portland. As the plane went down, it knocked over a pole and power lines, causing a separate brush fire in a nearby field, according to the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office. The plane was split into multiple parts as it crashed in the residential area in the city of Fairview, which is home to about 10,000 people. Lewis said the first call about the fire came from staff at the Troutdale Airports control tower, who saw a thick plume of smoke rising in the air. But Lewis said that initial reports indicated there was no mayday, no call for emergency from the aircraft itself before it crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the crash. The agency has sent two investigators to the site of the crash who will document the wreckage, spokesperson Peter Knudson said. He did not release further details about the crash. The website for the Port of Portland, which oversees general aviation and marine operations in the Portland area, describes Troutdale Airport as a flight training and recreational airport.

        "content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a visa amnesty program to allow people living illegally in the country to legalise their residency status or depart without facing any penalties. This scheme is projected to last two months, from September 1 to October 31, 2024, VisaGuide.World reports. The Federal Authority For Identity, Citizenship, Customs  Port Security (ICP), as cited by the Khaleej Times, said that people who choose to leave the country during the amnesty period will not be subject to overstay fines, exit fees or entry bans. This means they have the right to re-enter the UAE at any time as long as they have valid visas and related documents. The UAE authorities said the visa amnesty program promotes respect for the law, tolerance, compassion and social cohesion. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) confirmed that the amnesty, declared by the UAEs Authority for Registration of Persons, Customs, and Port Security, offers an opportunity for those without valid visas or the individuals who have absconded from their workplaces without the employers legal permission to regularize their stay or return to their home countries without facing penalties or legal repercussions. During this period, individuals can either leave the UAE or legally process their visa documentation without incurring fines. Accordingly, the SLBFE has urged Sri Lankan nationals residing illegally in the UAE to take advantage of this amnesty, either by rectifying their visa status or arranging to return to Sri Lanka. Who Is Eligible for Visa Amnesty Program? As further revealed, the visa amnesty program covers all categories of visas, including tourists and expired residency visas. In addition, people who were born without documents or those who absconded from their sponsors can apply for amnesty and regularize their status in the UAE. On the other hand, individuals who have entered the UAE irregularly cannot apply for amnesty. Other categories that cannot apply for amnesty include residency and visa violators after September 1, 2024, those who will get an absconding case after September 1, 2024, and individuals with deportation cases in the UAE or any GCC country. Applications May Be Submitted Either In Person or Online Eligible individuals can apply for amnesty in all Amer centres in Dubai and the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) Dubai centre in Al Awir. Amnesty services will also be provided in Abu Dhabi at the Al Dhafra, Suwaihan, Al Maqa, and Al Shahama centres.

        "date": "September 1, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "Israel says its forces have recovered the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies were located on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area. The IDF named the hostages as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. US President Joe Biden said Mr Goldberg-Polin was an American citizen. I am devastated and outraged, Mr Biden said. In its statement on Sunday morning, the IDF said the bodies had been returned to Israeli territory. They were all taken hostage on 7 October 2023 and were murdered by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip. The statement added that their families had already been notified. Meanwhile, President Biden said in a statement that Hersh was among the innocents brutally attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel on 7 October. He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas savage massacre. He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world. I have gotten to know his parents, Jon and Rachel. They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable, Mr Biden said. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held, including at least 27 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Addressing a gathering, Rajapaksa assured that under his tenure such attitudes would be completely eradicated, and instead, a bearable tax policy will be introduced along with efforts to develop national assets with investor aid. Through the implementation of our plan, we will enforce policies to protect local businesses in the country. We will implement policies to safeguard entrepreneurs. The current tax policy has thrust businesses into discomfort, Rajapaksa said. However, under our governance, we will implement a tax policy that the people and businesses can bear. Our policy as such will not result in the reduction of state revenue. Instead of selling off state assets we will ensure that we develop them. Furthermore, the SLPP presidential candidate added: If investors are required, we will take steps to get in touch with such investors. We must not exclusively consider the cheap disposal of state assets and arbitrary taxes to be the only modes of generating state revenue.",

He was halfway through his set at the Town Center Park in the city of Hamden when he collapsed on stage. Mayor Lauren Garrett said in a post to Facebook that the rapper was taken to a local hospital by ambulance. But his booking agency, MN2S, confirmed his death in a statement to the BBC, saying the New York natives legacy will live on through his timeless music. Scoop was a beloved figure in the music world, whose work was loved by countless fans across the globe, an agency spokesperson. His iconic voice, infectious energy, and great personality made an indelible mark on the industry. In a tribute on social media, Scoops family said he was a radiant soul, a beacon of light on the stage and in life. FatMan Scoop was not just a world class performer, he was a father, brother, uncle and a friend, his family said. He was the laughter in our lives, a constant source of support, unwavering strength and courage. Scoop, whose legal name is Isaac Freeman III, has been credited as an influential figure in New York Citys hip hop scene in the 1990s. He has featured on popular songs including Grammy award-winning Lose Control by Missy Elliott and Its Like That by Mariah Carey. Scoop is also known for his sleeper hit Be Faithful, which was originally released in 1999 but garnered international success in 2003, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK.

        "date": "September 1, 2024 02:28 pm",
        "content": "Apple will hold its annual September event on September 9 this year at Apple Park in Cupertino. Dubbed Its Glowtime, the event will see the unveiling of 4 new iPhones and other product launches from the Tim Cook-led company. However, as is the case every year, Apple is likely to discontinue some previous generation devices with the launch of the new iPhone series. Lets take a deep dive into all the devices that could be discontinued after the launch of the iPhone 16 series. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max: A report from Macrumors suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max could be discontinued soon after the iPhone 16 is launched. This move could make a lot of sense, as these are currently the only two iPhones capable of running Apple Intelligence, and the company would want to force buyers to buy the new iPhones in order to experience all the AI features it has to offer. iPhone 14 Plus: Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 Mini after the launch of the iPhone 14 last year, and if this trend continues, the company could discontinue the iPhone 14 Plus this year, leaving only the standard iPhone 14 model on the shelves. If reports are to be believed, Apple is already starting to look beyond its Plus models and could replace them instead with an Air model in the iPhone 17 series. iPhone 13: Launched back in 2021, the iPhone 13 is currently the oldest iPhone for sale and the phone is likely to get the axe after the iPhone 16 series is launched on September 9. AirPods 2 and AirPods 3: Apple will reportedly unveil the new AirPods 4 at its September 9 launch event. The new AirPods are said to come in two variants, one to replace the AirPods 2 and another to replace the AirPods 3. The main difference between the entry-level and mid-range AirPods 4 could be active noise cancellation; the mid-range model could include ANC, while the entry-level model might not. Bloombergs Mark Gurman suggests that AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 could be discontinued after the launch of the new AirPods on September 9. --Agencies",

        "title": "President pledges investigation into accountability for COVID cremation policy that affected Muslims",
        "date": "September 1, 2024 02:28 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed regret for the difficulties faced by Muslims regarding their burial during the COVID-19 pandemic. He announced plans to introduce a new law allowing burial or cremation according to individual preferences. Additionally, the President revealed that a committee will be established to investigate the accountability of those who recommended the cremation of Muslims. Compensation will also be provided to families who suffered injustices as a result. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these statements during the Puluwan Sri Lanka victory rally in Kattankudi yesterday (31). In his address at the public rally, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the country has no place for racism and bigotry as it moves forward. He stressed the importance of all citizensSinhalese, Tamil, and Muslimworking together to strengthen the countrys economy, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, another rally was held yesterday (31) in Sammanthurai to garner support for President Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential election. The event saw a massive turnout. The President also responded to a previous remark by Rishad Bathiudeen, who had said that while the President is good, those around him are not. President Wickremesinghe clarified that the upcoming election is a presidential one, not a parliamentary election. The President mentioned that since those around him are chosen through a parliamentary election, he will seek support from those aligned with MP Rishad Bathiudeen and the Muslim Congress in the upcoming presidential election, provided they are genuinely supportive. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also recalled that although Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and his team pressured the government to reduce the prices of goods, they did not advocate for Muslim rights, such as the issue of burial practices. He emphasized that it was his government that had actively protected the rights of Muslims. Minister Ali Sabry, This upcoming Presidential Election is crucial. If the wrong decision is made, the people will suffer once again. We must not let what happened in 2022 repeat itself. Weve seen how economies in countries like Lebanon and Greece collapsed after voting for change. Except for Greece, no country that faced such an economic crisis has recovered. When the nation was in turmoil, the only leader who stepped forward to save the country and its people was President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Today, we have access to fuel, gas, fertilizer, electricity, and medicine without shortages. Many can make false promises during an election, but you have the right to ask whether they can fulfil them and, if so, how. If we dont manage our expenses properly, the country will inevitably fall back into crisis. Sajith Premadasa lacked the patience to entrust the country for the next five years to the leader who once defended his father during a no-confidence motion. However, we will make sure that President Ranil Wickremesinghe secures victory in this election. Former Governor M. Asad Sally, Its a significant achievement that a country that was unable to repay its debts is now in a position to hold large gatherings like this. By the time this election campaign ends, only a small number of supporters will remain with Sajith Premadasa. Soon, more people will join hands to support the victory of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Anura Dissanayake goes around the country, quoting false statistics and claiming to lead in this presidential election. But the people have not forgotten the history of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). They are not ready to entrust the countrys governance to such individuals. The crowds at rallies are just heads, not votes that will be cast into the ballot box on Election Day. Before asking for votes from the people of this area, I challenge Sajith Premadasa to finish building the 300 houses in Sammanthurai where he once laid the foundation stones. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has already demonstrated his political maturity by earning the peoples trust, which we will see reflected in the election results on September 21st. MP SMM Muszhaaraff; In 2022, we placed our trust in Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but he abandoned us in the middle of the wilderness. When Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake were asked to take the wheel, they refused. They wanted a new vehicle instead. Seeing the state of things, they ran away. It was then that Ranil Wickremesinghe, an experienced technician, stepped in to help. However, despite being stuck in the forest, some people still called out for an artist to save them. Now that weve been rescued, Anura and Sajith, who initially fled, are asking public to hand the vehicle over to them. Are you really prepared to give them the keys? When you compare President Ranil Wickremesinghes manifesto with those of other candidates, it becomes clear how practical his approach is. The oppositions plan to reduce taxes could turn this country into another Venezuela or Greece. MP A.L.M. Athaullah, Anura Kumara, who received only 3 of the votes, and Sajith, whose lack of experience shows their inability, after President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the issues in the country. It is widely understood that Hakeems faction has no chance of winning. President Wickremesinghe stands out as the only leader with the experience needed to resolve any problem of the nation. Our sole condition for working with the President is to collaborate with all Sri Lankans. Additionally, President Wickremesinghes apology for the previous governments mistakes should be remembered as a significant moment in history Former Minister, Daya Gamage; I am delighted to see that all parties, regardless of religion, casts and colours have come together in support of the victory of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The ministers and MPs here today are committed to reinstating him as president not just because he saved our country, but because they dont want to see it return to the dire situation it faced in 2022. Our shared goal is to continue the Presidents work and guide the country forward. Its often said that Sajith Premadasa promises to give whatever is asked of him. But since he wont be president, these promises carry little weight. He can say hell provide anything because he wont have to deliver. On the other hand, the President understands what the people truly need. Its worth noting that individuals like Champika, Hakeem, and Rishad, who seem to be waiting for something in return, are mostly aligned with Sajith. Non- Cabinet Minister, Ali Zahir Moulana, Among the three main candidates in the upcoming presidential election, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only one with the experience and expertise needed. The people of Kattankudy have numerous reasons for supporting him. His election manifesto includes a commitment to addressing land-related issues in the area, for which we are grateful. Additionally, after the recent closure of the private university in the Eastern Province, President Wickremesinghe took swift action to reopen it and enhance higher education opportunities for our children. He has also worked to improve the Kattankudy Base Hospital, responding to long-standing demands for better healthcare. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe has pledged to provide compensation to the families of Muslims killed in Kurukkal Madu in 1990, based on the Nawaz Commissions recommendations. His dedication to resolving issues is the area and focusing on the future of our community is evident. I urge everyone to vote for Gas Cylinder to ensure a secure future for all. Governor of the North Western Province Naseer Ahamed: President Ranil Wickremesinghes victory is now assured. Individuals like Rauff Hakeem and Rishad Bathiudeen are misleading the Muslim community instead of supporting President Wickremesinghe impartially. They have historically guided the people in this manner during past elections. Its important to remember that they have misled the Muslim community on four occasions. However, their endorsed candidates have never won. Given this track record, President Wickremesinghes victory is certain. He is the only leader with a proven history of revitalizing the economy. During the countrys economic crisis, President Wickremesinghe worked tirelessly to address the severe issues faced by the Muslim community. Today, the Muslim community enjoys freedom and security. I urge everyone to show their gratitude by voting for President Wickremesinghe.",

        "title": "Chocolates future could hinge on success of growing cocoa not just in the tropics, but in the lab",
        "date": "September 1, 2024 04:07 pm",
        "content": "Climate change is stressing rainforests where the highly sensitive cocoa bean grows, but chocolate lovers need not despair, say companies that are researching other ways to grow cocoa or develop cocoa substitutes. Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on ways to make more cocoa that stretch well beyond the tropics, from Northern California to Israel. California Cultured, a plant cell culture company, is growing cocoa from cell cultures at a facility in West Sacramento, California, with plans to start selling its products next year. It puts cocoa bean cells in a vat with sugar water so they reproduce quickly and reach maturity in a week rather than the six to eight months a traditional harvest takes, said Alan Perlstein, the companys chief executive. The process also no longer requires as much water or arduous labor. We see just the demand of chocolate monstrously outstripping what is going to be available, Perlstein said. Theres really no other way that we see that the world could significantly increase the supply of cocoa or still keep it at affordable levels without extensive either environmental degradation or some significant other cost. Cocoa trees grow about 20 degrees north and south of the equator in regions with warm weather and abundant rain, including West Africa and South America. Climate change is expected to dry out the land under the additional heat. So scientists, entrepreneurs and chocolate-lovers are coming up with ways to grow cocoa and make the crop more resilient and more resistant to pests  as well as craft chocolatey-tasting cocoa alternatives to meet demand. The market for chocolate is massive with sales in the United States surpassing 25 billion in 2023, according to the National Confectioners Association. Many entrepreneurs are betting on demand growing faster than the supply of cocoa. Companies are looking at either bolstering the supply with cell-based cocoa or offering alternatives made from products ranging from oats to carob that are roasted and flavored to produce a chocolatey taste for chips or filling. The price of cocoa soared earlier this year because of demand and troubles with the crop in West Africa due to plant disease and changes in weather. The region produces the bulk of the worlds cocoa. All of this contributes to a potential instability in supply, so it is attractive to these lab-grown or cocoa substitute companies to think of ways to replace that ingredient that we know of as chocolatey-flavored, said Carla D. Martin, executive director of the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute and a lecturer in African and African American Studies at Harvard University. The innovation is largely driven by demand for chocolate in the U.S. and Europe, Martin said. While three-quarters of the worlds cocoa is grown in West and Central Africa, only 4 is consumed there, she said. The push to produce cocoa indoors in the U.S. comes after other products, such as chicken meat, have already been grown in labs. It also comes as supermarket shelves fill with evolving snack options  something that developers of cocoa alternatives say shows people are ready to try what looks and tastes like a chocolate chip cookie even if the chip contains a cocoa substitute. They said they also are hoping to tap into rising consciousness among consumers about where their food comes from and what it takes to grow it, particularly the use of child labor in the cocoa industry. Planet A Foods in Planegg, Germany, contends the taste of mass market chocolate is derived largely from the fermentation and roasting in making it, not the cocoa bean itself. The companys founders tested out ingredients ranging from olives to seaweed and settled on a mix of oats and sunflower seeds as the best tasting chocolate alternative, said Jessica Karch, a company spokesperson. They called it ChoViva and it can be subbed into baked goods, she said. The idea is not to replace the high quality, 80 dark chocolate, but really to have a lot of different products in the mass market, Karch said. Yet while some are seeking to create alternative cocoa sources and substitutes, others are trying to bolster the supply of cocoa where it naturally grows. Mars, which makes MMs and Snickers, has a research facility at University of California, Davis aimed at making cocoa plants more resilient, said Joanna Hwu, the companys senior director of cocoa plant science. The facility hosts a living collection of cocoa trees so scientists can study what makes them disease-resistant to help farmers in producing countries and ensure a stable supply of beans. We see it as an opportunity, and our responsibility, Hwu said. In Israel, efforts to expand the supply of cocoa are also under way. Celleste Bio is taking cocoa bean cells and growing them indoors to produce cocoa powder and cocoa butter, said co-founder Hanne Volpin. In a few years, the company expects to be able to produce cocoa regardless of the impact of climate change and disease  an effort that has drawn interest from Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate. We only have a small field, but eventually, we will have a farm of bioreactors, Volpin said. Thats similar to the effort under way at California Cultured, which plans to seek permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to call its product chocolate, because, according to Perlstein, thats what it is. It might wind up being called brewery chocolate, or local chocolate, but chocolate no less, he said, because its genetically identical though not harvested from a tree. We basically see that were growing cocoa  just in a different way, Perlstein said. Source: AP --Agencies",
