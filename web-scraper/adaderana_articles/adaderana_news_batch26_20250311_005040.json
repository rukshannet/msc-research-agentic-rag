        "title": "Welfare benefits to be deposited directly into recipients bank accounts",
        "date": "May 23, 2023 05:07 pm",
        "content": "In a bid to address the challenges faced by welfare beneficiaries in receiving their allowances, the Welfare Benefits Board says it has decided to implement a direct crediting system effective from July. The move will ensure that beneficiaries bank accounts are directly credited with the relevant welfare benefits, according to Welfare Benefit Board Chairman B. Wijayaratne. His remarks came during the 101 Katha program produced by the Presidents Media Division (PMD). This encompasses the correction of any previous errors in social welfare benefits and the continuation of existing government assistance programs such as Samurdhi and Elderly Assistance, Wijayaratne added. To further assist those without bank accounts, the Welfare Benefit Board has taken the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of bank accounts for beneficiaries who do not have one. Speaking on the Aswesuma welfare benefits program, the chairman said the selection of beneficiaries is carried out through a centralized data base, ensuring that political affiliations do not influence the assistance provided. The Aswesuma welfare benefit program, initiated by the President as part of the social safety net to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis, is under the purview of Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, with involvement from various Government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. Through this program, financial assistance will be provided to the lower-income group, comprising 40 of society, across four categories and the government aims to offer 15,000 rupees per month to families falling under the extremely poor category, Wijayaratne explained. He further noted that with the implementation of the Aswesuma welfare benefit program starting in July, it is possible for the individuals who have been receiving benefits such as Samurdhi to lose them. This could be due to factors such as having a stable income or not applying for the Aswesuma welfare benefits. The chairman urged the individuals who believe they should be eligible for benefits but are not included in the initial list to submit their appeals. As soon as the list of eligible recipients is published, they can either file an appeal or submit applications during the second phase, commencing after July. He acknowledged allegations that some financially vulnerable individuals were overlooked in the existing welfare benefit programs and that certain beneficiaries, including Samurdhi recipients, were included based on political influence. In response to these concerns and with the intention of addressing the allegations and providing support to those in need, President Wickremesinghe intervened and initiated the Aswesuma welfare benefit scheme, Wijayaratne explained. Starting from August last year, the Welfare Benefit Board invited applications, receiving submissions from over 3.7 million people. Data regarding income and expenses were collected through the Aswesuma mobile app, with additional verification conducted by a dedicated committee at the Divisional Secretariat level. The Welfare Benefit Board chairman said the finalized list of eligible individuals for the Aswesuma welfare benefits will be made available at each Grama Niladhari office and on the Boards official website (https:www.wbb.gov.lk). If an applicants name is not included in the list or if there is someone included who is deemed ineligible for assistance, individuals have the option to file an appeal. Noting that the scheme aims to ensure that no deserving individual is left behind, emphasizing inclusivity and fairness, Wijayaratne said, in addition, for those unable to submit applications during the initial phase, there would be an opportunity to do so during the second phase, after July. Further details regarding this will be communicated through newspapers and media channels.",

The ministries of transport and agriculture, along with authorities in eastern Shandong province, downsized the effort to a 48-hour small-scale investigation from a large maritime search and rescue, CCTV said, citing the transport ministry. The seven ships operating at the size of the disaster were down from 13 a day earlier. The wrecked hull was drifting slowly northeast, the broadcaster added. Sri Lankan divers found and recovered remains in the ships cabin, CCTV said. But it was not immediately clear which of the crew had been found from among those originally on board, made up of 17 Chinese, 17 Indonesians and five from the Philippines. An analysis of the various factors involved in the disaster showed extremely limited air pockets in the wreck to allow for humans to survive, leading to a preliminary finding that there were no survivors, CCTV said, citing the transport ministry.

This was conveyed by Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana, when a fundamental rights (FR) petition filed by Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero was called before a Supreme Court judge bench this morning. The probes are being handled by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures after a video of his sermon was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country. On May 15, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. The New Buddhist Front (Nawa Bikshu Peramuna) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) also lodged a complaint with the CID, seeking the immediate arrest of the Pastor and that strict legal action be initiated against him. Later, an overseas travel ban was imposed against the Pastor on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court yesterday (16 May), as per a request made by the CID. Fernando, however, left for Singapore on May 14. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Police said Pastor Jerome can be arrested upon his return to the island due to the overseas travel ban. On May 18, Ven.

        "content": "Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena says that the train fares need to be revised in order to maintain train fares one-third less than bus fares. Speaking in the parliament this morning (May 24), Minister Gunawardena emphasized that a policy decision should be taken for that purpose, adding that it is time to amend necessary Acts to convert the Railways Department to an authority. Gunawardena, who stated that a loss of around Rs. 10 billion was incurred by the Department of Railways in recent years, pointed out that the total revenue of the Railway Department in 2021 was Rs. 2.6 billion, while an amount of Rs. 2.3 billion was spent on overtime payments and Rs. 7 billion on salaries. There is only one solution to eliminate the inefficiency, corruption and irregularities of the department and to recover this loss. This needs to be digitized, he added. The minister stated that thereby, the ticketing, seat reservation and other processes are expected to be completely digitalized within three months. After that, the fees need to be adjusted. A policy decision should be taken to maintain the train fares one-third less than the bus fares and the fare should be revised accordingly, he expressed. Minister Gunawardena, who stated that it is hard to make decisions as a department, highlighted that the railway service should deviate from the departmental system in order to maintain efficiency. He said he would instruct the trade unions and relevant authorities to revise the Act passed in the 2001-2002 period to convert the Railways Department into an authority.",

        "date": "May 24, 2023 03:17 pm",
        "content": "The World Health Organization on Tuesday (May 23) commended Sri Lanka for enacting a legislation on trans-fat to protect health and prevent premature deaths from coronary heart disease. Eliminating trans-fats from food supplies is a cost-effective measure with enormous health benefits. By enacting legislation on trans-fat, Sri Lanka has once again demonstrated its resolve to protect and promote health of its people, said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia. The legislation restricts levels of industrially produced trans fats in oil and food, and bans partially hydrogenated oils, the primary source of trans fats in food. Since 2018 WHO has been working with countries for eliminating trans fat from food supply. High trans fat intake increases the risk of death from any cause by 34, coronary heart disease deaths by 28 and coronary heart disease by 21. In WHO South-East Asia Region, 9 million deaths, almost 69 percent of all deaths, are due to non-communicable diseases, with cardiovascular diseases being a major cause. WHO has been advocating for multi-sectoral approach to address non-communicable diseases in South-East Asia Region as flagship priority since 2014. The Regional Director said accelerating progress towards eliminating trans-fat through best-practice policies, monitoring and surveillance and healthy oil replacements can drive progress in our efforts to address non-communicable diseases. In 2018, WHO released REPLACE, a step-by-step guide to help achieve elimination of industrially produced trans-fatty acids from the global food supply by 2023. The Region continues to make significant headway against trans fats, in collaboration with Resolve to Save Lives by implementing the REPLACE protocol across Member countries. By 2022, Thailand, India and Bangladesh had adopted regulations for the elimination of trans fatty acids in the food supply. With Sri Lanka implementing new regulations, the collective efforts by countries would now potentially protect over 1.6 billion people from the harm caused by trans fatty acids. Nepal and Indonesia are making good progress to limit trans fats and Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar and Timor-Leste have made policy commitments. Implementation of trans fat regulations to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases is part of SEA HEARTS initiative launched recently by the South-East Asia Region that aims to accelerate action to reduce deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. Trans fats can be easily replaced with healthier alternatives without compromising the taste or availability of food, to enhance the health and wellbeing of people and also help attain the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets of reducing premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases by one-third by 2030.",

        "title": "Chinese hackers attacked Kenyan government as debt strains grew",
        "date": "May 24, 2023 03:44 pm",
        "content": "Chinese hackers targeted Kenyas government in a widespread, years-long series of digital intrusions against key ministries and state institutions, according to three sources, cybersecurity research reports and Reuters own analysis of technical data related to the hackings. Two of the sources assessed the hacks to be aimed, at least in part, at gaining information on debt owed to Beijing by the East African nation: Kenya is a strategic link in the Belt and Road Initiative - President Xi Jinpings plan for a global infrastructure network. Further compromises may occur as the requirement for understanding upcoming repayment strategies becomes needed, a July 2021 research report written by a defence contractor for private clients stated. Chinas foreign ministry said it was not aware of any such hacking, while Chinas embassy in Britain called the accusations baseless, adding that Beijing opposes and combats cyberattacks and theft in all their forms. Chinas influence in Africa has grown rapidly over the past two decades. But, like several African nations, Kenyas finances are being strained by the growing cost of servicing external debt - much of it owed to China. The hacking campaign demonstrates Chinas willingness to leverage its espionage capabilities to monitor and protect economic and strategic interests abroad, two of the sources said. The hacks constitute a three-year campaign that targeted eight of Kenyas ministries and government departments, including the presidential office, according to an intelligence analyst in the region. The analyst also shared with Reuters research documents that included the timeline of attacks, the targets, and provided some technical data relating to the compromise of a server used exclusively by Kenyas main spy agency. A Kenyan cybersecurity expert described similar hacking activity against the foreign and finance ministries. All three of the sources asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of their work. Your allegation of hacking attempts by Chinese Government entities is not unique, Kenyas presidential office said, adding the government had been targeted by frequent infiltration attempts from Chinese, American and European hackers. As far as we are concerned, none of the attempts were successful, it said. It did not provide further details nor respond to follow-up questions. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Britain said China is against irresponsible moves that use topics like cybersecurity to sow discord in the relations between China and other developing countries. China attaches great importance to Africas debt issue and works intensively to help Africa cope with it, the spokesperson added. THE HACKS Between 2000 and 2020, China committed nearly 160 billion in loans to African countries, according to a comprehensive database on Chinese lending hosted by Boston University, much of it for large-scale infrastructure projects. Kenya used over 9 billion in Chinese loans to fund an aggressive push to build or upgrade railways, ports and highways. Beijing became the countrys largest bilateral creditor and gained a firm foothold in the most important East African consumer market and a vital logistical hub on Africas Indian Ocean coast. By late 2019, however, when the Kenyan cybersecurity expert told Reuters he was brought in by Kenyan authorities to assess a hack of a government-wide network, Chinese lending was drying up. And Kenyas financial strains were showing. The breach reviewed by the Kenyan cybersecurity expert and attributed to China began with a spearphishing attack at the end of that same year, when a Kenyan government employee unknowingly downloaded an infected document, allowing hackers to infiltrate the network and access other agencies. A lot of documents from the ministry of foreign affairs were stolen and from the finance department as well. The attacks appeared focused on the debt situation, the Kenyan cybersecurity expert said. Another source - the intelligence analyst working in the region - said Chinese hackers carried out a far-reaching campaign against Kenya that began in late 2019 and continued until at least 2022. According to documents provided by the analyst, Chinese cyber spies subjected the office of Kenyas president, its defence, information, health, land and interior ministries, its counter-terrorism centre and other institutions to persistent and prolonged hacking activity. The affected government departments did not respond to requests for comment, declined to be interviewed or were unreachable. By 2021, global economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic had already helped push one major Chinese borrower - Zambia - to default on its external debt. Kenya managed to secure a temporary debt repayment moratorium from China. In early July 2021, the cybersecurity research reports shared by the intelligence analyst in the region detailed how the hackers secretly accessed an email server used by Kenyas National Intelligence Service (NIS). Reuters was able to confirm that the victims IP address belonged to the NIS. The incident was also covered in a report from the private defence contractor reviewed by Reuters. Reuters could not determine what information was taken during the hacks or conclusively establish the motive for the attacks. But the defence contractors report said the NIS breach was possibly aimed at gleaning information on how Kenya planned to manage its debt payments. Kenya is currently feeling the pressure of these debt burdens...as many of the projects financed by Chinese loans are not generating enough income to pay for themselves yet, the report stated. A Reuters review of internet logs delineating the Chinese digital espionage activity showed that a server controlled by the Chinese hackers also accessed a shared Kenyan government webmail service more recently from December 2022 until February this year. Chinese officials declined to comment on this recent breach, and the Kenyan authorities did not respond to a question about it. BACKDOOR DIPLOMACY The defence contractor, pointing to identical tools and techniques used in other hacking campaigns, identified a Chinese state-linked hacking team as having carried out the attack on Kenyas intelligence agency. The group is known as BackdoorDiplomacy in the cybersecurity research community, because of its record of trying to further the objectives of Chinese diplomatic strategy. According to Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET, BackdoorDiplomacy re-uses malicious software against its victims to gain access to their networks, making it possible to track their activities. Provided by Reuters with the IP address of the NIS hackers, Palo Alto Networks, a U.S. cybersecurity firm that tracks BackdoorDiplomacys activities, confirmed that it belongs to the group, adding that its prior analysis shows the group is sponsored by the Chinese state. Cybersecurity researchers have documented BackdoorDiplomacy hacks targeting governments and institutions in a number of countries in Asia and Europe. Incursions into the Middle East and Africa appear less common, making the focus and scale of its hacking activities in Kenya particularly noteworthy, the defence contractors report said. This angle is clearly a priority for the group. Chinas embassy in Britain rejected any involvement in the Kenya hackings, and did not directly address questions about the governments relationship with BackdoorDiplomacy. China is a main victim of cyber theft and attacks and a staunch defender of cybersecurity, a spokesperson said. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 24, 2023 03:59 pm",
        "content": "Investigators in Guyana believe a fire that killed 19 mostly girls trapped in a school dormitory was deliberately set by a student who was upset that her mobile phone was confiscated, a top official said Tuesday. The suspect in the fire late Sunday, who is among several injured people, had been disciplined by the dorm administrator for having an affair with an older man, National Security Adviser Gerald Gouveia said. The student allegedly threatened to torch the dorm and later set a fire in a bathroom area, Gouveia said. The fire raced through the wood, concrete and iron-grilled building after it had been locked for the night by the dorm administrator  or house mother  to prevent the girls from sneaking out, Gouveia said. The girl, who is about 14, was burned in the fire and is in a hospital in the area. She expected to be released from the hospital this week and held in juvenile detention until she is an adult, said Leslie Ramsammy, an adviser to the health ministry. She did this out of love for them. She felt she was forced to do so because many of them leave the building at night to socialize, Gouveia told The Associated Press. This is a very sad situation, but the state is going to work with the students and the families to provide all the support they need. All but one of the victims were Indigenous girls aged 12 to 18 from remote villages served by the boarding school in Mahdia, a mining community near the Brazil border. The remaining victim was the five-year-old son of the house mother. Many of the victims were trapped as the building burned, though firefighters were able to rescue people by breaking holes through one of the walls. The house mother was asleep at the time inside the building but panicked and could not find the right keys to unlock the building from inside but she made it out. She also lost her five-year-old child in the fire, Gouveia said. Many of the nine people hospitalized are in serious condition. Police were expected to charge the man who had the relationship with the student with statutory rape because she was under 16, Gouveia said. Guyanas government has accepted offers from the US to send forensic and other expert teams to help with the investigation, Gouveia said. The government also was sending specialists in DNA identification to help identify remains of 13 of the 19 victims who died at the scene. Leaders from all over the world have been offering to help us at this time. They were calling and messaging President Ali (Irfaan) while he was on the ground in Madhia on Monday, Gouveia said. Madhia is a gold and diamond mining town about 200 miles from the capital, Georgetown. Deputy Fire Chief Dwayne Scotland told the AP that more lives could have been saved if the service had been informed of the blaze sooner. When firefighters arrived, local residents were unsuccessfully struggling to douse the blaze and evacuate people, he said. The building was well engulfed, he said. This weeks dormitory fire outranked what had been the countrys deadliest fire in recent times, when 17 inmates were killed at the main Georgetown prison in 2016. Angry over trial delays and overcrowding, some inmates set fire to the building, built to house 500 but containing 1,100, resulting in the deaths of the 17 and severe injuries to about a dozen others.

        "date": "May 24, 2023 07:13 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardene says that measures will be taken to secure over 300 unprotected railway crossings across Sri Lanka within two months. Speaking in the parliament today (May 24), Minister Gunawardene pointed out that the total number of completely unprotected railway crossings in Sri Lanka is 330. There are a total of 1,177 railway crossings across the island. Among them, 438 level crossings have been protected with colour lights and 434 with bells and lights. However, the minister further emphasized that 100 more railway crossings will completely be secured during the renovation activities of the Northern railway line. The rest is 330 crossings, he said, adding There are 04 totally unprotected level crossings on the coastal line, 30 on the Kelani Valley line, 24 on the Puttlam Line and 101 on the Main Line. Minister Gunawardene also expressed that the Ministry of Transport has mentioned that bamboo gates will be provided to secure those unprotected crossings. However, this is not the response. I carried out a personal study into this issue. A number of lives have been lost due to unprotected railway crossings recently, he claimed. Gunawardene, who expressed that there has been a huge cost of around Rs. 4 million per railway crossing to establish colour lights or gates, claimed that the relevant cost is estimated to be around Rs. 8 million at present. Furthermore, the minister stated that the State Engineering Corporation, together with Mr. Harsha Subasinghe, who has contributed to several new innovations including the production of Vega; South Asias first all-electric super car, has looked into the matter on his request, and presented a project to complete the construction of all 330 unprotected railway crossings in two months. The cost is only Rs. 1 million per level crossing, he added. However, he highlighted that neither the Treasury nor the Railways Department can afford that cost at the moment, adding that therefore, the National Council for Road Safety will provide Rs. 0.5 million per railway crossing, while the remaining cost needs to be obtained from the private sector. Therefore, I invite the private sector entrepreneurs to provide us with the remaining amount as a social service. We will provide the opportunity to publish their commercials, he said. The minister stated that they would be able to deploy individuals for the operation of the rail gates from the Multi-Purpose Development Task Force. Thereby, we expect to complete this project with the assistance of both state and private sector within two months, Minister Gunawardene added.",

Part of the bump came from India, which wants to keep Chinas expansion in its neighbour in check. Indias Adani group signed up for two wind power plants worth 442 million last year. In the first quarter, Sri Lanka has already received proposals worth 600 million, said BoI Director General Renuka Weerakone, with 22 new projects and six expansions. The acid test is really in what comes in, that is what really helps the economy, she told Reuters. Sri Lanka is banking on information technology, solar and wind, bunkering and mineral processing to attract investments. Indias MCS Group has signed a 20 million deal for mineral processing, the largest Sri Lanka has received so far in 2023, Weerakone said. Other countries are also keen. Japan is very interested in minerals, so is China, she said. The raw material we have is something we can really pitch to get new investments. Sri Lanka has untapped deposits of graphite, phosphate and other minerals to attract investors but policy frameworks are yet to be updated, creating a bottleneck for FDI, Weerakone added. Over the last decade, China has invested about 3 billion in Sri Lanka, accounting for nearly a quarter of its FDI, while India made up about 1.3 billion. In the last two years, India took the lead, followed by the United Kingdom in 2022 and Netherlands in 2021. Sri Lanka is also drawing up plans to identify new islands for investors to help resuscitate its 4 billion tourism industry. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 25, 2023 08:19 am",
        "content": "Los Angeles (AFP)  Tina Turner, the trailblazing rocker whose powerful voice and imposing stage presence thrilled global audiences for decades, died Wednesday at the age of 83. Tributes poured in from around the world, with some of musics biggest names lamenting the loss of a singular and instantly recognizable performer, whose popularity spanned generations. Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger -- who, legend has it, learned his dance moves from the diva, said the world had lost an enormously talented performer and singer. She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her. Bandmate Ronnie Wood called Turner the Queen Of Rock And Soul and a dear friend. Fans lined up to pay tribute at the wrought iron gates of her huge compound in Kusnacht, on Switzerlands Lake Zurich, many bearing candles and flowers. Chateau Algonquin had been the home Turner shared with her German husband Erwin Bach for almost three decades, including when she took Swiss citizenship in 2013, and relinquished her US passport. The world has lost an icon, Swiss President Alain Berset said. US President Joe Biden paid a pointed tribute to a once-in-a-generation talent that changed American music forever. Tinas personal strength was remarkable, Biden wrote. Overcoming adversity, and even abuse, she built a career for the ages and a life and legacy that were entirely hers,  he added, calling Turner simply the best. Bidens former boss, Barack Obama called her a star whose light will never fade. Tina Turner was raw. She was powerful. She was unstoppable. And she was unapologetically herself  speaking and singing her truth through joy and pain; triumph and tragedy, Americas first Black president wrote of the star held up as a Black icon. Turners Britain-based publicist Bernard Doherty said her death came after a long illness, and had robbed the world of a music legend and a role model. He gave no details of the illness. The Best A career that would go on to net eight Grammy Awards began in the 1960s in a partnership with husband Ike Turner. The pair recorded a number of hits together throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and while he was credited as being the brains behind the operation, she was always clearly the more talented. After their troubled and violent marriage collapsed -- she fled in 1976 mid-tour -- Tina Turner forged a wildly successful solo career. The following decades gifted the world instantly recognizable hits like Whats Love Got to Do With It?, Private Dancer and the anthemic The Best. Her We Dont Need Another Hero featured on the soundtrack to Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the 1985 post-apocalyptic thriller starring Mel Gibson. A decade later she oozed her way through Goldeneye, joining the select ranks of artists who have sung on the James Bond franchise. Reaction to Turners death came from across the worlds of music, entertainment and sport. Fellow singer Gloria Gaynor took to Instagram to hail Turners mold-breaking career, and how she paved the way for so many women in rock music, black and white. She did with great dignity and success what very few would even have dared to do in her time and in that genre of music. She will be sorely missed. Mariah Carey called Turner the embodiment of a legendary superstar. She was an incredible performer, musician and trailblazer. To me, she will always be a survivor and an inspiration to women everywhere, she wrote. Angela Bassett, who played the singer in the 1993 biopic Whats Love Got to Do With It opposite Laurence Fishburne as Ike, paid emotional tribute to a woman who owned her pain and trauma and used it as a means to help change the world. Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion and freedom should look like, Bassett said. Basketball legend Magic Johnson posted a picture with the songstress -- one of my favorite artists of all time. Ive seen her many many times and hands down, she gave one of the best live shows Ive ever seen, he tweeted. Actor Forest Whitaker praised Turners voice, her dancing, and her spirit. But he also hailed her ability to bounce back, in a nod to the difficulty of escaping her troubled marriage to Ike. As we honor her, lets also reflect on her resilience, and think about all the greatness that can follow our darkest days. Source: AFP",

He conveyed this during the bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. We have made remarkable headway as far as the debt restructuring talks are concerned, Reuters quoted President Wickremesinghe as saying. He has also expressed confidence that the island nation should be able to conclude the newly-launched debt restructuring talks by September, or November at the latest. Citing a Japanese official, Reuters said the meeting between the two leaders, their first since last September, is unlikely to generate a new initiative but both sides would take a stock of the efforts to restructure debt. President Wickremesinghe also met with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this morning and invited Japanese investments while outlining the economic recovery in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan leader also attended a breakfast meeting hosted by former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and the Japan-Sri Lanka Association in Tokyo earlier today, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Wickremesinghes meeting comes after Japan, India and France jointly unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate debt restructuring. The island nation defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history in April last year as the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 crushed its economy. The IMF called this week for timely restructuring pacts with the countrys creditors. The global lender said Sri Lankas macroeconomic situation was improving, although earlier it had predicted the economy would contract this year. -with inputs from Reuters",

        "content": "Addressing the Nikkei Forum on the Future of Asia in Tokyo, a short while ago, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted Asias significance as the worlds largest economy, home to 60 of the global population, and a major contributor to global growth. He emphasized the regions potential for continued growth, supported by Chinas recovery, Indias domestic demand, and the contributions of advanced economies like Japan and South Korea. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted three major challenges facing Asia in his address at the Nikkei Forum in Tokyo, the Presidents Media Division reported. He said democratic values and human rights, climate change, and trade integration are key challenges and emphasized the importance of respecting the diverse political systems and definitions of human rights across Asian countries. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that Asia has become the global economic powerhouse and the most dynamic region, with its economy already comparable in size to Europe and North Americas economies. In his address, he also stressed on climate change, which poses significant threats to Asia, adding that rising temperatures in the region, leading to severe weather events and rising sea levels, are impacting the livelihoods, food security and exports of Asian countries. President Wickremesinghes speech focused on trade integration and debt sustainability and highlighted the risks faced by Asian countries, emphasizing the importance of upholding the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core, rejecting economic coercion and decoupling. He emphasized that Asian countries do not want to be forced to choose between big powers and highlighted the economic interdependence between ASEAN countries and China and expressed opposition to the bifurcation of Asia. President Wickremesinghe supported a cooperative approach by Japan and called for open-ended dialogues among Japan, China, India, and ASEAN, adding that it is crucial for the emergence of a peaceful and prosperous Asian region. A single Asian voice devoid of disharmony needs to be present at COP 28. The success of this conference will depend on the ability of the key Asian nations to come to an agreement, he said. Sri Lanka welcomes the pledge made at the G7 Hiroshima Leaders Communique to reject decoupling and its strategies in favour of economic resilience and economic security. To this end, the G7 has undertaken to engage in dialogue and follow a cooperative approach within the group as well as with global partners - including developing countries, said President Wickremesinghe, adding that it is appropriate that the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core be upheld. The President said that by mid-century, rising waters will impact nearly a billion people in the Asia-Pacific region. He told the Nikkei Forum, It is regrettable that as many as eight of the fifteen countries affected by climate change are from Asia.",

Regarding the conveyance of lands, the COPE directed the Mahaweli Authority to submit the following: (1) Report on existing land conveyance procedure to be submitted within 02 weeks. (2) Report on how lands conveyed for investment purposes was completed including details of the investor, purpose of investments, etc. to be submitted within 02 weeks. (3) Report on illegal constructions taking place within the purview of the body to be submitted within 01 month. Following an incongruence between the annual report submitted to parliament and the data sought out by the Auditor Generals office, the COPE called for an urgent report of all lands released in 2022. This comes on the heels of the Presidents directive where a stay order was made on the issuance of lands. The COPE, upon scrutinizing the Recruitment Process Management, found that there were vacancies that had not been filled up owing to suspected reservations for promotions to the existing staff internally. The Chairman of COPE immediately directed that the vacancies be filled within the next 60 days.

Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, says its weapons are capable of reaching Israel and U.S. bases in the region. Despite opposition from the United States and European countries, Tehran has said it would further develop its defensive missile programme. Our message to Irans enemies is that we will defend the country and its achievements. Our message to our friends is that we want to help regional stability, said Iranian Defence Minister Mohammadreza Ashtiani. State TV broadcast what it said was footage of an upgraded version of Irans Khoramshahr 4 ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles) that can carry a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) warhead. State News agency IRNA said the missile was called Kheibar, a reference to a Jewish castle overrun by Muslim warriors in the early days of Islam. Israel, which the Islamic Republic does not recognise, sees Iran as an existential threat. Iran says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the United States, Israel and other potential regional adversaries. On Tuesday, the top Israeli general raised the prospect of action against Iran as efforts by six world powers to revive Tehrans 2015 nuclear deal have stalled since last September amid growing Western fears about Tehrans accelerating nuclear advances. The nuclear agreement, which Washington ditched in 2018, imposed restrictions on Irans nuclear activities that extended the time Tehran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says that collective policy measures are painful for businesses and households and that such measures are imperative to prevent devastative impacts of the soaring inflation and economic instability, and to restore economic conditions that are essential for economic stakeholders. Speaking at the National Policy Symposium for promoting investments and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka in Colombo this morning (25), Weerasinghe mentioned that the recent economic crises resulted in numerous uncertainties and instability in the country, which directly affected investments and business sentiments. The CBSL chief, who pointed out that the sharp rise in inflation eroded the profitability of the entrepreneurs, also emphasized that it hampered new investment due to lower investable profits. Sharp rise in inflation, which is a key interest of businesses, eroded the profitability of the entrepreneurs and hampered new investment due to lower investable profits. Inflation is the number one enemy for any economy, as we experienced. Now its coming down gradually, he added. The CBSL recognized the need to restore price stability interest of low inflation to ensure macroeconomic stability, he said, added that it is the key objective to decisive measures to control the rise in inflation, and also balance of payments. Speaking further, Dr. Weerasinghe stated that two of the issues that the country had, were the rise in inflation and the foreign exchange crisis, noting that the CBSL has taken very decisive measures to curtail and prevent inflation from rising further. We have taken very decisive measures to curtail and prevent inflation rising, going out of control and went to the peak of 70, now its under 30 that certainly will be a single digit by the fourth quarter of this year with the measures that we have implemented. Collective policy measures are painful for businesses and households. In the short run, such measures are imperative to prevent devastative impact of rising inflation and economic instability to restore economic conditions that are essential for economic stakeholders including the businesses and entrepreneurs, he added. The CBSL chief also highlighted that it is important to understand that short-term painful measures are necessary to restore long-term economic stability. Dr, Weerasinghe, commenting on the businesses, mentioned that the restrictions on imports are gradually being relaxed, and some restrictions on capital transactions will also be relaxed and that both will facilitate businesses in the near future. He also emphasized that they have already removed margin deposit requirements on imports adding that there will be further relaxations with the situation improving both stable exchange rates and also low inflation.",

        "date": "May 25, 2023 09:54 pm",
        "content": "Sak Surin, an elephant donated to Sri Lanka two decades ago, will finally return home in July to receive medical treatment as he is ill and has poor living conditions. The jumbo will travel on a chartered Russian aircraft after construction of a new cage and flight arrangements were completed. He will leave Sri Lanka on July 1. Former Chartthaipattana MP Kanchana Silpa-archa said in her Facebook post on Wednesday that everything is now ready, including the cage for the aging male elephant, Sak Surin. Coordination between the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Thai embassy in Sri Lanka and the chartering of the Ilyushin IL-76 flight are also complete. She said that the Budget Bureau sought a special budget from the Central Fund to repatriate the elephant, for treatment at the elephant hospital in the northern province of Lampang. Sak Surin came to public attention in the middle of last year, when a group of international conservationists, RARE, urged Thailand to take the ailing elephant back. A team of Thai vets and mahouts were sent to Sri Lanka to treat the sick elephant, which was reported to be chained and frequently used in ceremonies. After about six months of treatment, the elephant has regained strength and was fit to fly in March or April this year but, due to some technical problems, its return has been delayed. One of the mahouts, Thongsuk Mali-ngam, told Thai PBS in November last year that it took about a week before he could communicate with Saksurin, because the animal was familiar with Sri Lankan handlers after about 2 decades of being away from Thailand. He said that, when he first saw the elephant, he felt saddened by its poor condition, with infected wounds on the front legs and a hind leg chained. Thongsuk said he raised the elephant when it was young, in the north-eastern province of Surin and, during their first reunion, he greeted the animal by saying Sawasdee, which he taught the animal 21 years ago. Saksurin weighs about 3.5 tonnes and is about 35-years-old. Source - Thai PBS -Agencies",

        "date": "May 26, 2023 08:03 am",
        "content": "A man has been arrested after four people were killed in a rare shooting and stabbing attack in Japan. The alleged assailant stabbed a woman and shot two policemen with a hunting rifle in Nagano prefecture. A fourth death was later confirmed. Police have named the suspect as Masanori Aoki, the 31-year-old son of a local politician. Gun violence remains extremely rare in Japan, despite the killing of ex-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in July last year. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo, police received a call at around 16:25 (07:25 GMT) about a man who had chased and then stabbed a woman. An eyewitness working in a nearby field told Kyodo that the mans attack on his first victim had been carried out with a blade around 30cm (1ft) long. His motive is not clear. When the witness asked the suspect why he had stabbed the woman, he is said to have replied: I killed her because I wanted to. Mr Aoki - who was reportedly wearing a camouflage uniform, a hat, sunglasses and a mask - then allegedly shot police officers who responded to the emergency. It was not immediately clear how the fourth person - described as an elderly woman - had died. Mr Aoki later barricaded himself for hours inside his fathers home in a quiet residential area of Nakano city. His father, Masamichi Aoki, is the speaker of Nakano citys assembly. Footage from Japanese broadcaster NHK showed police vehicles and ambulances near the home. Police officers wearing body armour and carrying shields formed a 300m (328 yards) exclusion zone around the house. The suspect later stepped out of the house and was detained. Residents were urged to stay at home via email announcements and on the neighbourhood loudspeaker, while police also went door to door. Later in the evening, local media aired footage of gunshots being heard just after 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday. Some residents had to spend the night elsewhere, while the local school was set to close. But after the arrest, people were told they could go about their day. A man in his 50s told NHK: Its sad something like this happened in my neighbourhood. I could not sleep all night. Abe was Japans longest-serving prime minister and his death profoundly shocked a country where handguns are banned and incidents of political violence are almost unheard of. In 2014, there were just six incidents of gun deaths in Japan, compared with 33,599 in the US. People have to undergo a strict exam and mental health tests in order to buy a gun. Even then, only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The discussion focused on strengthening bilateral relations and developing stronger cultural ties, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). As part of his ongoing visit, the Sri Lankan president also called on Japans Minister of Digital Transformation, Taro Kono. During this meeting, Wickremesinghe outlined the Sri Lankan governments efforts in digitization and discussed measures to boost cooperation between the two countries in the digital transformation programs. Wickremesinghes visit to Japan, from May 24-27- also included bilateral talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, former Prime Ministers Yasuo Fukuda and Yoshihide Suga and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki. The focus of these discussions fell on the island nations debt restructuring negotiations and the implementation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. The Sri Lankan president expressed confidence in concluding the newly-launched debt restructuring talks, which he said have made remarkable headway, by September or November at the latest. Wickremesinghe also delivered an address at the Nikkei Forum on the Future of Asia in Tokyo, during which he highlighted Asias significance as the worlds largest economy, home to 60 of the global population and a significant contribution to global growth. He underscored the regions potential for continued growth, supported by Chinas recovery, Indias domestic demand, and the contributions of advanced economies like Japan and South Korea. President Wickremesinghes meeting comes a month after Japan, India and France jointly unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate debt restructuring. The island nation defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history in April last year as the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 crushed its economy.

        "date": "May 26, 2023 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Giant underwater landslides induced in Antarctica by the climate crisis might lead to tsunami waves with the potential to cause a substantial loss of life far from their origin, according to a new study. Underwater landslides are global hazards that can displace large volumes of sediment and generate killer tsunamis. For instance, a submarine landslide near Papua New Guinea in 1998 generated tsunami waves that killed 2,200 people. Researchers, including those from the University of Plymouth in the US, discovered that between 3 and 15 million years ago, during a past period of global heating, loose sediment layers slipped in Antarctica, triggering giant tsunamis that ravaged the shores of New Zealand, southeast Asia and South America. In the new study, published recently in the journal Nature Communications, scientists found extensive layers of weak, fossilised and biologically rich sediment hundreds of metres beneath the seafloor. The research highlights that these layers formed at a time when temperatures in Antarctica were up to 3C warmer than they are today. Amid current human-driven rapid climate change, leading to rising sea levels and shrinking ice sheets, scientists warned that underwater landslides in Antarctica may once again generate tsunami waves that stretch across the Southern Ocean. Large landslides along the Antarctic margin have the potential to trigger tsunamis, which may result in substantial loss of life far from their origin, study co-author Amelia Shevenell said in a statement. The landslides were first discovered in the eastern Ross Sea in 2017 by an international team of scientists during the Italian ODYSSEA expedition. When researchers revisited the area in 2018, they collected sediment cores extending hundreds of metres beneath the seafloor. Scientists found that the sediments uncovered formed under areas of underwater landslides. Analysis of these layers revealed microscopic fossils that painted a picture of what the climate would have been like in the region millions of years ago and how they created weak layers deep under the Ross Sea  a bay in Antarctica that is said to be the worlds largest marine protected area. The weak sediment layers, according to scientists, make the area susceptible to failure in the face of earthquakes, leading to giant tsunamis emerging from the region. Submarine landslides are a major geohazard with the potential to trigger tsunamis that can lead to huge loss of life. The landslides can also destroy infrastructure including subsea cables, meaning future such events would create a wide range of economic and social impacts, study co-author Jenny Gales said. Our findings highlight how we urgently need to enhance our understanding of how global climate change might influence the stability of these regions and potential for future tsunamis, Dr Gales said.

The self-styled prophet says the police named him a suspect after presenting submissions to the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. Deeming the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, Pastor Fernando noted that the police have not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threaten the religious harmony in the country. Pastor Fernando, who seeks a court order ruling that his fundamental rights are thus violated, also wants the Supreme Court to prevent the respondents from arresting him until the hearing of the FR petition is concluded. Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures after a video of his sermon was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country. On May 15, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. The New Buddhist Front (Nawa Bikshu Peramuna) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) also lodged a complaint with the CID, seeking the immediate arrest of the Pastor and that strict legal action be initiated against him. Later, an overseas travel ban was imposed against the Pastor on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on May 16, as per a request made by the CID. Fernando, however, left for Singapore on May 14. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Police said Pastor Jerome can be arrested upon his return to the island due to the overseas travel ban. On May 18, Ven. Gunawansa Thero and several others lodged an FR petition seeking a Supreme Court order directing the police chief to arrest Pastor Fernando and to take legal action against him. In a live-streamed video, Pastor Fernando issued an apology, stating that I have done nothing wrong. And while I have done nothing wrong, I want to yet apologize to my Buddhist brothers, Hindu brothers, Muslim brothers and sisters, if my words by any means have hurt you emotionally.",

The doctor in question is believed to have administered the Glutathione vaccine as part of an unsafe skin whitening treatment. Nearly two years ago, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) called for the ban of products containing Glutathione, a molecule commonly used in treatments for side effects suffered by cancer patients, citing that the drug itself caused severely concerning side effects. Accordingly, upon further questioning of the doctor following his arrest, he had revealed that he does not, in fact, possess any knowledge on vaccines and their administration. Investigations carried out at the arrestees residence also led to the discovery of a stash of Glutathione vials, both used and unused. The doctor was arrested by Food and Drug Inspectors who were summoned to the site by the Ukussa team upon confirmation of the racket.",

        "date": "May 27, 2023 10:51 am",
        "content": "A government official in India has been suspended after he ordered a reservoir to be drained to retrieve his phone. It took three days to pump millions of litres of water out of the dam, after Rajesh Vishwas dropped the device while taking a selfie. By the time it was found, the phone was too water-logged to work. Mr Vishwas claimed it contained sensitive government data and needed retrieving, but he has been accused of misusing his position. The food inspector dropped his Samsung phone, worth about 1,200 (100,000 rupees), into Kherkatta Dam, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, on Sunday. After local divers failed to find it, he paid for a diesel pump to be brought in, Mr Vishwas said in a video statement quoted in Indian media. He said he had verbal permission from an official to drain some water into a nearby canal, adding that the official said it would in fact benefit the farmers who would have more water. The pump ran for several days, emptying out roughly two million litres (440,000 gallons) of water - reportedly enough to irrigate 6 sq km (600 hectares) of farmland. His mission was stopped when another official, from the water resource department arrived following a complaint. He has been suspended until an inquiry. Water is an essential resource and it cannot be wasted like this, Priyanka Shukla, a Kanker district official, told The National newspaper. Mr Vishwas has denied misusing his position, and said that the water he drained was from the overflow section of the dam and not in usable condition. But his actions have drawn criticism from politicians, with the states opposition BJP partys national vice-president tweeting: When people are depending upon tankers for water facility in in scorching summers, the officer has drained 41 lakh litres which could have been used for irrigation purpose for 1,500 acres of land.

The relevant directive was given by Ekanayake on the orders of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a bid to prevent illegal goods smuggled into the country via the VIP terminal. Customs officials further explained that albeit there being several scanning machines and checkpoints at the normal terminals of BIA, no such scans have been set up at the VIP terminal. Thus, several bags go unchecked through the said terminal, thereby providing an easy channel for illegal goods to be brought into the country, they said. They further stated that several foreign countries, too, have such highly advanced checkpoints and scanners at both, VIP terminals and other special terminals, which have proven successful in curtailing the entering of illegal goods into their respective countries. While the Head of State called for these scanners to be installed at the special departure terminals, Ekanayake further instructed the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs to compile a report on the matter.",

The ministry clarified that none of its staff members were involved in the alleged practice of exploiting the existing appointment system of the Consular Affairs Division by third parties to authenticate documents. It is unacceptable that the appointment system, which has been introduced to ensure an effective and efficient service to the public, is being misused by unscrupulous third party elements for undue financial gains. The ministry said it has requested the law enforcement authorities to investigate the alleged activities by these third-party elements. Document authentication is a one-day service of the Consular Affairs Division for those who visit the Division with prior appointment. The Foreign Ministry explained that a single document is authenticated in 25 minutes or less from the time it is submitted at the Consular Affairs Divisions counter and well over a thousand applicants are served every day. The Foreign Ministry strongly advised the applicants to submit documents for authentication in person and directly, with prior appointment, to the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo and its Regional Consular offices in Jaffna, Trincomalee, Matara, Kurunegala and Kandy, instead of using third parties to act on their behalf.

The man, in his thirties, was detained on landing. He told police that he opened the door because he wanted to get off the plane quickly, Yonhap said on Saturday, citing the Daegu Dongbu Police Station. He also told police he was stressed after losing his job recently. Reuters could not immediately reach police at the station. The man opened the door when the plane was about 700 feet (213 metres) above the ground, causing panic onboard. Nine passengers were taken to hospital with breathing issues. They were all discharged after about two hours, a fire department official said. Police sought an arrest warrant for the detained man on Saturday for violation of the Aviation Security Act and other offences, Yonhap said. Officials gave the mans surname as Lee but not his full name, as is usual custom. A video aired on television, reported to have been taken by a passenger, showed the moments before the landing, with a door open and wind rushing in as passengers sat nearby. Jin Seong-hyun, a former Korean Air cabin safety official, said that as far he knew, the incident was unprecedented, but that passengers have opened emergency exits without authorisation while planes are on the ground. A South Korean Transport Ministry official said on Friday that it was possible to open emergency exits at or near ground level because the pressure inside and outside the cabin is similar.

They further discussed the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) at length, during which Minister Alles commended the recently introduced laws in Britain, adding that they were essential in order to maintain law and order within a country. Matters pertaining to four persons currently being detained under the PTA were also raised during the discussion, to which Alles explained that all four persons were being detained on suspicion of their involvement in the Easter Sunday terror attacks of 2019. High Commissioner Hulton also noted that a training workshop would be organised, via Zoom, to educate Sri Lankan police officers on the proper use of the countrys rules and laws. Mellor, along with Sarah Hulton, also met with a wide range of stakeholders in Colombo, Jaffna and Galle. Commenting on the matter, Hulton said, It was great to accompany our UK Director across three provinces this week, meeting important stakeholders across civil society, businesses and government. We had productive discussions about local concerns and priorities, and economic and development opportunities. During their visits to Galle and Jaffna, the visiting diplomat met with the governors of the Northern and Southern Provinces, toured a Red Cross Project site to hear about how UK funding has impacted vulnerable communities, and visited Jaffna University and the historic Jaffna Library.

On May 15, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the harmony in the country.

On May 16, the CID initiated a probe into the matter, while the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court issued a foreign travel ban on Pastor Fernando who had left for Singapore on May 14. However, the police said Pastor Jerome could be arrested upon his return to the island due to the overseas travel ban. On May 18, Ven. Gunawansa Thero and several others lodged an FR petition seeking a Supreme Court order directing the police chief to arrest Pastor Fernando and to take legal action against him. Pastor Fernandos second apology came days after his first which was live-streamed from Singapore on May 21. Earlier, he had said that he has done nothing wrong but wanted to yet apologize to Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim devotees, had his words by any means hurt them emotionally. Against this backdrop, the self-styled prophet on May 26 filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition with the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) from arresting him.

        "title": "Sri Lanka conducts Strategic Risk Assessment Workshop with comprehensive WHO toolkit",
        "date": "May 27, 2023 09:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka conducted a Strategic Risk Assessment Workshop from 16-18 May 2023 to complement the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) core capacity of preparedness. Under the preparedness core capacity, a country is required to identify priority public health risks and map existing resources for response, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. During the Joint External Evaluation of the IHR Core Capacities in Sri Lanka (2017) it was identified that multiple stakeholder participatory risk mapping and staff capacity building for risk assessment needed further strengthening. According to the WHO, this workshop was an effort to bring together these stakeholders and build their capacities in risk assessment. The workshop was led by the Ministry of Health with national and subnational representation from a wider multi-stakeholder group including representatives of animal health, agriculture, and environment sectors. A total of 60 participants attended the three-day workshop where a comprehensive hands-on approach was utilized to enable discourse among stakeholders on hazards, and their likelihood and potential impact on the health and non-health sectors and on a society as a whole in the Sri Lankan context. The WHO says its Strategic Toolkit for Assessing Risks (STAR) was utilized as the resource package for this workshop. The early stages of an emergency response are a test to how well a country is prepared to respond in emergencies. This includes having plans and resources in place at both the local and national levels. If the country considers the risks and plans accordingly, this will lead to be better prepared to handle a threat and reduce the time and costs involved in responding to an emergency. This approach aims to make emergency response more effective and minimizes the negative impact of potential emergencies, such as unnecessary illnesses and deaths, the WHO said in a media release. The purpose of the workshop was to help Sri Lanka assess the public health risks related to known hazards. By identifying these risks, the country can prioritize actions and make plans to be ready for potential emergencies. The goal was to support the country in increasing its preparedness and ability to respond at a national level. The Strategic Toolkit for Assessing Risks offers a comprehensive toolkit that enables to rapidly conduct a strategic and evidence-based assessment of public health risks for prioritization of interventions for health emergency preparedness and disaster risk management in line with the IHR (2005) and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). The workshop consisted of key steps which included the identification of hazards, the evaluation of likelihood, the evaluation of impact, the determination of risk level and the development of a risk profile. The last step was to identify actions and next steps pertaining to the management of hazards. During the process of developing the risk profile several hazards including floods, landslides, dengue, infectious diseases of pandemic potential and landslides were identified as high risk. The actions and next steps included identification of prevention, preparedness and mitigation actions for each hazard. They will be integrated into national action plans including the National Action Plan for Health Security (2024-2030). Further to this, the risk assessment will be utilized in policy and advocacy efforts, planning and development of strategies and capacity building of workforce.",

        "date": "May 27, 2023 11:33 pm",
        "content": "The UN convened the first-ever global meeting with education ministers from around the world to explore risks and rewards of using chatbots in classrooms, announcing on Friday a new roadmap to chart a safer digital path for all. Less than 10 per cent of schools and universities follow formal guidance on using wildly popular artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like the chatbot software ChatGPT, according to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which hosted more than 40 ministers at an groundbreaking online meeting on Thursday. The ministers exchanged policy approaches and plans while considering the agencys new roadmap on education and generative AI, which can create data and content based on existing algorithms, but can also make alarming factual errors, just like humans. Generative AI opens new horizons and challenges for education, but we urgently need to take action to ensure that new AI technologies are integrated into education on our terms, said Stefania Giannini, UNESCOs Assistant Director-General for Education. It is our duty to prioritize safety, inclusion, diversity, transparency and quality. Institutions are facing myriad challenges in crafting an immediate response to the sudden emergence of these powerful AI apps, according to a new UNESCO survey of more than 450 schools and universities. Rapidly evolving landscape At the same time, governments worldwide are in the process of shaping appropriate policy responses in a rapidly evolving education landscape, while further developing or refining national strategies on AI, data protection, and other regulatory frameworks, according to UNESCO. However, they are proceeding with caution. Risks to using these tools can see students exposed to false or biased information, some ministers said at the global meeting. The debate revealed other common concerns, including how to mitigate the chatbots inherent flaws of producing glaring errors. Ministers also addressed how best to integrate these tools into curricula, teaching methods, and exams, and adapting education systems to the disruptions which generative AI is quickly causing. Many highlighted the vital role teachers play in this new era as learning facilitators. But, teachers need guidance and training to meet these challenges, according to UNESCO. Adding to existing frameworks For its part, the agency will continue to steer the global dialogue with policy makers, partners, academia, and civil society, in line with its paper, AI and education: A guide for policy-makers and Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, as well as the Beijing Consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education. UNESCO is also developing policy guidelines on the use of generative AI in education and research, as well as frameworks of AI competencies for students and teachers for classrooms. These new tools will be launched during Digital Learning Week, to be held at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on 4 to 7 September, the agency said.",

        "title": "Biden, McCarthy reach tentative US debt ceiling deal",
        "date": "May 28, 2023 08:21 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy reached a tentative deal to raise the federal governments 31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Saturday evening, ending a months-long stalemate. However, the deal was announced without any celebration, in terms that reflected the bitter tenor of the negotiations and the difficult path it has to pass through Congress before the United States runs out of money to pay its debts in early June. I just got off the phone with the president a bit ago. After he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months, weve come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people, McCarthy tweeted. Biden called the deal an important step forward in a statement, saying: The agreement represents a compromise, which means not everyone gets what they want. Thats the responsibility of governing. The deal would raise the debt limit for two years while capping spending over that time, claw back unused COVID funds, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects and includes some extra work requirements for food aid programs for poor Americans. Biden and McCarthy held a 90-minute phone call earlier on Saturday evening to discuss the deal, with McCarthy planning to brief his members later in the evening. We still have more work to do tonight to finish the writing of it, McCarthy told reporters on Capitol Hill. McCarthy said he expects to finish writing the bill Sunday, then speak to Biden and have a vote on the deal on Wednesday. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, rein in government overreach - there are no new taxes, no new government programs, he said. Negotiators have agreed to cap non-defense discretionary spending at 2023 levels for one year and increase it by 1 in 2025, a source familiar with the deal said. The deal will avert an economically destabilizing default, so long as they succeed in passing it through the narrowly divided Congress before the Treasury Department runs short of money to cover all its obligations, which it warned Friday will occur if the debt ceiling is not raised by June 5. Biden and McCarthy have to carefully thread the needle in finding a compromise that can clear the House, with a 222-213 Republican majority, and Senate, with a 51-49 Democratic majority. Republicans who control the House of Representatives have pushed for steep cuts to spending and other conditions, and were sharply critical of the deal as some details were reported in recent days. Republican Representative Bob Good, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, tweeted that he was hearing the deal would raise the debt by 4 trillion, and added IF that is true, I dont need to hear anything else. No one claiming to be a conservative could justify a YES vote. North Carolinas Dan Bishop described the deal earlier Saturday as utter capitulation in progress. By the side holding the cards. One high-ranking member of the House Freedom Caucus said they were in the process of gauging member sentiment, and unsure what the vote numbers might be. TAXES VS. SPENDING CUTS Republicans say they want to cut spending to slow the growth of the U.S. debt, which is now roughly equal to the annual output of the countrys economy. Biden and Democrats have pushed to increase taxes on the wealthy and companies to shrink the debt. The long standoff on raising the debt ceiling spooked financial markets, weighing on stocks and forcing the United States to pay record-high interest rates in some bond sales. A default would take a far heavier toll, economists say, likely pushing the nation into recession, shaking the world economy and leading to a spike in unemployment. Biden for months refused to negotiate with McCarthy over future spending cuts, demanding that lawmakers first pass a clean debt-ceiling increase free of other conditions, and present a 2024 budget proposal to counter his issued in March. Two-way negotiations between Biden and McCarthy began in earnest on May 16. The work to raise the debt ceiling is far from done. McCarthy has vowed to give House members 72 hours to read the legislation before bringing it to the floor for a vote. That will test whether enough moderate members support the compromises in the bill to overcome opposition from both hard-right Republicans and progressive Democrats. Then it will need to pass the Senate, where it will need at least nine Republican votes to succeed. There are multiple opportunities in each chamber along the way to slow down the process.
