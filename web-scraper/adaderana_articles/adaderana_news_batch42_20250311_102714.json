        "content": "A SpaceX Crew Dragon space capsule, which is due to bring home stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams next year, arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday, according to NASA and SpaceX. NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov boarded the ISS shortly after the Dragon capsule docked at the station at 2130 GMT, NASA said in a post on X. The SpaceX Crew-9 mission was supposed to transport four astronauts to the ISS until two empty seats had to be opened up for Wilmore and Williams after the Boeing Starliner capsule they arrived on in June was deemed unfit to return them to Earth. The two former military test pilots have been stuck on the ISS since then after the Starliner capsule suffered thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA decided it wasnt safe for the astronauts to return on Starliner, which was sent back to Earth empty earlier this month. Wilmore and Williams, who were the first crew to fly on the troubled Starliner, are now due to return home with Hague and Gorbunov on Crew Dragon in February next year, as what was supposed to be an 8-day mission has turned into an 8-month ordeal.

        "date": "September 30, 2024 10:01 pm",
        "content": "Israel is planning a limited ground operation in Lebanon that may start imminently, Israel has told the United States, the Washington Post reports citing an unidentified US official. The operation will be smaller than Israels 2006 war against Hezbollah and will focus on security for border communities, the official says. Israels Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday said ground forces could be used against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, adding military operations will go on despite the killing of the groups leader Hassan Nasrallah. Gallant made the comments while speaking to Israeli troops deployed to the northern border where cross-border fire with Hezbollah continued for nearly a year but escalated this month. We will use all the means that may be required -- your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land, Gallant said. The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the final one. In a meeting with local council heads in northern Israel, Gallant said: The next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon. Bidens statement US President Joe Biden indicated he was opposed to Israeli ground operations in Lebanon and called for a ceasefire. Im more aware than you might know and Im comfortable with them stopping. We should have a ceasefire now, Biden told reporters when he was asked if he was aware of reports of Israeli plans for a limited operation, and if he was comfortable with one going ahead. Israel had intensified air raids against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon from September 23, when Lebanons health ministry said at least 558 people were killed, in the deadliest day of violence since Lebanons 1975-90 civil war. Israeli officials have been hinting at a potential ground invasion into Lebanon, following attacks which decimated Hezbollahs leadership and communications this month. After Hamas October 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah began firing at Israeli military positions and communities along the border, in what it called support for Hamas. Fighting had been relatively contained until the current escalation. Tens of thousands of Israeli residents were evacuated from their countrys northern border area nearly a year ago. Israel said earlier this month that it was shifting its focus from Gaza to securing the northern border with Lebanon. Hezbollahs deputy leader Naim Qassem said Monday the movement was ready to face any Israeli ground operation, and warned that the battle could last a long time. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel begins Lebanon ground invasion with limited raids on Hezbollah",
        "date": "October 1, 2024 08:55 am",
        "content": "Israels widely expected ground invasion of Lebanon appeared to be getting underway early on Tuesday as its military said troops had begun limited raids against Hezbollah targets in the border area. The military said in a statement that it had begun limited, localised, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon villages close to the border that posed an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel. It said the air force and artillery were supporting the ground forces with precise strikes. Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead. Flares were repeatedly launched over the Lebanese border town of Rmeish, lighting up the night sky. On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told local council heads in northern Israel that the next phase of the war along Lebanons southern border would begin soon, and would support the aim of bringing home Israelis who have fled Hezbollah rockets during nearly a year of border warfare. The ground invasion represents an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed militants, sparked by an assault on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, that now threatens to suck in the US and Iran. An Israeli strike in Lebanon early on Tuesday targeted Mounir Maqdah, commander of the Lebanese branch of the Palestinian Fatah movements military wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, according to two Palestinian security officials. The strike hit a building in the crowded Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon, the sources said. It marked the first strike on the camp, Lebanons largest Palestinian camp, since cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel broke out nearly a year ago. In Syria, three civilians were killed and nine others injured in an Israeli airstrike on the capital Damascus, Syrian state media said on Tuesday citing a military source. Israels military said it does not comment on foreign media reports. Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has ramped up raids since the Hamas attack on Israels southern territory on October 7, 2023. Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage in its assault on Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Israel in response launched a massive assault on Hamas in Gaza, reducing most of the Palestinian territory to rubble, displacing most of its 2.3 million people and killing more than 41,300 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry. Strikes on Beirut Israels ground invasion into Lebanon follows its deadly detonation of booby-trapped Hezbollah pagers, two weeks of airstrikes, and its killing on Friday of Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah, which dealt the group one of the heaviest blows in decades. The intensive air strikes have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government. Overnight, strikes hit Beiruts southern suburbs, a security source said. A Reuters reporter witnessed a flash of light and a series of loud blasts about an hour after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate areas near buildings it said contained Hezbollah infrastructure south of the Lebanese capital. In the past 24 hours, at least 95 people had been killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanons southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut, Lebanons health ministry said early on Tuesday. Hezbollahs deputy leader Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallahs death, said that the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement. He said Hezbollah had continued to fire rockets as deep as 150 km (93 miles) into Israeli territory. We know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006, he said, referring to the last big conflict between the two foes. Late on Monday, Lebanese troops pulled back about five kilometres (3 miles) from positions along Lebanons southern border with Israel, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. A Lebanese army spokesperson did not confirm or deny the movement. Lebanons army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the last year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military. The White House and the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israels ground operations in Lebanon. But on Monday, US President Joe Biden had called for a ceasefire. Im more worried than you might know and Im comfortable with them stopping, Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. We should have a ceasefire now. Israel last week rejected a proposal by the US and France calling for a 21-day ceasefire on the Lebanon border to give time for a diplomatic settlement that would allow displaced civilians on both sides to return home.

The government has to bear a significant cost annually from the public tax to provide the said various entitlements, allowances, and privileges and the government has recognized the necessity of minimization of this huge expenditure at the present fiscal capacity, the government said. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the Prime Minister in her capacity as a Minister of Justice, Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Council and Local Government to appoint a committee consisting of the following members to submit a detailed report within two months with the suitable recommendations to study the facts in order to limit on a rational basis the entitlements, allowances, and privileges which creates an unnecessary burden on the Treasury or to introduce another suitable alternative method:  Mr. K.T. Chithrasiri (Chairman) - Retired Supreme Court Judge  Mr. D. Dissanayaka - Retired Secretary to Ministry  Mrs. Jayantha C.T. Bulumulla  Retired District Secretary",

        "title": "Japans parliament elects former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister",
        "date": "October 1, 2024 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Japans parliament on Tuesday formally elected Shigeru Ishiba, head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, as the countrys new prime minister. Ishiba was chosen as the partys leader on Friday to replace Fumio Kishida, who then stepped down earlier on Tuesday to pave the way. Ishiba will announce his new Cabinet later on Tuesday. Kishida took office in 2021 but left so his party could have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals. Ishiba plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27. Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election. Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term. Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members. As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japans future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet, Kishida said in a statement, citing the need to bolster security amid a deepening global divide, such as Russias war in Ukraine, while tackling a declining birthrate and population, as well as economic and political reforms at home. Ishiba earlier announced his partys leaders ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the partys election task force. He is expected to name defense experts Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief. The majority of his Cabinet ministers, like Ishiba, are expected to be unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abes powerful group linked to damaging scandals. Ishibas lack of stable power base could also mean a fragility of his government, and could quickly collapse even though Ishiba hopes to build up party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said. The move is also seen as revenge by Ishiba, who was largely pushed to the side during most of Abes reign. Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. Ishiba outlined his views in an article to the Hudson Institute last week. The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense. Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies, he wrote. Ishiba proposes combining of existing security and diplomatic groupings, such as the Quad and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks involving the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines. He also noted that the Asian version of NATO can also consider sharing of the control of U.S. nuclear weapons in the region as a deterrence against growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia. Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea. He pledged to continue Kishidas economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japans declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters. The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishibas more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishidas popularity. Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under Abe. Source: AP --Agencies",

Police could not immediately confirm the number of injuries or deaths but Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters about 25 people were believed to have been killed, without elaborating.

        "content": "The police fired tear gas shells and rubber bullets in an attempt to stop the protesters from marching towards the residence of Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in Dhaka. Protesters took to the streets of Dhaka on Monday demanding the Bangladesh caretaker government to increase the age limit from 31 to 35 for government jobs. The fresh protest in the capital city came as the crisis-hit nation is still recovering from the political turmoil that erupted in August, leading to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. On Monday morning, the protesters gathered in front of the National Museum in the citys Shahbagh. From there, they started their march to Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunuss official residence, Jamuna in Minto Road. According to local media reports, the protesters ignored a police restriction on rallies and gatherings in front of the Chief Advisors residence and attempted to occupy the premises. As the protest march proceeded, police personnel deployed in the area tried to block the demonstrators from moving ahead, leading to clashes and scuffles between the two sides. In an attempt to disperse the protesters, the police then resorted to firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets. This is not the first time that Bangladesh witnessed protests demanding an increase to the age limit. During Sheikh Hasinas Awami League-led regime, several such demonstrations took place, but the then government rejected the demand. Despite the formation of a new caretaker government in the wake of the political crisis two months ago, lawlessness is still evident across Bangladesh. In a separate incident also on Monday, a garment worker was shot dead and 50 others injured during violent clashes between the police and protesters in Ashulia, located in the outskirts of Dhaka. The protesters, comprising garment workers, were demanding the administration to clear their pending dues. However, the protest soon took a violent turn as the demonstrators vandalised shops and police vehicles in the area. As a result, the police opened fire at the protesters.

        "title": "Israel Military says missiles launched by Iran at Israel",
        "date": "October 1, 2024 10:29 pm",
        "content": "Iran has launched missiles targeting Israel, the military said Tuesday, following US warnings that an Iranian attack was imminent. A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel, the military said in a statement. It said sirens were sounded across Israel, including in Jerusalem. The US embassy in Israel called on its staff and their family members to shelter in place amid the warnings. As a result of the current security situation, the US embassy has directed all US government employees and their family members to shelter in place until further notice, the embassy said in a statement. Air raid sirens have sounded, and AFP journalists have reported hearing explosions over Jerusalem. Earlier on Tuesday, at least seven people were wounded in a shooting in Israels commercial hub Tel Aviv, according to emergency responders, in what police said was a suspected terror attack. At least seven have been wounded at two different sites, said the head of the Magen David Adom emergency medical service, Eli Bin. Paramedics are providing medical treatment to a number of casualties in varying conditions, including unconscious casualties, the service said in a separate statement. UPDATE: (11.35 p.m.) Irans state media IRNA reported that a missile attack had been launched on Israels commercial hub, Tel Aviv, without elaborating. Iranian media also posted videos that appeared to show missile launches at several sites across the country. Irans Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said the missile attack underway against Israel was in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week as well as that of the Hamas leader. In response to the martyrdom of (Hamas leader) Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and (Guards commander) Nilforoshan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories (Israel), the Guards said in a statement reported by Iranian news agency Fars. The IRGC also threatened to carry out crushing attacks against Israel if it retaliated to the missile attack. If the Zionist regime reacts to Iranian operations, it will face crushing attacks, the IRGC statement read. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden ordered the American military to aid Israels defence and shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel, the White House said. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in next months US presidential election, are both monitoring Irans attack on Israel from the White House situation room, it said in a statement. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari released a video statement saying the air defence system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment. Soon after, a series of explosions were heard in Tel Aviv and near Jerusalem. It was not immediately known if they were interceptions or incoming missiles landing. The explosions near Jerusalem were so loud that windows shook. Israel has closed its airspace and diverted flights, a spokesman from the airport authority said, as air raid sirens sounded across the country. Residents were ordered to shelter in place and remain close to bomb shelters. The order was sent to mobile phones and announced on national television. TV stations reported sirens in parts of Jerusalem as well as central Israel. The alerts were sounded after a day of rocket and missile attacks from Lebanon. Israeli authorities also warned that Iran might be preparing a missile attack. Israel has warned there would be repercussions if Iran attacks. Earlier today, the US said that Iran had been preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel and warned that any such assault would have severe consequences for Tehran. The warning came as Israel said it had launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to target the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah. The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel, a senior White House official told AFP on condition of anonymity. We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. The United States and other western allies stepped in to help defend Israel against a combined Iranian missile and drone attack in April, which Tehran launched in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. The US official added: A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran. Iran has said that Nasrallahs killing would bring about Israels destruction, though the foreign ministry said Monday that Tehran would not deploy soldiers to confront Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile issued a stark warning to Iran on Monday, saying there was nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. Netanyahu also said that a future when Iran is finally free would come a lot sooner than people think. An attack on Israel by Iran would gravely compound fears of a wider regional conflict that the United States and other world powers have said they want to avoid in the Middle East. The United States has cautiously backed Israels move to dismantle Hezbollahs ability to attack northern Israel, even as President Joe Biden has called for a ceasefire. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was tracking events in the Middle East very closely. The United States is committed to Israels defense, Blinken said Tuesday morning while meeting his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita at the State Department. Washington said Monday that it was boosting its forces in the Middle East by a few thousand troops, by bringing in new units while extending others that are already there. It was also deploying more fighter jets, the Pentagon said. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin late Monday offered support to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant for dismantling attack infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon. Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas, which is also backed by Iran, staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which triggered Israels devastating assault on the Gaza Strip. Cross-border fire from Israel and Hezbollah continued throughout Israels war in Gaza. --Agencies",

        "title": "Iran says attack on Israel is over as fears grow of wider conflict",
        "date": "October 2, 2024 09:08 am",
        "content": "Iran said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was over barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran as fears of a wider war intensified. Washington said it would work with longtime ally Israel to make sure Iran faced severe consequences for Tuesdays attack, which Israel said involved more than 180 ballistic missiles. The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire. Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X early on Wednesday. Israel renewed its bombardment early on Wednesday of Beiruts southern suburbs, a stronghold of the Iran-backed armed Hezbollah group, with at least a dozen airstrikes against what it said were targets belonging the group. Large plumes of smoke were seen rising from parts of the suburbs. Israel issued new evacuation orders for the area, which have largely emptied after days of heavy strikes. Irans biggest attack on Israel Irans attack marked it biggest ever military blow against Israel. Sirens sounded across the country and explosions rattled Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley as the entire population was told to move into bomb shelters. No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. Iran described the campaign as defensive and solely aimed at Israeli military facilities. Irans state news agency said three Israeli military bases had been targeted. Tehran said its assault was a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders and aggression in Lebanon against Hezbollah and in Gaza. Israel activated air defences against Irans bombardment and most missiles were intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States, Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video on X, adding: Irans attack is a severe and dangerous escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit back. Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it, he said at the outset of an emergency political security cabinet meeting late on Tuesday, according to a statement. Irans General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement carried by state media that any Israeli response would be met with vast destruction of Israeli infrastructure. It also said it would target regional assets of any Israeli ally that got involved. Fears that Iran and the U.S. could be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israels growing assault on Lebanon in the past two weeks, including the start of a ground operation there on Monday, and its year-old conflict in the Gaza Strip. Irans forces on Tuesday used hypersonic Fattah missiles for the first time, and 90 of its missiles successfully hit their targets in Israel, the Revolutionary Guards said. Israels Hagari said central and southern Israel received limited strikes. A video released by the military showed a school in the central city of Gadera heavily damaged by an Iranian missile. U.S. Navy warships fired about a dozen interceptors against Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, the Pentagon said. Britain said its forces played a part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East, without elaborating. U.S. President Joe Biden expressed full U.S. support for Israel and described Irans attack as ineffective. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for U.S. president, backed Bidens stance and said the U.S. would not hesitate to defend its interests against Iran. We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful, Israels U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters. U.S. does not urge restraint The White House similarly promised severe consequences for Iran and spokesman Jake Sullivan told a Washington briefing the U.S. would work with Israel to make that the case. Sullivan did not specify what those consequences might be, but he stopped short of urging restraint by Israel as the U.S. did in April when Iran carried out a drone and missile attack on Israel. The Pentagon said Tuesdays airstrikes by Iran were about twice the size of Aprils assault. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he called escalation after escalation, saying: This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement that he strongly condemns Irans new attacks on Israel, adding that in a sign of its commitment to Israels security it mobilised its military resources in the Middle East on Wednesday. Macron reiterated Frances demand that Hezbollah cease its terrorist actions against Israel and its population, but also wished for Lebanons sovereignty and territorial integrity to be reinstated in strict compliance with a United Nations Security Council resolution. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an immediate regional ceasefire. The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks ... spiralling out of control, he posted on X. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with the leaders of Germany and France, and they agreed on a need for restraint from all sides, Downing Street said. Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, most in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics on Tuesday.

        "date": "October 2, 2024 02:11 pm",
        "content": "Oil prices climbed more than 2 on Wednesday on rising concerns that Middle East tensions could escalate, potentially disrupting crude output from the region, following Irans biggest ever military blow against Israel. Brent futures leapt 1.63, or 2.2, to 75.19 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude spiked 1.70, or 2.4, to 71.53 at 0755 GMT. WTI had earlier risen more than 2. Both crude benchmarks on Tuesday surged more than 5 before closing around 2.5 higher. Iran said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was over barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to strike back against Tehran as fears of a wider war intensified. This could include damaging or obliterating Irans oil facilities, said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. Tehran said any Israeli response to the attack, which Israel said involved more than 180 ballistic missiles, would be met with vast destruction. Varga noted Irans or its allies retaliation could strike Saudi oil facilities like in 2019 or see the closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Any of these events would irretrievably send oil prices considerably higher, he said. In another escalation of the conflict, the Israeli military on Wednesday sent regular infantry and armoured units to join ground operations in southern Lebanon against Iran-backed Hezbollah. The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire. Irans oil output rose to a six-year high of 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, ANZ analysts said. A major escalation by Iran risks bringing the U.S. into the war, Capital Economics said in a note. Iran accounts for about 4 of global oil output, but an important consideration will be whether Saudi Arabia increases production if Iranian supplies were disrupted. A panel of ministers from OPEC, which includes Russia, meets later on Wednesday to review the market, with no policy change expected. The group is set to raise output from December by 180,000 bpd monthly. Any suggestion that production hikes will proceed could offset concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East, ANZ analysts said. However, Saudi Arabias oil minister said that oil prices could drop to as low as 50 per barrel if OPEC members do not stick to agreed-upon production limits, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday citing delegates from the oil producers group.

        "date": "October 2, 2024 04:10 pm",
        "content": "Indias external Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Sri Lanka this week and call on newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who assumed office on September 23, Indian media reported today. His visit to Colombo would be the first by any foreign minister after the presidential elections last month. Jaishankars visit to the neighbouring island nation, which is expected to begin on October 4, will be closely watched as it will include high-level engagement between India and Sri Lanka after Dissanayake came to power. Indias high commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, was the first foreign diplomat to call on Dissanayake after the outcome of the 2024 Sri Lanka was announced. The Sri Lanka visit of the Indian EAM will be a significant opportunity for India to reinforce its commitment to providing development support for its strategically situated Indian Ocean neighbor, amid worries about a shift in its foreign policy under the new president, the report said. Through Jaishankars Sri Lanka visit, the Indian government is also hoping to build on its outreach to Dissanayake in the past 12 months that witnessed him visiting New Delhi earlier this year, setting aside reservations over his party Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas (JVP) deep and longstanding resentment against India, the report said. During his Delhi visit, Dissanayake held talks with Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval. India doesnt want Dissanayake to be hostile like Muizzu A report by Times of India quoted a source speaking on condition of anonymity as saying that Sri Lankas Dissanayake may not have been Indias first choice, but Jaishankars in just the second week of his presidency suggests India doesnt expect him to be hostile in the manner the new Maldives president (Mohamed Muizzu) was initially or the way the interim government in Bangladesh has been. It took almost six months for the first-high level bilateral visit between Maldives and India after Muizzu took over last year. India and Bangladesh have still not had any bilateral visit following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina in early August. During his talks with Indian officials, Dissanayake is said to have praised Indias 4 billion assistance that helped bail Sri Lanka out of a financial crisis. Before becoming president, he also gave an assurance that he wont be letting Sri Lankas land, sea and airspace to be used against India. Though there are concerns about what kind of relationship Dissanayake might pursue with China, he has recently said that he views both India and China as valued partners and that he doesnt want Sri Lanka to get involved in any geopolitical fight. His anti-corruption focus helps India which believes in transparent infrastructure development, responsible debt financing practices, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law and the environment, ToI quoted the source as saying.

        "date": "October 2, 2024 05:03 pm",
        "content": "The release of a blockbuster Pakistani film has been put on hold in India after officials in Delhi refused to give permission for its screening, the BBC has learnt. A remake of a 1979 Punjabi film, The Legend of Maula Jatt, is the highest ever grossing film in Pakistan. The movie was set to release in the northern Indian state of Punjab on Wednesday, which would have made it the first Pakistani film to hit Indian screens in more than a decade. The South Asian neighbours share a frosty relationship and tensions often affect cultural exchanges between them. On Wednesday, a source close to Zee Studios - the films distributor in India - confirmed to the BBC that its release had been stalled indefinitely, after the information and broadcasting ministry denied them permission. Its not immediately clear why the film was put on hold. The BBC has contacted the ministry for comment. Starring Pakistans biggest stars Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan, the 2022 film tells the story of a local folk hero who takes on the leader of a rival clan. The film was initially supposed to release in India in 2022, but its screening was postponed indefinitely - until last month when its maker Bilal Lashari announced it would hit Indian theatres soon. Two years in, and still house full on weekends in Pakistan! Now, I cant wait for our Punjabi audience in India to experience the magic of this labour of love! he wrote on Instagram. However, the news sparked protests in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, where the regional Maharashtra Navnirman Sena political party said it would not allow the films release under any circumstances. Mumbai, which is located in the state, is home to Bollywood, Indias largest film industry. Following tensions, Zee Studios decided to limit the films release to Punjab state, which shares a border and language with Pakistans Punjab province. Despite tense relations, Indian and Pakistan have always shared an affinity for each others art and culture. Movies and web series made in India and Pakistan travel widely across the border. Indias Bollywood and Punjabi movies are particularly popular in Pakistan, while Pakistani series enjoy a large viewership in India. Performers in both the countries also have a history of cross-border collaborations, working together on film and music projects. But such collaborations came to a halt when Bollywood dropped Pakistani actors in 2016 and Pakistan banned Indian movies in 2019, over military tensions between the countries. A few Punjabi movies from India have been screened in Pakistan in recent months. In 2023, Indias Supreme Court dismissed a petition that sought a complete ban on performers from Pakistan, asking the petitioners to not to be so narrow minded. Encouraged by this mild thaw in relations and Maula Jatts global success, its makers had hoped the folk drama would attract audiences in India. The leading actors of Maula Jatt are well-known in India for starring in popular Pakistani dramas. They have also previously appeared in big-budget Bollywood films. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "October 3, 2024 08:56 am",
        "content": "Israel bombed central Beirut in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least six people, after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Israel said it conducted a precise air strike on Beirut. Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in central Beiruts Bachoura neighbourhood close to parliament, the nearest Israeli strikes have come to Lebanons seat of government. At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo being circulated on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire. Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen Israeli strikes on Wednesday. A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour. The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined its ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Irans missile attack and Israels promise of retaliation raised concerns that the oil-producing Middle East could be caught up in a wider conflict. Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a condolence video, said: We are at the height of a difficult war against Irans Axis of Evil, which wants to destroy us. This will not happen because we will stand together and with Gods help, we will win together, he said. Lebanons health ministry said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people in the south and centre of the country over the past 24 hours. Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over barring further provocation, but Israel and the United States promised to hit back hard. U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Irans nuclear sites in response to its ballistic missile attack and urged Israel to act proportionally against its regional arch-foe. Biden joined a call with Group of Seven major power leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response, including new sanctions against Tehran, the White House said. G7 leaders voiced strong concern over the Middle East crisis but said a diplomatic solution was still viable and a region-wide conflict was in no ones interest, a statement said. Hezbollah said it repelled Israeli forces near several border towns and also fired rockets at military posts inside Israel. The paramilitary groups media chief Mohammad Afif said those battles were only the first round and that Hezbollah had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back Israel. Israels addition of infantry and armoured troops from the 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armoured Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, suggested that the operation might expand beyond limited commando raids. The military has said its incursion is largely aimed at destroying tunnels and other infrastructure on the border and there were no plans for a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut to the north or major cities in the south. 1.2 million Lebanese displaced Nevertheless, it issued new evacuation orders for around two dozen towns along the southern border, instructing inhabitants to head north of the Awali River, which flows east to west some 60 km (37 miles) north of the Israeli frontier. More than 1,900 people have been killed and over 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that about 1.2 million Lebanese had been displaced by Israeli attacks. Malika Joumaa, from Sudan, was forced to take shelter in Saint Josephs church in Beirut after being forced from her house near Sidon in coastal south Lebanon with her husband and two children. Its good that the church offered its help. We were going to stay in the streets; where would we have gone? Iran described Tuesdays missile assault as a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders, including Nasrallah, attacks in Lebanon against the group and Israels war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. There were no casualties from the missile onslaught in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 3, 2024 12:13 pm",
        "content": "A Singapore court on Thursday sentenced a former minister to 12 months in prison for obstructing justice and receiving more than 300,000 worth of gifts, in the first jailing of an ex-cabinet member in a city-state famous for its clean governance. S. Iswaran, who was a cabinet member for 13 years and has held the trade, communications and transport portfolios, pleaded guilty last week to four counts of improperly receiving gifts and one of obstructing justice. The sentence handed down was more severe than the six to seven months sought by the prosecution, which presiding judge Vincent Hoong said was manifestly inadequate given the gravity of Iswarans offences and their impact on public trust. Trust and confidence in public institutions were the bedrock of effective governance, which could all too easily be undermined by the appearance that an individual public servant had fallen below the standards of integrity and accountability, he said in sentencing Iswaran. The case has shocked Singapore, which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong and squeaky clean governance. It was among the worlds top five least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency Internationals corruption perception index. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when its national development minister was investigated for alleged bribery but died before any charges were filed in court. The investigation caused a stir in the Asian financial hub and centred on allegations Iswaran while transport minister accepted expensive gifts from businessmen that included tickets to English Premier League soccer matches, the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, London musicals and a ride on a private jet. The value of those totalled more than S400,000 (308,880.31), according to the prosecution. Iswaran, 62, faced a huge media scrum as he arrived in court and declined to answer questions. He showed no emotion during the court session. The judge allowed him to remain on bail for the next few days and begin his jail term on Monday. Iswaran had initially said he was innocent and would fight to clear his name but pleaded guilty last week to the five charges put before the court. The former minister faced a total of 35 charges, two of which were corruption-related but were later amended to charges of receiving gifts while a public servant. The attorney-generals chambers last week said they made amendments because of litigation risks involved in proving the corruption charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Iswaran was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks from businessmen including property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was an adviser to the Singapore Grand Prixs steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offence and has issued no public comment on the allegations. The attorney-generals chambers last week said it would decide whether to take action against Ong soon. Judge Hoong in his ruling said there was a higher level of culpability when a public servant holds high office that wield greater influence over business transactions. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Israels military campaign to wipe out Hamas is believed to have severely weakened the group by killing several of its leaders and thousands of fighters, while also reducing swaths of the territory it rules to rubble. The Gaza war was sparked by Hamass October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity. Israels retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,788 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territorys health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable. Mushtaha was one of Hamas most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas force deployment, said the military in a statement. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Issuing an announcement on the safety of Sri Lankans in Lebanon on Thursday (3), it said the Sri Lankan Embassy in Beirut is maintaining constant contact with Sri Lankan Associations and individual Sri Lankans registered with the embassy. Ambassador Kapila Jayaweera and officers of the Sri Lanka Embassy are providing assistance to Sri Lankans as required, it said. Apart from a few Sri Lankans who have been stranded and for whom the Embassy has arranged shelter, no Sri Lankans have been seriously affected by the situation so far, the ministry said. On September 30, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a travel advisory instructing Sri Lankan nationals not to travel to Lebanon and Syria until further notice due to the current volatile situation in the region. All Sri Lankans who are currently in Lebanon and Syria were strongly requested to be on alert and to take necessary precautions including restricting their outside movements and maintaining regular contacts with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Beirut and the Honorary Consul of Sri Lanka in Damascus. In recent weeks, the Israeli air force has struck hundreds of targets across Lebanon, including the eastern border area and the Bekaa Valley, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of villages and towns in southern Lebanon that are north of a United Nations-declared buffer zone established after the 2006 war. The warning issued Thursday signaled a possible broadening of Israels incursion into southern Lebanon, which until now has been confined to areas close to the border. --With Agencies Inputs",

At the meeting, the Vietnamese Ambassador said that both nations have enjoyed sound relations between their parties, states, and parliaments, setting out hope that the two sides will intensify mutual visits and contacts at a high level. This is along with accelerating the implementation of bilateral co-operation mechanisms and expanding collaboration across potential areas such as tourism, culture, education and agriculture to encourage people-to-people exchanges. Other efforts include continuing ties of traditional co-operation and support for each other at multilateral forums, including the UN, as they will celebrate the 55th anniversary of their diplomacy next year. She also said she wishes that the Sri Lankan Government will keep offering favourable conditions for the Vietnamese people living, working, and studying in the island nation. Ambassador Tam used the occasion to convey the congratulations from high-ranking Vietnamese leaders to Sri Lanka on its successful organization of the ninth presidential election on September 21, expressing her belief that under the leadership of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka will overcome difficulties and challenges soon. It aims to continue its stable development and become an attractive destination of tourism, trade, and foreign investment.

The sponsorship deal comes into effect in 2025 and marks a fresh push by LVMH into sports. The company, headed by one of the worlds richest men, Bernard Arnault, paid some 150 million (166 million) to be the premium sponsor of the Paris Olympics. High-end Swiss watchmaker Rolex had been a partner to Formula 1 since 2013.

At the Paris Olympics, LVMH and other companies broadened the realm of traditional brand sponsorship, taking part in medals ceremonies, for example. For many years, several of our Maisons (brands) have also chosen to invest in Formula 1, said LVMH Watches CEO Frederic Arnault, adding: We want to further grow this experiential dimension that Formula 1 provides all over the world. LVMH did not provide financial details of the deal.

        "content": "Google said on Friday it will stop linking to New Zealand news articles and ditch the agreements it has with local news organisations, if the countrys government goes ahead with a law to force tech giants to pay a fair price for content that appears on their feeds. The New Zealand government in July confirmed it would progress legislation started by the previous Labour Party-led government that ensures fair revenue sharing between operators of digital platforms and news media entities. The proposed legislation is still in review and is likely to see changes including some to bring it more in line with Australian legislation. Caroline Rainsford, Google New Zealand Country Director said in a blog post that if the bill as it currently stands becomes law, Google would be forced to make significant changes to its products and investments. Wed be forced to stop linking to news content on Google Search, Google News or Discover surfaces in New Zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with New Zealand news publishers, Rainsford said. Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc is concerned that bill is contrary to the idea of the internet being open, that it will be harmful to small publishers and that the uncapped financial exposure provides business uncertainty. New Zealand Minister for Media and Communications Paul Goldsmith said he was considering the range of views in the sector. We are still in the consultation phase and will make announcements in due course, he said in a statement. My officials and I have met with Google on a number of occasions to discuss their concerns, and will continue to do so. Although minority government coalition partner ACT does not support the legislation, it is likely to find enough cross party support to pass once finalised. Australia introduced a law in 2021 that gave the government power to make internet companies negotiate content supply deals with media outlets. A review released by the Australian government in 2022 found it largely worked. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 4, 2024 02:19 pm",
        "content": "Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the groups key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived on Friday in Beirut, where he was expected to discuss the war between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Araghchis visit to Beirut came three days after Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Iran is Hezbollahs main backer and over the years has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group. The blasts overnight rocked Beiruts southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanons state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. Associated Press video footage showed that the strikes left two huge craters on each side of the road. People carrying bags were seen crossing on foot after being dropped off by cars that were unable to pass the site of the airstrike. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assads forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between the Masnaa crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23  when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon  and Sept. 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanons minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanons southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the occupied West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Source: AP --Agencies",
