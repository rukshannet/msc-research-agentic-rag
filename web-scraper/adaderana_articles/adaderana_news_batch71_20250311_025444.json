        "title": "Official Creditor Committee confirms debt treatment deal reached with Sri Lanka",
        "date": "November 29, 2023 03:55 pm",
        "content": "The Official Creditor Committee (OCC) has confirmed its in-principle agreement on specific financing terms to restructure Sri Lankas debt in line with the parameters set in the IMF program, Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe says. Following the launch of a common platform in April 2023 for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, the OCC  co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as the chair of the Paris Club)  was formally formed on May 09 with 17 countries to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for a debt treatment. Since its formation, the OCC has engaged extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, the World Bank as well as China, and Sri Lankas private creditors. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Semasinghe said this is a very significant milestone while referring to a similar in-principle agreement previously provided by Chinas Export-Import (Exim) Bank. This confirms that all official creditors have agreed to restructure Sri Lankas debt, which is a major step in the resolution of Sri Lankas economic crisis, the lawmaker emphasized. He mentioned that the OCCs agreement now paves the way for the IMFs Executive Board to consider the first review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program and unlock the next tranche of the loan which is expected in December and in turn would enable the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide further financing. Semasinghe also noted that this is another important indicator of the continued cooperation and support of the global community in Sri Lankas economic recovery. Sri Lanka remains committed to implementation of the comprehensive reform program that will restore macroeconomic stability and firms place the country on a path of sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Subsequently, Sri Lanka through its financial advisors, will continue to engage with its external private sector creditors in order to reach similar agreement in principle, Semasinghe asserted. Meanwhile, in its statement on the in-principle deal reached with Sri Lanka on debt restructuring, the OCC said it has come to an agreement with Sri Lanka on the main parameters of a debt treatment consistent with those of the EFF arrangement between the island nation and the IMF. The OCC has commended the Sri Lankan authorities for their continuous efforts in implementing the reforms necessary for their countrys return to a sustainable path. Attached below is the Official Creditor Committees statement on the agreement: Following the launch event in April 2023, 17 countries formally formed, on May 9, an Official Creditor Committee (OCC) co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as chair of the Paris Club) to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for a debt treatment. The committee includes India and Hungary in addition to Paris Club creditors. Since then, the OCC has engaged extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, the World Bank as well as China, and Sri Lankas private creditors. The OCC and Sri Lanka agreed on the main parameters of a debt treatment consistent with those of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement between Sri Lanka and the IMF. This agreement will allow the IMF staff to present to the IMF Executive Board the first review of Sri Lankas EFF arrangement and open the way for approval of the second disbursement under the arrangement. The OCC commends the Sri Lankan authorities for their continuous efforts in implementing the reforms necessary for their countrys return to a sustainable path. The OCC stands ready and looks forward to formalizing this agreement in the coming weeks in a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sri Lankan authorities. The OCC expects other bilateral creditors to consent to sharing, in a transparent manner, the information necessary for the OCC to evaluate comparability of treatment regarding their own bilateral agreement. The OCC also expects that the Sri Lankan authorities will continue to engage with their private creditors to find as soon as possible an agreement on terms at least as favourable as the terms offered by the OCC. These engagements will ensure that the overall debt treatment granted to Sri Lanka is consistent with the IMF program parameters.",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with its Official Creditor Committee (OCC) on the financial terms of a debt treatment. Issuing a statement, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policy stated that the agreement in principle covers approximately US 5.9bn of outstanding public debt and consists of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. The Sri Lankan government has commended the support and cooperation of OCC members in reaching this agreement, which demonstrates a mutual commitment to restoring public debt sustainability in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program targets, the statement mentioned. The agreement is expected to facilitate a swift approval by the IMF Executive Board of the First Review of Sri Lankas IMF-supported program, allowing for the next tranche of IMF financing of about US 334 million to be disbursed. The agreed-upon debt treatment terms will be further detailed and formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Sri Lanka and the OCC, which will then be implemented through bilateral agreements with each OCC member, in accordance with their laws and regulations. The Sri Lankan government looks forward to a prompt implementation of the agreed terms, the Finance Ministry said. Speaking in this regard, Secretary to the TreasuryMinistry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies, K. M. Mahinda Siriwardana said: This agreement marks a landmark step for Sri Lanka. We extend our sincerest thanks to the OCC and its co-chairs, Japan, India and France, for the unwavering support in resolving our countrys public debt situation. This agreement serves as a key milestone in Sri Lankas ongoing endeavour to achieve public debt sustainability and to foster economic recovery. The Finance Ministry said this agreement in principle, together with the agreement in principle reached last month with China Export-Import (Exim) Bank, goes a long way in dealing with Sri Lankas external bilateral debt restructuring. The next steps will include finalizing similar agreements with our remaining official bilateral creditors, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Kuwait and Iran, altogether representing a further US 274 million of outstanding claims, the statement read further. Sri Lankan government says it now intends to focus its efforts on reaching comparable debt restructuring agreements with external commercial creditors, and in particular with its holders of international sovereign bonds. Good faith engagement is still ongoing in that regard, and the authorities would like to invite its bondholders to now accelerate the discussions with a view to coming to a mutually acceptable agreement as promptly as possible. The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to transparency, comparable treatment of all participating external creditors, and full compliance with the debt sustainability targets under the IMF-supported program. Earlier today, the OCC confirmed that it has reached an agreement with Sri Lanka on the main parameters of a debt treatment consistent with those of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement between Sri Lanka and the IMF.",

We invite him to visit Gaza to see the extent of the massacres and destruction committed against the people of Gaza, in compliance with the standards of objectivity and credibility, Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan said in a press conference in Beirut. On Monday, Elon Musk, the social media mogul assailed for his endorsement of an anti-Jewish post, toured the site of the Hamas assault on Israel and declared his commitment to do whatever was necessary to stop the spread of hatred. Musk owns the X social media platform. Hamdans comments comes one day after a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas was extended for an additional 48 hours. Within 50 days, Israel dropped more than 40,000 tonnes of explosives on the homes of defenseless Gazans, he said, I call on US President Biden to review the US relationship with Israel and to stop supplying them with weapons. Speaking on the destruction of Gaza incurred by Israel since the conflict began on Oct. 7, Hamdan called on the international community to quickly send specialized civil defense teams to help retrieve bodies still trapped under the rubble. According to the Palestinian foreign ministry, thousands are still trapped. The truce agreed last week was the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. In response to that attack, Israel has bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north.

        "date": "November 29, 2023 09:15 pm",
        "content": "Addressing the 2023 Sri Lanka Economic Summit, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has declared the imperative need for radical economic restructuring to ensure the sustainability of the countrys economy. The Head of State emphasized that continuous commitment to a new economic policy framework is essential to avoid a recurring economic crisis. The summit, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and held over two days at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, commenced on Tuesday (Nov.28), and witnessed President Wickremesinghe laying out the achievements of the past years radical economic restructuring and outlining the roadmap for the nations economic future. Wickremesinghe began his keynote address by acknowledging the theme of the summit Economic Reform for 2023. He questioned whether the transformative measures taken could be labelled as mere reforms, asserting that the changes implemented were more accurately described as a radical restructuring with no possibility of reverting. Its a restructuring and a radical restructuring, and theres no going back, stated the President, underscoring the irreversible nature of the economic changes. The president highlighted the progress made in the economy through the governments radical restructuring efforts over the past year. He stressed the importance of continuing these efforts and working within the framework of the new economic policy to elevate the country to a robust economy resistant to potential downturns. Wickremesinghes vision for the economic future relies on the dedication and collaboration of all stakeholders within the specified policy framework. One of the key achievements mentioned by the president was the successful negotiation with creditors over the countrys debt. He acknowledged the cooperation of all creditor groups and commended their constructive engagement. Notably, negotiations with China Exim Bank resulted in an agreement in principle to restructure the countrys debt, signalling a positive step forward in the economic stabilization process. Wickremesinghe highlighted the governments transparent and good-faith negotiations with creditors, dispelling expectations of challenges in the process. He specifically mentioned the engagement with the Official Creditor Committee and China Exim Bank, showcasing Sri Lankas ability to navigate complex negotiations successfully. The president expressed optimism that the IMF Board would conclude the first review of Sri Lankas EFF program within the month of December. Wickremesinghe outlined the ongoing discussions with external private creditors, emphasizing the governments commitment to reach an agreement on specific restructuring terms with them shortly. A focal point of the restructuring strategy is a reliance on a long-term extension of the debt, with economic principles guiding future negotiations and operations. In his address, Wickremesinghe touched upon the necessity of adhering to the agreed-upon framework, stressing that deviation could lead to adverse consequences with creditors. He urged the nation to embrace the radical restructuring as a last chance for economic stability, emphasizing the need to break away from the cycle of seeking external aid due to mismanagement. Addressing concerns about consensus, the president acknowledged the challenges of obtaining agreement from political parties and trade unions. He argued that a consensus with those who had not taken responsibility in the past was difficult to achieve. The President called for a united front in recognizing the gravity of the economic situation and urged the country to agree on the proposed framework. Wickremesinghe drew attention to the dangers of remaining a beggar nation and the unsustainable practice of seeking financial assistance without addressing the root causes of economic instability. He questioned the wisdom of repeatedly asking other countries for help, emphasizing the need for internal reform and competitiveness. Wickremesinghe underscored the importance of a competitive, export-oriented economy, outlining the governments vision for a digitalized and green economy. He drew parallels with the economic reforms of 1977, emphasizing the need for a new era of economic policies that align with the current global landscape. Following his address, the president participated in a panel discussion moderated by the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce, Duminda Hulangamuwa.

        "title": "Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state and Nobel winner, dead at 100",
        "date": "November 30, 2023 07:51 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Henry Kissinger, a controversial Nobel Peace Prize winner and diplomatic powerhouse whose service under two presidents left an indelible mark on U.S. foreign policy, died on Wednesday at age 100, according to his geopolitical consulting firm Kissinger Associates Inc. Kissinger died at his home in Connecticut, Kissinger Associates said. Kissinger had been active past his centenary, attending meetings in the White House, publishing a book on leadership styles, and testifying before a Senate committee about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. In July 2023 he made a surprise visit to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. In the 1970s, he had a hand in many of the epoch-changing global events of the decade while serving as secretary of state under Republican President Richard Nixon. The German-born Jewish refugees efforts led to the diplomatic opening of China, landmark U.S.-Soviet arms control talks, expanded ties between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and the Paris Peace Accords with North Vietnam. Kissingers reign as the prime architect of U.S. foreign policy waned with Nixons resignation in 1974. Still, he continued to be a diplomatic force under President Gerald Ford and to offer strong opinions throughout the rest of his life. While many hailed Kissinger for his brilliance and broad experience, others branded him a war criminal for his support for anti-communist dictatorships, especially in Latin America. In his latter years, his travels were circumscribed by efforts by other nations to arrest or question him about past U.S. foreign policy. His 1973 Peace Prize - awarded jointly to North Vietnams Le Duc Tho, who would decline it - was one of the most controversial ever. Two members of the Nobel committee resigned over the selection and questions arose about the U.S. secret bombing of Cambodia. Ford called Kissinger a super secretary of state but also noted his prickliness and self assurance, which critics were more likely to call paranoia and egotism. Even Ford said, Henry in his mind never made a mistake. He had the thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew, Ford said in an interview shortly before his death in 2006. With his dour expression and gravelly, German-accented voice, Kissinger was hardly a rock star but had an image as a ladies man, squiring starlets around Washington and New York in his bachelor days. Power, he said, was the ultimate aphrodisiac. Voluble on policy, Kissinger was reticent on personal matters, although he once told a journalist he saw himself as a cowboy hero, riding off alone. HARVARD FACULTY Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in Furth, Germany, on May 27, 1923, and moved to the United States with his family in 1938 before the Nazi campaign to exterminate European Jews. Anglicizing his name to Henry, Kissinger became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1943, served in the Army in Europe in World War Two, and went to Harvard University on scholarship, earning a masters degree in 1952 and a doctorate in 1954. He was on Harvards faculty for the next 17 years. During much of that time, Kissinger served as a consultant to government agencies, including in 1967 when he acted as an intermediary for the State Department in Vietnam. He used his connections with President Lyndon Johnsons administration to pass on information about peace negotiations to the Nixon camp. When Nixons pledge to end the Vietnam War won him the 1968 presidential election, he brought Kissinger to the White House as national security adviser. But the process of Vietnamization - shifting the burden of the war from the half-million U.S. forces to the South Vietnamese - was long and bloody, punctuated by massive U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, the mining of the Norths harbors, and the bombing of Cambodia. Kissinger declared in 1972 that peace is at hand in Vietnam but the Paris Peace Accords reached in January 1973 were little more than a prelude to the final Communist takeover of the South two years later. In 1973, in addition to his role as national security adviser, Kissinger was named secretary of state - giving him unchallenged authority in foreign affairs. An intensifying Arab-Israeli conflict launched Kissinger on his first so-called shuttle mission, a brand of highly personal, high-pressure diplomacy for which he became famous. Thirty-two days spent shuttling between Jerusalem and Damascus helped Kissinger forge a long-lasting disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. In an effort to diminish Soviet influence, Kissinger reached out to its chief communist rival, China, and made two trips there, including a secret one to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai. The result was Nixons historic summit in Beijing with Chairman Mao Zedong and the eventual formalization of relations between the two countries. STRATEGIC ARMS ACCORD The Watergate scandal that forced Nixon to resign barely grazed Kissinger, who was not connected to the cover-up and continued as secretary of state when Ford took office in the summer of 1974. But Ford did replace him as national security adviser in an effort to hear more voices on foreign policy. Later that year Kissinger went with Ford to Vladivostok in the Soviet Union, where the president met Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and agreed to a basic framework for a strategic arms pact. The agreement capped Kissingers pioneering efforts at detente that led to a relaxing of U.S.-Soviet tensions. But Kissingers diplomatic skills had their limits. In 1975, he was faulted for failing to persuade Israel and Egypt to agree to a second-stage disengagement in the Sinai. And in the India-Pakistan War of 1971, Nixon and Kissinger were heavily criticized for tilting toward Pakistan. Kissinger was heard calling the Indians bastards - a remark he later said he regretted. Like Nixon, he feared the spread of left-wing ideas in the Western hemisphere, and his actions in response were to cause deep suspicion of Washington from many Latin Americans for years to come. In 1970 he plotted with the CIA on how best to destabilize and overthrow the Marxist but democratically-elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, while he said in a memo in the wake of Argentinas bloody coup in 1976 that the military dictators should be encouraged. When Ford lost to Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, in 1976, Kissingers days in the suites of government power were largely over. The next Republican in the White House, Ronald Reagan, distanced himself from Kissinger, who he viewed as out of step with his conservative constituency. After leaving government, Kissinger set up a high-priced, high-powered consulting firm in New York, which offered advice to the worlds corporate elite. He served on company boards and various foreign policy and security forums, wrote books, and became a regular media commentator on international affairs. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, President George W. Bush picked Kissinger to head an investigative committee. But outcry from Democrats who saw a conflict of interest with many of his consulting firms clients forced Kissinger to step down from the post. Divorced from his first wife, Ann Fleischer, in 1964, he married Nancy Maginnes, an aide to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, in 1974. He had two children by his first wife.

Tennakoon was serving as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) in charge of the Western Province at the time of his appointment yesterday (Nov.29). Speaking to the media last evening, Acting IGP Tennakoon vowed to eradicate the drug menace and organized criminal gangs in the country. He also said he would prioritize safeguarding the national security. The appointment was made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe pursuant to the powers vested with him. Accordingly, SDIG Tennakoon will serve as the Acting IGP for a period of three months. Meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena told Ada Derana yesterday that President Wickremesinghe has informed the Constitutional Council of the new Acting IGP. Tennakoons appointment comes days after former police chief C.D. Wickramaratne decided to finally retire from the police service with effect from November 25, after receiving four service extensions as the IGP this year. He was initially supposed to enter retirement on March 26, however the Head of State had extended Wickramaratnes tenure by 3 months, by way of a gazette issued in April. Later, on July 09, he received another 3-month service extension, followed by two 3-week extensions granted on October 13 and November 03. The position of the police chief remained vacant for a few days following the retirement of Wickramaratne. Against this backdrop, the Sri Lankan Catholic Church has deplored the appointment of Tennakoon as the Acting IGP. Addressing a media briefing yesterday, the spokesperson of the Colombo Archdiocese Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini said the Catholic Church deems this appointment an insult to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks.",

        "content": "Pastor Jerome Fernando, who was under fire for his much-disputed comments on several religions, has made an appearance at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) this morning (Nov.30) The self-styled prophet returned to the island on Wednesday morning (Nov.29) after months of controversy over his remarks. He arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned the self-styled prophet should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. As such, he arrived at the CID premises this morning to provide a statement. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him. Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels on May 16. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island. On May 26, Fernando filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition. In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country.",

The deal comes about a month after Sri Lankas agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China covering about 4.2 billion of outstanding debt, while clearing the IMF review could trigger a second tranche of about 334 million in funds. These understandings pave the way for the IMF Executive Board to consider completion of the first review of Sri Lankas four-year Extended Fund Facility Arrangement, Peter Breuer, IMFs mission chief for Sri Lanka, said in a statement. We look forward to the Executive Board taking up this review by mid-December and the continuation of our productive collaboration with Sri Lanka in the period ahead. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of 2.9 billion in March, the South Asian island nation has managed to partly stabilise its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. After receiving the IMF money, Sri Lanka could get further funding from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, bringing the total amount to around 900 million, central bank Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said last week. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

But we also had a problem with the printing machines. It was only last Monday that we received the required machines. Therefore, we will recommence the printing activities this week. I hope to complete printing these driving licences within 06 months.

        "date": "November 30, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Israel and Hamas on Thursday agreed to extend their cease-fire by another day, just minutes before it was set to expire. The truce in Gaza appeared increasingly tenuous as the number of women and children held by the militants as bargaining chips dwindled after dozens were released. Word of the extension came just as the truce was to expire at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) Thursday. The Qatari Foreign Ministry said the truce was being extended under the same terms as in the past, with Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages per day in exchange for Israels release of 30 Palestinian prisoners. International pressure has mounted for the cease-fire to continue as long as possible after nearly eight weeks of Israeli bombardment and a ground campaign in Gaza that have killed thousands of Palestinians, uprooted three quarters of the population of 2.3 million and led to a humanitarian crisis. The war has stoked tensions across the region. On Thursday morning, two gunmen opened fire on people waiting for buses and rides where a main highway from Tel Aviv enters Jerusalem. Israels Maged David Adom emergency service said one person was killed and six people were wounded, one of them critically. Police said the two attackers were killed. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel late Wednesday on his third trip to the region since the start of the war, and is expected to press for further extensions of the truce and the release of more hostages. The announcement followed a last-minute standoff, with Hamas saying Israel had rejected a proposed list that included seven living captives and the remains of three who the group said were killed in Israeli airstrikes. Israel later said Hamas submitted an improved list, paving the way for the extension. The talks appear to be growing tougher with most of the women and children taken hostage by Hamas during the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war already freed. The militants are expected to make greater demands in return for freeing men and soldiers. Israel says it will maintain the truce until Hamas stops releasing captives, at which point it will resume its offensive aimed at eliminating the group. Hamas is deeply rooted in Palestinian society and has ruled Gaza since 2007. So far, the Israeli onslaught in Gaza seems to have had little effect on the groups rule, evidenced by its ability to conduct complex negotiations, enforce the truce among other armed groups, and orchestrate the release of hostages. Hamas leaders, including Yehya Sinwar, have likely relocated to southern Gaza. With Israeli troops holding much of northern Gaza, a ground invasion south  where most of Gazas population is now concentrated  will likely bring an escalating cost in Palestinian lives and destruction. The Biden administration has told Israel that if it launches an offensive in the south, it must operate with far greater precision. INCREASINGLY TENSE HOSTAGE TALKS The plight of the captives and shock from Hamas Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel have galvanized Israeli support for the war. But Netanyahu is under pressure to bring the hostages home and could find it difficult to resume the offensive if theres a prospect of more releases. Since the initial truce began on Friday, both sides have been releasing only women and children. Israeli officials say Gaza militants still hold around 20 women, who would all be released in a few days if the swaps continue at the current rate. After that, keeping the truce going depends on tougher negotiations over the release of around 126 men Israel says are held captive, including several dozen soldiers. For men  and especially soldiers  Hamas is expected to push for comparable releases of Palestinian men or prominent detainees, a deal Israel may resist. So far, most Palestinians released have been teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Several were women convicted by Israeli military courts of attempting to attack soldiers. Palestinians have celebrated the release of people they see as having resisted Israels decades-long military occupation of lands they want for a future state. An Israeli official involved in hostage negotiations said talks on a further extension for release of civilian males and soldiers were still preliminary, and that a deal would not be considered until all the women and children are out. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations were ongoing. With Wednesdays releases, a total of 73 Israelis, including dual nationals, have been freed during the six-day truce, most of whom appear physically well but shaken. Another 24 hostages  23 Thais and one Filipino  have also been released. Before the cease-fire, Hamas released four hostages, and the Israeli army rescued one. Two others were found dead in Gaza. Hamas kidnapped some 240 people during the attack on southern Israel that began the war, including babies, children, women, soldiers, older adults and Thai farm laborers. It killed over 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians. Israels bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza have killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The toll is likely much higher, as officials have only sporadically updated the count since Nov. 11 due to the breakdown of services in the north. The ministry says thousands more people are missing and feared dead under the rubble. Israel says 77 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. IN GAZA, AN ANXIOUS RESPITE For Palestinians in Gaza, the truces calm has been overwhelmed by the search for aid and by horror at the extent of destruction. In the north, residents described entire residential blocks as leveled in Gaza City and surrounding areas. The smell of decomposing bodies trapped under collapsed buildings fills the air, said Mohmmed Mattar, a 29-year-old resident of Gaza City who along with other volunteers searches for the dead under rubble or left in the streets. In the south, the truce has allowed more aid to be delivered from Egypt, up to 200 trucks a day. But aid officials say it is not enough, given that most now depend on outside aid. Overwhelmed U.N.-run shelters house over 1 million displaced people, with many sleeping outside in cold, rainy weather. At a distribution center in Rafah, large crowds line up daily for bags of flour but supplies run out quickly. Every day, we come here  we spend money on transportation to get here, just to go home with nothing, said one woman in line, Nawal Abu Namous. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Manila mayor Honey Lacuna suggested taxidermy for Mali so she could be displayed in a museum. You all know that Mali is our prized possession. She was one of our star attractions in Manila Zoo, Ms Lacuna said in a mix of Filipino and English during a press briefing on Nov 29. We are starting to have talks with experts on how to preserve Mali and put it in our museum here, she added. Mali who had lived alone at the zoo for more than 40 years, could have died of heart failure, according to Manila Zoos chief veterinarian Dr. Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo. Animal rights activists had described as Mali as one of the worlds saddest elephants. There is no record of exactly how old she was, but she is believed to be 48 to 49 years old. Mali had been the Manila Zoos star attraction, sent as a gift by Sri Lanka in 1977 to then Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos. She would have been seen by nearly all Filipinos who had gone on field trips to the zoo while in primary school. Found orphaned in the wild, she was about three years old when she arrived in Manila. Mali was put in a pen with an older female elephant, Shiba, who had been rescued from a circus. Shiba died six years after Mali was brought to the zoo. In 2012, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals started a campaign to have Mali moved to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, calling her perhaps one of the worlds saddest elephants.

In that category, Taylor Swifts Midnights trails in second, with SZAs SOS in third. All three albums were released last year.

Instead, they pay per streamshare, a figure that is determined by adding up how many times music owned or controlled by a particular rights holder is streamed, divided by the total number of streams in the market it is streamed in each month. Last month, Spotify announced a new policy regarding royalty payments, eliminating payment for songs with less than 1,000 annual streams starting in 2024. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas overall rate of inflation as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) on year-on-year (y-o-y) basis has increased to 3.4 in November, from 1.5 in October. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), in its latest report, said the year-on-year inflation of the food group increased to -3.6 in November from -5.2 in October. Meanwhile, the year-on-year inflation of the non-food group rose to 6.8 in November from 4.9 in October. For the month of November, the contribution to inflation by food commodities was -1.20, while the contribution of non-food items was 4.5. The DCS said this was mainly due to the increases in value change in groups of housing, water, electricity, gas  other fuels, education, clothing  footwear, alcoholic beverages, tobacco  narcotic, recreation  culture, health and miscellaneous goods  services. A decrease in value change was reported for the groups of furnishing household equipment and routine household maintenance, restaurants and hotels and transport. Further, a very slight price increase was reported in group communication during the month. The CCPI is an economic indicator constructed to measure inflation which is defined in percentage change in the CCPI over the year. There are two measures of inflation in general use. One measure is the year-on-year base or point-to-point inflation (the percentage change in the CPI during the last 12 months). The other measure is moving average inflation (the percentage difference between the average price index of the last 12 months and the average price index of previous 12 months).

        "content": "The United States has welcomed the in-principle agreement reached between Sri Lanka and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) on specific financing terms to restructure the island nations debt in line with the parameters set in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the US Ambassador in Colombo, Julie Chung said this agreement supports a viable path to economic stability for Sri Lanka. Chung emphasized that the agreement on debt restructuring and sound economic policies are crucial for the timely release of the next tranche of the IMFs bailout package, which she said would provide the much-needed financial support for continued economic stabilization, recovery, and the improvement of public services, benefiting the people of Sri Lanka. The ambassador reiterated that the United States stands by Sri Lanka for a sustainable recovery. Pleased to see Sri Lankas agreement on a debt treatment with the Official Creditors Committee, supporting a viable path to economic stability for Sri Lanka. Agreement on debt restructuring  sound economic policies are crucial for the timely release of the next IMF tranche,  Ambassador Julie Chung (USAmbSL) November 29, 2023 On Wednesday (Nov.29), both the OCC and the Sri Lankan government confirmed the in-principle agreement the two sides have reached for debt treatment. In its statement, the OCC has commended the Sri Lankan authorities for their continuous efforts in implementing the reforms necessary for their countrys return to a sustainable path. Following the launch of a common platform in April 2023 for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, the OCC was formally formed on May 09 with 17 countries to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for a debt treatment. It is co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as the chair of the Paris Club). Since its formation, the OCC has engaged extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, the World Bank as well as China, and Sri Lankas private creditors. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas Finance Ministry revealed that the agreement covers approximately USD 5.9 billion of outstanding debt and consists of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. The IMF on Thursday (Nov.30) said the agreement will pave the way for its Executive Board to consider clearing the first review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in December and unlock the next tranche of the loan which amounts to about USD 334 million in funds. We look forward to the Executive Board taking up this review by mid-December and the continuation of our productive collaboration with Sri Lanka in the period ahead, Peter Breuer, IMFs mission chief for Sri Lanka, said in a statement. The debt deal between the OCC and Sri Lanka comes about a month after the island nations agreement with Chinas Export-Import (Exim) Bank covering approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt, Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of 2.9 billion in March, the South Asian island nation has managed to partly stabilize its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. After receiving the IMF money, Sri Lanka stands to receive further funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, bringing the total amount to around USD 900 million.",

Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels on May 16.

On May 26, Fernando filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition. In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country.",

        "date": "November 30, 2023 10:27 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Ways and Means recommended to the Department of Pensions to introduce a formula for raising the pensions in proportion to the existing cost of living index in a humanitarian manner. This was stated when the Committee met in Parliament on Wednesday (Nov. 29) under the Chairmanship of MP Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Officials of government institutions such as the Department of Pensions, National Secretariat for Elders, and representatives of pensioners associations were called for this meeting. The department disclosed that more than 700,000 active pensioners are currently registered in the Department of Pensions, and it was disclosed that some people are not active due to reasons such as investigations, deaths, etc. It was disclosed that about 26,000 retirees (19,000 civil, 7,000 armed forces) join active status every year, and about 20,000 are removed from the retired list due to death. It was reported that Rs. 413 billion has been earmarked for the Department of Pensions for a month, and 24 times the required pension will be paid as gratuity for those retiring at the age of 55, which will be deducted from the pension within 10 years. The role of the National Secretariat for Elders is to provide a monthly allowance of 2000 rupees to low-income earners over 70 years of age, whose monthly income is less than 6000 rupees, and on the certificate of the Grama Niladhari, 733,204 elderly allowances are currently being paid, the officials of that institution said. The Committee Chair instructed the officials of the National Secretariat for Elders to provide the Committee with statistics on the number of people who join the list of elderly allowance payers, the number of people who leave due to death, and the number of elderly people on the waiting list, the statement mentioned. It was discussed that the increase in wages for public servants with effect from 01.01.2016 was implemented under 5 phases till 01.01.2020, and that those who retired after 01.01.2020 will receive the full pension adjusted according to the increase in salary, which has resulted in a huge pension disparity between those who retired before 2017 and those who retired after 2020. The decision taken by the Council of Ministers to suspend the pension increase due on 01 January 2020 was a cause and additionally due to the salary increase for teacher principals in 2021, a severe pension discrepancy has arisen for those who retired before 01 January 2017 was mentioned. Moreover, although government employees were given a salary increase of Rs. 10,000 with effect from 01012024, the allowance of pensioners has been increased only by Rs.2500- and considering the salary increase, the pension has only increased by 25 and given the increase is not sufficient in view of the increase in the cost of living, the pensioners stated before the Committee. The Chair recommended to introduce a formula for the purpose of increasing the pension in proportion to the existing cost of living index in a humanitarian manner, it added. The benefits of the Agrahara insurance scheme are available to those who retired after 01 January 2016, and those who retired before that date should also be extended the insurance scheme in such a way that they get the same benefits. Thereby, the necessity of providing hospitalization allowances, surgery allowances, death gratuity allowances etc. to those who retired before the relevant date was emphasized on the part of the pensioners. The Committee Chair instructed to look into the possibility of providing the benefits of Agrahara Insurance Scheme to those who retired before 01 January 2016. Committee Chair Patali Champika Ranawaka instructed the officials to appoint an authorized representative of the Department of Pensions to discuss the issues faced by the pensioners and to make arrangements to hold the initial discussion between the representatives of the pensioners associations and the authorized officer on December 15 at 9.00 a.m., it said. It was emphasized here that those who receive senior citizens allowance and persons with disabilities should be included in the list of those who should receive social benefits (social registry). The need for setting up a digital system that can quickly update the deaths of pensioners was also emphasized as there is a significant impact on the payment of pensions. State Ministers Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Anuradha Jayaratne, and Members of Parliament W. D. J. Seneviratne and Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda were present at this Committee meeting held, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "title": "Shane MacGowan: The Pogues star behind Christmas hit Fairytale of New York, dies",
        "date": "December 1, 2023 08:44 am",
        "content": "The Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan has died aged 65, following a recent hospital stay after being diagnosed with encephalitis. The singer-songwriter, whose hits include 1987s Fairytale of New York and A Pair of Brown Eyes, had been unwell for some time. MacGowan also had well-documented problems with drugs and alcohol. His wife Victoria Mary Clarke said on Instagram that MacGowan meant the world to me. She wrote: I dont know how to say this so I am just going to say it. Shane... has gone to be with Jesus and Mary and his beautiful mother Therese. She said MacGowan will always be the light that I hold before me and the measure of my dreams and the love of my life and the most beautiful soul and beautiful angel and the sun and the moon and the start and end of everything that I hold dear. A statement from MacGowans spokesperson confirmed he died peacefully at 3.30am this morning (30 November) with his wife and sister by his side. Prayers and the last rites were read during his passing, he added. On 22 November, Clarke said he had left hospital, and just a few days later she said they celebrated their wedding anniversary, and were grateful they were still alive. Born in Kent, MacGowan was the son of Irish immigrants and fronted The Pogues from 1982 until their break-up in 2014. He had formed the Irish punk band Pogue Mahone, later shortened to The Pogues, in 1982 and released seven studio albums. In 1988 Kirsty MacColl collaborated with The Pogues for the Christmas song Fairytale of New York, written by MacGowan, which got to number two in the UK chart and remains one of the UKs best-loved Christmas songs. Libertines frontman Pete Doherty told Newshour the song was an absolute belter and one you never get tired of hearing. He recalled performing on stage with MacGowan, saying there you made the strongest connections. I knew he was ill but I thought he was bulletproof, Doherty told the programme. I loved and respected him. For a long time I was sitting at his feet in awe, and I do feel that over time I got his respect, he added MacGowan revealed he was diagnosed with encephalitis last year in a video posted to social media on New Years Eve. It is an uncommon but serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed, according to the NHS website. He had also used a wheelchair since 2015 after injuring himself in a fall. In 2018 he was honoured with a lifetime achievement award at a 60th birthday party in Dublins National Concert Hall. A documentary about his life - Crock Of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan - was released in 2020. He was close friends with Irish singer Sinéad OConnor who died in July. In her statement, Clarke said: I am blessed beyond words to have met him and to have loved him and to have been so endlessly and unconditionally loved by him and to have had so many years of life and love and joy and fun and laughter and so many adventures. Theres no way to describe the loss that I am feeling and the longing for just one more of his smiles that lit up my world. Irish President Michael D Higgins described Shane MacGowan as one of musics greatest lyricists. Like so many across the world, it was with the greatest sadness that I learned this morning of the death of Shane MacGowan, he said. His words have connected Irish people all over the globe to their culture and history, encompassing so many human emotions in the most poetic of ways. Author Tony Parsons posted on social media: I remember Shane MacGowan when he was in his mid-teens and coming down the Roxy in Covent Garden to bang on unattended drums in his Union jack jacket. A crazy kid with a dream who grew into one of the greatest talents these islands have ever know. A creative giant. Sleep well, Shane and see you at number one for Christmas. The musician Nick Cave called him a true friend and the greatest songwriter of his generation, adding it was a very sad day. The Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess also paid tribute, saying MacGowan had a life lived to the full. A lyrical genius. An inspiration to so many of us who wanted to be in bands. I followed The Pogues to far flung places, met Shane a few times and watched some of the most exhilarating shows Ive ever witnessed, he also said on social media. Derry Girls actor Siobhan McSweeney has said that Shane MacGowan was the voice of London for us Irish and said when she was scared about moving to the capital he lured me over with songs about chancers, drinkers, lovers, poets and scoundrels. Fairytale of New York producer Steve Lillywhite told BBC Radio 5 Live MacGowan was truly a poet, crediting him for inventing a new style of music that was sort of the punk attitude with traditional Irish rhythms. MacGowans bandmate, Spider Stacy also paid tribute with a band photo. TV presenter Dermot OLeary talked about the importance of The Pogues for the Irish diaspora. The Pogues were our band, he said. Shanes words were symbols of an Ireland I knew through sepia-worn pictures and endless summer holidays. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Eight Israeli hostages released for 30 Palestinian prisoners under tenuous Gaza truce",
        "date": "December 1, 2023 08:59 am",
        "content": "Israel released another group of Palestinian prisoners Friday, hours after Hamas freed additional Israeli hostages under a last-minute agreement to extend their cease-fire by another day in Gaza. But any further extension renewal, now in its eighth day, could prove more challenging as Hamas is expected to set a higher price for many of the remaining hostages. Hamas freed six hostages hours after releasing two Israeli women Thursday afternoon. All were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza after eight weeks in captivity. They were brought to Israel for medical evaluations and to be reunited with their families, the Israeli military said. A busload of 30 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel was welcomed home in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Dozens of men, some holding green Hamas flags, greeted the prisoners. The men were hugged as the crowd chanted, God is great. During the truce, at least 10 Israelis a day, along with other nationals, have been freed by Hamas in return for Israels release of at least 30 Palestinian prisoners. Asked why Hamas on Thursday released fewer than 10 hostages, as outlined in the cease-fire agreement, the militarys chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, noted that 12 Israeli citizens had been released the day before, implying that the overall total had met Israeli demands. We insist on getting the maximum possible, Hagari said. Its been that way every day and also today. International pressure has mounted for the truce to continue as long as possible after weeks of Israeli bombardment and a ground campaign following Hamas deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war. Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed and more than three-quarters of the population of 2.3 million have been uprooted, leading to a humanitarian crisis. Israel has vowed to resume the fighting  with the goal of dismantling Hamas  once the cease-fire ends. The cease-fire was set to expire Friday, though international mediators are working to extend it. The talks appear to be growing tougher, with Hamas having already freed most of the women and children it kidnapped on Oct. 7. The militants are expected to make greater demands in return for freeing scores of civilian men and soldiers. Roughly 140 hostages are believed to remain in Hamas captivity. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials on his third visit to the region since the start of the war, said he hoped the cease-fire could be extended and more hostages could be released. Blinken also said that if Israel resumes the war and moves against southern Gaza to pursue Hamas, it must do so in compliance with international humanitarian law and must have a clear plan in place to protect civilians. He said Israeli leaders understood that the massive levels of civilian life and displacement scale we saw in the north not be repeated in the south. Most of Gazas population is now crammed into the south with no exit, raising questions over how an Israeli offensive there can avoid heavy civilian casualties. Qatar and Egypt, which have played a key role in mediating, are seeking to prolong the deal by another two days, according to Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypts State Information Service. Thursday morning, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on people waiting for buses along a main highway entering Jerusalem, killing at least three people and wounding several others, according to Israeli police. The two attackers, brothers from a neighborhood in annexed east Jerusalem, were killed. After the attack, six other members of the family were detained, and the government ordered their house demolished. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, casting it as retaliation for the killing of women and children in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and other Israeli crimes. The attack did not appear to threaten the truce in Gaza. But escalating violence  including Israeli raids  in the West Bank and east Jerusalem could blow back to wreck the quiet in Gaza, even though these areas are not covered under the cease-fire. TENSE HOSTAGE TALKS Netanyahu is under intense pressure from families of the hostages to bring them home. But his far-right governing partners are also pushing him to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed, and could abandon his coalition if he is seen as making too many concessions. Israel says it will maintain the truce until Hamas stops releasing captives, at which point it will resume military operations, even as the Biden administration has urged it to operate with far greater precision if it does so. The initial truce, which began Nov. 24 and has now been extended twice, called for the release of women and children. Hamas said it handed over the two women released earlier Thursday to the Red Cross in Gaza City, suggesting they may have been held in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have controlled much of the area for weeks and have been searching for hostages. Its not clear how many of the remaining women hostages might be soldiers. For soldiers and the civilian men still in captivity, Hamas is expected to demand the release of high-profile Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, something Israel has strongly resisted in the past. Israel says around 125 men are still held hostage, including several dozen soldiers. The Palestinians released by Israel include 22 teenagers and eight Israeli Palestinian women who were arrested since the war started, most of them for pro-Palestinian social media posts, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates for prisoners. Israeli authorities have carried out a crackdown on such posts, arresting more than 270 Palestinian citizens on allegations of inciting violence, according to rights groups. The 240 Palestinians released so far under the cease-fire have mostly been teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Several of the freed women were convicted by military courts of attempting to attack soldiers, some of them after being found carrying scissors or knives near security positions. A total of 83 Israelis, including dual nationals, have been freed during the truce, most of whom appear physically well but shaken. Another 24 hostages  23 Thais and one Filipino  have also been released, including several men. Before the cease-fire, Hamas released four hostages, and the Israeli army rescued one. Two others were found dead in Gaza. On Thursday, the military confirmed the death of Ofir Tzarfati, who was believed to be among the hostages, without providing any further details. The 27-year-old attended a music festival where at least 360 people were killed and several others were kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas and other Palestinian militants killed over 1,200 people  mostly civilians  in their wide-ranging attack across southern Israel that day and took around 240 people captive. Authorities have only provided approximate figures. Israels bombardment and invasion in Gaza have killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The toll is likely much higher, as officials have only sporadically updated the count since Nov. 11. The ministry says thousands more people are feared dead under the rubble. Israel says 77 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Palestinians in Gaza have been calling for a permanent end to the war, saying the temporary truces dont resolve the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory. Over 1.8 million people have fled their homes, with more than 1 million sheltering in U.N. schools and struggling to find basic items including cooking gas and flour.

According to Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, the move comes into effect today (Dec.01). Sri Lankan youths are, however, required to fulfil the Japanese language requirement by passing the proficiency exam in order to be eligible to secure entry to Japan under the SSW visa category. This was announced at a joint press briefing chaired by Manusha Nanayakkara, the Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment; Mizukoshi Hideaki, the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka; and A.A.M. Hilme, the chairman of Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) today. Accordingly, a new skills test in the field of construction has been newly introduced in Sri Lanka for those working in Japan as specified skilled workers. Together with the skills tests in nursing care, food service and agriculture, which have already been in place since last year, skills tests in four fields will be available in Sri Lanka. In his remarks, Ambassador Mizukoshi expressed his sincere hope that as many talented Sri Lankans as possible will take this new opportunity to work in Japan, contributing not only to the development of Japans construction sector but also to Sri Lankas foreign currency acquisition. He welcomed the rapid expansion of enthusiasm for learning Japanese, triggered by the beginning of the test for SSW in Sri Lanka last year and explained measures to support Japanese language education in Sri Lanka.

        "title": "Israel resumes combat as truce expires, accuses Hamas of violation",
        "date": "December 1, 2023 11:05 am",
        "content": "Israels military said it had resumed combat against Hamas in Gaza on Friday after accusing the Palestinian militant group of violating a seven-day temporary truce by firing towards Israeli territory. The seven-day pause, which began on Nov. 24 and was extended twice, had allowed for the exchange of dozens of hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and facilitated the entry of humanitarian aid into the shattered coastal strip. In the hour before the truce was set to end at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT), Israel said it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza. Further sirens warning of rockets sounded again in Israeli areas near Gaza just minutes before the deadline, the Israeli military said. Palestinian media reported Israeli air and artillery strikes across the enclave after the truce expired. There was no immediate comment from Hamas or claim of responsibility for the launches. Qatar and Egypt have been making intensive efforts to extend the truce following the exchange on Thursday of the latest batch of eight hostages and 30 Palestinian prisoners. Israel had previously set the release of 10 hostages a day as the minimum it would accept to pause its ground assault and bombardment. Were ready for all possibilities.... Without that, were going back to the combat, Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on CNN ahead of the expiry of the truce. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas, which rules Gaza, in response to the Oct. 7 rampage by the militant group, when Israel says gunmen killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages. Israel retaliated with intense bombardment and a ground invasion. Palestinian health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say more than 15,000 Gazans have been confirmed killed. HOSTAGES HEAD HOME Thursdays releases brought the totals freed during the truce to 105 hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners. Among those released were six women aged 21 to 40 including one Mexican-Israeli dual national and 21-year-old Mia Schem, who holds both French and Israeli citizenship. Photos released by the Israeli prime ministers office showed Schem, who was captured by Hamas along with others at an outdoor music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, embracing her mother and brother after they were reunited at Hatzerim military base in Israel. The other two newly released hostages were a brother and sister, Belal and Aisha al-Ziadna, aged 18 and 17 respectively, according to the Israeli prime ministers office. They are Bedouin Arab citizens of Israel and among four members of their family taken hostage while they were milking cows on a farm. One of Qatars lead negotiators, career diplomat Abdullah Al Sulaiti, who helped broker the truce through marathon shuttle negotiations, acknowledged in a recent Reuters interview the uncertain odds of keeping the guns silent. At the beginning I thought achieving an agreement would be the most difficult step, he said in an article that detailed the behind-the-scenes efforts for the first time. Ive discovered that sustaining the agreement itself is equally challenging. ISRAEL AGREES TO PROTECT CIVILIANS, BLINKEN SAYS The truce had allowed some humanitarian aid into Gaza after much of the coastal territory of 2.3 million people was reduced to wasteland in the Israeli assault. More fuel and 56 trucks of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza on Thursday, Israels defence ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. But deliveries of food, water, medical supplies and fuel remain far below what is needed, aid workers say. At an emergency meeting in Amman, Jordans King Abdullah on Thursday urged U.N. officials and international groups to pressure Israel to allow more aid into the beleaguered enclave, according to delegates. When the ceasefire first came into effect a week ago, Israel was preparing to turn the focus of its operation to southern Gaza after its seven-week assault to the north. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Israel during his third visit to the Middle East since the war began, said he told Netanyahu that Israel cannot repeat in south Gaza the massive civilian casualties and displacement of residents it inflicted in the north. We discussed the details of Israels ongoing planning and I underscored the imperative for the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south, Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv. And the Israeli Government agreed with that approach, he said. This would include concrete measures to avoid damaging critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water facilities and clearly designating safe zones, he said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "December 1, 2023 11:20 am",
        "content": "In a significant move towards infrastructural development, the renovation of dilapidated rural roads across the country is planned to commence next week, Minister of Transport, Highways  Mass Media said on Thursday (Nov.30). Addressing a news conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), Minister Bandula Gunawardena said this ambitious project, aimed at reviving essential transportation networks, has received substantial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which has agreed to provide a loan amounting to nearly Rs. 20 billion. He also emphasized the pivotal role the loan will play in rejuvenating the nations road infrastructure. Gunawardena highlighted that the timely disbursement of funds would enable the commencement of road reconstruction work within the next week. The minister also disclosed key developments in the countrys debt restructuring efforts. Frances Lazard, renowned for its international expertise, has been selected to spearhead the debt restructuring process, while Clifford Hans Company will handle legal matters arising from non-payment of international debts. Minister Gunawardena revealed that fruitful discussions with creditors had taken place, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking support from Japan, India, and China during official foreign visits. Celebrating a milestone for the nation, Minister Gunawardena declared that the international community has officially endorsed the debt restructuring process in Sri Lanka. He expressed confidence that this victory would breathe new life into stalled projects across the island, including the resumption of work on deteriorating roads, bridges, and flyovers. The minister acknowledged the diverse opinions surrounding railways and highways, emphasizing the need for modernizing railway tracks for efficient operation. He provided insights into the efforts to operationalize 123 out of 160 railway carriages imported under an Indian loan scheme, with plans for repairing the remaining cabins. Gunawardena underscored the necessity of relying on domestic and foreign loans for the countrys development projects, citing the insufficient economic strength to allocate to such initiatives independently. He advocated for the digitization of government revenue-generating institutions, including ports, airports, and the income tax department, as a crucial step toward economic recovery. The minister envisioned a digitally transformed Sri Lanka, likening the move to the administrative models of advanced nations like the United States and the United Kingdom. As the country anticipates the initiation of rural road renovation and embraces debt restructuring measures, Gunawardenas announcements mark a significant stride towards fostering economic growth and infrastructural development in Sri Lanka.",

He was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) this morning, a few hours after he arrived at the premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day. Fernando made his first appearance at the CID last morning (30 Nov.) and provided a statement for around 08 hours. He found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Fernando then flew out to Singapore on 14 May, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on Wednesday morning (Nov.29). He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. As per a court directive, the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",

        "content": "A recommendation has been made to suspend the parliamentary services of State Minister Diana Gamage and SJB MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera and Rohana Bandara for one month, for the unruly events that unfolded in parliament in late October. The recommendation was put forward by the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges. During the parliamentary session on October 20, Diana Gamage had accused Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Sujith Sanjaya Perera of assaulting her outside the Chamber and called for a comprehensive investigation into the matter. This had prompted the temporary adjournment of the session by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse. Defending his actions, MP Sujith Perera had said that he had witnessed Diana Gamage becoming embroiled in a heated argument with his fellow MP Rohana Bandara, and when he had attempted to intervene, the state minister had attacked him. The SJB parliamentarian said he only acted in self-defence. MP Perera also urged the Deputy Speaker to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, MP Rohana Bandara has accused the State Minister of following him and verbally abusing him near the elevator. Following the conclusion of the parliamentary session, the three parliamentarians were once again involved in a heated argument, which was captured by MP Perera on his mobile phone and later went viral on social media. Later, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena appointed a committee to look into the matter. The panel, headed by Deputy Speaker Rajapakse, comprised MP Chamal Rajapaksa, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, MP Gayantha Karunatilleka and MP Imthiaz Bakeera Markar. Later, MPs Thalatha Atukorale and Dr. Seetha Arambepola too were added to the panel. The report compiled by the said committee was handed over to the Speaker on November 14 which was forwarded to the Ethics and Privileges Committee the following day. On November 28, the Ethics and Privileges Committee convened a meeting at the parliament complex to study the report, after which it recommended that three parliamentarians be suspended from the parliament for one month.",

He assumed duties in his new role last morning (Nov.30), following his appointment the day before. Tennakoon was serving as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) in charge of the Western Province at the time of his appointment. Acting IGP Tennakoon has vowed to eradicate the drug menace and organized criminal gangs in the country. He also said he would prioritize safeguarding the national security. The appointment was made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe pursuant to the powers vested with him. Accordingly, SDIG Tennakoon will serve as the Acting IGP for three months. Meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena later told Ada Derana that President Wickremesinghe had informed the Constitutional Council of the new Acting IGP. Tennakoons appointment comes days after former Police Chief C.D. Wickramaratne decided to finally retire from the police service with effect from November 25, after receiving four service extensions as the IGP this year. He was initially supposed to enter retirement on March 26, however the Head of State had extended Wickramaratnes tenure by 3 months, by way of a gazette issued in April. Later, on July 09, he received another 3-month service extension, followed by two 3-week extensions granted on October 13 and November 03. The position of the police chief remained vacant for a few days following the retirement of Wickramaratne. Against this backdrop, the Sri Lankan Catholic Church has deplored the appointment of Tennakoon as the Acting IGP. Addressing a media briefing yesterday, the spokesperson of the Colombo Archdiocese Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini said the Catholic Church deems this appointment an insult to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks.",

        "date": "December 1, 2023 08:42 pm",
        "content": "A group of creditors holding Sri Lankas international bonds said on Friday it welcomed the countrys debt restructuring agreement with official creditors, though said a lack of transparency on deals struck so far was regrettable. Sri Lanka and a group of its creditor nations, including Japan, France and India, on Wednesday reached an agreement in principle on a debt rework of 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt. That followed a deal between the country and the Export-Import Bank of China in October on about 4.2 billion of loans. But the bondholder group, which represents creditors holding some of the countrys 12 billion of outstanding bonds, said a lack of transparency between public and private creditors was making it more difficult for them to strike a deal with Sri Lanka that is compliant with IMF rules and that provides fair and equitable debt treatment. The Group finds it regrettable that there remains such a significant lack of transparency on the part of official sector creditors despite the Groups efforts so far to act as a constructive counterparty, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders said in an emailed statement. The visibility of terms and conditions attached to deals struck between indebted countries and their official and private creditors have recently moved centre stage. Last week, objections from official creditors derailed an agreement in principle between Zambia and its bondholders to restructure the African nations international debt. The group of Zambias bilateral creditors, including France, China and India, said the terms of that proposed deal were not comparable to the relief official creditors offered. The Sri Lanka Ad Hoc Group of bondholders said it remained committed to reaching an agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities as quickly as possible to find a sustainable solution to the countrys international bond debt challenges. Unfortunately, no substantive engagement has taken place between Sri Lanka and its private creditors to date, the Group said. The Ad Hoc Group is advised by Rothschild  Co on the financial side and by White  Case LLP on legal matters.

Accordingly, Senanayake was ordered to assist the Government Analyst, when requested by the police to do so. The order was issued when a complaint filed by the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry was taken up in court today. The court also ordered for the relevant case to be heard again on 17 May, 2024. Former Sri Lankan cricketer Sachithra Senanayake was released on bail on 25 September over the charges of match-fixing, on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court after the court found that facts have not been uncovered that the accused had influenced any of the witnesses during the investigation period. However, the overseas travel ban imposed on him continues to remain in effect, on the orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court. Senanayake was arrested on 06 September, after he reportedly surrendered to the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry, over match-fixing allegations levelled against him. The 38-year-old had allegedly approached two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 via phone calls from Dubai, instigating them to fix matches during the tournament. The Lanka Premier League was held from November 27 to December 17, 2020 in Hambantota, Sri Lanka.

The former Sri Lanka off-spinner however had refuted the allegations while claiming that they were attempts to defame and slander him.

Naval and fishing communities engaged in activities in the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Pottuvil via Matara are request to exercise caution. They are also advised to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the department in this regard. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times off the coast extending from Puttalam to Galle via Mannar, Kankesanturai, Trincomalee, Pottuvil and Hambantota. Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the other sea areas around the island particularly in the evening or at night. Winds will be north-westerly or westerly and wind speed will be 30-40 kmph in the sea areas around the island. Wind speed may increase up to 60-70 kmph in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Kankesanturai, Trincomalee and Batticaloa and up to 50-60 kmph in the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Pottuvil via Hambantota. The sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Kankesanturai, Trincomalee and Batticaloa will be very rough at times. The sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Pottuvil via Hambantota can be rough at times and the other sea areas around the Island can be fairly rough at times. Temporarily strong gusty winds and very rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.",

        "title": "President at COP28 urges bold action in the face of alarming climate predictions",
        "date": "December 2, 2023 08:23 am",
        "content": "In a compelling address at the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai, UAE on Friday (Dec.01), President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged the historical significance of the UN Conference on Human Environment, emphasizing its goal to defend and improve the environment for present and future generations. He referenced the alarming findings of the UNEP Report of 2023, titled Broken Promises, which warns of a 3-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by the end of the century. Highlighting the challenges faced by developing countries, Wickremesinghe stressed the disproportionate vulnerability and impact due to lower adaptive capacities in Finance, Technology, and Climate investments. He cited the Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance, which underscored the need for at least a USD 1 trillion per annum to combat climate change. The President commended the Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for hosting the crucial event and expressed gratitude for their warm hospitality Expressing concern about the lack of concrete measures in the Transitional Committees report on funding arrangements, Wickremesinghe called for a more transparent approach, particularly addressing issues of global debt relief. He questioned the wisdom of avoiding contentious issues, emphasizing the urgency of the climate crisis. He advocated for climate justice accessible to all nations and proposed a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum. This forum, agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific, aims to provide a platform for constructive and proactive engagements, with the proposal scheduled for the UN Environment Assembly on 6th February 2024. Underlining the critical nature of the current period, the President urged immediate action to find effective solutions, thinking outside the box and investing in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis. The Tropical Belt, covering 134 countries and 44 of the Earths surface, holds rich biodiversity and potential for renewable energy. Wickremesinghe announced plans for a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative, emphasizing its global impact. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), the Sri Lankan leader linked the health of the Indian Ocean to climate change. He stressed the need for a sustainable Blue Economy to counter the adverse effects of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and extreme weather patterns. The President also revealed plans to establish the International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, operationalizing it next year. The ICCU aims to contribute significantly to global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In conclusion, Wickremesinghes address at COP28 outlined a comprehensive approach, blending regional initiatives like the Tropical Belt and the Indian Ocean with global measures, reflecting Sri Lankas commitment to climate action and leadership on the international stage.  The speech made by the President at the World Leaders Summit of the COP28 is as follows: Chairperson, Excellencies, Esteemed Delegates, At the outset let me congratulate his highness and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for hosting COP28 and extend to you my gratitude for your warm hospitality. The UNEP Report of 2023 Broken Promises warned that we are facing a 3 degree Celcius increase in global temperatures by the end of the century. It is we; the developing countries are both disproportionately vulnerable and disproportionately impacted due to their lower adaptive capacity when it comes to investments in Finance, Technology and Climate. The Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance highlighted that at least a Trillion USD per annum is required to combat climate change. The Transitional Committee on the Operationalization of Funding Arrangements in its Report of 4th November 2023 only calls for voluntary contributions to the Loss and Damage fund. The Report makes no mention of the funds needed or who the contributors are. It is silent on the issue of global debt relief. These are interconnected Nevertheless, four days later, the Technical Dialogue of the First Global Stocktake highlighted the requirements of a minimum of US trillion per annum. To arrive at a consensus not to take up a contentious issue is not a solution. Who are we fooling? Climate justice must be available to all the people and all the countries. In this background, Sri Lanka will propose a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum which was agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific to be moved at the UN Environment Assembly of 6th February 2024. The Climate Justice Forum will provide us a platform for constructive and proactive engagements. The Secretary General of the UN highlighted, The era of global boiling has arrived. The enemy is at the gates. We are still procrastinating. We are still forming our battalions to take the fight to the enemy. Therefore, this fortnight is critical. It will determine whether we are capable of providing a leadership. Let us prove we can do so by action and delivery. Sri Lanka is committed to the 1.5 degree Celcius limit. We are facing a drastic situation to await the disaster. We must think outside of the box. We must Invest in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis. The Tropical Belt constitutes 134 countries covering 44 of earths surface, and will by 2030s be home to roughly 50 of worlds population. Most of the worlds remaining primary forests are tropical, along with its coral reef systems. The rich biodiversity of the Tropical Belt enhances biological carbon sequestration and can shield the world from instabilities in weather. Furthermore, the energy generation potential from solar, wind and biomass are significantly higher in the tropics than that of other areas on the earth. Yet, anthropogenic activities in the Tropical Belt can easily lead to an imbalance in the equilibrium of this region. So much so that some scientists predict that the Tropical Rain Belt could shift away from the Equator by the 22nd Century. Large scale investments in Renewable Energy, Pollution Control and Nature-based Solutions will lead to significant transformative changes in the entire world by enhancing carbon sequestration. Therefore, Sri Lanka and other concerned countries will convene a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative. A multi sector plan distributed not only among the whole tropical region but the whole world. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. A healthy ocean generates oxygen and absorbs the carbon and heat produced from global warming. Mangroves and sea grasses sink more carbon than land forests. However, the rapid climate change is altering the marine environment with rising sea levels and temperatures, Ocean acidification, coral bleaching, habitat destruction and extreme weather patterns. These phenomenon have a direct impact on human lives by disrupting ocean biodiversity, the Ocean dependent food patterns, and coastal livelihoods. Member states and partners of IORA will work towards ensuring a sustainable, Indian Ocean for future generations. The Tropical Belt initiative and the Indian Ocean IORA program combined will form the largest global sink for carbon sequestration. Addressing the climate change need, up to date scientific knowledge, and the effective use of these findings Therefore, at COP27, I proposed to establish an International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, necessary to contribute to the crucial efforts to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We will be operationalizing the International Climate Change University (ICCU) next year.",

        "date": "December 2, 2023 11:09 am",
        "content": "The motion to suspend State Minister Diana Gamage and SJB MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera and Rohana Bandara from Parliament for a period of one month was passed in the House this morning (02 Dec.). Accordingly, the relevant motion was passed by way of a parliamentary vote this morning, with 57 MPs having voted in favour of the motion, and only one voting against. Three MPs, however, abstained from voting. On 01 December, the parliamentary services of State Minister Diana Gamage and SJB MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera and Rohana Bandara were recommended to be suspended for one month, for the unruly events that unfolded in parliament in late October. The recommendations were put forward by the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges. During the parliamentary session on October 20, Diana Gamage had accused Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Sujith Sanjaya Perera of assaulting her outside the Chamber and called for a comprehensive investigation into the matter. This had prompted the temporary adjournment of the session by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse. Defending his actions, MP Sujith Perera had said that he had witnessed Diana Gamage becoming embroiled in a heated argument with his fellow MP Rohana Bandara, and when he had attempted to intervene, the state minister had attacked him. The SJB parliamentarian said he only acted in self-defence. MP Perera also urged the Deputy Speaker to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, MP Rohana Bandara has accused the State Minister of following him and verbally abusing him near the elevator. Following the conclusion of the parliamentary session, the three parliamentarians were once again involved in a heated argument, which was captured by MP Perera on his mobile phone and later went viral on social media. Later, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena appointed a committee to look into the matter. The panel, headed by Deputy Speaker Rajapakse, comprised MP Chamal Rajapaksa, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, MP Gayantha Karunatilleka and MP Imthiaz Bakeera Markar. Later, MPs Thalatha Atukorale and Dr. Seetha Arambepola too were added to the panel. The report compiled by the said committee was handed over to the Speaker on November 14 which was forwarded to the Ethics and Privileges Committee the following day. On November 28, the Ethics and Privileges Committee convened a meeting at the parliament complex to study the report, after which it recommended that three parliamentarians be suspended from the parliament for one month.",

        "content": "The Department of Meteorology has issued a Red alert for gusty winds and rough seas today (Dec.02) as the depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal has intensified into a deep depression. It was located near latitude 10.5N and longitude 84.1E, at 5:30 a.m. this morning and about 380km northeast of Trincomalee. The department said this deep depression will likely develop into a cyclonic storm by tomorrow (Dec.03). The system is expected to move west and northwestward near the North coast of Sri Lanka towards the North Tamil Nadu coast of India by Monday (Dec.04). Thereafter, it would move northwards as a Cyclonic storm and cross South Andhra Pradesh coasts on Tuesday. As such, the Naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Kankesanturai, Trincomalee and Batticaloa and into the marked areas over the next 48 hours. Those who are already out in aforementioned sea areas are meanwhile advised to return to coasts or move to safer areas immediately.

        "title": "Inmate who stabbed ex-US policeman Derek Chauvin 22 times charged with attempted murder",
        "date": "December 2, 2023 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Derek Chauvin was stabbed in prison 22 times by a former gang leader and one-time FBI informant who told investigators he targeted the ex-Minneapolis police officer because of his notoriety for killing George Floyd, federal prosecutors said Friday. John Turscak was charged with attempted murder a week after the Nov. 24 attack at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, Arizona. He told correctional officers he would have killed Chauvin had they not responded so quickly, prosecutors said. Turscak, who is serving a 30-year sentence for crimes committed while a member of the Mexican Mafia prison gang, told investigators he thought about attacking Chauvin for a month because he is a high-profile inmate but denied wanting to kill him, prosecutors said. Turscak is accused of attacking Chauvin with an improvised knife in the prison law library around 12:30 p.m. on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Correctional officers used pepper spray to subdue Turscak, prosecutors said. The Bureau of Prisons said employees performed life-saving measures. Chauvin was taken to a hospital for treatment. Turscak told FBI agents interviewing him after the assault that he attacked Chauvin on Black Friday as a symbolic connection to the Black Lives Matter movement, which garnered widespread support in the wake of Floyds murder in 2020, and the Black Hand symbol associated with the Mexican Mafia, prosecutors said. In addition to attempted murder, Turscak, 52, is charged with assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury. The attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder charges are each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Turscak is scheduled to complete his current sentence in 2026. A lawyer for Turscak was not listed in court records. Turscak has represented himself from prison in numerous court matters. After the stabbing, he was moved to an adjacent federal penitentiary in Tucson, where he remained in custody Friday, inmate records show. Messages seeking comment were left with Chauvins lawyers. His mother, Carolyn Runge Pawlenty, did not immediately respond to a Facebook message. In a post earlier Friday, Pawlenty said prison officials had told her that Chauvin was in stable condition but were otherwise not forthcoming with details about the assault or his injuries. The Bureau of Prisons said it gave updates to everyone Chauvin asked be notified. Chauvin, 47, was sent to FCI Tucson from a maximum-security Minnesota state prison in August 2022 to simultaneously serve a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyds civil rights and a 22½-year state sentence for second-degree murder. Chauvins lawyer at the time, Eric Nelson, had advocated for keeping him out of general population and away from other inmates, anticipating he would be a target. In Minnesota, Chauvin was mainly kept in solitary confinement largely for his own protection, Nelson wrote in court papers last year. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Chauvins appeal of his murder conviction. Separately, Chauvin is making a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea, claiming new evidence shows he didnt cause Floyds death. Floyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9½ minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit 20 bill. Bystander video captured Floyds fading cries of I cant breathe. His death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. Three other former officers who were at the scene received lesser state and federal sentences for their roles in Floyds death. Chauvins stabbing comes as the federal Bureau of Prisons has faced increased scrutiny in recent years following the beating death of James Whitey Bulger in 2018 and wealthy financier Jeffrey Epsteins jail suicide in 2019. The attack on Chauvin was the third incident involving a high-profile federal prison inmate in the last six months. Disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar was stabbed in July at a federal penitentiary in Florida and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski killed himself at a federal medical center in June. An ongoing Associated Press investigation has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Departments largest law enforcement agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an annual budget of about 8 billion. AP reporting has revealed rampant sexual abuse and other criminal conduct by staff, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides. Turscak led a faction of the Mexican Mafia in the Los Angeles area in the late 1990s and went by the nickname Stranger, according to court records. He became an FBI informant in 1997, providing information about the gang and recordings of conversations he had with its members and associates. The Mexican Mafia, a prevalent U.S. prison gang, was involved in a fatal 2022 altercation at a federal penitentiary in Texas. The investigation Turscak was aiding led to more than 40 indictments. But about midway through, the FBI dropped Turscak as an informant because he was still dealing drugs, extorting money and authorizing assaults. According to court papers, Turscak plotted attacks on rival gang members and was accused of attempting to kill a leader of a rival Mexican Mafia faction while also being targeted himself. Turscak pleaded guilty in 2001 to racketeering and conspiring to kill a gang rival. He said he thought his cooperation with the FBI would have earned a lighter sentence. I didnt commit those crimes for kicks, Turscak said, according to news reports about his sentencing. I did them because I had to if I wanted to stay alive. I told that to the FBI agents and they just said, Do what you have to do. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the maximum number of servicemen in the Russian armed forces by 170,000 people, the Kremlin and the Defence Ministry said on Friday. According to the document, the regular strength of the armed forces is now set at 1,320,000 servicemen. The increase in the full-time strength of the armed forces is due to the growing threats to our country associated with the special military operation and the ongoing expansion of NATO, the Russian defence ministry said. The ministry also said that the increase in the number of servicemen is due to the recruitment of contract personnel, and the military has no plans to significantly increase conscription or carry out a new wave of mobilisation. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russias Security Council, said on Friday that more than 452,000 people were recruited to the Russian military under contract from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1 2023.

Wickremesinghe was joined by prominent figures such as Mohammed Nasheed, the former President of Maldives; Dr. Aceng Jane Ruth, the Minister of Health of Uganda; and Inger Anderson, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Addressing the launch, the President conveyed that the resolution of the Climate Justice Forum will be formally presented at the United Nations. He described the CJF as an initial step to secure unwavering commitment from all parties involved in the collective effort. President Wickremesinghe underscored that the scope of contribution extends beyond the capabilities of countries alone, emphasizing the significant role private entities can play The President also drew attention to the allocation of funds, noting that more financial resources are directed towards the war in Ukraine and the bombing of Gaza compared to what has been allocated for the Loss and Damages fund. He extended invitations to other concerned nations to join this initiative, presenting it as a viable solution to the increased threat of climate change. Additionally, the President has formally requested the collaboration and cooperation of esteemed organizations such as UNEP, UNDP and the EU to engage with interested countries in advancing the pioneering initiatives presented by Sri Lanka. UNEP Executive Director, Inger Anderson, in her address at the launch, emphasized the growing disparity between the necessary actions and the current efforts in the battle against climate change. She welcomed the Climate Justice Forum, asserting that it will serve as a potent force in unifying nations for this collective endeavour. Minister of Environment, Dr. Keheliya Rambukwella, addressing the gathering, advocated for cooperation and solidarity in tackling global challenges. He asserted that initiatives such as the Climate Justice Forum, orchestrated today, will significantly influence the future trajectory of the planet. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, PC, remarked at the event that despite on-going discussions, viable solutions to the climate crisis are not currently emerging. Consequently, the lawmaker stated that the Climate Justice Forum initiative will be integrated into Sri Lankas foreign policy, aiming to exert influence on the global stage for a sustainable future. Minister of Health of Uganda, Dr. Aceng Jane Ruth, welcomed the initiative, describing it as a potential trend-setter that will help lead the fight against climate change. The 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) kicked off in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Thursday (Nov.30), bringing the world leaders together at a critical moment for global transformative climate action. At COP28, President Wickremesinghe is envisioning 3 key focal points at the event: the launch of the Climate Justice Forum, the Tropical Belt Initiative and the establishment of a Climate Change University. The concept behind the Climate Justice Forum aims to address the pressing issue of climate change and exert influence, particularly on the Global North.",

        "date": "December 2, 2023 06:33 pm",
        "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to take up for consideration the first review of the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement for Sri Lanka on December 12. This was mentioned in the global lenders Executive Boards calendar, which mentioned that the first review of Sri Lankas extended arrangement under the EFF, request for waiver of nonobservance of performance criterion, request for modification of performance criteria, financing assurances review, and rephasing of access are scheduled to go for consideration that day. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows. But since locking down the IMF bailout of USD 2.9 billion in March, the South Asian island nation has managed to partly stabilise its economy, bring down runaway inflation and rebuild currency reserves. An IMF mission visited the island nation from September 14-27 for the first review of the EFF-supported economic adjustment program. In October, IMF and Sri Lanka reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of the EFF-supported program, which is expected to unlock the second tranche  which amounts to about USD 330 million in financing  once the review is approved by the IMF Management and Executive Board. This will bring the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement about USD 660 million. Sri Lanka has now reached in-principle deals with the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China, its largest bilateral creditor, and the Official Creditor Committee to restructure its debts. On November 29, the Sri Lankan government and the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) revealed that they have reached an agreement in principle on the financial terms of debt treatment. The in-principle deal covers approximately USD 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and consists of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. Following the launch of a common platform in April 2023 for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, the OCC  co-chaired by India, Japan and France (as the chair of the Paris Club)  was formally formed on May 09 with 17 countries to respond to the Sri Lankan authorities request for a debt treatment. Since its formation, the OCC has engaged extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF, the World Bank as well as China, and Sri Lankas private creditors. The deal between OCC and Sri Lanka came about a month after the island nations agreement with the Chinas Exim Bank covering about USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. The IMF earlier said Sri Lankas in-principle pact with creditor nations and Chinas Exim Bank to restructure its debt prepares the way for the global lender to consider clearing the first review of the bailout.",

The quake struck at 10:37 p.m. and was measured at a depth of 32 kilometers (20 miles). There are no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said based on the magnitude and location it expected tsunami waves to hit the southern Philippines and parts of Indonesia, Palau and Malaysia. The USGS gave a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 while the Philippine agency in charge of earthquakes said it measured 6.9. Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology Seismology told The Associated Press his agency advised residents along the coast of southern Surigao del Sur and Davao Oriental provinces to evacuate immediately to higher grounds. Based on the quakes magnitude, he said a 1-meter (3.2-foot) tsunami may hit but the wave could be higher in coves and bays. The Philippines experiences regular earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the ocean. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "December 2, 2023 10:22 pm",
        "content": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), in collaboration with the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), launched the Electricity Dispatch Database and Dashboard, an online platform to enhance transparency in the management of Sri Lankas power distribution through a visualization platform. Developed and funded by USAIDs Sri Lanka Energy Program, the Dispatch Data Dashboard is a comprehensive tool that allows stakeholders to access and visualize data relevant to electricity generation, forecasts, costs, reservoir details, and emissions, providing insights into the energy sectors intricate operational dynamics. The initiative will help foster transparency and accountability within Sri Lankas energy, the US Embassy in Colombo said in a statement. The Dispatch Data Dashboard features a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a broad audience. Users will be able to query dispatch data, gaining valuable insights into the dispatch process and the rationale behind cost optimization. This transparency not only promotes accountability but also encourages collaboration among industry players, paving the way for improvements in the dispatch process. The Dispatch Data Dashboard will be used for a wide array of stakeholders, including sector analysts, researchers, current independent power producers, future renewable energy developers, and environmental organizations. The online dashboard is available at https:gendata.pucsl.gov.lkhome. The USAID Sri Lanka Energy Program is proud to be at the forefront of this initiative, driving positive change for the benefit of all stakeholders. Members of the public will now have the ability to comprehend the dispatch process, enabling them to raise inquiries and contribute to discussions about the energy sectors future. This marks a significant step forward in democratizing information and fostering a sense of ownership among the public. Chris Powers, Director of the Economic Growth Office of USAID stated that, This Dashboard will help drive financial sustainability of the power sector, while contributing to the viability of the nation by enhancing energy security and ensuring the lowest possible cost of electricity. By fostering transparency and empowering stakeholders, this tool is an instrumental resource in our collective fight against climate change. In understanding and optimizing our energy management processes, we pave the way for a more sustainable future, driving efficiencies that contribute to reducing the cost of power generation while reducing our carbon footprint. In the face of climate challenges, knowledge is power, and the Dashboard empowers us all to make informed decisions that positively impact our environment. The Dispatch Data Dashboard represents a major leap towards a more transparent and accountable energy sector in Sri Lanka, said Professor Manjula Fernando, Chairman of PUCSL. By providing a platform for stakeholders to engage with dispatch data, we aim to drive positive change, encourage innovation, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and cost-effective energy future for Sri Lanka. The Dispatch Data Dashboard is anticipated to play a crucial role in driving down generation costs for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). By facilitating a better understanding of the dispatch process and encouraging stakeholder collaboration, the initiative holds the potential to bring about operational efficiencies that will benefit both the industry and end consumers backed by the National Energy Benchmarking Portal  which was recently launched by the USAID Sri Lanka Energy Program and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority to address the demandconsumption side of the energy.",

        "content": "Officials of the Excise Department told the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Economic and Physical Plans that its monthly revenue has increased by Rs. 1 billion after raids to crack down on fake stickers on liquor bottles. This was mentioned when the SOC on National Economic and Physical Plans met in Parliament last week under the chairmanship of MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage. The Excise Department, Inland Revenue Department and Sri Lanka Customs were summoned before the SOC to discuss the matters mentioned in the report handed over to the President by the parliamentary committee. Accordingly, the SOC inquired into the amendment of the Excise Ordinance Act. It also pointed out the need to maintain the revenue that the Excise Department has managed to boost so far, adding that continuing random raids would further reduce the affixing of fake stickers on liquor bottles. Meanwhile, the Inland Revenue Department was asked about the current functioning of the RAMIS system. Thus, the SOC examined the current status of linking this data system with other government institutions. The officials presented at the committee meeting assured that this data system would be made functional by January 2024 by avoiding the existing deficiencies. The IRD officials further said that the number of tax files is currently around 700,000 and it is expected to increase up to 1 million in the future. Apart from this, the committee also advised the officials to focus on preparing a system for evaluating the parties who pay income tax correctly. The SOC pointed out that by amending the laws related to customs, the customs can reach a tax amount that exceeds the expected tax revenue. Further, it was discussed at length about the measures to be taken by the customs to collect the tax due.",

Officials pointed out that even if the rest is collected, it is being disposed of informally in the environment, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement, This was discussed when the Committee met at Parliament recently, under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Ajith Mannapperuma, it added. It was also revealed that industrialists have been allowed to import secondary plastic without any regulation. Therefore, the Sectoral Oversight Committee instructed the Central Environment Authority that licenses should be issued according to the needs of the industry in the future. The officials revealed that Sri Lanka annually imports 400,000 metric tons of plastic raw materials and 20,000 metric tons of waste plastic is also allowed to be imported. Although 20,000 metric tons of waste plastic was approved to be imported last year, it was revealed that only 5,179 metric tons of waste plastic was imported for the Sri Lankan industries. Therefore, the chairman of the committee advised the authorities to consider the need of the industry and give permission accordingly and to create a system for collecting the plastic brought in within a specific period of 5 years, the statement mentioned. Officials told the committee that many people are not interested in collecting plastic for recycling due to the high cost. However, the chairman mentioned that this amount can be increased by increasing the incentives given for plastic collection. Moreover, he also emphasized the need to establish special centers in all parts of the island for plastic collection. At the same time, the need to finalize the proposed environmental bill and implement it was also discussed at length by the committee.

Frances Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said an attacker had targeted tourists around the Quai de Grenelle, which is close to the Eiffel Tower. He added that a 26-year-old French national known to security services had been arrested. The suspect approached a tourist couple and fatally stabbed a German national, he said. The man was then pursued by police and attacked two other people with a hammer before being stopped with a Taser and arrested. The injured were treated by emergency services. Mr Darmanin said the alleged attacker had shouted Allahu Akbar, Arabic for God is greatest, and later told police he was upset because so many Muslims are dying in Afghanistan and in Palestine. He said the suspect was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 for planning a separate attack and was on the French security services watchlist. The man was also known to have suffered psychiatric disorders, Mr Darmanin said. A police operation was initiated around the Bir-Hakeim metro station on Saturday night, and authorities urged people to avoid the area. The anti-terrorism prosecutors office said it had taken charge of the investigation. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron sent his thoughts to all those affected by the terrorist attack and thanked the emergency services for their response.
