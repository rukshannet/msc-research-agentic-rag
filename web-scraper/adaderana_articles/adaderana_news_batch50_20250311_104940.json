        "date": "November 5, 2024 10:59 am",
        "content": "The worlds first wooden satellite, built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space on Tuesday, in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration. LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth. Named after the Latin word for wood, the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space. With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever, said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Dois team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material. Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood, said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. A wooden satellite should be feasible, too. Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because theres no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimises the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminium oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. Metal satellites might be banned in the future, Doi said. If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musks SpaceX. Industrial Application The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge woods ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data centre construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars, he said. Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.

        "content": "The prime ministers of India and Canada condemned violence that broke out on Sunday at a Hindu temple near Toronto at a time of escalating diplomatic tensions between the countries. Videos posted on social media appeared to show people hitting each other with flagpoles and throwing punches in the Toronto suburb of Brampton. It was unclear who instigated the violence and Reuters could not independently verify what happened. The incident happened weeks after Ottawa expelled six Indian diplomats, linking them to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in 2023 in Canada. Canada has accused the Indian government of conducting a broad campaign against South Asian dissidents in Canada, which New Delhi denies. Police said there were demonstrations at multiple locations in the region. Sikh activists said one demonstration was at a Hindu temple where pro-Khalistan activists protested the presence of Indian diplomats and another was at a Sikh temple. Khalistan refers to a Sikh homeland activists want carved out of Indias Punjab state. The local Peel Police said three men faced criminal charges over Sundays protest. A 43-year-old man is charged with causing a disturbance and assaulting a peace officer, a 23-year-old man is charged with assault with a weapon and a 31-year-old man is charged with mischief. Police said they are aware of video of an off-duty police officer participating in a demonstration. The officer has been suspended, they said. Police are investigating. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a strongly worded statement on X on Monday. I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats, Modi said. Such acts of violence will never weaken Indias resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law, he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday the acts of violence were unacceptable. India has accused Trudeau of pursuing a political agenda in their dispute and responded to Ottawas expulsion of its diplomats by expelling six Canadian diplomats. The North America-based activist group Sikhs for Justice said on Sunday that pro-Khalistan Sikhs who were peacefully demonstrating ... were violently attacked by a group of Indo Canadians. Indian media reported that an Indian consular camp at the venue was targeted in the violence. The foreign ministry in New Delhi said the violence was perpetrated by extremists and separatists. The ministry said it remained deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The Colombo High Court had earlier ordered to acquit and release Hemasiri Fernando and Pujith Jayasundara without calling for defense testimonies, following the hearing of a case filed by the Attorney General. The AG had later filed this appeal with the Supreme Court challenging the Colombo HCs decision, seeking to invalidate the relevant verdict and for it to be declared unlawful. Following the hearing of the appeal, the Supreme Court judge bench declared that the High Court should have called for defense during the hearings of the case.",

        "content": "As the world turns its attention to the US election on Nov. 5, presidential history aficionados may be particularly interested in an auction later in the month that has objects on sale ranging from a lock of George Washingtons hair to a flag that accompanied Abraham Lincoln to his final resting place. Were conducting an auction of a number of the most historic objects relating to American history that has ever come up for sale, said Arlan Ettinger, president of New York-based Guernseys auction house. One of the most intriguing items is the strands of hair of Washington, the very first US president, who died in 1799. The graying hair has been preserved in a locket that was given to a family friend and passed down the generations. There is also a US flag that was draped on Lincolns coffin as it traveled in 1865 from Washington, DC to Springfield, Illinois, where he is buried. It has a sale estimate range of 800,000 to 1.2 million, although putting a value on such a unique item was difficult, said Ettinger. A rare 49-star flag dating from the period in 1959 after Alaska joined the union but before Hawaii was added will also be among the items auctioned. That flag was in the White House during the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. The auction also will include presidential portraits from the Bachrach photography studio, many never before seen in public, and a portrait of Lincoln made by Francis Bicknell Carpenter as a study for his painting, First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln, which hangs today in the US Capitol building. The Nov. 22 sale will be conducted online and previewed at the Arader Galleries in New York City. We dont know whats going to happen at the election, but one way or another, theres great focus on the Office of Presidency right now and American history, Ettinger said. Source: CNN -Agencies",

Furthermore, the former President raised concerns over the reduction in her security detail, claiming that the move poses a direct threat to her safety, referencing past political conspiracies. In a letter addressed to Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security Ravi Seneviratne, Kumaratunga highlighted the reduction of her security personnel from 50 to 30, following an order issued on October 31 by Senior DIG Ajith Hemasiri. Kumaratunga noted in the letter that other former presidents currently receive significantly higher levels of protection. She has highlighted that Mahinda Rajapaksa is provided with 243 security personnel, including both military and police officers, while Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa have 109 and 200 security officers, respectively. She questioned the rationale behind the substantial reduction in her security team, particularly given her unique status as the only former president to have been injured in an assassination attempt. Expressing concern over her safety, Kumaratunga referenced prior intelligence reports indicating that the LTTE had issued threats against her life, even following her retirement. She underscored that, as the most threatened among former presidents, a larger security presence is essential. Kumaratungas letter also highlighted that the current government leaders, who previously stated they would refrain from elite protection upon taking office, are now safeguarded by hundreds of personnel. She questioned whether the administration has come to recognize that prominent figures in the country require significant protection.",

        "date": "November 5, 2024 02:32 pm",
        "content": "Residents in U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris ancestral village in southern India were preparing to hold prayers on election day on Tuesday in a Hindu temple more than 8,000 miles (13,000 km) from Washington. Harris maternal grandfather P.V. Gopalan was born more than a century ago in the leafy village of Thulasendrapuram in what is now southern Indias Tamil Nadu state. There will be a special prayer on Tuesday morning at the temple, G. Manikandan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said. Celebrations will follow if she wins. At the temple, Harris name is engraved into a stone that lists public donations, along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes the daughter of the land success in the election. Gopalan and his family migrated a few hundred miles to the coastal city of Chennai, Tamil Nadus capital, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement. The village received global attention four years ago, when its residents prayed for victory for Harris Democratic Party in 2020 before celebrating her inauguration as U.S. Vice President by setting off firecrackers and distributing food. Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump were scrambling to get supporters to the polls in an historically close contest, which means it could take days for the winner to emerge.

        "date": "November 5, 2024 04:55 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas privacy watchdog on Tuesday fined social media company Meta 21.6 billion won (15 million) for illegally collecting sensitive personal information from Facebook users, including data about their political views and sexual orientation, and sharing it with thousands of advertisers. It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information. Following a four-year investigation, South Koreas Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022. It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers. South Koreas privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved. The commission said Meta amassed sensitive information by analyzing the pages the Facebook users liked or the advertisements they clicked on. The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta. While Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent, Lee said. Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said. In September, European regulators hit Meta with over 100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form. Metas South Korean office said it would carefully review the commissions decision, but didnt immediately provide more comment. In 2022, the commission fined Google and Meta a combined 100 billion won (72 million) for tracking consumers online behavior without their consent and using their data for targeted advertisements, in the biggest penalties ever imposed in South Korea for privacy law violations. The commission said then that the two companies didnt clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an easy and clear consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online. The commission also hit Meta with a 6.7 billion won (4.8 million) fine in 2020 for providing personal information about itsx users to third parties without consent. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 5, 2024 06:03 pm",
        "content": "The dizzying presidential contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish on Tuesday as millions of Americans headed to the polls to choose between two sharply different visions for the country. A race whipsawed by unprecedented events - two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Bidens surprise withdrawal and Harris rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning. Trumps campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected. No matter who wins the White House, history will be made. Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. Opinion polls in the campaigns final days have shown the candidates running neck and neck in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. ReutersIpsos polling shows a significant gender gap, with Harris leading among women by 12 percentage points and Trump winning among men by 7 percentage points. The contest reflects a deeply polarized nation whose divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump has employed increasingly dark and apocalyptic rhetoric on the campaign trail, while Harris has warned that a second Trump term would threaten the very underpinnings of American democracy. Control of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs. Republicans have an easier path in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats are defending several seats in Republican-leaning states, while the House of Representatives looks like a toss-up. The candidates spent the final weekend barnstorming the swing states in search of every available vote. Trump staged his final rally on Monday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while Harris held twin rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. More than 80 million Americans had already voted before Tuesday, either via mail or in person, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. During the campaign, Trump hammered first Biden and then Harris for their handling of the economy, which polls show is at the top of voters concerns despite low unemployment and cooling inflation. But he showed a characteristic inability to stay on message, at one point questioning Harris Black identity and vowing to protect women whether they like it or not. His unbridled approach seemed designed to fire up his supporters, rather than expand his appeal. Even more than in 2016 and 2020, Trump has demonized immigrants who crossed the border illegally, falsely accusing them of fomenting a violent crime wave, and he has vowed to use the government to prosecute his political rivals. Polls show he has made some gains among Black and Latino voters, despite the historic nature of Harris candidacy. Trump has often warned that migrants are taking jobs away from those constituencies. By contrast, Harris has tried to piece together a broader but challenging coalition of liberal Democrats, independents and disaffected moderate Republicans, describing Trump as too dangerous to elect. She campaigned on protecting reproductive rights, an issue that has galvanized women since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a nationwide right to abortion. Harris has faced anger from many pro-Palestinian voters over the Biden administrations military and financial support for Israels war in Gaza. While she has not previewed a shift in U.S. policy, she has said she will do everything possible to end the conflict. After Biden, 81, withdrew amid concerns about his age, Harris sought to turn the tables on Trump, pointing to his rambling rallies as evidence he is unfit. Her campaigns embrace of viral memes and a parade of celebrity endorsements gained her traction with young voters seen as a critical voting bloc. Trump countered the likes of Harris supporters Taylor Swift and Beyonce with Elon Musk, the worlds richest man, who played an increasingly visible role as a surrogate and a top donor to Trumps cause. Tuesdays vote follows one of the most turbulent half-years in modern American politics. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Four weeks later, Trump and Biden met for their only debate, where the incumbent president delivered a disastrous performance that supercharged voters existing concerns about his mental acuity. In July, Trump narrowly escaped a would-be assassins bullet at a Pennsylvania rally, just before the Republican National Convention. Barely a week later, Biden exited the race, bowing to pressure from Democratic leaders. Harris entry into the race re-energized her party, and she raised more than 1 billion in less than three months while erasing Trumps lead over Biden in public polls. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

He also emphasized that the political leadership will not interfere in the public service protecting their capacity to operate independently.

        "title": "Trump, Harris notch first statewide wins as polls close in US presidential race",
        "date": "November 6, 2024 08:29 am",
        "content": "Republican Donald Trump won 15 states in Tuesdays U.S. presidential election while Democrat Kamala Harris captured seven states and Washington, D.C., Edison Research projected, but the contest remained undecided with critical battleground states unlikely to be called for hours or even days. The early results were as anticipated, with the contest expected to come down to seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Opinion polls showed the rivals neck and neck in all seven going into Election Day. As of 9:30 p.m. ET (0230 GMT on Wednesday), polls had closed in 41 states and Washington, D.C. Trump had 162 electoral votes to Harris 81 electoral votes, but both still had multiple paths to victory. A candidate needs a total of 270 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College to claim the presidency. Decision Desk HQ projected Trump would win North Carolina, but other media outlets and Edison had yet to call the race. In Georgia, Trump had opened up a 52.3 to 47.1 lead with 77 percent of the estimated vote tallied, according to Edison. Control of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs. Democrats had only a narrow path to defend their Senate majority after Republican Jim Justice flipped a West Virginia seat on Tuesday. The House of Representatives looked like a toss-up. In Florida, a ballot measure that would have guaranteed abortion rights failed to reach the 60 threshold needed to pass, according to Edison, leaving a six-week ban in place. Nine other states have abortion-related measures on the ballot. Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to national exit polls from Edison, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy. Hours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was a lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit. I dont respond to nonsense, Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters. A Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure. Trump, whose supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after he claimed the 2020 election was rigged, voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida. If I lose an election, if its a fair election, Im gonna be the first one to acknowledge it, Trump told reporters. His campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, as he did four years ago. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in battleground states are as slim as expected. Millions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains. Trump was watching the results at his Mar-a-Lago club before speaking to supporters at a nearby convention center, according to sources familiar with the planning. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, said he would watch the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump. Trump attended a morning meeting about turnout but appeared bored by the data talk, according to one source briefed on the meeting. All Trump wanted to know, the source said, was: Am I going to win? Harris, who had previously mailed her ballot to her home state of California, spent some of Tuesday in radio interviews encouraging listeners to vote. Later, she was due to address students at Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington where Harris was an undergraduate. To go back tonight to Howard University, my beloved alma mater, and be able to hopefully recognize this day for what it is, is really full circle for me, Harris said in a radio interview. ABORTION, ECONOMY AND IMMIGRATION Tuesdays vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Bidens surprise withdrawal and Harris rapid rise. No matter who wins, history will be made. Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. In Dearborn, Michigan, Nakita Hogue, 50, was joined by her 18-year-old college student daughter, Niemah Hogue, to vote for Harris. The daughter said she takes birth control to help regulate her period, while her mother recalled needing surgery after she had a miscarriage in her 20s, and both feared Republican lawmakers would seek to restrict reproductive healthcare. For my daughter, who is going out into the world and making her own way, I want her to have that choice, Nakita Hogue said. She should be able to make her own decisions. At a library in Phoenix, Arizona, Felicia Navajo, 34, and her husband Jesse Miranda, 52, arrived with one of their three young kids to vote for Trump. Miranda, a union plumber, immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico when he was four years old, and said he believed Trump would do a better job of fighting inflation and controlling immigration. I want to see good people come to this town, people that are willing to work, people who are willing to just live the American dream, Miranda said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Director General of the department Dr. Hemali Kothalawala stated that permission has now been granted for the transportation of healthy animals. Based on the current situation in the field, there has been a slight decrease in the spread of the disease this week, and its essential to protect the industry, Dr. Kothalawala explained. We have relaxed certain restrictions and issued a new Gazette, which will be effective from November 4 until further notice. Previously, animal transportation was prohibited, but under the new Gazette, non-infected animals may now be transported, provided they have an animal health report from a veterinarian. These animals can be slaughtered in slaughterhouses registered with the provincial office of the Department of Animal Production and Health. An authorized officer will certify and grant this registration, she further said. The new Gazette also mandates that slaughterhouses and meat refrigeration facilities must be registered. Meat processing and the sale of prepared meat from non-infected animals are now permitted, allowing restaurants to sell meat from animals confirmed to be free of the disease. Meanwhile, the Western Province Department of Animal Production and Health reported that around 50 percent of the pigs in the Western Province have died due to African swine fever. Its Director, K.K. Sarath, noted that Gampaha District recorded the highest number of pig deaths.",

        "date": "November 6, 2024 09:21 am",
        "content": "Migrants stranded for years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia will be offered the right to come to the UK, under a government proposal. Around 60 Sri Lankan Tamils have spent more than three years in a makeshift camp on the island, which hosts a secretive UK-US military base, after becoming the first people ever to file asylum claims there. The government has previously opposed bringing the group to the UK and complex legal battles have been fought for years over their fate. In a letter on Monday, government lawyers said that following further consideration, the government had proposed a change of policy. Under this, all families, children and those of the unaccompanied males who do not have criminal convictions, outstanding charges or investigations would be offered the opportunity to be transferred directly to the UK. It added that work on the offer was ongoing and a formal decision would be made within 48 hours. Details will be provided as soon as possible, it said. In a phone call with one of the Tamils, an official said the decision to bring them to the UK was due to the exceptional circumstances of the island, adding that entry would be for a short period of time. The Prime Ministers Official Spokesperson told reporters at a daily news briefing in Downing Street that the government inherited a deeply-troubling situation that remained unresolved under the previous administration when it came to migrants who had arrived at Diego Garcia. Diego Garcia had clearly never been a suitable long-term location for migrants. He added the government has been working to find a solution that protects their welfare and the integrity of British territorial borders. Lawyers representing the Tamils described the move as a very welcome step in a long battle for justice. After three years living in inhumane conditions, having to fight various injustices in court on numerous occasions, His Majestys Government HMG has now decided that our clients should now come directly to the UK. We hope that HMG will now take urgent steps to give effect to this decision, Simon Robinson of UK law firm Duncan Lewis told the BBC. Todays decision is an enormous relief to our clients and we urge the home secretary to close the camp and bring our clients here without any further delay, said Leigh Day lawyer Tom Short. It looks like a dream. I dont know what to think, one Tamil said after receiving a call from an official with the news. The UK had previously offered some of the group a temporary move to Romania with the possibility of then coming to the UK. Others were offered financial incentives to return to Sri Lanka. The latest development comes after the UK announced last month that it was handing sovereignty of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), which includes Diego Garcia, to Mauritius. The military base, however, will remain on the island. Under a separate deal last month, future migrants arriving on Biot before the arrangement with Mauritius comes into force will be transferred to the island of St Helena - another UK territory some 5,000 miles away. In court on Monday, lawyers said three people with criminal convictions may be sent to the island of Montserrat - a British territory in the Caribbean - to serve their sentences. The BBC was recently granted unprecedented access to Diego Garcia to attend a court hearing, which is set to determine whether the Tamils had been unlawfully detained. During the visit, the migrants walked the court through military tents they have been living in, pointing out damp, tears in the canvas, droppings, and a rats nest above one of the beds. Over the past three years, there have been multiple hunger strikes on the island, and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts after which some people have been transferred to Rwanda for medical care. For three years I have been caged. Now they are releasing me but I dont know what to do. I feel a bit blank, one man in Rwanda said. I am very happy because I am coming to the UK. I thought they would send me to some other country. The group includes 16 children. Most are awaiting final decisions on claims for international protection - which the United Nations says is akin to refugee status - or appealing against rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Republicans win control of US Senate, make gains in House",
        "date": "November 6, 2024 12:52 pm",
        "content": "Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate with victories in West Virginia and Ohio on Tuesday, ensuring Donald Trumps party will control at least one chamber of Congress next year. Republicans also posted early gains as they battled to retain control of the House of Representatives. But Tuesdays results ensured Republicans would be able to help Trump appoint conservative judges and other government personnel if he wins the presidential race, or block much of Democrat Kamala Harriss agenda if she prevails. Republican Jim Justice was projected to win an open Senate seat in West Virginia shortly after polls closed, taking over the seat previously held by Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno was projected to defeat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Those two victories ensured Republicans will hold at least a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with further gains possible as results in other competitive races come in. Republicans also won several races that could allow them to expand their 220-212 majority in the House, though the final outcome may not be known for days. They won a Democratic-held district in Pennsylvania that includes Scranton, Democratic President Joe Bidens hometown, and picked up seats from Democrats in North Carolina, where they had redrawn district lines to their advantage. Democrats won a Republican-held seat in upstate New York and a seat in Alabama that had been redrawn to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court order to create a Black majority district. Democrats now need to flip at least six seats to take control of the 435-seat chamber. In Delaware, voters made history by electing Democrat Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress. As in the presidential election, the outcome will likely be determined by a small slice of voters. Fewer than 40 House races are seen as truly competitive. Republicans stand a chance to widen their Senate majority further if they win in Montana, where Democrat Jon Tester faces a tough reelection battle, and prevail in several competitive Midwestern states. But they are unlikely to end up with the 60-vote majority needed to advance most legislation in the chamber. In Texas, incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz was projected to win reelection, holding off Democrat Colin Allred. In Nebraska, Republican Senator Deb Fischer was holding off a surprisingly strong challenge from an independent candidate, Dan Osborn, who has not said whether he would line up with Democrats in the Senate if he were to win. The Senate was set to see two Black women serving simultaneously for the first time, as Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester won in Delaware, and several media outlets projected Democrat Angela Alsobrooks would win in Maryland. House up for grabs The outcome was still up in the air in the House. Analysts say Democrats could easily pick up enough seats to win control of the chamber, though there are no signs of a wave election, akin to 2018 or 2010, that would result in a decisive shift in power. With at least 200 seats safe for each party, the winning side will likely end up with a narrow majority that could make governing difficult. That has been evident in the past two years as Republican infighting has led to failed votes and leadership turmoil and undercut the partys efforts to cut spending and tighten immigration. Tight races in the heavily Democratic states of New York and California could determine House control, though the final outcome may not be known for several days as California typically takes several days to count its ballots.

        "title": "Trump claims victory after Fox News projects he has won US presidency",
        "date": "November 6, 2024 01:11 pm",
        "content": "Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the 2024 presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, he said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center. Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research. Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday. We still have votes to count, he said. The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centers. Republicans won a U.S. Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from Jan. 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over. That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison. Trump won 45 of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53 but up 13 percentage points from 2020. About 31 of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79-to-20 margin, according to exit polls. Some 45 of voters across the country said their familys financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favored Trump 80 to 17. Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win late on Tuesday. U.S. stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose - all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favor a Trump victory. At Howard University, where a large watch party was being held for Harris, supporters were leaving in droves, anticipating that the vice president would not address the crowd on Tuesday night. Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris campaign, briefly addressed the crowd and said Harris would not speak. We still have votes to count, he said. We still have states that havent been called yet. TRUMP OUTPERFORMS 2020 Trump was earning a bigger share of the vote than he did four years ago in nearly every corner of the country. By 12:30 a.m. ET, officials had nearly completed their count of ballots in more than 1,600 counties  about half the country  and Trumps share was up about 2 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting a broad if not especially deep shift in Americans support for the president they ousted four years ago. He improved his numbers in suburban counties, rural regions and even some large cities that are historically bastions of Democratic support; in high-income counties and low-income ones; and in places where unemployment was comparatively high and in places where it is now at record lows. Harris had banked on big margins among urban and suburban voters, but her support in those places was running well behind President Joe Bidens in the 2020 election. Nearly three-quarters of voters said American democracy is under threat, according to the exit polls, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy. Hours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was a lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit. I dont respond to nonsense, Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters. A Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. DIZZYING CAMPAIGN Trump voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida. If I lose an election, if its a fair election, Im gonna be the first one to acknowledge it, Trump told reporters. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, watched the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump. Millions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains. Tuesdays vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, Bidens surprise withdrawal and Harris rapid rise. No matter who wins, history will be made. Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.

He declared that such appointments would not be made in the future. Individuals who were not part of the Foreign Service had been appointed as ambassadors and high commissioners to foreign nations. We have recalled 15 of them.

Direct political appointments have also been made in between. At the same time, the sons, daughters, and spouses of MPs and ministers have received direct appointments to lower positions in the diplomatic service. We have recalled them as well, he said. He emphasized that the process of making such appointments was highly improper and assured that this would not happen in the future. According to him, future appointments to the Foreign Service should be based on the relevant skills and expertise required to meet its specific needs. There is no justification for political appointments in the Foreign Service. In certain cases, individuals may need to be appointed to meet the economic and international priorities of the new government, and we will proceed with that. We have instructed all those appointed in this manner to return to Sri Lanka by December 01, he added.",

        "date": "November 6, 2024 04:55 pm",
        "content": "Three individuals, including the wife of a wealthy businessman, have been arrested in connection with the murder of the owner of Kempitiya Walawwa in Kegalle. The victim was found tied up and strangled to death on October 27. Later, police found his wife who had also been tied up. According to police, the murder was carried out with the intent to robbing cash and gold jewellery from the house however, they had only managed to steal Rs. 10,000 in cash and the victims gold ring. Accordingly, the officer-in-charge (OIC) of the Kegalle Division Crimes Investigation Unit, Chief Inspector Apasara Abeysekara who led the investigation, received information that a person who was involved in two similar robberies in Dedigama and Warakapola areas recently was also connected with this murder. Further information had also been received that the suspects were hiding in a house in the Thumbowila area in Piliyandala. Following a search of the house in question, the police arrested a woman and two other persons. During interrogation, the arrested suspects have admitted that the robbery was carried out at the womans behest. Investigations have uncovered that on the day of the incident, the woman had travelled with the three robbers to Kegalle with a hired driver in a car belonging to her brother, claiming they were attending a funeral in Kegalle. Later, the woman in question had instructed to stop the car about 500 meters away from the Kempitiya Walawwa and sent the three robbers to the relevant residence. Accordingly, the three robbers had entered the residence and murdered the owner, and ransacked the house in search of cash and valuables, police said. However, they had only managed to find Rs. 10,000 in cash and the victims gold ring. The gold ring was later sold for a sum of Rs. 160,000 by the woman to a local jewellery shop. It is reported that the 53-year-old woman was having a close relationship with the main suspect, a 25-year-old man while investigations are underway to arrest him. Police also said that the arrested suspects are heavily addicted to drugs. Furthermore, it is also revealed that the suspected woman is the spouse of an individual holding a top position at a prominent company and comes from a wealthy background. However, the suspects have revealed that due to recent financial hardships, the robbery was carried out under the guidance of the woman in question, police said. The suspects were produced before the Kegalle Magistrates Court yesterday (05) and were remanded until November 18.",

Wickremesinghe has been named as a respondent of the relevant writ petition filed by Epic Lanka Private Limited, through a motion submitted by the petitioning party, when the petition was taken up before the two-member Appeals Court judge bench comprising Justices Mohammed Laffar and P. Kumaratnam today (06). During the hearing, the attorneys who appeared for the two foreign companies named as respondents stated that their clients have been critically prejudiced through the interim injunction issued by the court preventing the purchase of 5 million e-passports. The attorneys, who pointed out that the relevant injunction will be in effect until the hearings of the petition are concluded, requested the court to issue an order lifting the injunction. Meanwhile, appearing for the petitioning party, Presidents Council Viran Corea argued that the process of purchasing the passports in question has been carried out under an informal procurement system. Furthermore, the Presidents Counsel objected to the lifting of the injunction issued, requesting for an expedited conclusion of the hearing of the petition and for a final verdict to be issued. Following the consideration of the facts presented, the bench ordered the petitioning party to file objections related to the request to lift the injunction preventing the purchase of passports. Later, the case was also ordered to be recalled on December 09 for the consideration of facts on whether or not the injunction should be lifted. The petition has been filed by Epic Lanka Private Limited seeking an order invalidating the decision taken by the previous government to purchase 750,000 normal passports and 5 million e-passports from two foreign firms.",

        "title": "Donald Trump elected president in stunning comeback",
        "date": "November 6, 2024 05:35 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad. Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country. The former presidents victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold. As of 5:45 a.m. ET (1045 GMT) Trump had won 279 electoral votes to Harris 223 with several states yet to be counted. He also led Harris by about 5 million votes in the popular count. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida. Trumps political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat. But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration. Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday. We still have votes to count, he said. Republicans won a U.S. Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. JOBS AND ECONOMY Voters identified jobs and the economy as the countrys most pressing problem, according to ReutersIpsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment. With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue. Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trumps election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force. Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. His victory will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans taxes and immigration. His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say. Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally. He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies. A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights. HARRIS FALLS SHORT Vice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanize enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters concerns about the economy and immigration. Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy. Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump ran a campaign characterized by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a garbage can for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from obliteration and cast some rivals as the enemy within. His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were poisoning the blood of the country, or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent. Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893. UNPRECEDENTED CAMPAIGN In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. Two months later, a would-be assassins bullet grazed his right ear during a campaign rally, exacerbating fears about political violence. Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris. Barely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid. Bidens decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergized despondent Democrats, and she raised more than 1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls. Harris financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the worlds richest man, Elon Musk, who poured more than 100 million into a super PAC mobilizing Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging. As the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans. She highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who described Trump as a fascist. Trumps victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonization of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behavior and party politics. A TRUMP SECOND TERM Trump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating what has been a longstanding policy of keeping such agencies independent. During his first term, Trumps most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results. Once the 2024 vote is certified by Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, Trump and his vice president, U.S. Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. Throughout his two-year-long campaign, Trump has signaled he will prioritize personal fealty in staffing his administration. He promised roles in his administration to Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both avid supporters. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 7, 2024 08:16 am",
        "content": "The Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners Association stresses that the growing rice shortage in the market is caused by the increased use of raw rice for beer production. According to the association, diverting more rice for brewing has impacted the availability of rice for consumers, leading to rising prices. Chairman of the association U.K. Semasinghe explained that the raw rice used in beer production is sourced from Nadu paddy. Raw rice is essential for beer production, but it comes from Nadu paddy. When a greater portion of this paddy is allocated to the production of beer, the supply of paddy for regular Nadu rice production diminishes, he noted. Against this backdrop, farmers organizations have echoed similar concerns, urging the government to intervene and stabilize rice prices. Many shopkeepers report difficulty in obtaining rice at the government-controlled price, further straining the market. Over the past few weeks, rice prices have surged in local markets, and consumers are facing a noticeable shortage of Nadu rice. In response, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake recently convened a meeting with large-scale rice distributors. Following the discussions, an agreement was reached to maintain controlled rice prices in the retail market, in order to alleviate pressure on consumers amid the shortage.",

        "title": "Biden rushing assistance to Ukraine, with aid uncertain under Trump",
        "date": "November 7, 2024 09:15 am",
        "content": "The White House plans to rush billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, sources said on Wednesday, hoping to shore up the government in Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration. The administration plans to push forward ... to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity, before its term ends in January. Trump has been critical of Bidens assistance for Ukraine, fueling concern about the future of support for President Volodomyr Zelenskiys government under a Republican-controlled White House, Senate and possibly the House of Representatives. The House has been narrowly controlled by Republicans since January 2023, and it was not clear by Wednesday afternoon whether the party had won enough seats in Tuesdays elections to keep Democrats from winning a slim majority. The Republican-controlled House last approved aid for Ukraine, including the authority for Biden to transfer billions of dollars in weapons from U.S. stocks, in April -- eight months after Biden first asked for additional aid, with the support of more Democrats than Republicans. Of the weapons transfer authority passed in April, 4.3 billion remains, in addition to 2.8 billion worth of transfers lawmakers approved in previous spending measures and 2 billion in funding for the purchase of new weapons from industry. In total, that 9 billion in military assistance would be a significant boost to Ukraines stores. Bidens plans for the transfers were first reported by Politico. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. will continue to send munitions and anti-tank weapons such as the Lockheed Martin and RTX, Javelin to Ukraine in the coming months. In order to help Ukraine retake its territory in its ground war with Russia, more ground vehicles will be needed, as well as 155mm artillery made by General Dynamics Corp. Ukraine should be receiving more GMLRS surface-to-surface rockets, which have been under heavy use by the HIMARS multiple rocket launch system. Analysts say it is by no means certain Washington would back any more Ukraine assistance once Republicans control the White House and at least half of Congress, especially as Ukraine experiences battlefield setbacks. Thats going to be a problem when you go forward with additional funding for Ukraine, which at some point is going to be necessary, said Scott Anderson, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declined to discuss aid for Ukraine at a press conference on Wednesday, saying he was there only to discuss election results. As he ran for a second four-year term, Trump insisted Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, adding that he could solve that in 24 hours. Trump told Reuters last year that Kyiv might have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something Ukraine has rejected and Biden has never suggested. The vice president-elect, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, has been a vocal critic of Ukraine assistance, arguing that government funds would be better spent on domestic priorities.

        "title": "Australia plans social media ban for under-16s",
        "date": "November 7, 2024 10:42 am",
        "content": "Australias government says it will introduce world-leading legislation to ban children under 16 from social media. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the harm social media was inflicting on Australian children. This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back, he said. While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban will not apply to young people already on social media. There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus will be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australias online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws. The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after its in place. While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together. Some experts argue that bans only delay young peoples exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces. Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements. One of Australias largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as too blunt an instrument. In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing safety standards on social media platforms. The group also pointed to UN advice that national policies designed to regulate online spaces should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it. But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australias government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content, misinformation, bullying and other social pressures. A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely until at least 16, and that currently excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness. When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it assumes an equal power relationship. I dont know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I dont want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old, he told reporters on Thursday. These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Germany faces snap election as Scholzs coalition crumbles",
        "date": "November 7, 2024 10:49 am",
        "content": "Germanys ruling coalition collapsed on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister and paved the way for a snap election, triggering political chaos in Europes largest economy hours after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. After sacking Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats (FDP) party, Scholz is expected to head a minority government with his Social Democrats and the Greens, the second-largest party. He would have to rely on cobbled-together parliamentary majorities to pass legislation and he plans to hold a parliamentary confidence vote in his government on Jan. 15, which could trigger snap elections by the end of March. Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives who are far ahead in polls, for support in passing the budget and boosting military spending. Merz is due to respond in a Thursday morning news conference. The collapse of Scholzs three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germanys economic direction, with the governments popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging. We need a government that is able to act, that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country, Scholz told reporters. Scholz said he fired Lindner for his obstructive behaviour on budget disputes, accusing the minister of putting party before country and blocking legislation on spurious grounds. The move comes a day after the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president, with Europe scrambling to form a united response on issues from possible new U.S. tariffs to Russias war in Ukraine and the future of the NATO alliance. The government crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure and an unprepared military. A political shake-up could fuel growing frustration with Germanys mainstream parties to the benefit of younger populist movements, including the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Unions two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the blocs integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west. Debt Brake suspension demand The coalition has been at odds over how best to rescue Europes largest economy, which is facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its economic model after the end of cheap gas from Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and amid increasing competition from China. Scholz said he had proposed capping energy costs for companies to bolster Germanys appeal as a place to do business. He wanted a package to help save jobs in the ailing auto industry, as well as increased support for Ukraine. The FDP had proposed public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to the malaise. It also wants to slow Germanys shift to a carbon-neutral economy. Speaking after Scholz, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally-enshrined spending limit known as the debt brake, a move that Lindner, a fiscal hawk, refused to support. Government sources said Scholz had wanted to increase a Ukraine support package by 3 billion euros (3.22 billion) to 15 billion euros and to finance it by suspending the debt brake. Olaf Scholz refuses to recognise that our country needs a new economic model, Lindner told reporters. Olaf Scholz has showed he doesnt have the strength to give his country a new boost. The SPD and the Greens, while at odds on some issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed. The three other FDP ministers - for transport, justice, and education - all voluntarily left the government. Scholz said Lindner was focused on the short-term survival of his own party. Especially today, one day after such an important event as the U.S. elections, this kind of selfishness is utterly incomprehensible. Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the coalition could not agree on how to plug a funding gap in the budget for next year. I want to say on our behalf that tonight feels wrong and doesnt feel right. Its almost tragic on a day like today, when Germany needs to show unity and capacity for action in Europe.

Furthermore, he mentioned that although nearly 600,000 regional party offices could technically be established to accommodate the voter base, only 9,291 regional party offices are currently operational, aligning with the low campaign turnout.

However, 25 violent incidents have been documented thus far, although they have not escalated to a severe situation, according to Hettiarachchi.

The association highlighted that the Department of Immigration and Emigration has a critical role in issuing passports that meet international standards, as mandated by the Immigration and Emigration Act. Despite continuous immigration and emigration services provided around the clock, including during emergencies, passport issuance has been disrupted by inefficiencies that began earlier this year and persist today, the statement added. The association detailed the following factors as having caused the crisis: 1. Not making purchases on time. 2. Not forecasting citizen demand accurately. 3. Not having proper stock of passports 4. Indiscreetly starting an online application process earlier and abandoning it after it failed, without making the existing conditions efficient and expeditious 5. Decision-making by only a few people in the top administration (Controller General  Additional Controller General Deputy Control and Information Technology Controller) 6. Non-consideration of departmental regular staff members in the decision-making process and arbitrary implementation of decisions. 7. Implementing projects without a pilot project or actual deficiency studies. 8. Not doing follow-up tasks 9. Imprudent implementation of the opinions and orders of the political authority. 10. Prioritizing private interests over public service. Furthermore, the Immigration and Emigration officers pointed out lapses in proactive measures that the authorities had made, such as, 1. Not having introduced a formal system to answer the inquiries made by telephone. 2. Non-attendance of duty by the responsible officers and at least not attending the phone calls. 3. Not obtaining the support that could have been obtained through the media. 4. Not recognizing and not implementing a method of providing successful answers even to the clients who come to the department premises and make inquiries. 5. Not taking steps to acquire the knowledge and experience of the experienced, regular employee community. 6. Imprisoning the employee community in an oppressive duty environment. 7. Making the duties that were done in a satisfactory and pleasant environment unsatisfactory and unpleasant 8. Immediate implementation of unfair and illegal conditions and development of unequal treatment. 9. Due to the reduction of employee commitment by working to meet the needs of the minority instead of giving the rights of the majority, the overall performance is reduced and the public service is hindered. The association also pointed to significant missteps in ensuring the availability of blank passports. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for passports rose, but the department did not increase its stock accordingly. Although the Court of Appeal approved the acquisition of 750,000 blank passports, supply delays from the new vendor have exacerbated the crisis, the statement highlighted, noting For example, only 7,000 blank passports were delivered on October 21, far short of demand, with a modest increase to 45,000 by October 27. This supply shortfall has made it difficult for the department to provide concrete answers to the public or media, further aggravating public dissatisfaction, the association added. The association expressed disappointment that higher administration has not been transparent with government leaders or the public. They warned that political loyalty-driven appointments under past political authorities have contributed to arbitrary decision-making. Moreover, the statement alleged that it is regrettable the authorities of the Immigration and Emigration Department have not revealed the true situation related to the issuance of passports, even to the minister in charge of the subject, who is engaged in an extremely responsible role that has to cover a 13 of the entire role of the government, even though the department has all the data and information. To address these issues, they urged for a formal investigation to hold all responsible individuals accountable and to prioritize efficient solutions over private interests. The Immigration and Emigration Officers Association concluded its statement by calling on departmental authorities to act promptly and end the passport crisis, pledging their support for the betterment of public service in Sri Lanka.",

He stated this while addressing a public meeting held in the Kandasurindugama area in Negombo last evening (06). Jayaweera said the Sarvajana Balaya alliance is not engaging in politics based on promises and that their focus is on a type of politics that is about only speaking about what is definitely achievable. He highlighted that their wish is to provide guidance to the President and alleged that many of the Presidents promises have remained unfulfilled as they were never attainable. They promised to reduce the electricity bills by 40. It cannot be done. They said theyll slash petrol price to Rs. 200. But in the end, only Octane 95 which is used by the wealthy was reduced. You got nothing, he said. We can explain how a coconut went up to Rs. 140, and the way the egg prices increased. They are simple concepts of how the price of a product is formed. They are unaware of this. How can one know if they havent visited a market? he questioned. The Sarvajana Balaya alliance leader said since a long time ago they have been speaking about nationalism and entrepreneurship and that today, even Americas Donald Trump is also talking about nationalism and entrepreneurship. He further stated that he believes Sri Lankans will learn a valuable lesson from Trumps Presidential Election result.",

        "date": "November 7, 2024 04:46 pm",
        "content": "A motion has been filed with the Colombo Magistrates Court seeking an order to hand over the investigations into the death of infamous underworld figure and drug lord Makandure Madush, who was allegedly killed in a crossfire between police and suspected underworld figures while in police custody, to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). A motion filed by a group of attorneys who appeared for the rights of the victim was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Rathnayake today (07). Appearing for the rights of the victim, Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera stated before the court that a formal investigation has not been carried out regarding the death of his client as of yet. Accordingly, he requested the court to issue an order handing over the relevant investigations to the CID. Following the consideration of the facts presented, the Additional Magistrate stated that such an order cannot be issued, as per a circular that has been issued by the Judicial Services Commission. Furthermore, the Additional Magistrate advised that the aggrieved party can request for proper investigations by lodging a complaint with the relevant institutions. However, the Additional Magistrate also ordered Maligawatta Police to brief the court on the progress of investigations related to the incident, on December 05, 2024. On October 20, 2020, Samarasinghe Arachchilage Madush Lakshitha alias Makandure Madush was allegedly killed in a crossfire between the police and suspected underworld figures, while he was in police custody. According to the police, the crossfire took place at a housing complex in Maligawatte. Makandure Madush who had been involved in a large number of murders and other criminal activities, was one of the most wanted outlaws in the country. Madush had been in hiding abroad for several years before his arrest. He was apprehended at a drug-fuelled party thrown by him in a Dubai hotel, back in October 2018 and was kept under the custody of the Dubai authorities before being deported to Sri Lanka on the 05 May 2019. The officers of the CID had placed him under arrest upon his arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA). After being held in the custody of the CID for nearly one-and-a-half years, the notorious drug kingpin was transferred to the custody of Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) in October 2020. He had given information to the CCD on a consignment of heroin purportedly hidden inside a home unit owned by Kanjipani Imran at the Laksetha Sewana apartment complex in Maligawatte. Thereby, a team of 17 CCD officers including its OIC had led Madush to the said location on October 20, 2020. As seven officers of the CCD team, who were accompanying Madush, entered the first floor of the building using the staircase, two armed individuals bidding their time on the second floor had opened fire at the police sleuths. Reports revealed that Madush was shot in the head during the gunfire while one of the CCD officers was wounded in the leg. An exchange of gunfire had then ensued between the police officers and the two suspects who were making an attempt to escape. The police had continued to fire at the duo who were getting away in a motorcycle. However, they had fallen off the vehicle, failing to control the speed amidst the shooting. The suspects had then hurled a hand grenade in the direction of the approaching the CCD officers, injuring one of them. Madush, who was subsequently admitted to the Colombo National Hospital, had succumbed to injuries.",

        "date": "November 7, 2024 10:22 pm",
        "content": "Cuba was left reeling Thursday after a fierce Category 3 hurricane ripped across the island, knocking out the countrys power grid, downing trees and damaging infrastructure. No fatalities were immediately reported. Hurricane Rafael crossed a western portion of Cuba on Wednesday evening about 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Havana, where José Ignacio Dimas returned home from his night shift as a security guard to find his apartment building in the historic center of the city had collapsed. The entire front wall of the building fell, José Ignacio Dimas said in a tight voice as he scanned the damage early Thursday. Like many buildings in the capital, it was aging and lacked maintenance. Some 50,000 people took shelter in Havana, with thousands more doing the same in regions south and just west of the capital since they lived in flood zones or in flimsy homes. The main road from Havana to the southern coastal city of Batabanó was strewn with dozens of utility poles and wires. Lázaro Guerra, electricity director for the Ministry of Energy and Mines, said power had been partially restored in the islands western region and that generation units were powering back up. But he warned that restoring power would be slow-going as crews took safety precautions. As Rafael plowed across Cuba on Wednesday evening it slowed to a Category 2 hurricane as it chugged into the Gulf of Mexico before heading toward Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Late Thursday morning, the hurricane was located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west-northwest of Havana. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (345 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). Earlier in the week, Rafael brushed past Jamaica and battered the Cayman Islands, downing trees and power lines and unleashing heavy flooding in some areas. Authorities in Jamaica are searching for a couple last seen inside a car that was swept away by floodwaters, police told Radio Jamaica News. Thousands of customers in Jamaica and Little Cayman remained without power as crews worked to restore electricity after the storm. Rafael was expected to keep weakening as it spins over open waters and heads toward northern Mexico, although the hurricane center warned there was above average uncertainty in the storms future track. Meanwhile, many Cubans were left picking up the pieces from Wednesday night, after a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation. In October, the island was hit by a one-two punch. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the islands energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people. The disasters have stoked discontent already simmering in Cuba amid an ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed many to migrate from Cuba. Classes and public transport were suspended on parts of the island and authorities canceled flights in and out of Havana and Varadero. Thousands of people in the west of the island had been evacuated as a preventative measure. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.
