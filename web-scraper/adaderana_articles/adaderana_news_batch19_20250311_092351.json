        "title": "Gunmen kill police, priest in attacks on places of worship in Russias Dagestan",
        "date": "June 24, 2024 08:57 am",
        "content": "At least 15 police officers and a priest were killed by gunmen on Sunday in what appear to be coordinated attacks on multiple places of worship in Russias southernmost Dagestan province, local authorities said. Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, said at least six militants were also killed following the attacks on churches, synagogues and police posts in the cities of Derbent and the regional capital Makhachkala, which are about 120 kilometers (75 miles) apart. A priest killed during an attack on a church in Derbent was identified by Dagestan Public Monitoring Commission Chairman Shamil Khadulaev as Father Nikolay. They slit his throat. He was 66 years old and very ill, Khadulaev said. A security guard armed with a pistol was also shot, Khadulaev said. The guards condition, along with the total number of victims, remains unclear. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, which come three months after ISIS affiliate ISIS-K claimed an assault at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow that claimed more than 140 lives in one of Russias deadliest terrorist atrocities in years. Law enforcement agencies told state-run news agency TASS that the gunmen in Dagestan were adherents of an international terrorist organization. Dagestan is a predominantly Muslim region home to a small Christian and even smaller Jewish minority. Russian security forces fought an Islamist insurgency in the mountainous region in the 2000s that spilled over from neighboring Chechnya, though attacks have become rarer in recent years. The Muftiyat of the Republic of Dagestan, a centralized Islamic organization that previously reported on the casualties, has since deleted all posts associated with its count of those dead and wounded. Earlier, local authorities reported that at least nine people had been killed and 25 injured in the attacks. The Muftiyat now says law enforcement officers, clergy, and ordinary citizens are among the victims but does not provide specific numbers. One of the law enforcement officers killed was Mavludin Khidirnabiev, the head of the Dagestan Lights police department, according to the Dagestan Ministry of Internal Affairs Telegram channel. Nighttime video, shared by the Republic of Dagestans Ministry of Internal Affairs, showed at least a dozen law enforcement officers  who appear to be armed and wearing tactical gear  outside the gates of a cathedral in northwestern Makhachkala. CNN has geolocated the video to the gates of Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor, a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Makhachkala. Earlier Sunday, TASS reported that a security guard was killed in a shootout at Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises during the attack. While it is unclear if the standoff has fully ended, those who had holed up there have since been evacuated to safety, TASS reported, citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Dagestan. Meanwhile, two synagogues in Dagestan  one in Derbent and one in Makhachkala  were attacked, according to a statement from the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC). The attack on the synagogue in Derbent happened 40 minutes after evening prayer, according to the RJC. Attackers set the building on fire using Molotov cocktails, while police and security guards were killed outside, it said. Photos showed large flames and plumes of smoke billowing heavily out of a series of windows on at least one floor of the structure. The exact number of dead and wounded is being clarified, the RJC said. The organization added that it will take part in the restoration of synagogues and provide assistance to the families of the victims. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the Derbent synagogue had burned to the ground and that local guards had been killed, while the synagogue in Makhachkala had been attacked by gunfire. As far as is known, there were no worshipers in the synagogues at the time of the attack, and there are no known casualties from the Jewish community, the ministry said in a statement. Security guards had been placed outside of local synagogues ever since an antisemitic mob stormed through the local airport in October. An attack was also reported at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. In an earlier Telegram post, Melikov, the head of Dagestan, said, unknown persons made attempts to destabilize the social situation. Dagestan police officers stood in their way. According to preliminary information, there are victims among them. Melikov said the identities of the attackers was being established, an operational headquarters had been set up and a counter-operation was underway. He urged the public to remain calm. Panic and fear are what they were counting on, he said. They wont get this from Dagestanis! The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. All the circumstances of the incident and the persons involved in the terrorist attacks are being established, and their actions will be given a legal assessment, the agency said in a statement.

        "title": "World first epilepsy device fitted in UK boys skull",
        "date": "June 24, 2024 11:38 am",
        "content": "A boy with severe epilepsy has become the first patient in the world to trial a new device fitted in their skull to control seizures. The neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals deep into his brain, has reduced Oran Knowlsons daytime seizures by 80. His mother, Justine, told the BBC he was happier and had a much better quality of life. The surgery was carried out in October as part of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London when Oran - who is now 13 - was 12. Oran, from Somerset, has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy which he developed at the age of three. Since then he has suffered several daily seizures ranging from two dozen to hundreds. When we first spoke to Orans mum last autumn, prior to surgery, she explained how Orans epilepsy dominated his life: It has robbed him of all of his childhood. She told us Oran had a range of different seizures, including those where he fell to the ground, shook violently, and lost consciousness. She said at times he would stop breathing and require emergency medication to resuscitate him. Oran has autism and ADHD, but Justine says his epilepsy is by far the biggest hurdle: I had a fairly bright three-year-old, and within a few months of his seizures commencing he deteriorated rapidly, and lost a lot of skills. Oran is part of the CADET project - a series of trials assessing the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation for severe epilepsy. The partnership involves Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London, Kings College Hospital and the University of Oxford. The Picostim neurotransmitter is made by UK company Amber Therapeutics. How it works Epilepsy seizures are triggered by abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain. The device, which emits a constant pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt the abnormal signals. Before the operation, Justine told us: I want him to find some of himself again through the haze of seizures. Id like to get my boy back. The surgery, which lasted around eight hours, took place in October 2023. The team, led by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Martin Tisdall, inserted two electrodes deep into Orans brain until they reached the thalamus, a key relay station for neuronal information. The margin of error for the lead placement was less than a millimetre. The ends of the leads were connected to the neurostimulator, a 3.5cm square and 0.6cm thick device which was placed in a gap in Orans skull where the bone had been removed. The neurostimulator was then screwed into the surrounding skull, to anchor it in place. Deep brain stimulation has been tried before for childhood epilepsy, but until now neurostimulators were placed in the chest, with wires running up to the brain. Martin Tisdall told the BBC: This study is hopefully going to allow us to identify whether deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for this severe type of epilepsy and is also looking at a new type of device, which is particularly useful in children because the implant is in the skull and not in the chest. We hope this will reduce the potential complications. That includes reducing the risk of infections after the surgery, and the device failing. Oran was given a month to recover from the operation before the neurostimulator was turned on. When it is on, Oran cannot feel it. And he can recharge the device every day via wireless headphones, while getting on with things that he enjoys, like watching TV. We visited Oran and his family seven months post-op to see how they were getting on. Justine told us there had been a massive improvement in Orans epilepsy: He is more alert and with no drop seizures during the day. His night-time seizures are also shorter and less severe. Im definitely getting him back slowly, she said. Martin Tisdall said: We are delighted that Oran and his family have seen such a huge benefit from the treatment and that it has dramatically improved his seizures and quality of life. Oran is now having riding lessons, which he clearly enjoys. Although a nurse is on hand with oxygen, and one of his teachers is always nearby just in case, neither has been needed so far. As part of the trial, three more children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome will be fitted with the deep brain neurostimulator. Currently, Oran gets a constant electrical stimulus from his device. The future looks brighter But in future, the team plan to make the neurostimulator respond in real time to changes in his brain activity, in an attempt to block seizures as they are about to happen. Justine said she was most excited about this next phase of the trial: The Great Ormond Street team gave us hope backnow the future looks brighter. Orans family know his treatment is not a cure, but they are optimistic he will continue to emerge from the shadow cast by his epilepsy. The Picostim neurostimulator, owned by Amber Therapeutics, has also been used to treat patients with Parkinsons disease. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "June 24, 2024 01:42 pm",
        "content": "More than 1,300 faithful died during the Hajj pilgrimage, which took place amid intense heat, and most of the deceased did not have official permits, Saudi Arabia said on Sunday. Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 being unauthorized to perform Hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. Based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries responses, an AFP tally last week put the toll at more than 1,100. The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals. Arab diplomats said last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths  630 of them unregistered pilgrims. The diplomats said the cause of death in most cases was heat-related. Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius, according to Saudi Arabias national meteorological center. Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own toll until Sunday. On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official gave a partial toll of 577 deaths for the two busiest days of Hajj: June 15, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and June 16, when they participated in the stoning of the devil ritual in Mina. The official also defended Riyadhs response, saying: The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgment on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks. Heat stress The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the Hajj this year as successful, SPA reported. He said the health system provided more than 465,000 specialized treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didnt obtain official authorization to perform Hajj, according to SPA, which summarized an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel. Jalajel did not specify how many deaths Saudi officials attributed to heat. The health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care, SPA reported. Among the deceased were several elderly and chronically ill individuals. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives. Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad. For the past several years, the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. The timing of the Hajj moves forward about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year, it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions. A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for Hajj pilgrims will exceed the extreme danger threshold from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses. Off-the-books Hajj Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery. Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the Hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught. Saudi authorities said before the Hajj that they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca. But the Saudi official who spoke on Friday said around 400,000 unregistered pilgrims took part, and that almost all of them (were) from one nationality, an apparent reference to Egypt. On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licenses and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypts cabinet said. It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which organized the Hajj programs using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca via official channels. Unregistered pilgrims in many cases did not have access to amenities meant to make the pilgrimage more bearable, including air-conditioned tents. Unregistered Egyptian pilgrims said last week that in some cases they struggled to access hospitals or hail ambulances for loved ones, some of whom ended up dying. Source: AFP --Agencies",

The fire, which has largely been extinguished, occurred around 10:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. Sunday ET) at a factory run by battery manufacturer Aricell in Hwaseong, south of the capital, Seoul. The blaze began after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, said Kim Jin-young, a local fire official. What triggered the explosion remains unclear, he added. The Yonhap news agency had earlier reported that some 20 bodies had been found inside the plant, but Kim told a televised briefing that 16 people died and two others had suffered serious injuries. He said rescuers were trying to find the five people unaccounted for. A Reuters witness saw firefighters moving as many as six bodies out of the factory, which is in an industrial area. Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its LinkedIn profile. Calls to Aricell offices were unanswered. The company is not listed on South Koreas stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to an Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5. Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked as if they had been blown out into the street by an explosion. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando says that the country must issue free visas to tourists for more countries in order to compete with its regional competitors and to achieve the nations ambitious target of 2.3 million tourist arrivals within the year. Speaking during a press conference held today, the Minister expressed that the special committee report on the proposal to issue free visas to tourists from 67 countries will be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers within the next 2 weeks. Furthermore, Fernando revealed a number of government initiatives intended to attract more tourists to the country. Cabinet has appointed a special committee to provide a report on the proposal to issue free visas to tourists from 67 countries. That committees report will be submitted to Cabinet either this week or the next, the Minister said. Our competitors; the Maldives, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore all offer free visa facilities. We have seen a significant increase in the number of requests for 6-month, multiple entry visas. There has been a similar increase in the number of requests for 1, 2 and 5-year visas. However, in order to be competitive as a tourist destination, we must relax the regulations for single-entry visas as well. We will launch our global tourism promotion initiative within the week. There will be 5 separate campaigns for China, Europe, Australia and Japan, India and Eastern Europe. The procurement process has been completed and it only remains to finalize the contracts with our partners. With this campaign, we intend to attract a record number of tourists to the country for the winter season, which starts in November, he added. Apart from that, we intend to launch a marine tourism promotion campaign by August this year. Through this campaign, we intend to attract global recognition to Trincomalee and Arugam Bay as premier marine tourist destinations, said the Minister. Moreover, Minister Harin Ferndao also said that 33 of tourists who arrive in Sri Lanka are repeat visitors and that is why the government intends to promote the tag-line Sri Lanka  You Come Back for More.

        "content": "Sri Lankan officials and global investors are expected to hold a second round of direct talks this week to agree on the restructuring of 12 billion in defaulted bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. A group of bondholders, known as the steering committee, will continue to negotiate on the governments new proposal in this round of the talks, the people said. The bondholders went restricted, meaning the conversations with the government are covered by temporary trading limitations because the topics under discussion may be market sensitive, one of the people said. Representatives for the bondholders and the government were not immediately available to comment. Swift progress on the matter is key as the country is scheduled to hold presidential elections in mid-October. In February, Sri Lanka sent a proposal to holders of dollar bonds as part of its plan to overhaul 27 billion of foreign debt, including bonds and loans. The restructuring is critical to ensure financing from the IMF bailout keeps flowing. Last week, strategists at Barclays said that the restructuring was progressing and likely to be completed in the next few months, meaning that the bonds offer value. Sri Lanka needs to reach deals with both bondholders and bilateral lenders to keep receiving IMF disbursements under a 3 billion program.

        "date": "June 24, 2024 10:33 pm",
        "content": "The Strategic Steering Committee meeting and summary workshop of the Biogas, Biomass and Solar South-south and Trilateral Cooperation Project was successfully held in Colombo, Sri Lanka from 12-14 June with the participation of 30 key stakeholders from the Strategic Steering Committee Board, with thematic focus on presenting the projects results and achievements, alongside an independent evaluation to assess lessons learned and provide recommendations for ensuring the projects continued sustainability. Participants also engaged in a two-day visit to project sites in Wennappuwa, Kurunegala and Trincomalee. The project, in partnership with the governments of China, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka, was implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the aim of improving local access to clean and renewable energy in Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. The project also facilitated two-way exchanges of expertise and technologies, as well as mutual learning among China, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Specifically, the Project was a collaboration between the Ministry of Commerce of the Peoples Republic of China (MOFCOM), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST), the Ministry of Water and Energy of Ethiopia (MoWE), Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), Administrative Center for Chinas Agenda 21 (ACCA21), China Agricultural University (CAU), coordinated by UNDP China and implemented by UNDP Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Under the banner of South-South and Trilateral Cooperation modality, in Sri Lanka, UNDP Sri Lanka implemented the Biogas, Biomass and Solar Trilateral Cooperation (TSSC) Project from 2019-2024. The project spanned five provinces, delivering 262 Solar Powered Renewable Energy Technology(RETs) Applications, including solar PV systems, solar-powered greenhouses, cold rooms, solar-powered aerators for shrimp farms, solar-powered sprayers, solar animal repellers, and solar insect traps to over 233 beneficiaries including 80 women and 200 vulnerable groups. Key outcomes of the project included the development of an Energy Data Management System (EDMS) to monitor energy savings from these RETs with the support of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA); the distribution of IT equipment among the 5 provinces for data collection and updating EDMS; development and handing over of 5 Provincial Energy Plans for the agriculture sector for the Eastern, North-Western, Northern, Southern and Uva provinces. Commenting on the impact of the project over the years at the summary workshop, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP Sri Lanka stated, UNDPs Biogas, Biomass, and Solar Trilateral Project exemplifies the success of South-South and triangular cooperation in promoting innovative development solutions and fostering transformative change towards net-zero development pathways. The Project has supported Sri Lankas national targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions and has greatly supported vulnerable farmer communities in Sri Lanka, enabling them to secure a sustainable income through the transfer of renewable energy technologies. From the Government of Sri Lankas perspective, Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary, Ministry of Power  Energy commented, We are looking forward to deeper and larger opportunities to cooperate with the global South in our journey of national development. This pilot project clearly showed the greater mutual understanding of partners and brought experience from China on renewable energy technologies and provided opportunities for Sri Lanka to exchange ideas and lessons learnt with China and Ethiopia. We foresee the ever-broadening space for South-South cooperation in our accelerated energy transition programme launched to reach carbon neutrality. From the Chinese perspective, Mr. Chen Qizhen, Deputy Director General, ACCA21 noted, Throughout the project implementation, we not only shared advanced technologies and experiences in the field of renewable energy with our partners, promoting technology transfer and innovation, but also jointly explored new paths to address energy poverty and advance green, low-carbon development. From solar energy, and biogas, to biomass energy, and from technical training to the construction of project demonstration sites, every step reflects the dedication and wisdom of all experts and representatives involved. Each achievement stands as a testament to our collective commitment to pursuing a green future. Adding to this, Ms. Charu Bist, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Ethiopia also highlighted the impact in Ethiopia Ethiopia is the third-highest country in Sub-Saharan Africa facing electricity access deficits. Only around 35 per cent of its population is connected to on-grid electrification, with an additional 13 per cent utilising off-grid pre-electrification, resulting in a combined electricity access rate of 48 per cent. Addressing these energy disparities not only enhances social equality, particularly for vulnerable populations and women but also mitigates health issues, and improves access to essential services, education, and information. Played as the bridge between China, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka, Ms. Beate Trankmann, Resident Representative, UNDP in China commented, At a time when global progress towards the SDGs has not only stalled - but in some areas such as climate action is in fact regressing, and when government budgets are overstretched, partnerships like this can make a critical contribution. By developing and deploying biogas, biomass, and solar technologies, this project has brought access to clean and renewable energy to vulnerable people and communities in Sri Lanka and Ethiopia, improving livelihoods and enabling sustainable growth. South-South cooperation is a manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South that contributes to their national well-being, national and collective self-reliance, and attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Trilateral Cooperation including the engagement of UNDP adds value to that. --UNDP--",

        "date": "June 25, 2024 07:35 am",
        "content": "(AP)  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will plead guilty to a felony charge in a deal with the U.S. Justice Department that will allow him to walk free and resolve a long-running legal saga that spanned multiple continents and centered on the publication of a trove of classified documents. Assange left a British prison on Monday and will appear later this week in the U.S. federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Western Pacific. Hes expected to plead guilty to an Espionage Act charge of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified national defense information, the Justice Department said in a letter filed in court. The guilty plea, which must be approved by a judge, brings an abrupt conclusion to a criminal case of international intrigue and to the U.S. governments years-long pursuit of a publisher whose hugely popular secret-sharing website made him a cause célèbre among many press freedom advocates who said he acted as a journalist to expose U.S. military wrongdoing. Investigators, by contrast, have repeatedly asserted that his actions broke laws meant to protect sensitive information and put the countrys national security at risk. He is expected to return to Australia after his plea and sentencing, which is scheduled for Wednesday morning, local time in Saipan, the largest island in the Mariana Islands. The hearing is taking place there because of Assanges opposition to traveling to the continental U.S. and the courts proximity to Australia. Attorneys for Assange didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. In a statement posted on X, WikiLeaks said Assange boarded a plane and departed the UK on Monday after leaving the British prison. WikiLeaks applauded the announcement of the deal, saying it was grateful for all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom. WikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the peoples right to know, WikiLeaks said. The deal ensures that Assange will admit guilt while also sparing him from any additional prison time. He had spent years hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London after Swedish authorities sought his arrest on rape allegations before being locked up in the United Kingdom. Assange is expected to be sentenced to the five years he has already spent in a high-security British prison while fighting to avoid extradition to the U.S. to face charges, a process that has played out in a series of hearings in London. Last month, he won the right to appeal an extradition order after his lawyers argued that the U.S. government provided blatantly inadequate assurances that he would have the same free speech protections as an American citizen if extradited from Britain. Assange has been heralded by many around the world as a hero who brought to light military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists. But his reputation was also tarnished by rape allegations, which he has denied. The Justice Departments indictment unsealed in 2019 accused Assange of encouraging and helping U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal diplomatic cables and military files that WikiLeaks published in 2010. Prosecutors had accused Assange of damaging national security by publishing documents that harmed the U.S. and its allies and aided its adversaries. Prosecutors said in a charging document filed in connection with the plea agreement that Assange conspired with Manning to receive and obtain documents, notes and other writings related to the national defense and to willfully communicate those records. The document takes care to note that Assange was not a United States citizen, did not possess a U.S. security clearance, and did not have authorization to possess, access, or control documents, writings, or notes relating to the national defense of the United States, including classified information. The case was lambasted by press advocates and Assange supporters. Federal prosecutors defended it as targeting conduct that went way beyond that of a journalist gathering information, amounting to an attempt to solicit, steal and indiscriminately publish classified government documents. It was brought even though the Obama administration Justice Department had passed on prosecuting him years earlier. The plea agreement comes months after President Joe Biden said he was considering a request from Australia to drop the U.S. push to prosecute Assange. The White House was not involved in the decision to resolve Assanges case, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offenses for leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven years behind bars. Assange made headlines in 2016 after his website published Democratic emails that prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives. He was never charged in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation, but the inquiry laid bare in stark detail the role that the hacking operation played in interfering in that years election on behalf of then-Republican candidate Donald Trump. Justice Department officials mulled charges for Assange following the documents 2010 publication, but were unsure a case would hold up in court and were concerned it could be hard to justify prosecuting him for acts similar to those of a conventional journalist. The posture changed in the Trump administration, however, with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017 calling Assanges arrest a priority. Assanges family and supporters have said his physical and mental health have suffered during more than a decade of legal battles, which includes seven years spent inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 and was granted political asylum after courts in England ruled he should be extradited to Sweden as part of a rape investigation in the Scandinavian country. He was arrested by British police after Ecuadors government withdrew his asylum status in 2019 and then jailed for skipping bail when he first took shelter inside the embassy. Although Sweden eventually dropped its sex crimes investigation because so much time had elapsed, Assange has remained in Londons high-security Belmarsh Prison during the extradition battle with the U.S. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 25, 2024 09:04 am",
        "content": "The World Banks Board of Executive Directors has approved 150 million in financing for Sri Lanka to improve the quality and utilization of its primary healthcare services. The newly approved Sri Lanka Primary Healthcare System Enhancing Project will help improve quality of care and increase the use of primary medical care institutions, which provide essential health services to local communities, a statement said. Capacity challenges and absence of a formal referral mechanism have led to the underutilization of primary healthcare facilities and overcrowding in tertiary care facilities in Sri Lanka. The previous World Bank-supported Primary Healthcare Systems Strengthening Project had already enhanced 550 Primary Medical Care Institutions with essential equipment, medicines, health workers and basic laboratory testing facilities. The new project will scale up these efforts to cover 100 of Primary Medical Care Institutions across all districts of Sri Lanka, expanding to over 1,000 facilities with a more comprehensive service package and improved quality of care. Sri Lankas health system has demonstrated remarkable performance, but it needs to be strengthened to face emerging health care challenges, said Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. This project will support the countrys forward-looking primary care reorganization agenda, laying the foundation for a more responsive and people-centric healthcare system. Non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cervical cancer are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Sri Lanka, accounting for 80 of deaths. Effective control and management of non-communicable diseases require robust screening, early diagnosis, treatment and follow up. Additionally, Sri Lanka has the fastest aging population in South Asia, necessitating health system adaptations to meet the growing healthcare needs of the elderly. This project is designed around these evolving health priorities, helping invest in preventive care and promoting primary care facilities as the first point of care. In addition, the project will support the provision of comprehensive primary healthcare services by expanding capacity to cover mental health, palliative, geriatric, rehabilitative, and emergency care, which are particularly important for the aging population. The project will also bolster pandemic preparedness by expanding the capacity of primary medical care institutions to detect and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks. This will help Sri Lankas healthcare system to adapt and respond effectively to new and emerging challenges, the World Bank said.",

Since October, Gaza has faced relentless violence which has killed over 37,000 people, including thousands of children. It follows an attack in Israel by Palestinian armed groups that killed over a thousand people, including at least 33 children, the Save the Children report said. It also notes that about 250 Palestinian children are also missing in the occupied West Bank, as of June 9. Jeremy Stoner, Save the Childrens regional director for the Middle East, has called for an independent investigation into the situation surrounding Gazas missing children, and for accountability. Families are tortured by the uncertainty of the whereabouts of their loved ones. No parent should have to dig through rubble or mass graves to try and find their childs body. No child should be alone, unprotected in a war zone. No child should be detained or held hostage, he added. Further strain The agencys child protection teams are reporting that the latest displacements caused by the offensive in Rafah have separated more children and further increased the strain on families and communities caring for them. It is almost impossible to collect and verify information under the current conditions in Gaza, but at least 17,000 Palestinian children are believed to be unaccompanied and separated. With 40 per cent of the casualties said by the UN to be children, approximately 4,000 children are likely missing under the rubble. An unknown number are believed to be in mass graves. Others have been forcibly disappeared, including an unknown number detained by the Israeli occupation forces and transferred out of Gaza, their whereabouts unknown to their families amidst reports of ill-treatment and torture. Every day we find more unaccompanied children and every day it is harder to support them, explained a Save the Children Child Protection Specialist. We work through partners to identify separated and unaccompanied children and trace their families, but there are no safe facilities for them; there is no safe place in Gaza. Besides, reuniting them with family members is difficult when ongoing hostilities restrict our access to communities, and constantly force families to move. Source: Gulf News --Agencies",

        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has urged the Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to secure the immediate release of all the fishermen and their fishing boats apprehended by Sri Lanka. The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister has requested Minister Jaishankar in writing to prevail upon the Sri Lankan Government for securing the release of 37 arrested fishermen of Tamil Nadu and to secure expeditious release of the seized boats. As I had pointed out in my previous letter, the incidents of arrests and intimidation have been continuing unabated resulting in loss of livelihoods, he added in his letter, a copy of which was released to the media. Despite this, yet again, on June 22, 22 fishermen from Rameswaram fishing harbour were apprehended along with their three mechanised fishing boats, Mr. Stalin said in his letter. I request you to ensure the immediate release of the apprehended fishermen and their boats, he added. I would also like to inform that permission is yet to be granted for the salvage boats and crew for bringing back the released boats from Sri Lanka, Mr Stalin pointed out. Similarly, the requests of various fishermen associations in Tamil Nadu to visit the fishermen jailed in Sri Lanka, to provide them with some consolation and certain basic needs, may be proactively considered, he added. It is imperative that urgent diplomatic initiatives are taken to resolve this festering issue. I have been reiterating the need to revitalise the Joint Working Group that was set up to address this. I therefore request you to take this up with the Sri Lankan authorities and also to work towards a lasting solution to this issue, Stalin said. Separately, BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai also wrote to Minister Jaishankar requesting his intervention in ensuring the early release of the 22 Tamil fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy and the boats belonging to them, Indian media reported. The Sri Lanka Navy on Sunday (23) apprehended 03 Indian fishing trawlers along with 22 Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters off the Delft Island, Jaffna. Additionally, the navy has taken into custody 10 Indian fishermen in a trawler while poaching in seas off Delft Island last night (24), whereas a navy officer who was injured during the incident has succumbed to his injuries after admission to hospital. Sri Lanka Navy has arrested over 200 Indian fishermen and seized more than 27 Indian poaching trawlers in Sri Lankan waters so far in 2024, and subsequently handed them over to authorities for legal proceedings. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has urged both indian External Affairs Minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on several occasions to address this issue to seek a diplomatic resolution to ensure the safety and well-being of Tamil fishermen mentioning that the nationalisation of the apprehended boats without proper compensation or alternative arrangements pushes the fishermen and their families into financial distress. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "June 25, 2024 04:16 pm",
        "content": "Chinas lunar probe has returned to Earth with the first ever samples from the Moons unexplored far side. The Change-6 landed in the Inner Mongolia desert on Tuesday, after a nearly two-month long mission which was fraught with risks. Scientists are eagerly awaiting the Change-6 as the samples could answer key questions about how planets are formed. China is the only country to have landed on the far side of the Moon, having done so before in 2019. The far side - which faces away from Earth - is technically challenging to reach due to its distance, and its difficult terrain of giant craters and few flat surfaces. Scientists are interested in this less-explored side as it is hoped it may contain traces of ice, which can be harvested for water, oxygen, and hydrogen. The Change-6 mission is a source of pride for a nation which has stepped up its missions to the Moon - drawing attention from its rival, the US. State media showed officials planting the Chinese flag with a flourish just after the Change-6 capsule landed in the desert of Inner Mongolia. Chinas President Xi Jinping has called to congratulate those at the command centre of the Change-6 mission. Mr Xi said he hopes they can carry on exploring deep space and reaching new heights in unravelling the mysteries of the universe... to benefit humanity and advance the nation. The Change-6 blasted off from a space centre in early May, and successfully landed on a crater close to the Moons south pole a few weeks later. Its mission lasted 53 days. The probe will be sent to Beijing and samples will be retrieved there, according to state broadcaster CCTV. This is Chinas sixth mission to the Moon, and its second to the far side. The probe is named after the moon goddess Change in Chinese mythology. The probe used a drill and a robotic arm to scoop up soil and rocks, took some photos of the surface and planted a Chinese flag. Catherine Heymans, the astronomer royal for Scotland, hoped the samples would help test theories about how the Moon was formed 4.5 billion years ago and whether it resulted from a collision with a very early version of the Earth. its incredibly exciting to see this landing successfully, she told the BBC. The geological activity on the Moon is very different on the near side and the far side and its been a big puzzle why we see those differences. She hoped the samples brought back would help researchers understand the composition of the centre of the Moon. Is it very similar to the Earth? Can that confirm our theory that the Earth and the Moon were once the same thing? Beijing has poured huge resources into its space programme over the past decade in an effort to catch up with both the US and Russia. It aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and plans to eventually build a base on the lunar south pole. The US also plans to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2026 with its Artemis 3 mission. Analysts believe the next space race will not just be about putting people on the Moon  it will be about who is able to stake their claim and control lunar resources. Source: BBC --Agencies",

We have been advocating for this community for a while. They are also a part of this society. Gender identities are diverse, including those of the same-sex community. From the beginning, we are of the stance that individuals should not be discriminated based on their gender, she said. Specifically, these same-sex relationships have been criminalized in our penal code. This is not a law which was originated in our country; it was introduced during the Victorian era by the British. Therefore, we believe it should be amended, Dr. Amarasuriya expressed. MP Premnath C. Dolawaththa, a government representative, has tabled a private members bill in the Parliament to amend the penal code Commenting further, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya said: Our party believes that decisions regarding the relationships of two adults should be made by the individuals involved, not dictated by law. However, a law should remain in place to protect children and minimize potential harm. Only the sexual relationships with animals are a crimeSo, the NPP will back this during its third reading, she assured.",

        "date": "June 25, 2024 09:53 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the government is placing special focus on integrating economic and technical sectors through advancements in computer and information technology. The President highlighted the vision to transform Colombo Port City into a financial zone facilitating offshore activities and attracting investments in Sri Lanka, with a strong emphasis on the development of enterprises and the utilization of digital technology by both local and foreign investors. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during the opening of the 2024 DigiEcon Global Investment Conference, commenced today (25) at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo. The conference, themed Harnessing Sri Lankas Untapped Potential, aims to showcase the countrys investment opportunities. He stated that Sri Lanka needs digital cooperation with India and China who are giants in the field. We are situated between two giants in this sector, China and India, covering both hardware and software. We need to utilize that knowledge and cooperate with these countries, he said. He also outlined the governments plans to build national infrastructure under the Science and Technology Development Act, which established the National Science and Technology Commission and the National Science Foundation. We are now introducing new laws to supplement it. Firstly, we will create a Chief Technological Officer, who will be the chief technological advisor to the government of Sri Lanka. Then, we will establish the Technology and Innovation Council, which will fund commercializing research. He said the government will also support pure and applied sciences through the National Science Foundation. We aim to create a system for commercializing research. All government funding for pure and applied research will go through the National Science Foundation, which will set priorities and monitor performance. The President said the government is also establishing the Digital Transformation Agency. Initially focused on computer and information technology, we are now integrating economic and technological aspects. The final new institution we are introducing is the National AI Centre. He further said that Sri Lanka must establish the infrastructure for high-tech cities. We are looking at one in the outskirts of Colombo, which at least have 100 acres or more. Smaller areas like Jaffna and others could have their own cities, with about 25 to 50 acres, depending on the available land. One major high-tech city will be in Colombo, and if possible, another in Kandy. Following the opening session, a panel discussion took place, featuring participation from Chief of Presidential Staff Senior Advisor to the President on National Security Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister of State for Technology Kanaka Herath and Minister of State for Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe met with the Global CEO of IFS, Mr. Mark Moffat, in conjunction with the conference. Addressing the gathering, the President further said: If you are looking at fast growth, then certainly the digital economy and the whole innovation system are essential. We started with tourism and agricultural modernization. This is another fast-growing sector that has been identified. So how do we promote it? Where do we go from here? So, what is it that we have, and what is it that we need? Firstly, we need to look at how we can expand this sector of the economy. How can the digital economy and innovation in the field of digital technology help us? At the moment, we have identified areas for development. Agriculture modernization will go hand in hand with the expansion of the digital sector. We are looking at modernizing agriculture into smart agriculture. We are a country where the average holding is sometimes less than one acre, but we are trying to increase it to two or three acres. Look at the potential we have there. Secondly, if you look at any sector to expand, there are two factors to consider: the economic crisis and the utilization of technology. We also need a workforce capable of developing and applying that technology. I will say a few words about what we hope to do. As far as the digital economy is concerned, we have identified it because, as Mark said, theres a growing demand. Additionally, look at the demand that is going to come up in Asia and Africa. We are situated between two giants in this sector, China and India, covering both hardware and software. We need to utilize that knowledge and cooperate with these countries. We have already started discussions with India in the private sector. SLASSCOM and NASSCOM are cooperating, and we hope there will be more. We are trying to build this commerce and are also getting help in building up our national platform. Initial discussions have started with China, and we hope for a successful outcome. Here we are in Asia, and this is where we have to move forward. We need to look at different areas, and I must mention the Port City project, which we want to proceed with. In Colombo, we aim to create a financial zone that will also provide for offshore activity, encouraging investment in Sri Lanka. With that said, the rest of the work will be left to you: what enterprises to develop and how to use digital technology. Regarding infrastructure, we are building national infrastructure under the Science and Technology Development Act, which established the National Science and Technology Commission and the National Science Foundation. We are now introducing new laws to supplement it. Firstly, we will create a Chief Technological Officer, who will be the chief technological advisor to the government of Sri Lanka. Then, we will establish the Technology and Innovation Council, which will fund commercializing research. We will also support pure and applied sciences through the National Science Foundation. We aim to create a system for commercializing research. All government funding for pure and applied research will go through the National Science Foundation, which will set priorities and monitor performance. All state institutions must comply with this, and those seeking to commercialize research will go through the council. This system will be open to both the public and private sectors, as well as universities, which have been left out previously. We are also establishing the Digital Transformation Agency. Initially focused on computer and information technology, we are now integrating economic and technological aspects. The final new institution we are introducing is the National AI Centre. These initiatives require human resources. In the short term, we may produce more, but we may not have enough. We might need to bring in trainers from outside, and if so, we shouldnt hinder this. The more we train, the better the results. Internally, if we need experienced people, we should allow that for a short period while ensuring companies are not disrupted and that Sri Lankans can progress in the medium term. We will now restructure the entire vocational training system. Instead of having multiple authorities, there will be one central authority with nine provincial agencies. Vocational colleges will integrate various training centres run by different authorities, converting them into vocational colleges. Regarding technical colleges, we are planning to establish new institutions focused on technology and management, awarding associate degrees. These associate degrees, which take about two years to complete, will allow graduates to upgrade their qualifications at vocational and technical universities, the Open University, or any other university, to achieve bachelors or masters degrees. This approach will benefit those in higher education and university education. We are discussing with India the establishment of a Chennai IIT campus in Kandy. Additionally, we are starting three new universities following the KDU model. The first is the University of Kurunegala, which is being planned with three campuses, one in Sitawaka, and the third somewhere outside Colombo, possibly in Gampaha or nearby. These universities will focus on technology and management, and we will collaborate with other foreign universities to offer various courses. Some universities that currently do not offer engineering programs will be allowed to introduce them, and we will ensure that AI is taught there. We have a number of students who are studying in the arts faculties in the arts stream. Now, employment is a problem for them if they are looking at government employment. What we are discussing now is to see if there are firms capable of taking them on while they are in university, studying subjects such as geography or others. These students will become proficient in IT and English, so they can find employment. This initiative will provide employment opportunities for a certain number of people. The government will fund this. In any case, its better to fund them in IT rather than creating additional jobs as development officers, for which we have no money. So, we are prepared to discuss with you all how we will establish these schemes, which will work. Then, lets see whether some of the companies will really focus mainly on training others in the digital economy itself. I dont want to take any more of your time, but we must establish the infrastructure for high-tech cities. We are looking at one in the outskirts of Colombo, which at least have 100 acres or more. Smaller areas like Jaffna and others could have their own cities, with about 25 to 50 acres, depending on the available land. One major high-tech city will be in Colombo, and if possible, another in Kandy. This is our current thinking. We will focus significantly on human resources development and research. The rest is up to you. We must now look at how we can find more capital, possibly at a slightly concessional rate and development financing for you to get ahead. Ive just explained what we hope to achieve in the coming years, and I hope you will contribute to enriching the future of the country and influencing government thinking. --PMD",

        "date": "June 26, 2024 09:48 am",
        "content": "Thousands of protesters stormed Kenyas parliament Tuesday to protest tax proposals, burning part of the building, sending lawmakers fleeing and drawing fire from police in unrest that the president vowed to quash. Several people were killed. It was the most direct assault on the government in decades. Journalists saw at least three bodies outside the complex where police had opened fire, and medical workers reported five people killed. Clashes spread to other cities. There was no immediate word on arrests. Todays events mark a critical turning point on how we respond to threats to our national security, President William Ruto said, calling the events treasonous and vowing to quash the unrest at whatever cost. Kenyas defense minister said the military had been deployed to support police during the security emergency and breaching of critical infrastructure. Protesters had demanded that legislators vote against a finance bill imposing new taxes on East Africas economic hub, where frustrations over the high cost of living have simmered. Youth who had voted Ruto into power with cheers for his promises of economic relief have taken to the streets to object to the pain of reforms. Lawmakers managed to pass the bill before fleeing through a tunnel as protesters outmaneuvered police and poured in. The fire at the building was later put out. The Kenya Medical Association said in a statement that at least five people were fatally shot while trying to treat wounded people at the scene. It said more than 30 people were wounded, at least 13 with live bullets. Police fired live ammunition and threw tear gas canisters at protesters who sought treatment at a medical tent at a nearby church. Elsewhere in town, Kenyatta National Hospital said it received 45 casualties. One person shot dead was wrapped in a Kenyan flag and carried away. Another lay on the sidewalk, their head in the gutter. Internet service in the country noticeably slowed in what NetBlocks called a major disruption, and at least one broadcaster issued a statement saying that we have received threats from the authorities to shut us down. Ruto had been outside Nairobi attending an African Union retreat. He was expected to sign the finance bill into law this week. He has two weeks to act but faces calls from religious and other leaders to think again. The nearby office of the Nairobi governor, a member of the ruling party, also was briefly on fire Tuesday, smoke pouring from its white facade. Police water cannons were used to extinguish the fire. Protesters could be heard shouting, Were coming for every politician. The Kenya Human Rights Commission shared a video of officers shooting at protesters, and it urged Ruto to issue an immediate order to stop the killings. The president instead said the government had mobilized all resources to ensure order. On Sunday, Ruto tried to calm the rising public tensions, saying he was proud of the young Kenyans who came out to exercise their democratic duty in earlier protests. The politician who had promoted himself as a hustler from humble beginnings said he would engage them on their concerns. Youth had announced they were uniting to keep the government in check as prices for fuel, food and other necessities have soared. In Nairobi, a regional hub for expatriates and home to a United Nations complex, the inequality among Kenyans has sharpened along with long-held frustrations over state corruption. Opposition to the finance bill has united a large part of the country, with some explicitly rejecting the tribal divisions that have torn Kenya apart in the past. Some who had passionately supported Ruto felt betrayed. I fell for his lies. Now Im out here regretting why I voted for him, youth Oscar Saina told The Associated Press last week As throngs of protesters rushed through the streets Tuesday, defiance emerged elsewhere in the country  including in the town where the president was, Naivasha, as protesters chanted Ruto must go. Protesters tried to storm the State House in the western city of Nakuru, a witness said. There were clashes in the western lakeside city of Kisumu. The governor of Mombasa, Kenyas second largest city, joined protesters outside his office and expressed his support for them. Protesters burned ruling party offices in Embu in central Kenya, the Nation newspaper reported. Citizen TV showed footage from Nyeri in central Kenya with police confronting protesters in the smoking streets. A national gathering of Catholic bishops urged police not to attack protesters and pleaded with the government to listen to citizens pain over the unwarranted taxes, saying the country is bleeding ... families are immensely suffering. The Kenya Law Society President Faith Odhiambo said earlier Tuesday that 50 Kenyans, including her personal assistant, had been abducted by people believed to be police officers. Some had been vocal in the demonstrations and were taken from homes, workplaces and public spaces ahead of Tuesdays protests, according to civil society groups. A statement by diplomats from 13 Western countries including the United States said they were shocked by the scenes outside parliament and expressed concern about the violence and abductions of protesters. Police officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Parliament Speaker Moses Wetangula had directed the inspector general of police to provide information on the whereabouts of those missing. Also Tuesday, hundreds of Kenyas police officers, long accused of abuses by human rights watchdogs and others, arrived in Haiti to lead a United Nations-backed multinational force against the powerful gangs who have the country in its grip. The deployment faces a legal challenge in Kenya but Rutos government has gone ahead, with the thanks of U.S. President Joe Biden. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "June 26, 2024 02:03 pm",
        "content": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange walked free on Wednesday from a court on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Saipan after pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage law in a deal that allowed him to head straight home to Australia. His release ends a 14-year legal saga in which Assange spent more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven years in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London battling extradition to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges. During the three-hour hearing, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities. Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information, he told the court. I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute. Chief U.S. District Judge Ramona V. Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail. We firmly believe that Mr. Assange never should have been charged under the Espionage Act and engaged in (an) exercise that journalists engage in every day, his U.S. lawyer, Barry Pollack, told reporters outside the court. WikiLeaks work would continue, he said. His U.K. and Australian lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, thanked the Australian government for its years of diplomacy in securing Assanges release. It is a huge relief to Julian Assange, to his family, to his friends, to his supporters and to us and to everyone who believes in free speech around the world that he can now return home to Australia and be reunited with his family, she said. Assange, 52, left the court through a throng of TV cameras and photographers without answering questions, then waved as he got into a white SUV. He left Saipan on a private jet to the Australian capital Canberra, where he is expected to land around 7:30 p.m. (0930 GMT), according to flight logs. Assange had agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.S. territory in the western Pacific was chosen due to his opposition to travelling to the mainland U.S. and for its proximity to Australia, prosecutors said. Dozens of media from around the world attended the hearing, with more gathered outside the courtroom to cover the proceedings. Media were not allowed inside the courtroom to film the hearing. I watch this and think how overloaded his senses must be, walking through the press scrum after years of sensory depravation and the four walls of his high security Belmarsh prison cell, Stella Assange, the wife of WikiLeaks founder said on social media platform X. Assange spent more than five years in what Judge Manglona called one of Britains harshest prisons and seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London as he fought accusations of sex crimes in Sweden and battled extradition to the U.S. While stuck at the embassy he had two sons with his partner, Stella, who had been one of his lawyers. They married in 2022 at the Belmarsh prison in London. Assanges supporters view him as a victim because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing and potential crimes, including in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Washington has said the release of the secret documents put lives in danger. The Australian government has been advocating for his release and has raised the issue with the United States several times. This isnt something that has happened in the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday. This is something that has been considered, patient, worked through in a calibrated way, which is how Australia conducts ourselves. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 26, 2024 02:29 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has reached a final restructuring agreement for USD 5.8 billion of debt with its bilateral lenders Official Creditor Committee in Paris, France on Wednesday. This agreement grants significant debt relief, allowing Sri Lanka to allocate funds to essential public services and secure concessional financing for its development needs, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. We are pleased to announce that the final agreement has been reached on debt restructuring between Sri Lanka and the Official Creditor Committee on the sidelines of the Paris Forum 2024 in Paris, France, Sri Lankas State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe confirmed. Today, we are also in the process of signing bilateral debt treatment agreements between Sri Lanka and Export-Import Bank of China, he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). On behalf of Sri Lanka, the state minister expressed gratitude to the OCC chairs - France, India, and Japan - as well as the Export Import Bank of China (EXIM) for their leadership in this process, as well as all OCC members for their unwavering support. He also commended the OCC Secretariat for their dedication to finding a resolution to Sri Lankas debt crisis and to achieve this significant milestone, which he said will enhance confidence in the countrys economy and foster growth. I reiterate that the unwavering commitment and leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe have been instrumental in steering our nation towards this milestone achievement, he added. The Sri Lanka government was expected to sign the debt restructuring agreement with the group of creditor nations on Wednesday, in a major step to help stabilise the countrys finances following its economic crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had updated his Cabinet on the debt restructuring late on Monday. The Cabinet also approved the debt restructuring framework, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told reporters yesterday, while declining to divulge details. Details of the agreement will be presented to parliament later to ensure transparency, he said, during the Cabinet press briefing. The deal will allow creditor nations to resume lending to Sri Lanka. The economy crashed in 2022 when a fall in foreign exchange reserves prompted the island to default on its foreign debt. Sri Lankas bonds, were up 0.2-0.3 cents in late Asian trading, slightly outperforming most emerging markets and maintaining the more than 15 gains made since February. Sri Lankas finance ministry said in November that the debt restructuring agreement in principle covered approximately 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and involved a mix of extending the maturity of long-term borrowings and reducing interest rates on the credit. The majority of the debt is owed to Japan and India, which chair the OCC along with France. A provisional agreement with the OCC was reached in November. The Official Creditor Committee (OCC), led by Japan, France and India, covers about 5.9 billion of Sri Lankas outstanding external debt of 37 billion, according to the countrys finance ministry. The Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) covers about 4 billion of outstanding debt, latest government data showed. Among bilateral creditors, Sri Lanka owed China 4.7 billion with debt to India standing at 1.74 billion. Japan, a part of the Paris Club group, was owed 2.68 billion. China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral lender, is not an official member of the OCC. Commercial loans, comprising of sovereign bonds and other time-bound loans, accounted for 14.73 billion. A 2.9 billion bailout programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) secured in March last year helped Sri Lanka stabilise economic conditions. In April, Sri Lanka rejected an initial bondholder proposal to restructure more than 12 billion in debt. Formal negotiations with the international private creditors are set to resume imminently after a group of bondholders signed non-disclosure agreements late last week. The country owed about 10.9 billion to multilateral banks. Sri Lanka has debt outstanding of 6.2 billion to the ADB and owes 4.3 billion to the World Bank but the country is not restructuring multilateral debt. The debt restructuring is crucial for Sri Lanka to reach a 2.3 primary budget surplus by 2025, the key fiscal target set by the IMF. Once the debt restructuring is completed, Sri Lanka hopes to reduce its overall debt by 16.9 billion. --With Agencies Inputs",

The petition, filed by 21 plantation companies including Agarapatana Plantations Ltd., was taken up for consideration before Justice Sobhitha Rajakaruna today (31). The petitioners have named 52 individuals including Minister of Labor Manusha Nanayakkara and the Labor Commissioner as respondents of the case. The petitioning plantation companies point out that the Minister of Labor has issued a gazette notification setting the minimum daily wage of a plantation worker at Rs. 1,350, together with an allowance of Rs. 300 and another allowance of Rs. 80, as minimum wage. The petitioners claim that the decision taken by the Minister of Labor without consulting them, violates the legal principle of natural justice. Accordingly, the petitioners seek an order invalidating the decision, claiming that the decision was made arbitrarily by the government.",

        "content": "NATOs 32 nations on Wednesday appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliances next head, handing him the job at a crucial moment with Russia on the march in Ukraine and American elections looming. Rutte will take over from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on October 1 after major powers  spearheaded by the United States  wrapped up his nomination ahead of a summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. I warmly welcome NATO Allies choice of Mark Rutte as my successor. Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader and a consensus-builder, Stoltenberg said on social media after NATO ambassadors approved the appointment. I know I am leaving NATO in good hands, he added. The seasoned Dutch leader, whose 14-year tenure in charge of the Netherlands is set to end within weeks, is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of stewarding the 75-year-old alliance through perilous times. While the 57-year-old faces the specter of a possible return by former US president Donald Trump to the White House, Rutte will also have to grapple with the threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. After staking a claim for the NATO post following the collapse of his coalition last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary. He finally clinched the race for the top job last week when sole challenger Romanian President Klaus Iohannis dropped out.

Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte (R) greets NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during the NATO summit, in Vilnius on July 11, 2023 (Ludovic MarinAFP) After staking a claim for the NATO post following the collapse of his coalition last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary. He finally clinched the race for the top job last week when sole challenger Romanian President Klaus Iohannis dropped out. Back Ukraine, tame Trump? A staunch supporter of Ukraine, the straight-talking Dutchman has spearheaded a push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets to help fight off Russias invasion. As NATO chief he will play a key role in marshaling weary allies to keep backing the war-torn country  while treading a fine line over Kyivs push to join. The Kremlins 2022 assault on Ukraine has reinvigorated an alliance that often struggled for purpose after the end of the Cold War, and pushed European nations to up their defense spending. Rutte will now have to ensure NATO is fighting fit to deal with the threat Moscow will pose for years to come, and also keep a keen eye on the growing might of China. Most testing, however, could be the challenge of keeping the alliance together if Trump reclaims the presidency. Trump reportedly mulled pulling the military superpower out of NATO during his first term  only to be talked down by world leaders, including Rutte. On the campaign trail this time around, the volatile former reality TV star has rattled allies by saying hed encourage Moscow to attack countries not spending enough on defense. It is not just the US that is facing political uncertainty  with crunch polls also coming up in other key countries like France. From his many years in Dutch politics and on the international stage, Rutte is an adroit balancer of political relationships, said Philippe Dickinson from the Atlantic Council think tank. This political savvy will be put to the test to an unprecedented extent in the years ahead. Rutte will look to learn from his predecessor Stoltenberg, who has headed NATO through its most consequential decade since the Cold War ended. The unflappable former Norwegian prime minister won plaudits for maintaining unity and strengthening NATO through a tumultuous period. Rutte will be the fourth Dutchman to head the alliance since it was founded in the ashes of World War II to face off against the Soviet Union.

        "content": "OkSeven content-licensing sellers of music, image, video and other datasets for use in training artificial intelligence systems have formed the sectors first trade group, they said on Wednesday. The Dataset Providers Alliance (DPA) will advocate for ethical data sourcing in the training of AI systems, including rights for people depicted in datasets and the protection of content owners intellectual property rights, the companies said in a statement. Founding members include U.S. music dataset company Rightsify, image licensing service vAIsual, Japanese stock photo provider Pixta and Germany-based data marketplace Datarade. The emergence of generative AI technologies that can mimic human creativity in recent years has triggered an outcry from content creators and a string of copyright lawsuits against tech companies like Google, Meta and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft. Developers have been training models by feeding them vast quantities of content, much of it scraped from the internet for free without the consent of those who created the works or own rights to them. Tech companies, which claim the usage is legal, are also quietly paying for access to private collections of content both to fulfill needs for particular types of data and to hedge against legal and regulatory risks. The prospect that demand for licensed data will grow if copyright owners prevail in their legal fights has prompted the emergence of a nascent industry of companies that package content and sell access to it for use by AI systems. As a result, groups have been formed to establish ethical standards for that trade, like Fairly Trained, a non-profit founded this year which certifies models that have not used copyrighted materials without a license. The DPA targets the content of those transactions, requiring, for example, that its members agree not to sell text data obtained by crawling the web or audio that features peoples voices without their explicit consent. A heavy focus will be to push for legislation like the NO FAKES Act, a U.S. bill introduced last year to create penalties for generating unauthorized digital replicas of peoples voices or likenesses, said Alex Bestall, CEO of Rightsify and its licensing subsidiary GCX, who led the founding of the group. Advocacy will be a big part of it because everyones taken their positions on AI and copyright, but a lot of these battles are yet to be solved and its going to take a while for them to be, said Bestall. The DPA also will press for more training data transparency requirements like those in the European Unions AI Act and a similar U.S. bill introduced in April, the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act, he added.

        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says that he met the Chinese Vice Minister of Finance, Liao Min in Paris and the final agreement has been reached on debt treatment between Sri Lanka and Export Import Bank of China. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Semasinghe stated that the formalities for signing of the implementing agreements are under way. Meanwhile, earlier today, Sri Lanka had also reached a final restructuring agreement for USD 5.8 billion of debt with its bilateral lenders Official Creditor Committee in Paris, France. This agreement grants significant debt relief, allowing Sri Lanka to allocate funds to essential public services and secure concessional financing for its development needs, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Sri Lankas finance ministry said in November that the debt restructuring agreement in principle covered approximately 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and involved a mix of extending the maturity of long-term borrowings and reducing interest rates on the credit. The majority of the debt is owed to Japan and India, which chair the OCC along with France. A provisional agreement with the OCC was reached in November. The Official Creditor Committee (OCC), led by Japan, France and India, covers about 5.9 billion of Sri Lankas outstanding external debt of 37 billion, according to the countrys finance ministry. The Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) covers about 4 billion of outstanding debt, latest government data showed. Among bilateral creditors, Sri Lanka owed China 4.7 billion with debt to India standing at 1.74 billion. Japan, a part of the Paris Club group, was owed 2.68 billion. China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral lender, is not an official member of the OCC. Meanwhile, the total value of debt restructuring agreements that Sri Lanka reached today with creditor nations, including Official Creditor Committee and with EXIM bank of China is USD 10 billion. They will provide up to 92 relief on debt repayments during International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program.",

        "date": "June 26, 2024 06:11 pm",
        "content": "The union that represents most behind-the-scenes film and television crews has reached a tentative deal with studios for about 50,000 of its members, making another major, production-stopping strike unlikely after a year of labor turmoil in Hollywood. The two sides announced the three-year deal in a joint statement Tuesday night. The union, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, said in an email to members, who still must vote to approve the deal, that the agreement includes the pay hikes and artificial intelligence protections they had been vying for. The contract, known as the Basic Agreement, affects about 50,000 crew members who belong to 13 different West Coast-based union locals, including art directors, set painters, editors, camera technicians, costume designers, hair stylists and make-up artists. A separate agreement that affects about 20,000 crew members across the country is still under negotiation. Last years grueling writers and actors strikes, and 2021 IATSE talks that went well past the contracts expiration and nearly spilled into a strike, had raised fears that 2024 would bring more work stoppages in an industry that still hasnt gotten entirely back to work after being shut down for much of 2023. Actors including Mark Ruffalo and Kerry Washington sent a letter to the AMPTP last week urging a fair contract for crews. Several individual branches had already reached separate agreements on the issues unique to them. The Basic Agreement affects crew members across different jobs. IATSE reached Tuesday nights deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents studios, streaming services and production companies including Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Amazon Prime. Its the same alliance that struggled to reach a deal with writers and actors during prolonged strikes last year. But the tentative Basic Agreement agreement comes nearly a month before the previous contract expired. The letter to IATSE members said more details on the tentative deal will be released later in the week, but it includes new protections around Artificial Intelligence, including language that ensures no employee is required to provide AI prompts in any manner that would result in the displacement of any covered employee. It also includes scale rate increases of 7, 4, and 3.5 over the three-year term, triple time for workers who surpass 15 hours in a day, and payments from studios to help make up for a shortfall in the unions health insurance budget, the letter said.

        "date": "June 26, 2024 08:04 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that today marks an important day in the countrys recent history and a unique turning point, as Sri Lanka reached final restructuring agreements for its external debt owed to bilateral creditors. Delivering a special address to the nation on Wednesday (26) evening, the Head of State said that the country is benefitting from the positive results of the hard work carried out by the government in the recent past. He said that this morning, Sri Lanka reached a final restructuring agreement for USD 5.8 billion of debt with its bilateral lenders Official Creditor Committee in Paris, France. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka today also signed debt treatment agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) in Beijing to restructure USD 4.2 billion of debt. He stated that the necessary formal procedures are currently being implemented. For those who truly love the country, this is a good news. Sri Lanka won, he declared in the televised speech. Wickremesinghe states that as Sri Lanka has reached agreements with the bilateral creditors, the international trust in the country will be increased. This is an international assurance in a certain way, Wickremesinghe expressed. The international communities, who didnt even accept the letters of credit from us, are now at a situation which gives us a certification of trust, he added. Commenting further, the Head of the State highlighted that both the agreements reached today will be tabled in the Parliament by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena during the special parliamentary session to be convened on July 02. I urge all the members representing the Parliament, who are patriotic to the country to help pass these agreements in Parliament, said the President. Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe emphasized that the country cannot find solutions to the economic issues through strikes or threats, but by joining hands for strengthening the economy. In his special statement, President Wickremesinghe announced that debt restructuring agreements will postpone all bilateral loan payments to foreign countries until 2028. Additionally, Sri Lanka will have until 2043 to repay these loans on concessional terms, he said. The President also highlighted that in 2022, Sri Lanka allocated 9.2 of its GDP to foreign debt payments. However, with ongoing efforts, this percentage is expected to decrease to less than 4.5 between 2027 and 2032, reflecting significant fiscal improvement, he said. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that following Sri Lankas official declaration of its inability to repay loans, all transactions and foreign-funded development projects were suspended. He emphasized that the successful debt restructuring now paves the way to resume these projects and transactions. Emphasizing that agreements with bilateral creditors bolster international trust in Sri Lanka, the President noted that the global community, which previously rejected the countrys Letters of Credit, now offers assurances regarding Sri Lankas credibility. Wickremesinghe said that Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena will present these agreements to Parliament on July 2nd, and urged all patriotic MPs to help ratify them. He also expressed gratitude to all parties involved, including ministers, officials and the majority of the people who patiently supported the country through challenging times. President Wickremesinghe stated that while a few are trying to disrupt the countrys progress, they will one day have to face shame before their children for betraying their nation. The President noted that as the countrys economic conditions improved, relief was provided to the people. He emphasized that continuing on the correct path to strengthen the economy can further alleviate existing difficulties, adding that issues cannot be resolved through protests and threats Wickremesinghe stated that he accepted the challenge unconditionally when some people proposed various conditions to rescue the country from its economic abyss. He expressed confidence in his ability to rebuild the economy through his experience, planned policies, commitment, and capacity to garner international support. Following is the full special statement delivered by the President: Today marks a significant milestone in the recent history of our country, a special juncture reflecting the hard work and dedication of our efforts. Our country is now reaping the positive results of our persistent endeavours over the past years. This morning in Paris, Sri Lanka reached a final agreement with our official bilateral creditors. Similarly, we signed another agreement with Chinas Exim Bank today in Beijing. This is indeed encouraging news for those who genuinely care about our countrys welfare. Sri Lanka won.!! Over the past two years, we have worked diligently to reach agreements with our bilateral creditors, engaging in extensive discussions. The economic progress we have achieved has provided us with considerable strength in these negotiations. I extend my gratitude to our creditors, including China and Exim Bank of China, India, Japan, and France, who co-chair the Official Creditors Committee. I also thank the other members of the committee and the Paris Club Secretariat for their support in making these negotiations successful. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the representatives of Sri Lanka and other countries who participated in these discussions, as well as the officials from Lazard and Clifford Chance for their valuable advice. With these agreements, we will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, we will have the opportunity to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043. In 2023, we successfully completed the restructuring of domestic debt. Now, we have also successfully concluded the bilateral debt restructuring with foreign countries. Our next objective is to reach an agreement with commercial creditors, which includes International Sovereign Bond (ISB) holders. By continuing on our current path, we are confident that we can achieve this agreement, and discussions are on-going. The agreements we reached today will provide significant relief to our economy. In 2022, we spent 9.2 of our gross domestic product (GDP) on foreign debt payments. With the new agreements, it will pave the way for us to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 of GDP between 2027 and 2032. The governments annual gross fiscal requirement was 34.6 of GDP in 2022. Due to these agreements, this requirement will decrease by more than 13 by the period of 2027-2032. In April 2022, Sri Lanka officially declared its inability to meet its debt obligations. Following this declaration, international business transactions with Sri Lanka came to a halt. No country is willing to engage in financial relations with a nation that is bankrupt and unable to pay its debts. Consequently, we were unable to secure loans or even obtain letters of credit. Against this backdrop, all projects in our country funded by foreign loans were halted. The countries involved closed their project offices and withdrew. Consequently, development work came to a complete standstill. However, now that we have achieved a crucial milestone in debt restructuring, there are legal opportunities for these countries to resume all projects funded by foreign loans. Projects such as the development of Katunayake Airport, the light railway, and the expressway are set to recommence. Moreover, we can look forward to initiating many new development projects. International confidence in our country is reaffirmed as bilateral creditors have reached an agreement with us, serving as a kind of international endorsement. The global community, which previously refused to accept our letters of credit, is now prepared to grant us a certificate of confidence. We are presenting both agreements to Parliament. Our Prime Minister will introduce these agreements in a special parliamentary session on July 02nd. I urge all patriotic members of Parliament to ratify these agreements. The journey to this point has not been easy. We have travelled a difficult and arduous path. Our ministers and officials have worked tirelessly towards this goal. The majority of our citizens have supported us with patience and resilience, enduring various hardships. Despite the on-going challenges, we have persevered. A few individuals attempted to disrupt our progress and continue to do so, but they have not succeeded in halting our journey. In the future, these detractors will face the shame of having betrayed their country. As our economy improves, we have provided concessions in a manner that does not harm our economic stability. This approach will continue. By following the correct path, as our economy strengthens, we can gradually alleviate current difficulties. The burden we carry can now be incrementally reduced. Strikes and threats will not resolve these issues. By uniting to strengthen the economy, we will find solutions and obtain further concessions. When we assumed responsibility for the country two years ago, I emphasized that we had a very challenging path ahead. I made it clear that these problems could not be resolved within a week, a few months, or even a year. Using the metaphor from the play The Caucasian Chalk Circle, I illustrated that we had to navigate a precarious journey across a metaphorical fallen vine bridge over a terrifying, bottomless chasm. At that time, our countrys economy was in a dire state. Many were hesitant to step forward to help rescue the nation. There was fear and reluctance. Some said, You need more than just effort to treat this situation. One faction stated they would take charge only if given control of the entire government. Another group said they would accept if allowed to appoint their own people to the cabinet. Others indicated they would accept the presidency if it were offered to them. Despite these conditions, I accepted the challenge without any preconditions. I believed in my ability to save our country and its people from the economic abyss. I had a comprehensive work plan and a deep understanding of the strategies that other nations had employed to emerge from similar crises. Furthermore, I had faith that with my planned policies and dedication, the economy could be revitalized. I was confident that I could garner international support for our recovery efforts. That was all I had. I had no Members of Parliament. I did not have my own cabinet. I did not have a government to call my own. Despite these challenges, I accepted the daunting task. At that critical juncture, I recalled a quote from the renowned creator Walt Disney: The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. Without hesitation, I got down to business. On August 3, 2022, during the opening address of the parliamentary session, I unveiled to the nation a four-step plan to reconstruct the faltering economy. 1. Securing extended credit facilities in consultation with the International Monetary Fund and instituting fiscal discipline nationwide. 2. Collaborating with international financial and legal experts from Lazard and Clifford Chance to formulate a debt stabilization plan and negotiate agreements with creditors. 3. Implementing policies, regulations, and initiatives to attract foreign investment, bolster the export economy, and promote a digital green economy. 4. Aiming to transform into a developed nation with a debt-free advanced economy by 2048 through this comprehensive program. Throughout this process, I consistently presented detailed updates on our strategic roadmap to Parliament, ensuring transparency in every step. The successful advancement of the first three components of our four-pronged program validates the correctness of our approach and strategy. Achieving such significant progress within two years, from a state of debt inability and near-bankruptcy, marks a remarkable milestone. Historically, countries facing economic crises similar to ours have taken much longer to achieve such positive outcomes. This achievement stands as a testament to our dedication and the effectiveness of our initiatives. We possessed a clear understanding of the depth of the economic crisis we faced and were equipped with the appropriate solutions guided by vision, determination, and unwavering commitment. As a result of our resolute efforts, it is now evident that we are on course to achieve our fourth objective: transforming into a developed country by 2048. Reflecting on the state of our nation in 2022, which was grappling with severe economic challenges, what is the present status?  After six consecutive quarters of economic contraction, our economy began to grow again starting from the third quarter of 2023.  Our foreign reserves, which had plummeted, have rebounded to USD 5500 million by April 2022. The strength of the rupee has increased, and bank interest rates have declined.  Inflation, which had soared to 70 per cent in September 2022, has now been reduced to a manageable 0.9 per cent.  We have achieved a surplus in the primary account balance, and for the first time since 1977, a current account surplus has been achieved in our foreign account balance. These milestones underscore our successful navigation away from bankruptcy through effective economic management. The recognition and support received from our official creditors for restructuring our debt have reinstated international confidence in our nation. This reaffirms that the path we have charted is not only correct but also endorsed internationally. On that occasion, I extended an invitation to all political parties and groups to prioritize the national interest and support the program I presented to Parliament. While some political parties have responded positively and joined me in this collective effort, others have chosen to criticize. It is pertinent to address these criticisms. During President Gotabayas tenure, those who previously insisted that the IMF was the only solution are now asserting that the IMF should not be approached. Those who argued that economic improvements were futile amidst public suffering are now promising extravagant benefits upon assuming power. Certain individuals engage in populist or partisan rhetoric, displaying a limited understanding of economic and political dynamics beyond elementary levels. Despite my consistent efforts to highlight the gravity of our challenges and propose solutions since assuming office, some individuals still fail to grasp the seriousness of our situation. Since assuming leadership, I have implemented numerous measures to rebuild our nation. It has taken nearly two years for some to acknowledge the wisdom of those decisions. It may require additional time for them to recognize the validity of the current steps I am undertaking. Nevertheless, those who persist in empty rhetoric will continue to do so. Allow me to clarify an important point: Sri Lanka has sought IMF assistance on sixteen previous occasions, each ending in failure. Why? We consistently failed to meet the conditions set, neglected our commitments, and lacked financial discipline. This marks the first instance in our nations history where an IMF program has been successfully implemented. Previously, in sixteen instances, we approached the IMF not from a position of inability to repay debts, but as a country facing bankruptcy. Leading this successful endeavour to seek assistance fills me with satisfaction. However, our journey does not end here; this is only a juncture in our journey. We should start anew from here. We have received international assurances and we have once again gained international trust. We should make use of this and forge ahead towards a developed economy. We should achieve complete success, ensuring that our country never again finds itself in need of IMF support. This objective drives our efforts to establish a robust and disciplined advanced economy that can sustain itself independently. To achieve this, my cabinet, our government, and I are diligently working and demonstrating tangible results. In contrast, some critics from various political groups appear more focused on gaining power. These groups, eyeing future electoral victories, have already envisioned presidential appointments and speculated about cabinet compositions. Reports suggest some individuals are even contemplating familial succession within ministerial positions. How many among these aspiring leaders have misled the nation with false promises and press conferences? The falsehoods propagated about the accomplishments I highlight today are now exposed for what they area fabrication. Why do they react with such disdain to our nations achievements? Why do they view good news for the country as inauspicious? Why do they seek to capitalize politically on every development? Their actions reveal a culture of opportunism, driven solely by ambitions for personal gain and political positioning. While they vie for presidential positions, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the countrys development and progress. Their dreams revolve around titles and accolades; ours are anchored in advancing the nation. They strategize to divide ministries; we strategize to advance the nation. They traverse Sri Lanka seeking power, visiting schools and traveling the world in relentless pursuit of authority. Meanwhile, I dedicate my days and nights to serving the country, addressing the needs of our people, and launching economic strengthening programs. I engage globally to garner international support for our nations development. Given this context, I pose a crucial question: Will you move forward with me, who comprehended the problem from its inception, offered practical solutions, and delivered results? Or will you align with those grappling in the dark, still struggling to grasp the issues? Will you stay the course towards a brighter future for yourself and the nation? Or will you opt for a different path? We are all aware of the perils of veering off course or choosing the wrong path. Therefore, make the right decision. You have the full right and freedom to make that choice. The future does not merely belong to Ranil Wickremesinghe; it pertains to the country, to your future, and the future of our children. In just two years, without a parliamentary majority, without my appointed government officials or ministers, I successfully elevated our country from bankruptcy and economic turmoil to a position that astonished the world. Consider this reflection: Two years ago, as we walked down the street, what did we see? Today, as we walk down that same street, what do we see now? I made a promise that day, and I have safely guided the child named Mother Sri Lanka through treacherous waters. What has transpired since then? Much like the tale of The Caucasian Chalk Circle, those who once hesitated to shield the child during difficult times, those who offered no support, now clamour to claim the childs rights. Even before we have crossed the perilous vine bridge, they vie to seize the child, tugging in every direction. Yet, as we know from the Caucasian Chalk Circle, the rightful claim to the child belongs to the true mother. In the words of Grusha from the play: Things should belong to those who do well by them, Wagons to good drivers that they may be well driven Therefore, akin to Judge Azdak in Hunuwataya (The Caucasian Chalk Circle) drama, I urge you to make the right decision. Let the deserving receive their due. Let our country stride confidently towards a brighter future. Thank you.",

Earlier in the day, military units led by General Juan Jose Zuniga, recently stripped of his military command, had gathered in the central Plaza Murillo square, home to the presidential palace and Congress. A Reuters witness saw an armored vehicle ram a door of the presidential palace and soldiers rush in. Today the country is facing an attempted coup détat. Today the country faces once again interests so that democracy in Bolivia is cut short, Arce said in comments from the presidential palace, with armed soldiers outside. The Bolivian people are summoned today. We need the Bolivian people to organize and mobilize against the coup détat in favor of democracy. A few hours later, a Reuters witness saw soldiers withdraw from the square and police take control of the plaza. Bolivian authorities arrested Zuniga and took him away, though their destination was unclear. Inside the presidential palace, Arce swore in José Wilson Sanchez as the military commander, Zunigas former role. He called for calm and order to be restored. I order that all personnel mobilized on the streets return to their units, Sanchez said. We entreat that the blood of our soldiers not be spilled. The United States said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged calm and restraint. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 09:18 am",
        "content": "India on Wednesday welcomed Sri Lankas debt restructuring agreement with a group of creditor nations and said it will continue to support the island nations economic recovery, including by promoting long-term investments. India is one of the co-chairs of the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) that was formed in April last year to finalise a plan for restructuring Sri Lankas debt. The Sri Lankan government said it has finalised a long-delayed debt restructuring agreement for USD 5.8 billion with its bilateral lenders, including India and China. After several rounds of engagements, the OCC signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on debt restructuring on June 26, Indias Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. It said this milestone demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilising its economy and moving towards reform and growth. As one of the co-chairs of the OCC, along with France and Japan, India has been steadfast in its commitment to the stabilisation, recovery and growth of the Sri Lankan economy, it said. This was also demonstrated by Indias unprecedented financial support of USD 4 billion to Sri Lanka. India was also the first creditor nation to convey financing assurances to IMF (International Monetary Fund) which paved the way for Sri Lanka to secure the IMF programme, the MEA said in a statement. It said, India will continue to support Sri Lankas economic recovery including by promoting long-term investments in its key economic sectors. Following the approval by the IMF for the Extended Fund Facility (EFF programme) for Sri Lanka on March 20 last year, the OCC was launched to hold talks among the island nations bilateral creditors to finalise a plan for restructuring its debt. Sri Lanka witnessed a severe economic crisis in 2022. The fall in its foreign exchange reserves prompted the country to default on foreign debt.

        "date": "June 27, 2024 11:52 am",
        "content": "Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses. The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds. A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat. Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough. U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution. He also said jurors saw through Hernandezs polished demeanor during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense. They saw him for what he was: a two-faced politician hungry for power, Castel said in Manhattan federal court. Hernandez led Honduras, a U.S. ally in Central America, from 2014 to 2022. Prosecutors said he facilitated shipments of at least 400 tons of cocaine to the United States, fueling addiction and violence. They also said Hernandez used drug money to bribe officials and manipulate voting during Honduras 2013 and 2017 presidential elections. The defendant fed this never-ending cycle of drug trafficking and corruption that tore his country apart, prosecutor Jacob Gutwillig said on Wednesday. Hernandez denied taking bribes and said he fought the cartels during his presidency. Wearing olive green prison clothing at his sentencing hearing, Hernandez said he had been wrongfully convicted. He singled out testimony from several convicted traffickers who testified that they bribed him, saying they were trying to reduce their own punishments and exact revenge. Despite everything done to me, which is an outrage and a lynching, I am an optimist and I know that the truth will be known later, Hernandez told Castel through a Spanish interpreter prior to being sentenced. After being sentenced, he faced journalists seated in the jury box and said soy inocente, Spanish for I am innocent. He used a cane as U.S. marshals led him out of the courtroom. Hernandez has been jailed in Brooklyns Metropolitan Detention Center since his April 2022 extradition from Tegucigalpa. Castel said he would let Hernandez stay there for now while he appeals. Hernandezs younger brother, Tony Hernandez, was sentenced to life in prison in March 2021 following his conviction on drug charges. He has been imprisoned in California. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 12:48 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Navy says that the 10 Indian fishermen who were arrested while poaching in Sri Lankan waters off Kankesanthurai in the early hours of Tuesday (25) will also face charges for causing the death of a naval person and for causing damage to naval property. The Sri Lanka Navy had conducted a special operation off Kankesanthurai, Jaffna in the wee hours of June 25, to seize an Indian fishing trawler poaching in Sri Lankan waters. During this operation, a senior sailor from the Navy Special Boat Squadron sustained critical injuries due to the aggressive manoeuvres of the Indian trawler, resisting its seizure, the navy said. Unfortunately, the senior sailor succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. The seized Indian trawler along with the 10 Indian fishermen were brought to the Kankesanthurai Harbour and they were handed over to the Kankesanthurai Police for onward legal proceedings. The Kankesanthurai Police has filed a B report with the Mallakam Court in Jaffna, seeking prosecution of ten Indian fishermen. They face charges for illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters, causing the death of a naval person during the operation and for causing damage to naval property, the navy said. On 25th June, the Jaffna Magistrate conducted a post-mortem examination of the deceased senior sailor. The examination determined that the sailors death was an accident, resulting from spinal code damage. The body of the deceased senior sailor was handed over to the next of kin for last rites last morning (26) while his funeral ceremony is scheduled to be held today (27) in Ibbagamuwa with full honours of the Navy. Following the tragic loss of this senior sailor during active duty, the Commander of the Navy posthumously promoted him to the rate of Fleet Chief Petty Officer, the navy media unit said. Sri Lanka Navy has also ensured that all necessary arrangements have been made for his family to receive the appropriate compensations and allowances, it said. The Magistrate of Mallakam Court on Wednesday (26) conducted an on-site inspection at Kankesanthurai Port. The inspection had focused on the Indian fishing vessel detained by the Navy and the Navys Fast Attack Craft, which was damaged during the operation. Meanwhile, the initial hearing of the case over this incident is scheduled for July 22 at the Mallakam Nmagistrates Court, Jaffna.",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 01:00 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera, announced that a national week for the implementation of the Youth Agri-Entrepreneurship Village Program will be held from July 01st to 07th. He also stated that the government has decided to provide free MOP fertilizer for paddy cultivation to farmers for the next two seasons. Minister Amaraweera made these remarks during a press briefing themed Collective Path to a Stable Country, held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (26). Addressing the press briefing, the minister further elaborated that the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries has launched various programs to attract youth to the agriculture sector and as part of this effort, 160 villages across the 25 districts in the country have been selected to become Youth Agri-Entrepreneurship Villages. To support this initiative, a national week for the Youth Agri-Entrepreneurship Village Program will be held from July 01 to 07. In the first phase, Rs. 10 million will be allocated for projects in each village, totalling Rs. 1,600 million, he said. In 2022, the country faced a rice shortage and had to import 800,000 metric tons of rice and the government had to spend about USD 300 million. However, in 2023, the country was able to produce its entire rice requirement. For 2024, the national rice requirement is 4.1 million metric tons, and the total rice production in 2023 was 4.5 million metric tons, Amaraweera said. Our goal is to double rice cultivation over the next five cropping seasons. To achieve this, we are introducing a technical package for paddy cultivation, said the minister. He added that in order to increase the productivity of paddy cultivation, special programs will be implemented to boost rice yield across 100,000 hectares in various areas. Recent years have seen an increase in crop damage due to climatic effects, he pointed out. Minister Amaraweera further stated that they have not yet achieved self-sufficiency in egg and milk production. Poultry and cattle farming have been impacted by the decline in maize production used for animal feed, resulting from the fertilizer shortage in 2021. The national maize requirement in the country is 600,000 metric tons. In the Maha season of 2023, maize production increased to 221,249 metric tons. He further said: We have launched a new program to boost egg production. In the next two months, 160,000 chicks will be distributed to entrepreneurs in 160 Youth Agri-Entrepreneurship Villages. Additionally, we are addressing the rise in the price of coconut oil in the market. Currently, the government charges Rs.150 per liter of imported coconut oil. As the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, I will propose a reduction of this amount to the Cabinet. The Coconut Development Authority states that the countrys annual coconut oil requirement is 25,868 metric tons, and currently, there are 51,457 metric tons of coconut oil available. Furthermore, the increase in fertilizer prices has impacted other crops, including paddy. As a result, we requested the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to obtain MOP fertilizer. The organization has agreed to supply 55,000 metric tons of MOP fertilizer. The government will distribute fertilizer free of charge to farmers for paddy cultivation for the upcoming two seasons. Additionally, we have arranged fertilizer subsidies used in tea cultivation. Government-owned fertilizer companies are producing tea fertilizer and offering it at a 50 discount compared to market prices. The expenditure on this fertilizer subsidy amounts to Rs.12 billion, said Minister Amaraweera. --PMD",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 01:07 pm",
        "content": "Kenyas President William Ruto says he will withdraw a finance bill containing controversial tax hikes after deadly protests which saw parliament set ablaze on Tuesday. In an address to the nation, he said it was clear that Kenyans want nothing to do with the bill. I concede, he said, adding that he would not sign the bill into law. At least 22 people were killed in Tuesdays protests, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHRC). Mr Ruto said he would now enter into dialogue with the young people, who were at the forefront of the biggest protests to hit the country since he was elected in 2022. The bill was passed by parliament on Tuesday, despite nationwide demonstrations against it. Protesters broke into parliament, vandalising the interior and setting parts of the complex on fire. The ceremonial mace, symbolising the authority of the legislature, was stolen. Mr Ruto initially responded with defiance. He ordered the military to be deployed, saying violence and anarchy would not be tolerated. But he climbed down on Wednesday, following an extraordinary demonstration of people power. Ruto bows to Gen Z pressure, withdraws Finance Bill, read the headline on Kenyas Citizen TV. In his second address to the nation in less than 24 hours, Mr Ruto laid out a very clear rationale for why he thought the tax increases were necessary. The proposed legislation was part of efforts to cut the countrys massive debt burden of more than 80bn (63bn), which costs the country more than half of its annual tax revenues to service. Mr Ruto added that his government had made progress and was on course to assert sovereignty by repaying its debts. He said the provisions would have benefitted farmers, students and teachers, but he admitted the people were not behind him. I also lead people, he said, and the people have spoken. It is unclear clear how his climbdown will affect plans to resume the protests, which have largely been organised via social media, on Thursday. Chatter on social media suggested that it would still go ahead. The stated purpose of the demonstrations was to force the president not to sign the bill. But the protesters have begun demanding that he step down, with the slogan Ruto must go. Mr Ruto rose to the presidency after defeating his main rival Raila Odinga by a narrow margin in the 2022 election. He got 50.5 of the vote, to Mr Odingas 48.8. Mr Ruto won after portraying himself as a hustler who was challenging an attempt by two dynasties - the Odingas and Kenyattas - to hang on to power. He promised a bottom-up approach to the economy to tackle the high unemployment rate among young people, and to improve the lives of those less well off. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has issued an interim order preventing the implementation of Gazette notification issued by Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, which de-gazetted a section of the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve in Wilpattu to allocate it for a prawn farm project. The Supreme Court issued this order while allowing the hearing of a petition filed by several environmental organizations. The order stated that this interim order will remain in effect until the hearing of the petition is concluded. In May, an extraordinary gazette had been issued de-gazetting a section of the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve to set up an aquaculture industrial park. The aquaculture industrial park will reportedly be used for the farming of various species including marine finfish, crabs and exotic species of shrimp in a Public Private Partnership. The gazette issued by Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, had noted that the area specified in the appendix of the gazette will no longer be designated as part of the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve. However, several environmental groups including the Center for Environmental Justice (CEJ) had filed a petition with the Supreme Court challenging the governments decision. The countrys third largest Marine Protected Area, Vidataltivu Nature Reserve, close to the Vankalai Sanctuary, was declared a Nature Reserve by Gazette 195613 on March 1, 2016 and covers 29,000 hectares. This followed the area being identified as needing protection by the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Northern Province conducted in 2012.",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 03:03 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of teachers being present in schools during school hours for the education of the nations children. He warned that if this commitment is not upheld in the future and school children are deprived of their education as a result, necessary measures will be taken to designate the teaching profession as an essential service, the Presidents Media Division reported. President Wickremesinghe mentioned this during his visit to the Asgiri Maha Viharaya. The President received blessings from the Most Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Maha Nayaka Thero, the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya Chapter. President Wickremesinghe also participated in a cordial conversation with the Maha Nayaka Thero. The President emphasized that teachers and principals should be role models for children and prioritize their future. He highlighted the need to consider the impact on children when teachers participate in protests and strikes, stressing the importance of their ability to provide guidance and advice to students. The President clarified that this crisis does not affect the entire teaching profession. He noted that information received indicates only certain politically aligned teachers are involved, attributing the damage to the entire profession to the actions of this specific group. Highlighting that this situation is confined to Sinhalese schools, the President commended Tamil, Muslim, and private schools for ensuring uninterrupted education for children. President Wickremesinghe also mentioned that reports have indicated school guards are sending the children home, and he has directed the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to enforce the law in response to these incidents. President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the historic Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, this morning (27). During his visit, the President paid homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic and received blessings. Upon his arrival, he was warmly welcomed by the Chief Custodian, Diyawadana Nilame Nilanga Dela. The Maha Sangha recited Seth Pirith and blessed the President as he participated in religious ceremonies at the Dalada Maligawa. During his visit, the President inspected statues of a king and a queen crafted by artist Atula Herath using Artificial Intelligence technology at the Dalada Maligawa premises. While at the historic Sri Dalada Maligawa premises, the President engaged in cordial conversation with the people present, inquiring about their well-being. The Presidents first stop in Kandy was at the Malwatu Maha Vihara, where he received blessings from the Chief Prelate of the Malwathu Chapter, Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Mahanayaka Thera. The President inquired about the Chief Prelates well-being and held a brief discussion. This is President Wickremesinghes first visit to the Chief Prelates following his special statement yesterday. During this visit, he also presented the Mahanayakas with the Greater Kandy Urban Development Plan. In response to the Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Mahanayaka Theras request to address the demands of protesting groups, the President assured that a formal system will be established to increase the salaries of government officials, ensuring no salary disparities prevail, starting in 2025. The President highlighted that the Cabinet has focused on increasing the salaries of government officials and announced that a committee has been appointed to address this matter. He further commented: Upon assuming office as President, my priority was to visit here first. Following your guidance, we have stabilized the country and averted bankruptcy. Today, my foremost objective is to update you on these developments. We have successfully concluded two agreements and will proceed with foreign debt restructuring until 2032. Teachers will be provided with the necessary means to increase their salaries again next year, and we have already communicated this to them. Before proceeding with the salary increments for teachers, we must also consider adjusting the salaries of other government officials. In 2022, teachers experienced salary increases ranging from LKR 3,000 to 17,000. On average, this equates to about six to seven thousand rupees. Additionally, this year they received an additional LKR 10,000 increase, resulting in total raises ranging from LKR 13,000 to 27,000 for teachers. Hence, the salaries of other government officials need to be deliberated upon accordingly. Currently, Tamil and Muslim schools are operational, whereas only Sinhala schools engage in such trade union actions. This matter has garnered the Cabinets attention, leading to plans to implement a unified approach to increase government officials salaries starting from 2025. A committee has been tasked with studying and recommending appropriate measures in this regard. Furthermore, under the Kandy city development plan, the administrative city is slated for relocation to Kundasale. Discussions are underway regarding the establishment of an Indian IIT University in Kandy, along with plans for a new building complex at Peradeniya University. Concurrently, initiatives such as the Aswasuma and Urumaya programs have been undertaken to provide relief to the population. Following this, the President proceeded to the Asgiri Maha Vihara and received blessings from the Most Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayaka Thera, the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya Chapter. President Wickremesinghe also engaged in a cordial conversation with the Chief Prelate. President Wickremesinghe further added: The reconstruction of this nation cannot proceed solely through traditional political divisions. If we continue to operate along these lines, economic recovery within two years will remain unattainable. Various factions from all parliamentary parties have supported us in bringing the country to its current state, while segments of each party have also moved into opposition. Had the entire parliament collaborated with the government, our nation could have achieved far better outcomes. I have extended an invitation to all parliamentarians to join the governments economic revitalization program. Globally, political landscapes are evolving; major parties in nations like England, America, and France are fragmenting. Hence, the fragmentation of Sri Lankas main parties comes as no surprise. We have successfully negotiated foreign debt restructuring agreements. Furthermore, the government has prioritized salary increases for teachers and other government officials. Despite the presence of more than four government officials in villages, their economic impact remains limited. Despite the existence of institutions related to coconut production, Sri Lankas coconut yield has been declining. In contrast, Kerala has seen an increase in coconut production and is rapidly transitioning to an export-oriented economy. Despite the operation of Mahaweli zone offices and the Irrigation Department, the yield from the Mahaweli zone is only around three metric tons per hectare. Over the past 50 years, countries like India and China have significantly benefited economically from the plantation industry. Historically, Sri Lanka had an economy based on tea, coconut, and rubber during colonial times. Following the introduction of an open economy in 1977, the garment industry became crucial in preventing further economic decline. Efforts are underway to develop Gadaladenia, Lankatilakaya, and Ambakke into a tourism zone, with infrastructure development initiatives in progress. Plans include establishing a Buddhist cultural centre to attract a large number of tourists to the Kandy area. Tourists visiting the historic Dalada Maligawa, Udawatta Kale, and Victoria Dam will often spend several days in the Kandy area. Under the Greater Kandy Urban Development Plan, efforts are underway to transform the Bogambara Prison area into a hotel complex. Additionally, plans include relocating the citys administrative functions to Kundasale and establishing a technology zone in Digana to foster advanced technological development. Discussions have been initiated to complete the Colombo-Mirigama section of the Kandy-Colombo Expressway with assistance from China, and the Kurunegala-Kandy section with assistance from Japan. We seek the support of the Mahanayaka Theras to ensure the success of our initiative to modernize agriculture in rural areas. --PMD",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 04:14 pm",
        "content": "The Official Creditor Committee (OCC) of Sri Lankas bilateral lenders has commended island nations efforts in implementing necessary reforms to ensure a sustainable economic path. The Official Creditor Committee says it now looks forward to receiving from Sri Lanka all information necessary for the OCC to ensure comparability of treatment. The OCC said it also expects that the Sri Lankan authorities will continue to engage with their private creditors to find as soon as possible an agreement on terms at least as favourable as the terms offered by the OCC. These engagements will ensure that the overall debt treatment granted to Sri Lanka is consistent with the IMF program parameters, it said in a statement on Wednesday. Since the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and Sri Lanka agreed on the main parameters of a debt treatment consistent with those of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement between Sri Lanka and the IMF on November 23, 2023, the OCC and Sri Lanka furthered discussions in order to finalize the agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The OCC also continued to engage extensively with the Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF and the World Bank, as well as China and Sri Lankas private creditors in order to ensure comparability of treatment. On June 26, 2024, the OCC and Sri Lanka finalized the MoU, based on the main parameters of the debt treatment agreed in November 2023. The progress on the MoU had enabled the IMF staff to present to the IMF Executive Board the second review of Sri Lankas EFF arrangement and thus open the way for approval of the third disbursement under the arrangement. The Paris Club, formed in 1956, is an informal group of official creditors whose role is to find coordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by borrower countries. The members of the Paris Club which are part of the Official Creditor Committee are representatives of countries with eligible claims on Sri Lanka: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States of America.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka debt deal key to restoring debt sustainability, IMF says",
        "date": "June 27, 2024 04:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas agreements with China and other creditor nations to restructure about 10 billion in bilateral debt brought it a step closer towards restoring debt sustainability, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday. The island nation signed deals with China and other creditor nations to restructure about 10 billion in bilateral debt on Wednesday, helping it approach the end of a restructuring process that began in September 2022 after its reserves hit record lows and forced it to default on foreign debt for the first time. Sri Lankan officials in Paris inked the agreement with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) co-chaired by Japan, India and France that have lent a combined 5.8 billion. The committee is now awaiting details of a separate agreement that was signed with China EXIM Bank to rework 4.2 billion to be shared with them to ensure comparability of treatment, OCC said in a statement. Sri Lanka, however, still needs to convince bondholders to restructure about 12.5 billion in international bonds. We hope that there will be swift progress on reaching agreements with external private creditors in the near future, Peter Breuer, IMFs senior mission chief for Sri Lanka, said in a statement. Bilateral lenders said they hoped an agreement with bondholders would be on terms at least as favourable as the terms offered by the OCC. The restructuring of bilateral debt agreements was one of the key conditions set by the IMF under a 2.9 billion bailout programme that helped Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve government finances. The central bank estimates the economy will expand 3 in 2024 after contracting 2.3 last year. Sri Lanka, whose total external debt is 37 billion, also has to finalise arrangements with China Development Bank to restructure debt of 2.2 billion, according to latest finance ministry data. Under the restructuring plan, Sri Lanka can delay repaying bilateral creditors till 2028. During this period, the government and creditors can arrange new loans out to 2043. Once the restructuring is completed, Sri Lanka aims to reduce its debt by 16.9 billion, the government said. It will seek approval from parliament on July 2 to proceed with the deals, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said during an address to the nation late on Wednesday. The debt restructuring will help the cash-strapped nation more than halve its foreign debt repayments to 4.5 of gross domestic product between 2027-2032, from 9.2 in 2022 at the peak of the economic crisis. But the country has to still improve governance and stay on the path of reforms, including implementing legislation to lock in IMF-stipulated fiscal targets, impose a property tax, and limit lending by state banks to loss making state-run companies, according to analysts. Recovery could also face headwinds from upcoming presidential elections scheduled to be held before mid-October. There is now the chance Sri Lanka can access undisbursed loans from bilateral lenders, particularly for infrastructure projects that were stalled, or get new loans, said Thilina Panduwawala, head of research at Frontier Research. But it could be next year by the time they get these up and running because elections can also delay that process. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 27, 2024 11:53 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  Israeli authorities say 68 people - sick and injured children plus their companions - have been allowed out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt in the first medical evacuation since May, when the territorys sole travel crossing was shut down. The Israeli military body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, known by its acronym COGAT, said Thursday that the evacuation was carried out in coordination with officials from the United States, Egypt and the international community. The children and their companions left the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom crossing, and the patients were to travel to Egypt and further abroad for medical treatment. The nearly nine-month Israel-Hamas war has devastated Gazas health sector and forced most of its hospitals to shut down. Health officials say thousands of people need medical treatment abroad, including hundreds of urgent cases. Family members earlier bade a tearful goodbye to the children as they and their escorts left the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis bound for the Kerem Shalom cargo crossing with Israel. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only one available for people to travel in or out, shut down after Israeli forces captured it during their operation in the city early last month. Egypt has refused to reopen its side of the crossing until the Gaza side is returned to Palestinian control. Six of the children were transferred to Nasser Hospital from Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City earlier this week. Five have cancer and one suffers from metabolic syndrome. That evacuation was organized by the World Health Organization, which could not immediately be reached for comment. At a press conference at Nasser Hospital on Thursday, Dr. Mohammed Zaqout, the head of Gazas hospitals, said the evacuation was being conducted in coordination with the WHO and three American charities. Zaqout said over 25,000 patients in Gaza require treatment abroad, including some 980 children with cancer, a quarter of whom need urgent and immediate evacuation. He said the cases included in Thursdays evacuation are a drop in the ocean and that the complicated route through Kerem Shalom and into Egypt cannot serve as an alternative to the Rafah crossing. At Nasser Hospital earlier on Thursday, many of the families appeared anxious. Most relatives had to stay behind, and even those allowed to accompany the patients did not know their final destination. Nour Abu Zahri wept as he kissed his young daughter goodbye. The girl has severe burns on her head from an Israeli airstrike. He said he didnt get clearance to leave Gaza with her, though her mother did. Its been almost 10 months, and there is no solution for the hospitals here, he said. Kamela Abukweik burst into tears after her son got on the bus heading to the crossing with her mother. Neither she nor her husband were cleared to leave. He has tumors spread all over his body and we dont know what the reason is. And he constantly has a fever, she said. I still dont know where he is going. Physicians for Human Rights Israel and Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization, petitioned Israels Supreme Court to create a permanent mechanism to allow people in need of medical treatment to evacuate Gaza. Adi Lustigman, an attorney with Physicians for Human Rights Israel, said that before May 7, when the Israeli military launched their ground operation in Rafah and took control of the crossing, approximately 50 Palestinian patients per day crossed into Egypt for medical treatment abroad. The fact that fewer than 70 people left the territory Thursday after two months the crossing has been closed is beyond tragic, said Tania Hary executive director of Gisha. Our sense of it is that its just unsustainable in terms of a response. She called on the Israeli military to reopen Rafah Crossing and allow patients to exit the Erez Crossing in the northern part of the territory, which had previously been the main crossing for Palestinians entering Israel. On Monday, Israels Supreme Court will hold a hearing on the petition. In a post on the social media platform X, the World Health Organization regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Hanan Balkhy, welcomed news of the childrens evacuation, but noted that more than 10,000 patients still require medical care outside the Strip. Of the 13,872 people who have applied for medical evacuation since 7 October, only 35 have been evacuated. Medical evacuation corridors must be urgently established for the sustained, organized, safe, and timely passage of critically ill patients from Gaza via all possible routes, she said. Israels offensive against Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, has killed over 37,700 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Thousands of women and children are among the dead. The war began with Hamas surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. On Thursday, the Israeli military ordered new evacuations from Gaza City neighborhoods that were heavily bombed and largely emptied early in the war. The latest orders apply to Shijaiyah and other neighborhoods where residents reported heavy bombing on Thursday. First responders with Gazas Civil Defense said airstrikes hit five homes, killing at least three people and wounding another six. It said rescuers were still digging through the rubble for survivors. Gaza City was heavily bombed in the opening weeks of the war. Israel ordered the evacuation of all of northern Gaza, including the territorys largest city, later that month. Hundreds of thousands of people have remained in the north, even as Israeli troops have surrounded and largely isolated it. Shijaiyah residents in a messaging group shared video showing large numbers of people fleeing the neighborhood on foot with their belongings in their arms. International criticism has been growing over Israels campaign against Hamas as Palestinians face severe and widespread hunger. The eight-month war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, and people there are now totally dependent on aid. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza  a charge Israel strongly denies. Source: Associated Press --Agencies",
