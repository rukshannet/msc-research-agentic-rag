        "title": "Hamas releases two American hostages from Gaza after Qatari mediation",
        "date": "October 21, 2023 12:47 pm",
        "content": "Hamas has released two American hostages, Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie Raanan, who were kidnapped in its attack on southern Israel. They are the first hostages to be freed since fighters from the Palestinian group carried out a surprise attack on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 200 others hostage. Hamas armed wing, the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, freed the hostages for humanitarian reasons after Qatari mediation efforts, its spokesman Abu Ubaida said on Friday. The Israeli prime ministers office confirmed that Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie Raanan had been released and were in the country. US President Joe Biden in a statement thanked Qatar and Israel for their partnership in securing the pairs release. A spokesperson for Qatars foreign ministry said the release of the US hostages came after many days of continuous communication with all parties. Qatar hopes dialogue will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality, the spokesperson said. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that it contributed to the effort to free the two United States citizens. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) helped facilitate this release by transporting the hostages from Gaza to Israel, underscoring the real-life impact of our role as a neutral actor between the warring parties, the organisation said in a statement. The ICRC continues to call for the immediate release of all hostages. We are ready to visit the remaining hostages and to facilitate any future release following an agreement reached by the parties. Hamas had said earlier in the day that it was releasing the two captives in response to diplomatic efforts by Qatar. The Israeli military said earlier on Friday that it believed that the majority of the captives were still alive. Most of the 1,400 people killed in the Hamas attack were civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment that has killed at least 4,137 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also imposed a complete siege of the enclave and said it will not be lifted unless Israeli hostages are freed. Those held include women, children, the elderly and people from other countries, which have been working for their release, along with some Israeli soldiers.

        "content": "Trucks with humanitarian aid that have been stranded in Egypt entered the Rafah border crossing with the besieged Gaza Strip on Saturday after days of diplomatic wrangling over conditions for delivering the relief. Television images showed trucks moving into the border crossing area from the Egyptian side. Rafah is the main route in and out of the Gaza Strip that is not controlled by Israel, and the focus of efforts to deliver aid to Gazas 2.3 million residents. Israel imposed a total blockade and launched air strikes on Gaza in response to a deadly attack on Israeli soil by Palestinian group Hamas on Oct. 7. Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, said a relief aid convoy of 20 trucks would enter on Saturday, carrying medicine, medical supplies and a limited amount of food and canned goods. The U.N. has warned of humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, where food has been running out and supplies of fuel needed to keep hospital back-up generators running have reached dangerously low levels. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the border on Friday in a push to get the aid in, saying a mechanism for inspection of the aid demanded by Israel was still being worked out. Many of Gazas residents have crammed into the south of the territory to avoid air strikes in the north. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "A Presidential Election is set to take place in 2024 in accordance with the Constitution of Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed. Furthermore, the Presidential Election is also set to be followed by a General Election, the Head of State said at a United National Party (UNP) convention held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium this afternoon (21 Oct.). Addressing the Special General Convention of the UNP, President Wickremesinghe emphasized his commitment to bolstering the countrys economy by positioning Sri Lanka as a smart nation. Accordingly, the Head of State outlined the timeline for upcoming elections in line with the constitutional provisions, and added that local government elections are expected to transpire in the first half of 2025. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the Special General Convention of the United National Party held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo today (21). The theme for this years UNP Anniversary convention was Smart Country  2048. The vision behind this concept is a vision of an intelligent and prosperous Sri Lanka, where every citizen recognizes their potential, upholds virtuous goals, and embraces diversity while harnessing modern technology and nature to cultivate a nation of adept and resourceful individuals. The Smart Country concept envisions the creation of a prosperous nation. Departing from conventional party politics vying for power, the main objective of this years UNP Special Convention was to adopt a nation-centric approach to reorganize the party for this purpose. Party leader President Ranil Wickremesinghe also presented an amended party constitution designed to facilitate this transformation. A significant amendment allows the United National Party to establish an online presence and engage actively in social media platforms, thus facilitating the digital transformation of the party. The President emphasized the need for the UNP to evolve into a technologically adept and intelligent party, aligning itself with the broader vision of building both a smart nation and a smart party. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, leader of the Peoples United Front, extended his congratulations to the United National Party Special Convention. The Sugathadasa Stadium was packed to capacity, with attendees representing various regions of the island, including the North and East. The event was inaugurated with immense pride, featuring the party leader, President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The celebration also featured cultural and artistic elements, underscoring the diversity and richness of Sri Lankas heritage. Minister Manusha Nanayakkara presented President Wickremesinghe with a Lets start with me badge, symbolizing the collective effort needed to construct a smart nation. During the ceremony, an archived edition of the Siya Rata newspaper was presented by its editor, Mrs. Maya Kalubowila, to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who, in turn, handed it over to the Secretary General of the party. The President stressed the imperative need to eradicate corruption and emphasized the passage of long-awaited anti-corruption legislation, along with the introduction of multiple ordinances to combat corruption both within the government and political parties. He reiterated the United National Partys strength in contributing to the nations economic development and emphasized the partys role as a forward-looking entity that will serve the nations interests in the future. Notable speakers at the conference included United National Party President and Member of Parliament Wajira Abeywardena, Deputy Leader of the Party Ruwan Wijewardena, National Organizer Sagala Rathnayaka, Deputy Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Lands and Tourism Harin Fernando, along with General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara and former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

Subsequently, the female suspect had approached him, and had taken the relevant post down for a sum of Rs. 3 million, which had been paid by the doctor in installments. She offered to help me, and I expressed the urgency of the situation. I also knew of her contacts and connections, and as she promised, the relevant post was taken down within an hour, the victimised doctor said in this regard. However, three months after this incident occurred, a similar post had been circulating on Facebook, consequent to which the doctor filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), suspecting the suspects potential involvement in the matter. The suspect had reportedly portrayed herself to be a woman with many influential connections, and claimed that her husband is currently employed at the Presidents Media Division (PMD), while she herself is a Parliamentary staffer. It was later revealed, however, that the Parliament ID presented by the suspect was, in fact, forged, and that she hold no such position within the House.

        "date": "October 22, 2023 12:08 pm",
        "content": "India successfully carried out Saturday the first of a series of key test flights after overcoming a technical glitch ahead of its planned mission to take astronauts into space by 2025, the space agency said. The test involved launching a module to outer space and bringing it back to earth to test the spacecrafts crew escape system, said the Indian Space Research Organization chief S. Somanath, and was being recovered after its touchdown in the Bay of Bengal. The launch was delayed by 45 minutes in the morning because of weather conditions. The attempt was again deferred by more than an hour because of an issue with the engine, and the ground computer put the modules lift-off on hold, said Somanath. The glitch caused by a monitoring anomaly in the system was rectified and the test was carried out successfully 75 minutes later from the Sriharikota satellite launching station in southern India, Somanath told reporters. It would pave the way for other unmanned missions, including sending a robot into space next year. In September, India successfully launched its first space mission to study the sun, less than two weeks after a successful uncrewed landing near the south pole region of the moon. After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India in September joined the United States, the Soviet Union and China as only the fourth country to achieve the milestone. The successful mission showcased Indias rising standing as a technology and space powerhouse and dovetails with Prime Minister Narendra Modis desire to project an image of an ascendant country asserting its place among the global elite. Signaling a roadmap for Indias future space ambitions, Modi earlier this week announced that Indias space agency will set up an Indian-crafted space station by 2035 and land an Indian astronaut on the moon by 2040. Active since the 1960s, India has launched satellites for itself and other countries, and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. India is planning its first mission to the International Space Station next year in collaboration with the United States. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "October 22, 2023 12:22 pm",
        "content": "Argentines will head to the polls on Sunday to vote in a general election under the shadow of the South American countrys worst economic crisis in two decades, which has driven the rise of an outsider far-right libertarian who is in pole position to win. The vote is likely to roil Argentinas already shaky markets, impact its ties with trade partners like China and Brazil, and set the political path for the country, a major grains exporter with huge reserves of lithium and shale gas. Polling stations open at 8:00 am (1100 GMT) with three frontrunner candidates likely to split the vote: libertarian economist Javier Milei, centrist Peronist Economy Minister Sergio Massa and conservative Patricia Bullrich. Milei, pledging to chainsaw the economic and political status quo, is the candidate to beat, with angry voters flocking to his tear-it-all-down message, fed up with inflation at 138 and poverty affecting over two-fifths of the population. People want things to change, said Federico Aurelio, president of consulting firm Aresco. How? They have no idea, but they want change. Milei, a brash former TV pundit likened to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, posted a shock win in August open primaries, though Massa and Bullrich were not far behind and it may well prove a close race. Pollsters expect no outright winner. A candidate needs over 45 of the vote or 40 and a 10-point lead to avoid a second round run-off, which would be held on Nov. 19. Voting on Sunday will end around 6:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) and the first results are expected at 9:00 p.m. (00:00 GMT). Whoever wins will have to deal with an economy on life support: central bank reserves are empty, recession is around the corner after a major drought, and a 44 billion program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is wobbling. Amid this crisis Milei has risen abruptly, pledging shock therapy to fix the economy including dollarizing, shutting the central bank, slashing the size of government drastically and privatizing state entities. He is the only one who understands the situation in the country and understands how to save it, said Buenos Aires student Nicolas Mercado, 22. Massa, current economy chief, remains in the running despite overseeing inflation hitting triple digits for the first time since 1991. He is pledging to cut the fiscal deficit, stick with the peso and defend the Peronist social welfare safety net. Massa represents certain traditional guarantees with which I was raised: public health, state education, which is what I want to defend with my vote, said astrologer Flavia Vázquez. Bullrich, a former security minister who is popular in business circles, has seen her support diluted by the unexpected emergence of Milei. Pollsters see her as the most likely of the top three runners to miss out on a second round. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The accused, identified as Mohamed Imran Khan (39) alias Haja Najerbheeden, a native of Ramanathpuram, was secured from his hideout in Theni district by the absconder tracker team (ATT) of the NIA from Bengaluru. The NIA said that it had been tracking his movements for a few months. The NIA said that Mohamed Imran Khan was a smuggler and fugitive wanted by several investigation agencies. He, along with a Sri Lankan national named Eesan, formerly associated with the LTTE, devised a plan to illegally transport 61 Sri Lankan nationals from the island nation to various locations in Tamil Nadu. They lured these individuals with false promises, including the prospect of obtaining legitimate documentation for emigration to Canada and securing employment, said the NIA. NIA registered a case in 2021 after the Tamil Nadu Polices Q branch secured 23 Sri Lankan nationals and four agents in Madurai, which led to the detention of another 38 Sri Lankan nationals in Mangaluru. So far, the NIA has arrested 13 suspects in the case and filed a chargesheet against five named Dhinakaran alias Ayya, Kasi Viswanathan, Rasool, Satham Ushen, and Abdul Muheetu. Investigations revealed that Imran Khan played a pivotal role in a broader conspiracy involving international human trafficking. He acted as the main conduit responsible for transporting Sri Lankan nationals from their home country to India and subsequently to other nations, said the NIA. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop! Stop! Francis said after his traditional Angelus prayer in Romes Saint Peters Square. I renew my call for spaces to be opened, for humanitarian aid to continue to arrive and for hostages to be freed, the 86-year-old pontiff said. Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people. Israels retaliatory bombing campaign has killed more than 4,300 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and reduced swathes of densely populated Gaza to smouldering ruins. Alarm has grown about a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israel has cut off water, food and power. A first trickle of aid entered the besieged Strip on Saturday, but UN officials said the 20 trucks permitted to cross were not enough given the catastrophic humanitarian situation for 2.4 million people. Two US hostages were released Friday but over 200 people abducted by the militants are still being held. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 22, 2023 08:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the policy of the present government is to treat every religion equally and provide equal rights to every citizen. He further stressed that he does not approve of making the Palestinian people victims in the Israel-Hamas conflict. He pledged full support to the program of the UN Secretary-General to stop the conflicts and establish peace in the region, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed these thoughts while addressing the National Milad-Un Nabi Celebration held at Musali National School Stadium in Mannar this morning (22). The event was jointly organized by the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, and the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, upon arriving at the event site, received a warm welcome from prominent Muslim cultural figures. The keynote address of the event was delivered by Maulavi Ashek B. Nihamatullah. A commemorative stamp and souvenir cover were issued for the National Milad-Un Nabi celebration 2023 and were presented to the President by the Postmaster General, Mr. Ruwan Palitha Satkumara. The President was also presented with a special commemorative issue and the book History of Mannar District, issued on the occasion of the National Milad-Un Nabi celebration. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also awarded prizes and certificates to the students who won the design competitions held in conjunction with the Holy Prophets birthday celebration. Subsequently, honorary awards were presented to the Maulavis who had worked in mosques for an extended period, and a souvenir gift was also presented posthumously to Mr. Hasbullah, a professor who had rendered exceptional service to the area. The President presented souvenir gifts to the Chairman of the Puttalam Mosque Association and the Chairman of the Puttalam Jameitul Ulama Organization. A souvenir gift was also presented to the President on behalf of the Department of Muslim Religion and Culture, it added. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; Today, we are celebrating the birthday of the Holy Prophet here. This is the second religious celebration I have attended in Mannar District. A few months ago, we attended an event at the Sacred Madu Church. I would like to express my gratitude to the Ministry of Religious and Cultural Affairs and the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs for organizing this event in a grand manner. In addition to this event, development programs such as the opening of a new school building and housing projects have been implemented here. Mannar District is in need of development, especially considering the damage it suffered during the war. Therefore, we are implementing programs for the resettlement of displaced persons in these areas. We are also continuing discussions about the construction of roads, especially in Mannar District, as reminded by the minister in Parliament. Education is another area that needs development, not only in Mannar city but also in other parts of the district. Furthermore, we have planned a substantial development program in this area. Arrangements are already being made to establish a sea transport service between India and Mannar, starting from Kankasanthurai and later in Thalaimannar. India and Sri Lanka are also planning to develop the electricity system together, which will benefit Mannar. This is just the beginning of Mannars development. This area has a high potential for a green economy and green energy, particularly with the available solar power. From Puttalam to Mannar through the Jaffna Peninsula to Mullaitivu, there is a great opportunity for this, and we aim to make Pooneryn the centre of this development. Additionally, we aspire to make Mannar a tourist hub, and as the fishing industry develops, Mannar will experience a new economic boost. Today, we gather here to remember the Holy Prophet. The same doctrine preached by Nabi Nayaka is what exists in Sri Lanka today. Therefore, we consider this celebration a national one. Our policy is to treat all religions equally, and our aim is to provide equal rights to everyone. The Muslim community here faces certain challenges, and I would like to state that the government is actively working to address them. We inherited a country in financial distress, and we are diligently working to recover from that situation. The Islamic doctrine of the Prophet has spread from Morocco to Indonesia, across Africa and Europe. When the Prophet preached this doctrine, people of different faiths coexisted in the region without issues. However, today, there are more significant problems, especially the Palestinian issue, which was recently debated in Parliament. We heard that 20 food trucks have been sent to Gaza, but we must question whether this is enough. The Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip are trapped due to the Israeli-Hamas conflict, and we cannot ignore their suffering. We call for the necessary food to be provided to these people, not only from Israel but also from Egypt, along with access to clean water. While the Israel-Hamas conflict continues, its essential to ensure that ordinary Palestinian people are not victimized in this struggle. Arab countries, including Egypt, are taking steps to address this issue, and other nations are showing their support. We, too, are committed to giving our full support to the activities of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Council in resolving this matter and bringing peace to the region. There is a genuine need for a Palestinian government. Minister of State and Chairman of Mannar and Mullaitivu Development Committee Mr. Kader Masthan, We consider the Presidents visit to Mannar to participate in the National Milad-Un Nabi Celebration as an honor to our people. After the end of the war, this area did not develop. Due to the resettlement activities being carried out without proper planning, a situation has arisen where it is impossible to acquire land for development and investment in that area. It should be mentioned that the expectations of the people of my district will be fulfilled under your leadership. You took the responsibility of a country whose economy was in collapse and worked to rebuild it. As a president who understands the plight of the people well, we hope that you will provide a solution to the problem of resettlement in these areas. This event was graced by the presence of the Minister of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, Vidura Wickramanayake; the Governor of the Northern Province, Mrs. P.S.M. Charles; Member of Parliament K. Thilipan; the Secretary to the Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry, Mr. Somaratne Vidanapathirana; the Director of the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, A.M. Faisal; religious leaders; defence chiefs; students; local residents; and a large number of people, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "October 22, 2023 10:09 pm",
        "content": "China is trying to expand global military footprints, with a latest Pentagon report naming 18 countries, besides Djibouti and Cambodias Ream Naval Base, to insist that Beijing has probably considered them as locations for PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) military logistics facilities. Of these considered defence facilities outside the China which would provide PLA military access in case of any operational requirements, four are Indias immediate neighbours -- Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Burma (Myanmar) and another three of them -- Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia -- are in the South East Asia, as per the US Department of Defences annual report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People Republic of China 2023. The PRC (Peoples Republic of China) probably also has considered other countries as locations for PLA military logistics facilities, including Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea, Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola, Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tajikistan, the annual report released by the US Department of Defence this month stated. The PLAs Strategic Support Force (SSF), revealed the US report, operates tracking, telemetry, and command stations in Namibia, Pakistan, Argentina, and Kenya. The Beijing is doing it to expand its overseas logistics and basing infrastructure to allow the PLA to project and sustain military power at greater distances, the Pentagon report observed but cautioned that its global network could disrupt US military operations. The Pentagon findings also narrated that China has scaled up deployment of forces and infrastructure build-up along the Line of Actual Control since the 2020 Galwan stand off with India in eastern Ladakh. These improvements include underground storage facilities near Doklam, new roads in all three sectors of the LAC, new villages in disputed areas in Bhutan, a second bridge over Pangong Lake, a dual airport and multiple helipads. The report, at the same time, stated negotiations between India and China made minimal progress as both sides resisted losing perceived advantages on the border. Since early May 2020, sustained tensions along the India-China border have dominated the Western Theater Commands attention. Differing perceptions between India and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) regarding border demarcations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) combined with recent infrastructure construction on both sides, led to multiple clashes, an ongoing standoff, and military buildups along the shared border, the report said. In 2022, China deployed one border regiment, supported by two divisions of Xinjiang and Tibet Military Districts with four combined arms brigades (CAB) in reserve in the western sector of the LAC. China also deployed as many as three light-to-medium CABs in the eastern sector from other theater commands and an additional three CABs in the central sector of the LAC. Although some elements of a light CAB eventually withdrew, a majority of the deployed forces remain in place along the LAC, it pointed out on enhanced deployment at the border. The Galwan face off which, it said, lead to death of 20 Indian Army personnel and four of PLAs, significantly strained the bilateral ties. The deployment of the PLAs Western Theater Command, oriented toward India and counterterrorism missions along Chinas Central Asia borders, along the LAC will likely continue through 2023, it said.

Accordingly, the public has been warned of the spread of eye diseases, diarrhea, and respiratory diseases, often associated with high body temperatures, and are therefore urged to take all possible precautionary measures while also paying attention to their personal health habits. Speaking further in this regard, Chairman of the Public Health Inspectors Union (PHIU), Upul Rohana, emphasised that personal hygiene plays an integral role in controlling the spread of the aforementioned illnesses. He further stated that a significant increase of dengue cases have also been reported from across the island, as floodwaters subside from those localities that were submerged as a result of the heavy downpours.",

        "title": "Proposals for CEB restructuring to be presented to Cabinet next week  Minister",
        "date": "October 23, 2023 12:07 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera, announced that a comprehensive proposal pertaining to the restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is scheduled for submission to the Cabinet next week. Minister Wijesekera further emphasized that a mechanism will be developed immediately for a systematic approach to revise the electricity bill once every six months. The Minister made these remarks during a press conference held today (23), at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. The Minister providing additional insights remarked that the Public Utilities Commission had recently approved a revision of electricity tariffs for the Electricity Board. Consequently, preparations we made to implement an approximate 18 rate adjustment, effective from the 21st of October, with subsequent rate evaluations for the coming months. This price revision adheres to the governments policy framework established in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pursuant to this framework, no state enterprise is permitted to draw funds from the Treasury to cover its financial losses. Consequently, a specialized price formula has been devised for both the Electricity Board and the Petroleum Corporation. Addressing a prevalent misconception within society, the Minister clarified that the Electricity Board is not confined to revising tariffs only twice a year. Provisions are in place for tariff adjustments in cases of emergency and the necessary cabinet approval has been secured for this purpose. Furthermore, the Minister also revealed the on-going restructuring efforts of the Electricity Board. The proposals for this endeavour were previously submitted and are presently under consideration by the Legal Draftsmans Office. The office has finalized its review and has forwarded the proposal to the Attorney General. On a positive note, the Attorney General recently conveyed plans to provide the requisite clarifications within the week, thus facilitating the proposals presentation to the Cabinet in the forthcoming week. These developments indicate a significant step forward in the restructuring program. Moreover, it has come to the attention that there is a prevailing public sentiment regarding the need for a tariff revision due to the current heavy rainfall. It is pertinent to note that not only the Matara district, which I have the privilege of representing, but also the neighbouring Galle district and the Gampaha district have experienced flooding as a result of these meteorological conditions. In light of recent heavy rainfall and its implications for electricity production, it is essential to recognize that the primary reservoirs responsible for hydroelectric power generation, namely Samanala Lake, Victoria, and Randenigala, remain within their existing capacities. The rainfall in these regions has been below the typical levels. As of today, we are utilizing only 65.81 of the reservoir capacity, a stark contrast to the 84.41 capacity utilization observed by October 22, 2022. This represents a considerable 20 decrease. Comparatively, the hydroelectricity production from our reservoirs in 2022 reached 5,364 gigawatt hours, a significant decline from 5,639 gigawatt hours in 2021. By October 22, 2023, the figure stands at 2,893 gigawatt hours, only half of the corresponding output in the preceding years. With a mere 70 days remaining in the year, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to meet these targets. Consequently, the exploration of alternative measures is imperative to ensure the continued supply of electricity. On Sunday (22 Oct.), State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe stated that measures are underway to expedite the procedure of restructuring public institutions. Semasinghe pointed out that the restructuring programme of loss-making state institutions is currently being carried out successfully, in order to provide solutions to the current economic crisis. Earlier this year, it was discussed that the CEB would be restructured in a manner in which the management structure of the CEB will undergo reforms so as to enable renewable energy generation to be promoted within Sri Lanka with the support of government, and private and public partnerships. The Cabinet of Ministers, on 17 April, approved the proposed roadmap and timeline of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) restructuring process.",

        "content": "The further hearing of the petition filed by Ministers Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando, challenging the decision taken by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to oust them from the party and disqualify them of their parliamentary seats, has been postponed until 27 October by the Supreme Court. The relevant order was issued by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Gamini Amarasekera and Arjuna Obeysekera, when the petition was called in court this morning (23 Oct.), The further hearing of the relevant petition was postponed in light of the absence of the Justices that participated in the initial hearing, which took place on 12 October. On 18 July, the SJB Working Committee decided to expel Fernando and Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. MPs Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara were sworn in as the Minister of Tourism  Lands and Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment, respectively. Fernando and Nanayakkara had said they accepted ministerial portfolios in the government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to do their utmost to find solutions to the ongoing economic crisis as a positive response was not received from many political party leaders for a collective effort. They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign. However, they were both reappointed to the same ministerial portfolios by incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he appointed a new Cabinet on July 22, 2022.",

        "date": "October 23, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has raised concerns over the latest Cabinet reshuffle, claiming that the changing of ministerial portfolios was a wrong decision by the President. Speaking to the media in this regard this afternoon (23 Oct.), SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of having taken the wrong decision in this regard, in particular the removal of Keheliya Rambukwella from the post of Minister of Health. There were false allegations made against Minister Keheliya, and it was proven that these allegations were false. However, the President must have thought that making certain changes in this regard was the right thing to do, Kariyawasam said in this regard. Further opining his concerns pertaining to the Cabinet reshuffle, the SLPP General Secretary further stated that President Wickremesinghe has already been informed of the political partys concern with regards to the appointment of Dr. Ramesh Pathirana as the new Minister of Health. Voicing the partys displeasure with regards to the appointments of two members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to both Cabinet and non-Cabinet portfolios, Kariyawasam asserted that they are unafraid to call the President out on his wrong decisions. A large number of MPs supporting the President to take this country forward are from the SLPP. There are only five such MPs supporting the President from the SLFP. Thus, it is wrong of the President to remove a ministerial portfolio from an SLPP MP, and give it to an MP belonging to the SLFP, and to also give another SLFP member the portfolio of a State Minister. We are unhappy about this decision, it was a wrong thing to do. We are not afraid to say when something is wrong. If an act is wrong, it is wrong, even if it is committed by the President, the SLPP General Secretary stressed in this regard. A Cabinet reshuffle took place earlier today, during which the ministerial portfolios of several ministers including Mahinda Amaraweera and Keheliya Rambukwella were changed. Accordingly, Minister Amaraweera, was sworn in as the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, while former Health Minister Rambukwella was sworn in as the new Minister of Environment. Meanwhile, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana has been appointed as the Minister of Health, in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries, while State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was appointed as the Non-Cabinet Minister of Plantation Enterprises, in addition to his current post.",

        "date": "October 23, 2023 07:02 pm",
        "content": "Gazas Hamas-run health ministry said Monday that more than 5,000 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian enclave since Israel launched its withering bombing campaign more than two weeks ago. Alarm has surged about the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the war sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack that, Israeli officials say, killed more than 1,400 people who were gunned down, stabbed or burnt by the Islamist militants. Hamas also took more than 200 hostages. On a day when Israels army reported more than 300 new strikes within 24 hours, Gazas health ministry said the death toll had surged above 5,000, around 40 percent of them children. Thousands of buildings have been destroyed and more than one million people displaced in the territory that has been under siege and largely deprived of water, food and other basic supplies. About a dozen trucks carrying desperately needed aid -- the third convoy in three days -- arrived inside Gaza from Egypt on Monday through Rafah, Gazas only crossing not controlled by Israel. The United States, which has brokered the entry of the aid convoys, has vowed a continued flow of relief goods into Gaza, even as UN aid agencies have said far more is needed. Fighting raged unabated overnight, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed again that Israel would erase Hamas and as a full-scale ground invasion loomed. Gazas Hamas-controlled government media office said that more than 60 were martyred in the raids during the night -- including 17 in a single strike that hit a house in Gazas north -- and at least 10 others were killed in new strikes early Monday. The Israeli military said it had hit over 320 military targets in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours. It said the targets included tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres as well as military compounds and observation posts used by Islamic Jihad, another militant group. Call for blood donations Rafah resident Mohammed Abu Sabalah said he had returned home from the local mosque after dawn prayers Monday and that a quarter of an hour later there was a bombing. We couldnt see anything because of the thick smoke, he said, adding that we thank God that weve emerged safe and sound with only a few windows and doors destroyed. Israeli forces are massed near the Gaza border, and smaller units have already carried out limited incursions, targeting Hamas and hoping to rescue hostages, whose number Israel now puts at 222. In one such operation, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded, the army said, adding that the tank operation had aimed to dismantle terror infrastructure... and locate missing persons and bodies. Tensions have been inflamed in the occupied West Bank, where 95 Palestinians have been killed in clashes involving Israeli security forces or settlers since fighting began in Gaza, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry. Israel kept evacuating southern communities near Gaza. Orit Cohen, 29, a native of Sderot, an Israeli town just near Gazas northern border, told AFP: I came to pick up my mother who until then refused to leave the city. But the army is bombing right on the other side. I was afraid for her and I came to get her out of here. In Gaza, where thousands have been wounded, the health ministry issued a statement saying citizens are called upon to immediately go to hospitals and blood bank branches to donate blood. Alarm has grown about the dire needs of the 2.4 million civilians trapped inside the 40-kilometre (25-mile) long coastal strip that was already blockaded and impoverished before the war. Children killed in an Israeli air strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis were Monday laid to rest in a makeshift grave, while in Rafah men were filling plastic jerrycans from containers with now scare safe drinking water. US President Joe Biden brokered the passage of aid convoys with Egyptian and Israeli leaders in talks last week -- but the United Nations estimates Gaza needs about 100 trucks of relief goods every day. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said Sundays delivery of food, water and medical supplies was another small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid. But they need more, much more. Israel has rejected the entry of fuel into Gaza, fearing Hamas could use it for weapons and explosives. This has sparked warnings that soon Gazas ambulances, hospital incubators for infants and water desalination plants will soon stop functioning. Hezbollah warning Around the world, Israels friends and foes alike have warned against the Gaza war spilling over into a full-scale regional conflagration. Israels arch enemy Iran has repeatedly warned of an escalation, as have its allied armed groups, including Lebanons Hezbollah, which has traded cross-border fire with Israel. Netanyahu warned on Sunday that if Hezbollah were to get more deeply involved, it would be the mistake of its life. We will strike it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating, he said. Israeli air strikes have been reported against two airports in Syria, a mosque it said were used by terror operatives in the West Bank city of Jenin, and Hezbollah military infrastructure inside Lebanon. Hamas, Hezbollah and Syrias government are all backed by Iran, which opposes Israels existence and has warned the region could spiral out of control. Washington said it would not hesitate to act in the event of any escalation, just hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region. If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see, our advice is: dont, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on ABC News. Netanyahu on Monday hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the latest Western leader to pay a solidarity visit, and told him that we have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is ISIS, a reference to the Islamic State jihadist group. Palestinian prime minister Muhammad Shtayyeh charged that Israels planned Gaza invasion would mean new crimes, atrocities, forced displacement and killing for the sake of killing and revenge.

        "title": "Swift bests Scorsese at box office, but Killers of the Flower Moon opens strongly",
        "date": "October 23, 2023 07:10 pm",
        "content": "In a movie match-up almost as unlikely as Barbie and Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese took on Taylor Swift in cinemas over the weekend. And while the box office belonged for a second time to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, Scorseses Killers of the Flower Moon got off to a strong start in Apple Studios first major theatrical gambit. After a record-breaking opening weekend of 92.8 million, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour took in an estimated 31 million over the weekend from 3,855 locations, according to AMC Theaters. In an unconventional deal, the theater chain is distributing Swifts concert film, and playing it only Thursdays through Sundays. Most Swifties rushed to see the film on opening weekend, when a large percent of sales were driven by advance ticketing. Sales dropped a steep 67 in its second weekend, potentially signifying that The Eras Tour was predominantly an opening-weekend phenomenon. But The Eras Tour has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. Within days, it became the highest grossing concert film ever in North America, not accounting for inflation. Its quickly accumulated 129.8 million domestically. More was riding on Killers of the Flower Moon, a historical crime drama about a string of murders against the Osage nation in the early 1920s. The film, which cost at least 200 million to make, is the largest production yet from Apple Studios. The streamer partnered with Paramount Pictures to release Scorseses adaptation of David Granns bestseller in 3,628 theaters, with plans to later stream it on a not-yet-announced date on Apple TV. Killers of the Flower Moon debuted with 23 million, marking the third best opening for the 80-year-old Scorsese, following Shutter Island (41 million in 2010) and The Departed (26.9 million in 2006). Though Scorseses latest opus, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, will have a hard road to reaching profitability, its a successful launch for a 206-minute-long adult-skewing drama  a type of movie that, outside Oppenheimer, has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years. And Killers of the Flower Moon, with rave reviews, an A- CinemaScore from audiences and the backing of a robust Oscar campaign, should continue to play well over the long haul. It added 21 million overseas. Killer of the Flower Moon also marks the best wide-release debut for a film from a streaming company. While Netflix (which backed Scorseses last narrative feature, The Irishman, in 2019) has charted a mostly limited approach to theatrical release, Apple and Amazon, which last year closed its purchase of MGM, have pursued more expansive theatrical strategies. Earlier this year, Apple said it plans to spend 1 billion a year making movies that will have theatrical releases before reaching its streaming service. Apple is also behind Ridley Scotts upcoming Napoleon, with Joaquin Phoenix, which Sony Pictures will distribute Nov. 22; and has partnered with Universal for Matthew Vaughns Argylle, due out Feb. 2. Paramount had initially signed on to produce and distribute Killers of the Flower Moon, but transitioned into the deal with Apple when costs of project  shot during the pandemic  rose. If flexibility is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business, then this is a significant success  it establishes a viable option for the companies, David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, said of the Killers of the Flower Moon launch. As dissimilar as Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and Killers of the Flower Moon are, theyre alike in their extended run times. A double feature of the weekends top two movies would have taken six hours and 14 minutes, not counting ads and trailers. Killers of the Flower Moon also reeled in more young moviegoers than one might have expected. Paramount said 44 of ticket buyers were under the age of 30. Exorcist: The Believer, the horror sequel directed by David Gordon Green, came in a distant third with 5.6 million in its third weekend of release. The Universal, Blumhouse film has grossed 54.2 million domestically. PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie came in at No. 4 with 4.5 million in its fourth weekend. The fifth spot went to the rerelease of Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas, which collected 4.1 million 30 years after it first landed in theaters. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday are for U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, 31 million. 2. Killers of the Flower Moon, 23 million. 3. The Exorcist: Believer, 5.6 million. 4. Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie, 4.5 million. 5. The Nightmare Before Christmas, 4.1 million. 6. Saw X, 3.6 million. 7. The Creator, 2.6 million. 8. Leo: Bloody Sweet, 2.1 million. 9. A Haunting in Venice, 1.1 million. 10. The Blind, 1 million.

        "title": "US Treasury sees potential improvement in sovereign debt cases",
        "date": "October 23, 2023 11:22 pm",
        "content": "A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday said there were signs of potential improvement in sovereign debt restructuring cases and more vulnerable countries were expected to seek help, but further work was needed to accelerate the process. Treasury Assistant Secretary for International Finance Brent Neiman noted advances in the cases of Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka over the past year, along with development of new technical approaches, adding his hope that Ghana would reach agreement on its external restructuring in the coming weeks. We clearly havent gone far enough or fast enough and much more work remains, Neiman said in a speech at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. The critical test of any progress will be whether it is sustained when, as seems likely, more countries come forward requesting debt treatments, he said. But, I am hopeful that our recent efforts are yielding some movement toward an improved international debt architecture that can help low- and middle-income countries when they need it. He gave no details on which countries might be ready to ask for help as long-stalled debt restructuring processes moved forward for Zambia, Ghana and others. The Group of 20 major economies set up the Common Framework for debt relief for low-income countries during the COVID pandemic, but only two cases - Chad and Zambia - have completed the process, with Ethiopias request still in work. The glacial pace of progress on debt restructuring dampened interest among other countries, despite the fact that a majority of low-income countries are in or near debt distress. Neiman said the focus that global leaders put on the issue had helped to elevate this topic toward the top of the international economic agenda. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) has brought together borrowers, official and private sector lenders and international institutions to help agree on common terms and treatments. Roundtable participants have discussed state-contingent debt instruments (SCDIs) which helped advance Zambias restructuring and Neiman said these can be helpful when creditors disagree on a borrowers future prospects, such as differences in the outlook for oil prices for an oil exporting debtor country. These securities are designed to pay more interest when growth is higher or prices of key commodities increase, or they can reduce interest payments if there is an extreme weather event or other natural disaster. Since SCDIs can automatically lower debt repayments in times of economic stress, the hope is that they can reduce the need for debt treatments in the first place, Neiman said. Restructuring domestic debt also can help smooth the process for external debt restructuring efforts, as in the case of Ghana, Neiman said. But a simple insistence for comparable treatment between domestic and external debt - with the same reduction in net present value - could impose particularly large economic costs for domestic debt holders, including banks in the debtor country holding the debt, and is not always workable. We hope that a simple insistence on achieving comparability of treatment between domestic and external debt will not in the future hold up any restructuring cases, Neiman said. (Reuters) --Agencies",

In a tweet, he said the Cabinet has approved visa-free entry to visitors from India, China, Russia, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Thailand with immediate effect. Last week, the Ministry of Tourism announced that a cabinet paper had been presented in the previous Cabinet meeting to issue free tourist visas for foreigners from five countries who come to Sri Lanka as tourists. The cabinet paper in this regard was presented as a joint cabinet paper by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Tourism and Lands Minister Harin Fernando, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry. The ministry had said that it was expected to get approval in the upcoming cabinet meeting and that accordingly, it was proposed that tourists from China, Russia, India, Thailand and Indonesia be entitled for free visa. The purpose of exempting tourists from many countries from visas is to attract more tourists to Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it is expected to increase tourist arrivals to five million over the coming years, the Tourism Ministry had said. Sri Lanka is also within the 20 countries that China has announced for travel by Chinese tourists, it said. This proposed program will save money and time spent on obtaining visas and it is expected that the tendency of foreign tourists to visit Sri Lanka will increase, the statement had said. It is also proposed to introduce an e-ticketing system for most of the tourist sites in the country in the near future, according to the ministry.",

        "title": "Hamas frees two Israeli hostages, US cautions on Gaza invasion",
        "date": "October 24, 2023 09:46 am",
        "content": "Hamas on Monday said it had freed two Israeli women who were among the more than 200 hostages taken during its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel while sources said the U.S. had advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault in the Gaza Strip. We decided to release them for humanitarian and poor health grounds, Abu Ubaida, spokesman for the armed wing of the Palestinian Hamas militant group, said on Telegram. The Israeli prime ministers office issued a statement confirming that the women, whom it named as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, were handed over to the Israeli military and would be taken to a medical facility. The two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, near the Gaza border, along with their husbands, who were still held by Hamas, it added. Hamas freed them after releasing an American woman and her daughter on Friday. All four were seized in the Oct. 7 cross-border assault in which the Islamist Hamas killed 1,400 people. In public, the United States has stressed Israels right to defend itself but two sources familiar with the matter said the White House, Pentagon and State Department have stepped up private appeals for caution in conversations with the Israelis. A U.S. priority is to gain time for negotiations to free other hostages, especially after Fridays unexpected release of Americans Judith and Natalie Raanan on Friday, said the sources, who spoke before the hostage releases were announced on Monday. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, U.S. President Joe Biden said: We should have those hostages released and then we can talk. Israel pounded hundreds of targets in Gaza from the air on Monday as its soldiers fought Hamas militants during raids into the besieged Palestinian strip where deaths are soaring and civilians are trapped in harrowing conditions. Gazas health ministry said 436 people had been killed in bombardments over the last 24 hours, most in the south of the narrow, densely populated territory, next to which Israeli troops and tanks have massed for a possible ground invasion. The Israeli military said it had struck more than 320 targets in Gaza over 24 hours, including a tunnel housing Hamas fighters, dozens of command and lookout posts, and mortar and anti-tank missile launcher positions. The Israeli bombardment was triggered by the Oct. 7 assault, the bloodiest episode in a single day since the state of Israel was founded 75 years ago. With Gazas 2.3 million people running short of basics, European leaders looked set to follow the United Nations and Arab nations in calling for a humanitarian pause in hostilities so aid could reach them. A U.S. special envoy is negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the United Nations to create a sustained delivery mechanism to get aid into Gaza after aid convoys began crossing into the strip from Egypt, the U.S. State Department said on Monday. The U.N. said desperate Gazans also lacked places to shelter from the unrelenting pounding that has flattened swathes of the Hamas-ruled enclave. The conflict meanwhile was escalating beyond Gaza. Israeli aircraft hit positions in south Lebanon held by Hezbollah which, like Hamas, is a group allied to Israels long-time foe Iran. The Israeli army and Palestinians also clashed in the occupied West Bank and Hamas fired more rockets into Israel. At least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed in two weeks of strikes, including 2,055 children, the health ministry said. Israels police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency released footage from their interrogations of captured Hamas gunmen who took part in the Oct. 7 rampage. In the video clips, one handcuffed Hamas man sitting beside a desk is heard describing the orders they received regarding Israeli civilians - to kill the men and bring the women, children and elderly as hostages. Another, with an injury on his face, said they were told their prize for bringing captives would be a new home and 10,000. FIGHTING INSIDE GAZA Israel said its armed forces incursions overnight were partly intended to gather intelligence, with the whereabouts of the hostages unknown, and had helped improve its military readiness. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. Hamass armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters engaged with an Israeli force that infiltrated southern Gaza, destroying two bulldozers and a tank and forcing the raiders to withdraw. Israel made no comment on the incident. The Al-Qassam Brigades also said they were firing missiles at the southern Israeli towns of Ashkelon and Mavkiim. Warning sirens sounded on the Israeli side. The Israeli military, the Middle Easts most powerful, faces a group that has built up a large arsenal with Irans help, fighting in a crowded urban setting and using a vast tunnel network. The U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said about 1.4 million of Gazas population - more than half - were now internally displaced, with many seeking refuge in overcrowded U.N. emergency shelters. Israel has ordered Gaza residents to evacuate the north. But many who had fled appeared to be returning north due to increased bombardments in the south and lack of shelter. They told us to evacuate your place and go to Khan Younis because it is safe... They betrayed us and bombed us, said 18-year-old Dima Al-Lamdani who lost her parents, seven siblings and four members of her uncles family in an air strike after the family moved south. SPREADING VIOLENCE Early on Monday, Israeli warplanes also struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were planning to launch missiles and rockets towards Israel, the Israeli military said. Israel also hit a Hezbollah compound and an observation post. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, two Palestinians were killed at the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said. Residents told Reuters that Israeli forces raided the camp and made many arrests as they clashed with gunmen and some youths who threw stones. The Israeli military said 15 suspects were captured, 10 of them Hamas operatives. A third convoy of 20 aid trucks entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday. The U.N. said aid arriving so far was just 4 of the daily average before the hostilities. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The estimated value of the heroin haul is over Rs. 4.5 billion. On Monday (Oct. 23), it was reported that naval personnel had intercepted a multi-day fishing trawler carrying a large stock of narcotics. The interception resulted from a special operation that the navy had mounted on October 19 on the high seas nearly 292 nautical miles (approximately 540km) off Dondra in Matara, after receiving information from the State Information Service (SIS). Nine sacks containing 200 parcels carrying a total of 219kg and 634g of heroin were found aboard the fishing vessel and five suspects aged between 30-48 years were taken into custody. These individuals are reportedly residents of Kudawella, Tissamaharama, Kottagoda and Mamadala areas. The apprehended trawler and the apprehended suspects were brought ashore and were handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for onward action. Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff, Sagala Ratnayake, and the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, arrived at the Colombo Port this morning (Oct. 24) to inspect the seized consignment of narcotics.

        "title": "French President flies to Israel to push for humanitarian truce and proposals",
        "date": "October 24, 2023 12:11 pm",
        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron flies to Israel on Tuesday at a delicate juncture of its conflict with Hamas, coming with proposals and pushing for a humanitarian truce despite a looming ground offensive into Gaza. His advisers said that beyond showing solidarity with Israel, Macron wanted to make proposals that are as operational as possible to prevent an escalation, free hostages, guarantee Israels security and work towards a two-state solution. The French leader upped the ante before the trip, telling reporters he would only travel to the region if he thought the visit would be useful. Declining to elaborate on what these proposals could be, a Macron adviser only said in a briefing to reporters there were things that could be done so that Israel doesnt feel alone in its fight against terrorism. Macron will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and centrist leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid for the opposition. However, although he has worked the phones and spoken to the leaders of Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, his visit comes late, days after his American, British, German and Italian counterparts. Macrons ability to influence events in the region now seems limited by what some analysts say is a shift towards a more pro-Israel Anglo-American line, in contrast with the traditionally distinctive and more pro-Arab French Gaullist approach. Frances soft power south of the Mediterranean has considerably faded, Karim Emile Bitar, a Beirut-based foreign policy expert at French think tank IRIS, told Reuters. Were under the impression that nothing distinguishes France from other Western countries now, which wasnt historically the case, and is shocking to public opinion in the Arab world, he said. The French governments decision to adopt a blanket ban on pro-Palestinian protests in France, before it was struck down by courts, is one of the reasons why Macron has lost credit in the Arab world, he said. French officials contest the idea that Macrons policy is biased, however. They say Macron has constantly reaffirmed the rights of Palestinians and the position of a two-state solution. Its a goal France has never veered from, the adviser said. A meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was most likely as well as a stop-over in one or more Arab capitals in the region, French officials said. But Macron is also constrained by an explosive situation at home and the fact a number of French nationals are likely held hostage by Hamas. Thirty French citizens were killed on Oct. 7 and seven are still missing. One appeared in a video released by Hamas, but the fate of the other six remains unknown. Macron has vowed on national television that France would not abandon any of its children in Gaza. He told reporters he hoped Qatars mediation could help free hostages. Macrons visit will also take a special resonance at home, where Frances large Muslim and Jewish communities are on tenterhooks following the killing of a teacher by an Islamist militant that French officials have linked to the events in Gaza. The French leader will have to tread a fine line during his tour of the region, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict having often stoked tension back home and Frances fractious opposition being ready to pounce on any faux pas.

According to Ada Derana correspondent, a group of officers attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) took three individuals including two Postal Department workers over their involvement in drug trafficking. The parcel had been addressed to a woman in Mattakkuliya but a man had arrived at the Central Mail Exchange to claim the parcel by producing the womans National Identity Card (NIC). As suspicions were raised by the postal and Customs officials, he had fled the scene. The Postal Department later informed the PNB of the matter, after which investigations were launched in tandem with the Criminal Investigation Department. This man, who was identified as an employee of the Postal Department, was subsequently arrested. During interrogations, he had divulged that the parcel contained 5.7kg of Kush cannabis and that another Postal Department worker was also involved in this drug peddling syndicate. The second postal worker was also later placed under arrest. Upon interrogating the duo, the investigation officers uncovered information about the drug trafficker who leads the syndicate. The 31-year-old from Raththanapitiya was arrested today while he was on his way to pick up the parcel from the two postal workers, as planned. The luxury car, which the suspect was travelling in, was also impounded by the PNB officers.",

This is a decrease of 14.94 when compared to the figure recorded in August 2023, the EDB said further, citing the provisional data released by Sri Lanka Customs. In August 2023, Sri Lanka recorded over USD 1 billion in revenue from merchandise exports. The decline in merchandise exports is attributed to the decreased demand for export products, particularly in sectors such as apparel and textiles; rubber and rubber-based products; and coconut and coconut-based products. The cumulative merchandise exports during the first nine months of 2023 (from January to September) have meanwhile dropped by 10.31 to USD 8,961 million compared to the corresponding period of 2022.

The guard dog, called Bobi, died over the weekend in a veterinary hospital, Leonel Costa told The Associated Press. Bobi lived on a farm in the village of Conqueiros in Portugal with Costa and four cats. He was born on May 11, 1992, when his owner was just 8 years old. In an interview earlier this year, Costa told the Associated Press that Bobis secret to a long life was good food, fresh air and lots of love. Bobi eats what we eat, said Costa. Whats more, Bobi had never been put on a leash. Bobi claimed the Guinness World Record from Bluey, an Australian cattle dog, who died in 1939 aged 29 and had held the record for almost a century. Officials at the Guinness World Records on Monday said they were saddened to learn of the death of Bobi, the worlds oldest dog ever. In a statement on their website, they said Bobi lived to be 31 years and 165 days old and died on Saturday. Bobi was a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of Portuguese dog that has an average life expectancy of some 10 to 14 years. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "October 24, 2023 05:14 pm",
        "content": "Its often said romantic partners need the approval of our friends and family. But now the dating app Tinder is taking things a step further, by enabling friends and family of users to recommend potential matches. Under the Tinder Matchmaker feature, users will be able to grant others access to their accounts for 24 hours so they can suggest likes. Tinder says it makes dating a team sport, but one dating expert warned there could be privacy concerns. It is not uncommon to discuss swipes or potential matches with friends in real life, or even hand the phone to someone else to handle swipes for a while. The Matchmaker feature sends profiles to a group of selected people, chosen by the user, so they can scroll through and give their opinions. This group cannot like or reject potential matches, but can make recommendations. The feature will first be rolled out in 15 countries, including the UK, the US and Australia, before going global in a few months time. Dating expert and matchmaker Sarah Louise Ryan says her one reservation about the new feature is the fact that one persons profile can be shared digitally with other people. The feature means that up to 15 people can view a profile without needing to log in to Tinder to do so. One of the main reasons my clients come to me is for confidentiality, she said. If youre a dating app user, youre happy to leave a digital footprint - but with other singles on the other side of the swipe. So the idea that up to 15 people that you do not know and dont necessarily see their faces - theyre looking at your profile... I dont know how I feel about that. However, Ms Ryan said that Tinder generally had a good record on data privacy. Tinder told the BBC: You can opt out of your profile being shown in the Matchmaker experience, end all active Matchmaker sessions or invite friends to be your Matchmaker via Settings. In 2016, the company said it would review its data privacy policies after being accused of collecting the private data of users without explicit consent. In February 2023, it released an incognito mode, which only shows users profiles to those they have already liked, for paying subscribers. Ms Ryan pointed out that matchmaking for friends and family was common in many communities, having worked with Jewish and Sikh clients herself. Outsourcing ones journey to finding love is not a foreign concept, she said. Outsiders may be able to give a more objective view on potential matches, she added, although too many opinions could cloud ones judgement. Dating app Hinge launched a similar feature in 2017, but it has now closed down. Hinge has been fully owned by Match Group, Tinders parent company, since 2019. Meanwhile, rival dating app Bumble has a feature where individual profiles can be shared with friends outside of the app. Tinder has been approached for comment. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "October 24, 2023 05:57 pm",
        "content": "Senior Adviser on National Security to the President and Chief of the Presidential Staff, Sagala Ratnayaka, announced the forthcoming establishment of an Anti-Narcotic Command to combat the influx of drugs from foreign nations into Sri Lanka. The initiative is being launched in a bid to empower the countrys armed forces and the State Intelligence Service to collaborate with international intelligence agencies when conducting necessary operations. Ratnayaka conveyed these insights today (24 Oct.) while inspecting the recent seizure of over 200 kilograms of heroin valued at over Rs. 4 billion, which was intercepted in the high seas and brought to the Colombo port on Monday (23 Oct.). He emphasized that the drafting of essential legislation to create this Anti-Narcotic Command is currently underway and will soon be presented to the Parliament. Furthermore, Ratnayaka underscored that while 65 of drug raids result in arrests, the remaining 35 continues to infiltrate the country. He stressed the urgency of implementing a modern program aimed at entirely preventing the entry of drugs into our country. Expressing his views further Sagala Ratnayaka said; First and foremost, I extend my congratulations to both the Navy and the Police Narcotics Bureau for successfully apprehending 200 kilograms of heroin. Remarkably, this marks the second substantial drug seizure within a brief span of time. The initial operation was executed based on intelligence provided by the Police Narcotics Bureau, while the most recent operation, according to information from the State Intelligence Service, was carried out by the Navy. The widespread global network of drug trafficking necessitates on-going efforts to safeguard our population from this peril. In collaboration with the Navy, Police and various government agencies, Sri Lanka actively conducts drug raids. These endeavours result in the apprehension of approximately 65 of drugs attempting to enter the country, with the remaining 35 still making their way in. According to the latest intelligence, these drug shipments arrive at the international maritime border via large vessels and are subsequently transported into the country via smaller boats. This expansive drug network poses a significant challenge. Furthermore, there is a concerning possibility of arms trafficking intertwined with these drug trades. Vigilance in this regard is paramount, as it could pose a substantial threat to national security. To address these challenges, the development of new legislation is underway, with the creation of an Anti-Narcotic Command in progress. Proposed laws are in preparation and will be presented to the Parliament for future implementation. Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera and a group of high ranking officers of the Navy were also present on this occasion.",

        "date": "October 24, 2023 06:28 pm",
        "content": "The Welfare Benefits Board on Tuesday (24 Oct.) urged all eligible beneficiaries of the Aswesuma welfare benefit payment program to open their respective bank accounts to receive their entitled benefits, if they have not done so yet. Accordingly, those beneficiaries, whose names have been listed at regional secretariats but have yet to open bank accounts to receive their entitled benefits, have been urged to do so without delay, Chairman of the Welfare Benefits Board, Jayantha Wijeratne said. A discussion was held at the Presidents Office recently, with the participation of the Welfare Benefits Board other related parties, pertaining to the Aswesuma programme which is overseen by State Minister of Finance, Shehan Semasinghe. During the aforementioned discussion, Chairman Wijeratne disclosed that, as of 16 October, an amount of Rs. 7,705,302,250.00 has been disbursed to 1,230,097 families across five benefit categories related to July. He also noted that the remaining payments for July will be finalized by December. However, it was also revealed that there have been delays in providing payments to another group of beneficiaries due to various issues, including pending appeals and protest investigations. State Minister Semasinghe subsequently emphasized the need to investigate the causes of these delays and expedite the disbursement of benefits. Wijeratne stated that approximately two hundred thousand beneficiaries have faced delays in receiving their payments because they havent opened bank accounts yet, assuring that once they open their accounts, they will promptly receive the associated payments without any issues. Beneficiaries of the subsidy can establish their bank accounts at any branch of Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank, National Savings Bank, or Regional Development Bank in their locality by presenting the letter issued by the subsidy computer system of the relevant Regional Secretariat. The bank will then forward the account details to the Good Factor Benefits Board, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) further reported in this regard. To assist those applicants who cannot open bank accounts due to the absence of national identity cards, the Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank, and Regional Development Bank have extended the opportunity, with the condition that applicants provide their national identity cards within six months. During the discussion, the importance of maintaining a robust unit within the divisional secretaries offices for the execution of the relief program was also emphasised. In light of the pressing need for the relevant payment activities to be completed by the end of this year, it was also suggested to declare a special work week to facilitate this. Among those who participated in the discussion were Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the President, Chandima Wickramasinghe, Additional Secretary to the President, K. P. Harsha Wijewardena, Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister (Administration), Champika Kaluarachchi, Additional Secretary (Social Empowerment) of the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, M.

        "content": "Three separate armed attacks in Mexico on Monday left at least 24 people dead, including a dozen police officers, authorities said about the latest violence to hit regions plagued by drug trafficking. In the deadliest incident, unidentified attackers targeted a security patrol in Guerrero states municipality of Coyuca de Benitez, prosecutor Alejandro Hernandez said. At least 13 people were killed and two others wounded in that attack, the state prosecutors office said in a statement, with Hernandez earlier having confirmed that at least 11 of those killed were members of the municipal police force. A senior state security official was traveling in the convoy when it was attacked, authorities said, without confirming media reports that he was murdered along with police bodyguards. Security forces were later seen patrolling the area  where several lifeless bodies lay on the ground  as a police helicopter flew overhead. Another attack, in the neighboring state of Michoacan, left four civilians and a policeman dead, and two others wounded, authorities said. A group of gunmen had attacked the brother of the mayor of the town of Tacambaro, according to the state prosecutors office. A restaurant worker and a member of the police force were among those killed, while the mayors brother was wounded, it said. In a video posted on social media, gunmen were seen opening fire before fleeing in several vehicles. A third attack on Monday, a gunfight between alleged drug dealers in the central Mexican state of Puebla, left at least six dead and two wounded, the regional government reported. The incident took place in the rural community of San Miguel Canoa, about 75 miles from Mexico City. Mexico is plagued by cartel-related bloodshed that has seen more than 420,000 people murdered since the government deployed the military in its war on drugs in 2006. Since then, the countrys murder rate has tripled to 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Mexico has also registered more than 110,000 disappearances since 1962, most attributed to criminal organizations. Guerrero and Michoacan are among the countrys most violent areas, due to confrontations between rival drug traffickers and security forces. Although it is home to the famed coastal resort of Acapulco, Guerrero is one of Mexicos poorest states. Violence  particularly targeting low-level officials  often escalates across the country in the run-up to elections. Presidential and parliamentary polls are set to be held next year. Even so, experts said the latest wave of violence was particularly shocking. Guerrero has long seen one of Mexicos most complicated armed conflicts, but the current, pre-electoral levels of violence are extraordinary, Falko Ernst, an analyst at International Crisis Group, wrote on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. Since taking office in 2018, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has championed a hugs not bullets strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by fighting poverty and inequality with social programs, rather than with the army.

        "date": "October 24, 2023 11:00 pm",
        "content": "The officers of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) told the court today (Oct. 24) that they have uncovered information about an alleged plot to execute a terrorist-like attack, designed to aid the escape of notorious criminal figure and drug lord Harak Kata who is currently in custody. Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage has ordered the initiation of an investigation into the purported plot and called for a report on the findings. Meanwhile, two former army commandos have been arrested over their complicity in this purported attack plot. The CID officers also produced two audio tapes indicating the two ex-commandos discussing the plan hatched to free Harak Kata. It was reported that the duo had been removed from the Army commando regiment on disciplinary grounds. They have told the investigating officers that a group of six was preparing to use some smoke to knock out the CID officers and to enter the CID premises clad in police unforms. Further investigations revealed that the plan was hatched by Harak Katas close associate Midigama Chooti who currently in hiding abroad. In September, Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata attempted a failed escape bid at the CID premises. The ill-famed underworld figure, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with the help of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  a police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and detained Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date. Now the police have offered a cash reward of Rs. 2.5 million for a tip-off about the said officer named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara. On 18 September, the mother and brother-in-law of this constable were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention to interrogate them. Meanwhile, another Constable was arrested on September 30 on suspicion of his involvement in notorious underworld figure Harak Katas escape bid. Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu on March 01 this year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry on March 08 of the arrest of eight suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking.",

        "date": "October 24, 2023 11:32 pm",
        "content": "The Kremlin on Tuesday denied a report that President Vladimir Putin was ill, and laughed off persistent rumours that he used body doubles to cover for him in public appearances. Everything is fine with him, this is absolutely another fake, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about an unsourced report by a Russian Telegram channel, picked up by some Western media, that the president had suffered a serious health episode on Sunday evening. The spokesman laughed in response to a further question about body doubles, and denied that Putin had any. This belongs to the category of absurd information hoaxes that a whole series of media discuss with enviable tenacity. This evokes nothing but a smile, Peskov said. Putin, a judo enthusiast who has long cultivated an action man image, turned 71 on Oct. 7. He maintains an intensive schedule of meetings and public appearances, many of them televised. His recent programme included a visit to China last week, with stop-offs in two Russian cities on the way back. In a 2020 interview, Putin denied longstanding rumours that he uses body doubles, although he said he had been offered the chance to use one in the past for security reasons.

        "title": "Govt to implement water tariff formula in January 2024",
        "date": "October 25, 2023 08:01 am",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman, emphasized that there are no plans to increase the water tariffs. Instead, the ministry is diligently working on implementing a water tariff formula, set to roll out in January 2024, he said. He assured the public that following the water tariff hike in August 2023, there will be no further increases. The focus is now on developing a cost recovery formula, a collaborative effort with the Water Board, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) project, an integral part of a policy-based sub-program. This sub-program aims to contribute US  100 million to the centralized budget upon completion, he said. Minister Thondaman addressing the News Briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (24) under the theme Collective path to a stable country clarified the governments stance on water tariffs and announced initiatives to support the Upcountry community. He refuted the recent rumours speculating about the current formulas intention to guarantee fair water access while safeguarding those in vulnerable segments of society. These individuals are beneficiaries of social welfare programs such as Samurdhi and Aswasuma, and this speculation is seen in light of the upcoming elections. The Minister emphasised that notably, of the approximately 2.96 million connections within the Water Board, the estate sectors are excluded, as they fall under the Rural Community Water Supply Department. This department extends its services not only to the estate community but to all rural areas, working closely with 5,000 community-based organizations. Therefore, the water tariff in question applies exclusively to Water Board consumers. In addition to this, Minister Thondaman shared that the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure is preparing to commemorate the Upcountry communitys contributions to the nation spanning two hundred years on November 2nd. The Ministry is also actively engaged in initiatives aimed at benefiting the Upcountry community, he said. A charter, featuring seven committees, has been formed within the ministry to address a wide range of issues specific to the plantation sector. These committees are dedicated to economic upliftment of women and children, on gender equality, health, education, sports and other activities. He said this charter will serve as a comprehensive guideline for all ministries, offering insights into how to address the unique concerns of the Upcountry community and reintegrate them into Sri Lankan society, ending their isolation within the plantation sector. Minister Thondaman underlined the significance of the Upcountry community, consisting of approximately 200,000 estate working families and roughly about 150,000- 200,000 workers. Further an additional 800,000 to 1.2 million individuals who are part of their families, reside within the estates. He stressed the importance of recognizing not only estate workers but also the broader community and their identities in these endeavours, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported.",

        "title": "China ousts defence minister after two-month public absence",
        "date": "October 25, 2023 09:09 am",
        "content": "China has replaced Defense Minister Gen. Li Shangfu, who has been out of public view for almost two months, state media reported Tuesday. No further information was given. Li is the second senior Chinese official to disappear this year, following former Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who was removed from office in July with no explanation offered. Li, who became defense minister during a Cabinet reshuffle in March, hasnt been seen since giving a speech on Aug. 29. There is no indication that the disappearances of Qin and Li signal a change in Chinas foreign or defense policies, although they have raised questions about the resilience of president and ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinpings circle of power. Xi has a reputation for valuing loyalty above all and has relentlessly attacked corruption in public and private, sometimes in what has been seen as a method of eliminating political rivals and shoring up his political position amid a deteriorating economy and rising tensions with the U.S. over trade, technology and Taiwan. Li is under U.S. sanctions related to his overseeing weapon purchases from Russia that bar him from entering the country. China has since cut off contacts with the U.S. military, mainly in protest over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, but also strongly implying that Washington must lift the measures against Li, which Beijing refuses to publicly recognize. The announcement from state broadcaster CCTV said that both Li and Qin had been removed from the State Council, Chinas Cabinet and the center of government power. That virtually assures the end of their political careers, although it remains unclear whether they will face prosecution or other legal sanctions. CCTV also announced Lan Foans new appointment as finance minister, and Yin Hejun as science and technology minister. Chinas political and legal systems remain highly opaque, fueling lively discussion of possible corruption, personal foibles or fallings-out with other powerful figures leading to the downfall of top officials. Along with dealing with what appear to be internal political issues, the ruling party is struggling to revive an economy that has been severely impacted by the draconian zero-Covid measures, an aging population, high unemployment among college graduates and a movement of many of its wealthiest and best educated to more liberal societies abroad. Having had his ideology, known as Xi Jinping Thought, enshrined in the party constitution and with the abolishment of presidential term limits, Xi has structured the system so that he may stay in power for the rest of his life. The 70-year-old also heads the party and state committees overseeing the Peoples Liberation Army, the worlds largest standing military with more than 2 million personnel on active duty.

Roundtree died at his home in Los Angeles of pancreatic cancer, the Reporter said, citing his manager, Patrick McMinn. Roundtrees representatives did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for confirmation. Richards work and career served as a turning point for African American leading men in film. The impact he had on the industry cannot be overstated, McMinn said in a statement, according to Variety, another show business trade publication.

Roundtree shot to fame with the 1971 Blaxploitation movie Shaft about a private detective in the Harlem section of New York, and he reprised the role in a number of sequels and a short-lived network TV series. The rugged and streetwise character, who wore flashy leather jackets and who was accompanied by a catchy theme song from Isaac Hayes, helped define cool for a Black leading man and also gained acceptance from white audiences. Roundtree also had a role in the groundbreaking ABC television slavery drama Roots in 1977 and other prominent projects of the era, playing motorcycle daredevil Miles in 1974s Earthquake. Among his more poignant films was 1996s Once Upon a Time ... When We Were Colored, the story of a tight-knit Black community confronting the racism of post-war Mississippi. He also played opposite Peter OTooles Robinson Crusoe in Man Friday in 1975 and alongside Laurence Oliviers depiction of General Douglas MacArthur in 1981s Inchon. Roundtree worked regularly until the end, with 159 acting credits to his name plus three upcoming projects yet to be released, according to IMDB.com. He was married twice and is survived by four daughters - Nicole, Tayler, Morgan and Kelli Roundtree - and his son, James, Variety said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "October 25, 2023 12:02 pm",
        "content": "Israel vowed again to destroy Hamas, rejecting calls for a cease-fire from the U.N. chief, the Palestinians and many countries at a high-level U.N. meeting on Tuesday and declaring that the war in Gaza is not only its war but the war of the free world. Israels Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also dismissed calls for proportionality in the countrys response to Hamas surprise attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 people and has since led to more than 5,700 Palestinian deaths in Gaza according to its Health Ministry. Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape (of) women and burn them, for beheading a child? Cohen asked. How can you agree to a cease-fire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence? He told the U.N. Security Council that the proportionate response to the Oct. 7 massacre is a total destruction to the last one of the Hamas, calling the extremist group the new Nazis. He stressed: It is not only Israels right to destroy Hamas. Its our duty. Cohen called the Oct. 7 attacks a wake-up call for the entire free world against extremism, and he urged the civilized world to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas. And he warned that today it is Israel, and tomorrow Hamas and the attackers will be at everyones doorstep, starting with the West. Cohen also accused Qatar of financing Hamas and said the fate of the more than 200 hostages taken from Israel, some of whose families came to the U.N. meeting, was in the hands of its emir. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki demanded an end to the Israeli attacks. We are here today to stop the killing, to stop  the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel, the occupying power, against the Palestinian civilian population, he said. Over 2 million Palestinians are on a survival mission every day, every night. Under international law, he said it is our collective human duty to stop them. Al-Maliki warned that more attacks and killings and weapons and alliances wont make Israel safer: Only peace will. For those actively engaged to avoid an even greater humanitarian catastrophe and regional spillover, it must be clear that this can only be achieved by putting an immediate end to the Israeli war launched against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, he said. Stop the bloodshed. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the monthly meeting on the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which has turned into a major event with ministers from the wars key parties and a dozen other countries flying to New York  warning that the situation in the Middle East is growing more dire by the hour. As the council met, a barrage of Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip crushed multiple residential buildings and buried families under rubble. Nearly 90 countries were on the speakers list including about 30 foreign ministers and deputy ministers, many echoing calls for a cease-fire and halt to attacks on Palestinian civilians. The U.N. chief said the risk of the Gaza war spreading through the region is increasing as societies splinter and tensions threaten to boil over. He called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to deliver desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel. He also appealed to all to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther. Guterres stressed that the rules of war must be obeyed. He said the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrifying and unprecedented Oct. 7 acts of terror by Hamas in Israel and demanded the immediate release of all hostages. But Guterres also stressed that those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. He expressed deep concern at the clear violations of international humanitarian law, calling Israels constant bombardment of Gaza and the level of destruction and civilian casualties alarming. Protecting civilians is paramount in any armed conflict, he said. Without naming Hamas, the U.N. chief stressed that protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields. Guterres also criticized Israel without naming it, saying protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself. Cohen, in his address to the council, criticized the secretary-generals remarks. After being told by a reporter at a stakeout later that the secretary-general stood by his statement, the Israeli minister said: There is no cause for this, and shame on him. Israels U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan went further, taking issue especially with Guterres statement that its important to recognize that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. He accused the secretary-general of having lost all morality and impartiality and called for his resignation. By contrast, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking for Israels closest ally, thanked the U.N. chief for your leadership in this incredibly challenging time, particularly in getting humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. He stressed Israels right to defend itself against terrorism but also called for protection of Palestinian civilians saying: We know Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people and Palestinian civilians are not to blame for the carnage committed by Hamas. He said Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians and humanitarian pauses must be considered to get aid flowing into Gaza and enable civilians to get out of harms way. Blinken told the council all countries are determined to prevent the conflict from spreading, saying a broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis but for people across the region and indeed around the world. He warned Iran  which supports Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen  that while the U.S. doesnt seek a conflict, it will respond swiftly and decisively to any attack on U.S. personnel by its forces or its proxies anywhere in the world. Irans U.N. Ambassador Amir Iravani later accused Blinken of wrongly attempting to blame Iran for the Hamas attack, rejecting his groundless allegations and saying the Islamic Republic is committed to regional peace and security, and supports the call for an immediate cease-fire. He echoed secretary-general Guterres statement that the Oct. 7 attack didnt happen in a vacuum and claimed the U.S. unwavering support for Israel and its rapid provision of military and logistical support made the U.S. complicit in the brutal massacre of innocent Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. Iravani also claimed that Israel, as an occupying power, has no right to self-defense in Gaza under the U.N. Charter. But he said the Charter does recognize the right to self-determination and self-defense for the Palestinian people, which Iran supports, including resistance groups like Hamas, in the struggle against Israeli occupation. The United States is pushing for adoption of a resolution that would condemn the Hamas attacks in Israel and violence against civilians, and reaffirm Israels right to self-defense. There were some expectations that it might be voted on Tuesday, but diplomats said it was still being negotiated. Russias U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council Moscow rejects the U.S. draft and is demanding an immediate ceasefire. The U.S. draft does not mention a cease-fire and Nebenzia said Russia is putting forward its own new proposed resolution. Jordans Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, speaking on behalf of the 22-memeber Arab Group at the United Nations, accused Israel of waging a war that is killing innocent civilians and razing Gaza to the ground in violation of international law without any deterrent. And the Security Council didnt even call for a cease-fire, he said, urging the U.N. body charged with maintaining international peace and security to adopt a resolution to stop the war, condemn the killing of civilians on both sides, and prevent the starvation of Palestinians and their collective punishment. The Security Council must take a clear stance to reassure two billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied, Safadi said. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says 75 of imports of Beedi leaves are carried out through informal means due to the high import tax of Rs. 5,000 charged per 1 kilogram.

The state minister made these remarks during a meeting held with Beedi manufacturers at the Presidential Secretariat. Siyambalapitiya further mentioned that the government is mulling the registration and regulation of small-scale Beedi manufacturers in the country. He, however, clarified that the government, at no point, endorses Beedi as it is yet another cigarette, but only aims to protect the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people who are engaged in this industry and to recover the lost revenues.",

The SLPP MP thus opined that the changing of portfolios and positions does not allow for such a system to be implemented, nor does it resolve any of the countrys issues. While acknowledging the Head of States right to make decisions such as the recent Cabinet reshuffle, the SLPP MP emphasised the Presidents responsibility is to create a system beneficial to the countrys citizens, and thereby highlighted the due responsibility to consult all political parties affiliated with the coalition government when making such decisions. Electricity bills have increased, water bills too, are expected to increase and there is also talk of new taxes being introduced. The President openly admitted to increasing electricity tariffs following discussion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). If they are going to take political decisions based on discussions with the IMF, instead of with the related political parties, then that it is their way of governance. But the end result is the fact that people of this country are the ones who are left affected. If they think that such discussions and measures would resolve the countrys health crisis, or help drag Sri Lanka and its citizens out of this economic crisis that they have been forced to face; they are wrong, the SLPP MP stated, highlighting that no proper measures are being taken to maintaining living expenses at affordable rates. Commenting on President Ranil Wickremesinghes decision-making, the SLPP MP stated that while the political party is grateful for the fact that he accepted the presidency when invited to do so at a time where the country was in turmoil, and other potential candidates backed out, it is imperative that the President, in his capacity as a seasoned politician, understands coalition politics and the need for discussions with all political parties, or at least the patty leaders, prior to making certain decisions. Thus, Rajapaksa stated that with the upcoming discussions for the Appropriation Bill (The Budget) for the fiscal year 2024, he hoped that the President will implement a mechanism that would bring relief to the people.",

        "date": "October 25, 2023 04:42 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday (25 Oct.) granted leave to proceed with an appeal submitted by the Attorney General, seeking the conviction of a Sri Lankan national who was acquitted of raping and 18-year-old in Korea in 1998. The relevant decision was delivered following the consideration of the facts presented by Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana to the three-judge Supreme Court bench comprising of Justices S. Thurairajah, Shiran Gooneratne and Janak de Silva. Three Sri Lankan men in Korea were charged with the rape of 18-year-old Jeong Eun-Hui, a Korean university student who was returning from a late-night party in Daegu city in South Korea, in 1998. While Korean investigators were only able to muster up the DNA evidence against one of the three men, the DNA profile was subsequently stored away on account of being an unknown criminal as per the Korean National Forensic Service, until 2013, when the probe was re-opened. It was later found out that the suspect was awaiting trial in South Korea in relation to a charge of attempting to have a sexual relationship with a minor in 2010. He, and the other two individuals involved in the attack were subsequently charged with the rape of Jeong Eun-Hui, but were later acquitted due to a law in South Korea that states a rape charge should be brought within 10 years of such a crime.",

        "date": "October 25, 2023 04:47 pm",
        "content": "The reconstructed head and torso of a young girl likely sacrificed to appease Incan gods was unveiled in Peru on Tuesday, with three-dimensional scans of her mummy helping produce the lifelike recreation more than 500 years after her death. Scientists from both Peru and Poland used digital scans of her mostly well-preserved mummy, which was found in 1995 inside an Inca-era funerary bundle near the summit of the Ampato volcano outside Arequipa, in Perus south. Ruling over a massive swath of western South America along the Pacific coast and Andean highlands, the Inca saw their rich and powerful empire fall to Spanish invaders in 1532. But some time before then, the girl was sacrificed by a blow to the head, possibly in a ritual ceremony that sought divine relief from natural disasters, according to the scientists. Dubbed the Lady of Ampato, or simply Juanita, she was believed to be either 14 or 15 years old. The reconstruction now on display at the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa shows her mouth slightly open and dark, piercing eyes gazing into the distance. It includes colorful attire, head covering and adornments, similarly based on the scans of the mummy. Its been done in a magnificent way, said archaeologist Johan Reinhard, who was part of the team that found the mummy, adding that the reconstruction was especially striking since her face had been exposed to the elements and as a result was not well preserved. Seeing her face like when she was alive, its a different experience because it seems so real, he said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",
