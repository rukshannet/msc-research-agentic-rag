        "title": "India stampede: About 116 killed at religious event in Hathras district",
        "date": "July 2, 2024 10:44 pm",
        "content": "At least 116 people, many of them women and children, were killed in a stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in north India on Tuesday, authorities said, in one of the countrys worst such tragedies in years. The stampede happened in a village in Hathras district, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of the national capital New Delhi, where authorities said thousands had gathered in sweltering late afternoon temperatures. The incident happened due to overcrowding at the time when people were trying to leave the venue, Ashish Kumar, administrator of the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, told reporters. Chaitra V., another senior state official, told broadcaster India Today that people may have lost their footing as they sought water in the heat. There was wet mud at one place where people may have slipped. Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well, she said. A video on social media showed a large crowd packed into a tented area, standing and listening to devotional tunes as they waved their hands in the direction of the religious leader who sat on a stage. Video clips recorded by news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed bodies piled into the back of trucks and laid out in vehicles. Purses and bags covered in dust, were heaped up at the venue, with people sitting on their haunches sifting through them to identify their belongings. Mobile phones were similarly piled together, waiting to be claimed by their owners. It also showed some women hanging on to the bamboo poles holding up the canopy to get a better view above the heads of the large crowd. Reuters could not immediately verify the social media images. There must have been about 50,000 people...at the gate on the highway, some people were going left and some people were going right, the stampede was caused in that confusion, Suresh Chandra, a witness who was at the gathering, told local media. Seema, a woman who travelled from a town almost 60 km away to attend the event, said she was leaving the venue when the stampede occurred. She was accompanied by three relatives, two of whom were killed. Stampedes and other accidents involving large crowds at religious gatherings and pilgrimage sites have happened in the past and are often blamed on poor crowd management. While 115 people were killed in central India in a stampede in 2013, nearly 250 died in 2008 and more than 340 were killed during an annual pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra in 2005, according to local media reports. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered an investigation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the federal government was assisting the state and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees (2,400) to the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees to those injured.

Excise Commissioner M. J. Gunasiri stated that by June 30, the department had reached its revenue target. Gunasiri highlighted that, We have collected Rs. 105 billion as planned by the Excise Department by June 30. By this time last year, we had collected Rs. 88 billion. He emphasized that the department had achieved a notable increase of Rs. 17 billion in revenue collection. The department had initially anticipated a revenue growth of Rs. 20 billion within the first half of the year. However, due to natural disasters and issues at a major production plant, they incurred a shortfall of approximately Rs. 3 billion. Gunasiri remarked that if not for these setbacks, they could have reached their target of Rs. 107 billion. Despite these challenges, the department still managed to achieve almost a 20 growth compared to last year, a remarkable achievement for the Excise Department, he said.",

        "content": "The death toll from a stampede at a Hindu religious congregation in northern India has risen to 121, news agency ANI reported on Wednesday, where a police report said the number of people present was more than triple the permitted capacity. The stampede on Tuesday was at the religious event in a village in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh state, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of New Delhi, where police had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, according to the document, the first information report. Around 250,000 people attended the event, according to the police report reviewed by Reuters. At least 121 people were killed and 28 were injured, ANI news agency reported, citing local officials. The victims included 108 women and seven children, Manoj Kumar Singh, Uttar Pradesh states chief secretary, told reporters. The document described a scene of utter chaos when the preacher at the congregation, Surajpal, also known as Bhole Baba, was leaving in his car. Thousands of devotees shouted and ran towards the car, crushing others still sitting in the gathering, according to the document. Some people also fell into an adjacent field of slush and mud and were trampled there. Local media said the event was organised by a group of devotees, but did not identify anyone. ANI news agency, in which Reuters has a minority stake, said police were trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the preacher. Police officials in Hathras were not immediately available for comment. The devotees at the event included Kamla, who said she had been attending the preachers gatherings for two decades. I went to attend satsang (religious meet) with my 16-year old daughter and a stampede broke out around 2 in the afternoon, she told ANI.

        "title": "High-tech cash: Japan launches banknotes with hologram portraits",
        "date": "July 3, 2024 11:00 am",
        "content": "Japan began circulating its first new banknotes in 20 years on Wednesday, featuring three-dimensional portraits of the founders of financial and female education institutions in an attempt to frustrate counterfeiters. The notes use printed patterns to generate holograms of the portraits facing different directions, depending on the angle of view, employing a technology that Japans National Printing Bureau says is the worlds first for paper money. Faces of those representing Japans capitalism, womens empowerment and technology innovation are on the new bills, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a function. The step comes just as the economy moves into a growth-driven phase for the first time in three decades, he added. Though existing bills stay in use, train stations, parking lots and ramen shops are scrambling to upgrade payment machines as the government pushes consumers and businesses to use less cash in its bid to digitise the economy. The new 10,000-yen (62) note depicts Eiichi Shibusawa (1840-1931), the founder of the first bank and stock exchange, who is often called the father of Japanese capitalism. The new 5,000-yen bill portrays educator Umeko Tsuda (1864-1929), who founded one of the first womens universities in Japan, while the 1,000-yen bill features a pioneering medical scientist, Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853-1931). Currency authorities plan to print about 7.5 billion newly-designed bills by the end of the current fiscal year. They will add to the 18.5 billion banknotes worth 125 trillion yen already in circulation as of December 2023. Cash is a secure means of payment that can be used by anyone, anywhere, and at any time, and it will continue to play a significant role despite alternatives, said Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan. The central bank has been conducting experiments on digital currencies, but the government has made no decision on whether to issue a digital yen. Cashless payments in Japan have almost tripled over the past decade to make up 39 of consumer spending in 2023, but still lag global peers and should rise to 80 to boost productivity, the government says. Roughly 90 of bank ATMs, train ticket machines and retail cash registers are ready for the new bills, but only half of restaurant and parking ticket machines, the Japan Vending Machine Manufacturers Association said. Nearly 80 of the nations 2.2 million drink vending machines also need upgrades, it added. It might take until year-end to respond to this, said Takemori Kawanami, an executive at ticket machine company Elcom. Thats too slow, but we are short of components, he added, as client orders for upgrades exceeded expectations. Many Japanese fast-food restaurants such as ramen shops and beef bowl stores rely on ticket machines to cut labour costs, but some small business owners battling inflation are unhappy at the extra investment the new bills entail. The machine replacement has no sales impact, so its only negative for us, on top of rising costs of labour and ingredients, said Shintaro Sekiguchi, who spent about 600,000 yen for ticket machines at three ramen shops he runs in Tokyo.

        "date": "July 3, 2024 03:51 pm",

He declared that no one would be permitted to disrupt school education between 7:30 am and 1:30 pm and he has directed the Attorney General to consider further measures to ensure this, Presidents Media Division reported. No one, whether directly or indirectly, should disrupt school education from 7.30 am to 1.30 pm. I have requested the Attorney General to propose measures regarding this issue, he said. The President stated that it is imperative that the education of children is not hindered by school closures or strikes. Our actions must be taken with future generations in mind. The President said he also discussed with the Education Minister regarding the possibility of implementing a computerized teacher transfer system. Fairness must prevail in promotions and in the treatment of teachers. Moving forward, we will take stronger measures on this front, even if it may provoke dissent. This is the reality we must confront to secure a better future for our children, he said. The President made these remarks while attending a ceremony at Temple Trees today (03), where appointments were awarded to officers of the Education Administrative Service, as well as teaching appointments to graduates and diploma holders. The president, who requested that everyone prioritize childrens education, also asked the opposition not to support acts of sabotage. Furthermore, the President mentioned that he has discussed with the Minister of Education the future process of teacher transfers and promotions through an online system, emphasizing that no one will face injustice in these matters. Appointments were granted to 60 individuals approved by the Education Service Committee of the Public Service Commission, and teaching positions were awarded to 1,706 graduates and 453 English diploma holders. President Ranil Wickremesinghe symbolically presented several appointments to them. The president further elaborated, Congratulations to all of you entering the administrative and teaching services. Today, you are assuming a very important responsibility. Even when the country faced bankruptcy in the past two years, and as we took steps to recover, funding for education was increased. Teachers were recruited not only for existing vacancies but also for future needs. It must be said that even in difficult times, these steps were taken with a focus on the countrys future. Our future is our children. That is why the government is committed to equipping the next generation with new knowledge and modern technology in a changing world. This is a responsibility we all share. Therefore, everyone entering this honourable profession should dedicate their service to the future generation and must be disciplined. Education in a country cannot be maintained without discipline. You may have 40-50 students in your classroom, but there is a difference between a teacher and a military officer. Military officers train adults, whereas you will be guiding a group of individuals under 18 years of age who need proper training and attention. If we do not protect the countrys education system and allow it to be disrupted, we will lose our future generation. To build the countrys economy, we must move forward rapidly. In the next 20-25 years, we should aim to raise our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from USD 85 billion to at least USD 350 billion for our future generations. It is, therefore, the responsibility of all of us to focus on and prioritize the childrens future. The teaching profession is distinct from other services; it carries a unique dignity that must be upheld. Todays schools must uphold discipline. Strikes in schools are detrimental and unjustified. In 2022, under President Gotabaya Rajapaksas administration, the only salary increase was for teachers. This year, we provided a stipend of Rs. 10,000 for all government employees. Given the countrys economic situation, further increases were not feasible. Some trade unions have requested a revision and additional salary increases, which is surprising considering teachers have already received two salary increments. Recently, teachers went on strike, abandoning classrooms to protest at the Colombo Fort railway station. University students and others joined, demonstrating and attempting to reach the Presidential Secretariat, even amidst tear gas. While protests are not new, such actions do not befit the honourable teaching profession. In the past, teachers on strike would still teach without signing attendance books, or they might wear a black armband while continuing their duties, as seen in some countries. However, the most recent strike was entirely different. This situation did not occur in Tamil and Muslim schools, where educational activities for children continued. Similarly, international schools and private schools maintained their educational activities effectively. However, Sinhala-medium schools had to face disruptions. Children from rural areas attend these schools. I question whether this is also a responsibility of the teaching profession. Teachers of Tamil and Muslim schools recognized the importance of education. When Sinhala-medium schools in places like Nuwara Eliya were disrupted, education continued in Tamil-medium schools. Such disparities should not exist in our country. In certain schools, teachers faced threats preventing them from attending. People fault the government for its lack of action and accuse the opposition of backing such incidents. This situation is troubling. No one, whether directly or indirectly, should disrupt school education from 7:30 am to 1:30 pm. I have requested the Attorney General to propose measures regarding this issue. It is imperative that the education of children is not hindered by school closures or strikes. Our actions must be taken with future generations in mind. Yesterday, I discussed with the minister the possibility of implementing a computerized teacher transfer system. Fairness must prevail in promotions and in the treatment of teachers. Moving forward, we will take stronger measures on this front, even if it may provoke dissent. This is the reality we must confront to secure a better future for our children. Therefore, I urge everyone to prioritize the future of our children. I particularly appeal to the opposition not to endorse actions that sabotage education. We must heed the voices of the people and parents in our decisions. Once again, I extend my best wishes to all entering the teaching profession today. Minister of Education, Susil Premajayantha, Granting these teacher appointments is not an easy task. We undertook the task amid an economic crisis, striving to fulfil nearly 2000 appointments for national schools today. The economic strategy led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe aimed to alleviate the countrys financial challenges and establish stability has shown promising results. During a period of economic turmoil, as the Minister of Finance, President Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed you while allocating funds. I urge you not to jeopardize the future of our children by accepting these appointments and participating in trade union actions. Your educational journey as a graduate was made possible by the dedication of teachers. It is crucial to ensure our children receive education and pursue careers, lest their future be obscured. In the past, teachers took trade union action against a bill proposed by Minister of Education Mr. Iriyagolle, teaching children without signing the book. I believe their actions serve as a commendable example. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during his tenure as Minister of Education, established the National Institute of Education and significantly strengthened the educational infrastructure. He also introduced the University Grants Commission Act, and under the current presidents leadership, science faculties have been established, producing approximately 5000 teachers annually. Having someone with such a distinguished record in the sector of education as the current president is a great asset to the education sector. In the upcoming education reforms, efforts are underway to ensure that university graduates have ample job opportunities without the need for undue influence. These reforms aim to produce graduates well-suited for the job market.

        "date": "July 3, 2024 05:50 pm",
        "content": "The management of the financially-burdened Mattala International Airport will soon be entrusted to a joint venture between an Indian and Russian firm within the next few weeks, says Sri Lankas Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva. He also said that the development of the Kankesanthurai Port is progressing with assistance amounting to USD 69 million from India. Minister de Silva further affirmed that the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, will undergo restructuring instead of being sold. He emphasized that according to existing regulations, only up to 49 of the airlines shares can be transferred to another entity, yet no suitable investor has expressed interest thus far. Addressing the press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (03), Minister Siripala de Silva further said: President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed Parliament yesterday (02), outlining the on-going debt restructuring crucial for the countrys economic progress. Despite political scepticism from the opposition, he emphasized that the message conveyed was largely positive for the countrys interests. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund is actively involved in the restructuring process based strictly on legal frameworks, regulations, and objective criteria, without regard to personal considerations. Sajith Premadasa noted examples such as Argentina, Ecuador, and Ghana, which have successfully negotiated a 25 reduction in commercial loans, distinct from bilateral debts. Discussions to restructure commercial debt within Sri Lanka are on-going, with evolving criteria influenced by IMF assessments of each countrys economic resilience. It is stressed that pursuing narrow political objectives without acknowledging internationally accepted realities would be inappropriate in this context. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has initiated the first step towards rebuilding the country from its recent challenges. The next crucial step is to safeguard and propel it forward, crucial in preventing a regression to conditions of two years ago. This years budget allocates funds not only for provincial councils, Pradeshiya Sabha and government departments, but also for social security benefits like Aswesuma. Those activities are not being conducted in anticipation of the elections. Furthermore, SriLankan Airlines should be addressed here. Our approach involves restructuring the airline rather than selling it outright. Under Sri Lankan law, only 49 of SriLankan Airlines shares can be transferred to another entity. However, there has been minimal global interest in this opportunity, with only six individuals expressing interest, none of whom were deemed suitable. Even if we were to extend this opportunity to a Sri Lankan entrepreneur, their capabilities would need to be demonstrated. Additionally, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is set to discuss the resumption of their projects next week, marking another advantage of debt restructuring. Despite interest from Chinese firms in the airport project, contractual obligations with Japan stipulate that contracts should be awarded to Japanese companies. Furthermore, the management of the financially burdened Mattala Airport will soon be entrusted to a joint venture between Russia and India. Development at the Kankesanthurai port is progressing with assistance amounting to USD 69 million from India. During a recent visit to Sri Lanka, Indian Foreign Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar confirmed plans to initiate a ferry service between Sri Lanka and India in the near future. --PMD",

        "title": "Kamala Harris top choice to replace Joe Biden if he steps aside, sources say",
        "date": "July 3, 2024 09:06 pm",
        "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is the top alternative to replace U.S. President Joe Biden if he decides not to continue his reelection campaign, according to seven senior sources at the Biden campaign, the White House and the Democratic National Committee with knowledge of current discussions on the topic. Bidens fumbling, sometimes-incoherent and widely-panned first-debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump last week set off a wave of panic within the Democratic party over concerns that he may not be fit enough to serve a second term, and prompted calls for top aides to resign. Some influential Democrats have floated alternatives to Biden besides Harris, including popular cabinet members and Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom from California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. But trying to sidestep Harris is wishful thinking and would be nearly impossible, these sources, who did not wish to be named, said. If named as the party nominee, Harris, 59, would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, the sources said. She also has the highest name recognition among all the alternatives, and the highest polling among Democrats who could seriously be considered a candidate, the sources said. In a ReutersIpsos poll published Tuesday, Harris trailed Trump by one percentage point at 42 to 43, a difference that was well within the polls 3.5 percentage point margin of error, a showing statistically just as strong as Bidens. In addition, she has already been vetted for national office and has survived intense scrutiny from Republicans, they said. Also, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the man who was key to Bidens 2020 win, told MSNBC he would support Harris to be the Democratic nominee if Biden stepped aside. Its pretty near impossible to win the nomination over the vice president, said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist from California who worked for Hillary Clintons campaign in 2008 and 2016. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that Biden just had a bad night at the debate and would continue to make his case for reelection to the American people. The Biden campaign deferred to Harriss team for comment on the story. Harriss aides dismissed any talk of a Democratic ticket that doesnt include both Biden and Harris. Vice President Harris looks forward to serving a second term with President Joe Biden, a statement from her office said. Bidens campaign has amassed 3,894 delegates after state primaries, leaving only a few dozen uncommitted delegates outstanding. They are expected to formally nominate Biden later this month in a virtual meeting, ahead of the Democrats nominating convention in August. All of the delegates are not just Joe Biden delegates, they are Kamala Harris delegates, Trujillo said, adding she will have a sizable delegation and support in all 50 states on day one, he said. Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, who has a key committee role at this years Democratic National Convention in August, said the person who can step in right away, if Biden decides not to run, is Harris. People may have dreams of another superhero but there is a process and the last time I checked its a Biden-Harris ticket, shes number two on the ticket, Brazile said, adding Biden remains the nominee for the Democratic party and is not going anywhere. Passing over the first Black and woman vice president for another candidate would lead to a backlash from Black and women voters who are key to any victory, several Democratic strategists said. IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE KAMALA Still, Harris has been sidestepped in a lot of the speculation since the debate because some influential Democrats have little faith she can beat Trump, four of the sources said. The United States has never elected a woman president, and Harris has spent much of her time as vice president struggling to distinguish herself in a role that is by definition a supporting one. As recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign privately worried she was a liability for the campaign. Since then, Harris has managed to find her stride on the issue of abortion rights but her polling has not improved significantly. Harriss approval ratings hover under 40, but according to recent polling highlighted by the Biden campaign, she and the president have similar odds of beating Trump. The vice president has also been consistently targeted by Republicans and conservative media in attacks many allies consider sexist and racist. Three Democratic donors, who have recently been pushing for Biden to step aside, also said this week they think it will be impossible to sidestep Harris. The donors had been floating Whitmer and Newsoms names as possible alternatives until the past weekend. There is a real conversation in the Democratic party about leadership right now, but fair to say, and Im not thrilled about this... it will be impossible to ignore Kamala, said one of the donors. Another donor said shes nobodys choice, but yeah, nearly impossible. Still, the presidents reelection campaign is standing its ground, emboldened by a stronger performance by Biden during a scripted speech in North Carolina even as calls for him to step aside grow. Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama, whose firm is on contract to produce the Democratic National Convention in August, said President Biden is the nominee and hes going to remain the nominee. For those who are looking for some sort of interparty fight, be careful what you wish for because that would ensure a Trump victory, she said in a statement. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka strikes restructuring agreement with bondholders",
        "date": "July 4, 2024 12:27 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has secured a deal to move forward on restructuring about 12.5 billion of international bonds, the government said on Wednesday, a major step in the island nations fragile recovery from a severe financial crisis. The South Asian country defaulted for the first time on its foreign debt in May 2022 after its economy was driven to the brink by a slump in foreign exchange reserves. Restructuring international bonds was one of the key conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a 2.9 billion bailout programme that helped Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve public finances. The deal with selected bondholders, who cover about 50 of Sri Lankas bonds, is contingent on confirmation by the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) made up of bilateral creditors and the IMF to ensure it is in line with the global lenders debt sustainability analysis for the country. The latest agreement comes after Sri Lanka held a second round of formal talks with bondholders this week. Sri Lanka ... looks forward to further constructive interaction to finalise the ISB (International Sovereign Bonds) restructuring, the government said in a regulatory statement. The framework proposes a 28 haircut on face value and 11 reduction on past interest with payments on the interest component to start from September. The outline proposes to swap four existing dollar-denominated bonds for a bundle of three fixed income instruments. One is a standard or so-called plain vanilla bond that has a coupon of 4 and matures in 2028. The second is a series of macro-linked bonds, where payouts and principal will be adjusted according to the countrys economic performance - downwards in case the economy fails to hit the IMF baseline projections, and upwards if the economy outperforms. A third instrument would be a so-called governance linked bond. While the statement did not detail the parameters to which the payout was linked, a source familiar with the situation said the country would have to pay investors less if it managed to achieve reforms demanded by the IMF and hit tax revenue targets. The bondholder group, the Paris Club, and the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sri Lankan sovereign dollar bonds were marginally up in price on Wednesday, still trading around 57 or 58 cents on the dollar. The bonds were up nearly 15 year to date at the index level up to Tuesdays close, according to JPMorgan data. Sri Lanka signed in late June an agreement with creditor nations including Japan, India and China to restructure about 10 billion in bilateral debt. Sri Lanka now needs to present the proposal to all its bondholders who need to agree to the deal for the restructuring to be finalised. The country, whose total external debt is 37 billion, also has to finalise arrangements with China Development Bank to restructure debt of 2.2 billion, according to the latest finance ministry data.

        "title": "Labour predicted to rout Sunaks Conservatives as Britain goes to polls",
        "date": "July 4, 2024 11:58 am",
        "content": "Britain looks set to elect Labour Party leader Keir Starmer as its next prime minister when voters go to the polls on Thursday, sweeping Rishi Sunaks Conservatives out of office after 14 often turbulent years. Opinion polls put Starmers centre-left party on course for a landslide victory as voters turn their backs on the Conservatives following a period of infighting and turmoil that led to five prime ministers in eight years. However, surveys show many voters simply want change, rather than fervently backing Labour, meaning Starmer could enter office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it. Today, Britain can begin a new chapter, Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour. Sunak, who called the election months earlier than expected, has in recent weeks abandoned his call for a fifth consecutive Conservative victory, switching instead to warning of the dangers, opens new tab of an unchallenged Labour Party in parliament. He issued a fresh rallying cry to voters for election day, saying a Labour government would hike taxes, hamper economic recovery and leave Britain more vulnerable at a time of geopolitical tension, charges Labour deny. They will do lasting damage to our country and our economy - just like they did the last time they were in power, Sunak said. Dont let that happen. PUNISHING GOVERNMENT If the opinion polls are correct, Britain will follow other European countries in punishing their governments after a cost of living crisis that stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russias invasion of Ukraine. Unlike France it looks set to move to the centre left and not further right. Labour has held a poll lead of between 15 and 20 points since shortly after Sunak was chosen by his lawmakers in October 2022 to replace Liz Truss who resigned after 44 days, having sparked a bond market meltdown and a collapse in sterling. Modelling by pollsters predicts Labour is on course for one of the biggest election victories in British history, with a likely majority in parliament that would exceed those achieved by Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher, although a high number of voters are undecided and turnout could be low. Such an outcome would have been unthinkable at Britains last election in 2019 when Boris Johnson won a large victory for the Conservatives, with politicians predicting that the party would be in power for at least 10 years as Labour was finished. Starmer, the former chief prosecutor of England and Wales, took over Labour from veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn after it suffered its worst defeat for 84 years in 2019, and dragged it back to the centre. At the same time, the Conservatives in Westminster have imploded, ripped apart by scandal under Johnson and the rancour that followed the vote to leave the European Union, and a failure to deliver on the demands of its broad 2019 voter base. While Johnson destroyed the partys reputation for integrity, Truss eroded its long-held economic credibility, leaving Sunak to steady the ship. During his time inflation returned to target from its 41-year high of 11.1 and he resolved some Brexit tensions, but the polls have not budged. Sunaks election campaign has been hit by a string of gaffes. He announced the vote in driving rain, an early departure from a D-Day event in France angered veterans and allegations of election gambling among aides reignited talk of scandal. The unexpected arrival of Nigel Farage to lead the right-wing Reform UK has also eaten into the Conservatives vote, while the centrist Liberal Democrats are predicted to fare well in the partys traditional affluent heartlands. PROMISE OF CHANGE Starmer could also benefit from a Labour recovery in Scotland, after the Scottish National Party embarked on its own self-destructive path following a funding scandal and looks set to lose its stronghold for the first time since 2015. But Starmer may find his fortunes more sorely tested in Downing Street. His campaign was built around a one-word promise of Change, tapping into anger at the state of stretched public services and falling living standards. But he will have few levers to pull, with the tax burden set to hit its highest since 1949 and net debt almost equivalent to annual economic output. Starmer has consistently warned that he will not be able to fix anything quickly, and his party has courted international investors to help address the challenges. Sunak has argued that his 20 months in charge have set the economy on an upward path and Labour should not be allowed to put that in jeopardy. Voters will give their verdict on Thursday.

A dearth of funding hurt the platform, and high costs for technology to keep the app running led to the shutdown, the post said. Launched in 2020, Koo gained popularity a year later when a spat between social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, and Indian lawmakers regarding the governments order to take down certain content led to politicians and others flocking to the domestic micro-blogging competitor. In February, news website TechCrunch reported that Koo was in talks to be acquired, by Indian news aggregator Dailyhunt in a share-swap agreement.

        "content": "US President Joe Biden worked to calm senior Democrats and staff on his campaign on Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future after his disastrous debate with Donald Trump last week. Mr Biden held a closed-door lunch with Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House as speculation mounted over whether she would replace him as the partys candidate in Novembers election. The pair then joined a call with the broader Democratic campaign where Mr Biden made clear he would remain in the race and Ms Harris reiterated her support. Im the nominee of the Democratic Party. No ones pushing me out. Im not leaving, he told the call, a source told BBC News. That same phrase was repeated in a fundraising email sent out a few hours later by the Biden-Harris campaign. Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: Im running, Mr Biden said in the email, adding that he was in this race until the end. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following the debate with Trump, which was marked by verbal blanks, a weak voice and some answers which were difficult to follow. It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown in the days since as more polls indicate his Republican rivals lead has widened. A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBCs US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Biden in the crucial battleground states. That poll also indicated the former president was leading nationally. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The Supreme Court issued this order while allowing the hearing of an appeal petition filed by plantation companies including Agarapathana Plantations Ltd, against the relevant Gazette imposing a minimum wage for plantation workers. The order was issued by a three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickramasinghe and Janak de Silva. The judgment also states that this interim order will remain in force until the hearing of the petition is concluded. After that, it was decided to call the petition for further hearing on August 28. A petition had been filed by plantation companies seeking an order invalidating the gazette notification issued by the Minister of Labor stipulating a minimum daily wage for plantation workers. The petition had been filed by 21 plantation companies including Agarapatana Plantations Ltd while the petitioners have named 52 individuals including Minister of Labor Manusha Nanayakkara and the Labor Commissioner as respondents of the case. The petitioning plantation companies point out that the Minister of Labor has issued a gazette notification setting the minimum daily wage of a plantation worker at Rs. 1,350, together with an allowance of Rs. 300 and another allowance of Rs. 80, as minimum wage. The petitioners claim that the decision taken by the Minister of Labor without consulting them, violates the legal principle of natural justice. Accordingly, the petitioners seek an order invalidating the decision, claiming that the decision was made arbitrarily by the government.",

        "date": "July 4, 2024 07:06 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka, strengthened by the recent agreement reached with international creditors for the restructuring of 5,6 billion dollars of debt, urges Japan to make further investments in the country, contributing to the revival of the Sri Lankan economy and guaranteeing Colombo a further point of diplomatic reference as well as India and China. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry declared this in an interview with the Japanese newspaper Nikkei. We expect Japan-financed projects to start any time now thanks to the debt restructuring deal, the minister said, referring to a series of projects financed in recent years by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) but never started, including the construction of a light railway in Colombo and the expansion of the international airport serving the capital. The expansion of the airport is very important. We want to make it a global hub, Sabry explained. In 2020, Japanese engineering group Taisei won a 62 billion yen (383 million at current exchange rates) heat contract for the second phase of the expansion of Bandaranaike International Airport, about 30 kilometers north of Colombo. The contract also included the construction of a four-storey passenger terminal, with the works being completed in 2023. As with other projects, however, the contract was terminated following the blocking of financing by the Jica agency, in the context of the acute financial and debt crisis experienced by Sri Lanka in the last two years. In addition to infrastructure, Sabry said, Sri Lanka offers Japan investment opportunities in renewable energy, aviation and IT development. The Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, Ali Sabry, accompanied by a delegation, is engaged in an official visit to Japan at the invitation of his counterpart Yoko Kamikawa, as announced in recent days by the Foreign Ministries of the two countries, according to which the visit will will end on July 7th. The two ministers held talks on Tuesday 2 July regarding the progress of bilateral relations since their last visit in May. Sabry will also meet with other dignitaries, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi. Sri Lankas Official Committee of Creditors (OCC) signed a memorandum of understanding on the countrys debt restructuring on June 26. This was announced by the Foreign Ministry of India, one of the countries that chair the Committee, together with France and Japan. The OCC, we read in a statement, started talks on the restructuring plan on 13 April, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program on 20 March. The signing of the memorandum is defined as a milestone, which confirms the progress made by Sri Lanka to stabilize its economy and bring it back to growth through a path of reforms. India is committed to the stabilization, recovery and growth of Sri Lanka, as demonstrated by the unprecedented financial support offered of four billion dollars. India will continue to support its neighboring country by promoting long-term investments in key sectors, the note concludes. Source: Nikkei --Agencies",

The Minister of State also pointed out that some parties in the opposition are engaged in sabotage to weaken the program launched by the government to develop the country. State Minister Indika Anuruddha conveyed these updates during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) held today (04) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. The state minister further elaborated; Many energy sector projects were stalled during the recent crisis. However, agreements for debt restructuring have been signed with bilateral creditor countries. This has resolved the legal issues necessary to restart these foreign-funded projects. As a result, the successful debt restructuring will significantly help address the countrys energy crisis. Additionally, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), and the Ministry of Power and Energy have calculated the costs of producing electricity using rooftop solar panels. Consequently, prices have been reduced, and a related cabinet paper was presented last week. This has enabled us to apply for electricity purchase agreements at a lower price, allowing the CEB to achieve a loss-free situation. Furthermore, feasibility studies and environmental reports for the Adani project are still in progress. Once these are completed, it will be discussed whether the project can proceed under the current pricing conditions. It has been observed that some opposition parties are engaging in sabotage activities to undermine the governments development program. They have also issued false statements regarding the construction of power plants such as Uma Oya and Sampur. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 4, 2024 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Israel has dispatched a delegation to negotiate a hostage release deal with Hamas, a government official said on Thursday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to convene his security cabinet to discuss new Hamas positions on an accord. Before the cabinet meets on Thursday evening, Netanyahu will have consultations with his ceasefire negotiations team, a source in his office said. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has sought for months to broker a truce, will also speak with Netanyahu on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that the war will end only after all its objectives have been achieved and not a moment before, said the official, who did not specify where the delegation had been sent. Prior efforts to end the nearly nine-month conflict were mediated by Egypt and Qatar, with talks held in both locations. Israel received Hamas response on Wednesday to a proposal made public at the end of May by Biden that would include the release of about 120 hostages held in Gaza and a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave. A Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters that Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, has shown flexibility over some clauses, that would allow a framework agreement to be reached should Israel approve. Two Hamas officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hamas has said any deal must end the war and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel maintains it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas is eradicated. The plan entails the gradual release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza and the pullback of Israeli forces over the first two phases, and as the freeing of Palestinian prisoners. The third phase involves the reconstruction of the war-shattered territory and return of the remains of deceased hostages. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH In Gaza, Palestinians reacted cautiously ahead of Israels response. We hope that this is the end of the war, we are exhausted and we cant stand more setbacks and disappointments, said Youssef, a father of two, now displaced in Khan Younis, in the south of the enclave. Every more hour into this war, more people die, and more houses get destroyed, so enough is enough. I say this to my leaders, to Israel and the world, he told Reuters via a chat app. On Thursday, Gazas health ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the nearly nine months of war had passed 38,000, with 87,445 wounded. The health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its figures. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led gunmen burst into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. An Israeli strike hit a school in Gaza City and the Civil Emergency Service said five Palestinians were killed and others wounded, while other Israeli strikes on Gaza Citys old town on Thursday killed a woman and wounded several others, medics said. The Israeli military said it had been operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities. It said it was acting in accordance with international law and taking feasible precautions to minimise civilian casualties. Israeli tanks also shelled several areas on the eastern side of Khan Younis after the army issued evacuation orders on Tuesday, but there has been no movement by the tanks into those areas, residents said. SEEKING SHELTER On Thursday, many Palestinians were still seeking shelter following the evacuation order, which also included the border city of Rafah and which the United Nations said was the largest such edict since 1.1 million people were told to leave the north of the enclave in October. Khan Younis residents said many families slept on the road because they could not find tents. Israeli planes and tanks bombed several areas in the northern Gaza areas of Shejaia, Sabra, Daraj, and Tuffah, killing several Palestinians, including children, and wounding others, health officials said. The Israeli military said its troops and aircraft killed dozens of militants in those areas and in Rafah, in southern Gaza, which Israel has described as Hamas last stronghold. Israels leaders have said they are winding down the phase of intense fighting against Hamas and would soon move to more targeted operations. However, after months of conflict Hamas still claims to have munitions to fight back. On Thursday, Hamas armed wing said it had targeted the Israeli operations command headquarters east of Gaza City with missiles. The group also claimed that its militants were able to fire a Soviet-built anti-aircraft missile towards an Apache helicopter in the sky over the Shejaia neighborhood, east of Gaza City, without saying if it had been hit. Israel did not comment on the claims. The war has created a humanitarian crisis and destroyed the majority of the enclaves medical facilities. On Thursday, the Gaza health ministry said generators at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, the only main hospital still functioning, would run out of fuel within hours and appealed to international humanitarian organisations for help to secure fresh supplies.

        "date": "July 5, 2024 09:35 am",
        "content": "Britains Labour Party headed for a landslide victory Friday in a parliamentary election, an exit poll and partial returns indicated, as voters punished the governing Conservatives after 14 years of economic and political upheaval. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged the defeat. That makes center-left Labours leader Keir Starmer the countrys next prime minister. He will face a jaded electorate impatient for change against a gloomy backdrop of economic malaise, mounting distrust in institutions and a fraying social fabric. Tonight people here and around the country have spoken, and theyre ready for change, Starmer told supporters in his constituency in north London, as the official count showed hed won his seat. You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver. As thousands of electoral staff tallied millions of ballot papers at counting centers across the country, the Conservatives absorbed the shock of a historic defeat that would leave the depleted party in disarray and likely spark a contest to replace Sunak as leader. Nothing has gone well in the last 14 years, said London voter James Erskine, who was optimistic for change in the hours before polls closed. I just see this as the potential for a seismic shift, and thats what Im hoping for. While the result tallied so far suggest Britain will buck recent rightward electoral shifts in Europe, including in France and Italy, many of those same populist undercurrents flow in the country. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has roiled the race with his partys anti-immigrant take our country back sentiment and undercut support for the Conservatives, who already faced dismal prospects. The exit poll suggested Labour was on course to win about 410 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons and the Conservatives 131. With more than half of the official results in, the broad picture of a Labour landslide was borne out, though estimates of the final tally varied. The BBC projected that Labour would end up with 410 seats and the Conservatives with 144. Even that higher tally for the Tories would leave the party with its fewest seats in its nearly two-century history and cause disarray. Its clear tonight that Britain will have a new government in the morning, said soon-to-be former Defense Secretary Grant Shapps after losing his seat  one of a clutch of Conservative Cabinet ministers who went down to defeat. In a sign of the volatile public mood and anger at the system, some smaller parties appeared to have done well, including the centrist Liberal Democrats and Reform UK. Farage won his race in the seaside town of Clacton-on-Sea, securing a seat in Parliament on his eighth attempt. A key unknown remained whether Farages hard-right party could convert its success in grabbing attention into more than a handful of seats in Parliament. Britons vote on paper ballots, marking their choice in pencil, that are then counted by hand. Final results are expected later Friday morning. Britain has experienced a run of turbulent years  some of it of the Conservatives own making and some of it not  that has left many voters pessimistic about their countrys future. The U.K.s exit from the European Union followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russias invasion of Ukraine battered the economy, while lockdown-breaching parties held by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his staff caused widespread anger. Johnsons successor, Liz Truss, rocked the economy further with a package of drastic tax cuts and lasted just 49 days in office. Rising poverty and cuts to state services have led to gripes about Broken Britain. Hundreds of communities were locked in tight contests in which traditional party loyalties come second to more immediate concerns about the economy, crumbling infrastructure and the National Health Service. In Henley-on-Thames, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of London, voters like Patricia Mulcahy, who is retired, sensed the nation was looking for something different. The community, which normally votes Conservative, may change its stripes this time. The younger generation are far more interested in change, Mulcahy said. So, I think whatever happens in Henley, in the country, there will be a big shift. But whoever gets in, theyve got a heck of a job ahead of them. Its not going to be easy. Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London, said British voters were about to see a marked change in political atmosphere from the tumultuous politics as pantomime of the last few years. I think were going to have to get used again to relatively stable government, with ministers staying in power for quite a long time, and with government being able to think beyond the very short term to medium-term objectives, he said. Labour has not set pulses racing with its pledges to get the sluggish economy growing, invest in infrastructure and make Britain a clean energy superpower. But nothing really went wrong in its campaign, either. The party has won the support of large chunks of the business community and endorsements from traditionally conservative newspapers, including the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun tabloid, which praised Starmer for dragging his party back to the center ground of British politics. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have been plagued by gaffes. The campaign got off to an inauspicious start when rain drenched Sunak as he made the announcement outside 10 Downing St. Then, Sunak went home early from commemorations in France marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. Several Conservatives close to Sunak are being investigated over suspicions they used inside information to place bets on the date of the election before it was announced. Sunak has struggled to shake off the taint of political chaos and mismanagement thats gathered around the Conservatives. But for many voters, the lack of trust applies not just to the governing party, but to politicians in general. I dont know whos for me as a working person, said Michelle Bird, a port worker in Southampton on Englands south coast who was undecided about whether to vote Labour or Conservative in the days before the elections. I dont know whether its the devil you know or the devil you dont. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The newly appointed World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives David Sislen on Thursday called on President Rani Wickremesinghe and vowed to support the debt-trapped island nations journey towards prosperity. The meeting took place at the Presidential Secretariat. WorldBank Vice President for the South Asia Region MartinRaiser, Country Manager for Maldives and Sri Lanka, South Asia Chiyo Kanda and Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr R H S Samaratunga, also attended the meeting, Presidents Media Division said in a post on X. Honored to have met President RW_UNP. Impressed by Sri Lankas commitment to economic reforms. WorldBank stands ready to support the nations journey towards prosperity, Sislen posted on X. In April 2022, the island nation declared its first-ever sovereign default since gaining Independence from Britain in 1948. The unprecedented financial crisis led President Ranil Wickremesinghes predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa to quit office in 2022 amid civil unrest. On Jun 12, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) disbursed the third tranche of USD 336 million from its USD 2.9 billion bailout package to Sri Lanka. The third tranche was under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. Earlier last week, President Wickremesinghe, also the finance minister, announced that debt restructuring agreements were finalised with bilateral lenders, including India and China, in Paris on June 26 and described it as a significant milestone for bolstering international trust in the debt-ridden economy. On Tuesday, while making a special statement in Parliament, Wickremesinghe said: Sri Lankas external debt now totals USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt is USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds. In November last year, the World Bank approved USD 150 million to strengthen Sri Lankas financial and institutional sectors. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "title": "UKs Labour sweeps to power as Sunak concedes election",
        "date": "July 5, 2024 10:22 am",
        "content": "Keir Starmer will be Britains next prime minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government by trouncing Rishi Sunaks party. With many results still to be announced from Thursdays vote, centre-left Labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410. On a humiliating night for Sunak, the Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the partys long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals. Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken and theyre ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service, Starmer said after winning his seat in London. The change begins right here ... You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver. Sunak conceded defeat and said he had called Starmer to congratulate him on his victory. Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides, he said after regaining his seat. There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates ... I am sorry. Despite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party, and he comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges. Britains tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes. He has already had to scale back some of Labours more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, while he has promised not to raise taxes for working people. Much of the heavy damage to the Conservative support was inflicted by the right-wing populist Reform UK party, headed by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, who had campaigned strongly on curbing immigration. Starmer has promised to scrap the Conservatives controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but will be under pressure himself to find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel on small boats. Within the Conservative party, the recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began, with some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others argued Reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots. Reform captured four seats, with Farage himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt, and won more votes than the Conservatives across swathes of the country. There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it, and thats exactly what Im going to do, a triumphant Farage said. Believe me, folks, this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you. POPULIST ALTERNATIVE The rise in support for a populist alternative echoed recent similar results in Europe, where the far right have been surging. But, unlike France where Marine Le Pens far-right National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change. Starmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union to resolve issues created by Brexit, just as far-right politicians are enjoying success. However, despite opposing Brexit, rejoining the European Union is not on the table. He may also have to work with Donald Trump in the United States if he wins Novembers presidential election, but he has vowed to continue Londons unequivocal support for Ukraine. The election victory would represent an incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing. But a series of Conservative scandals - most notably revelations of parties in Downing Street during COVID lockdowns - undermined then prime minister Boris Johnson and its commanding poll leads evaporated. Liz Truss disastrous six-week premiership, which followed Johnson being forced out at the end of 2022, cemented the decline, and Sunak was unable to make any dent in Labours now commanding poll lead. Sunak stunned Westminster and many in his own party by calling the election earlier than he needed to in May with the Conservatives trailing Labour by some 20 points in opinion polls, and his campaign then proved a disaster. We deserved to lose. The Conservative Party just appears exhausted and out of ideas, Ed Costello, the chairman of the Grassroots Conservatives organisation, which represents rank-and-file members, told Reuters. But it is not all Rishi Sunaks fault. It is Boris Johnson and Liz Truss that have led the party to disaster. Rishi Sunak is just the fall guy. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 5, 2024 10:44 am",
        "content": "The Colombo High Court has suspended fixed deposits and insurance policies to the tune of Rs. 97 million belonging to former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and fiver of his close relatives for a period of 03 months, Ada Derana reporter said. This order was issued by Colombo High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne this morning (05), after taking into consideration the facts presented by the CIABOC. The CIABOC has also requested the court to suspend the aforementioned assets of Keheliya and his family members with regard to an ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the court ordered the relevant assets to be suspended until October 04, 2024, and ordered the CIABOC to report the progress of the investigations to the court on that date. The former Minister of Health is currently in remand custody in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials. Against this backdrop, on June 19, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said that it has initiated an investigation following a complaint received against Rambukwella. The investigation had been launched following a complaint filed by a civilian alleging that two vehicles belonging to the ministry provided to him during his tenure as the Health Minister have not been returned after he resigned from the ministerial position and have been misused. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

        "content": "A tense situation has been reported in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys Headquarters on Darley Road in Colombo 10, following the arrival of MP Dayasiri Jayasekara. However, MP Jayasekara had claimed that he will recommence duties in the post of General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) this morning (05). Meanwhile, he also alleged that he is still the legitimate General Secretary of the party. Accordingly, Jayasekara had extended an open invitation to party members and supporters to participate in the event of his resumption of official duties. Against this backdrop, the SLFPs Senior Vice Chairman Prof. Rohana Luxman Piyadasa had stated that they will accept MP Dayasiri Jayasekara as the SLFPs General Secretary. He further stated that a candidate from the SLFP will be nominated for the upcoming Presidential Election. However, MP Mahinda Amaraweera emphasized that nominating a presidential candidate from SLFP itself is pointless. He also stated that a candidate supported by the SLFP will definitely secure the victory. On Tuesday (02), the Colombo District Court issued an interim order against the SLFPs decision to expel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from party membership and the post of General Secretary. Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order revoking the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party. Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the partys General Secretary and a letter directed by the partys then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself. On September 05, 2023, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was ousted from the SLFP with immediate effect and he was stripped of his position as the partys general secretary. The then SLFP chairman, former President Maithripala Sirisena communicated this to MP Jayasekara in a letter, adding that a disciplinary inquiry would also be initiated against the parliamentarian pursuant to the provisions of the partys constitution. However, addressing concerns pertaining to MP Jayasekaras removal, former President Sirisena had stated that the party membership was only temporarily suspended. He further asserted that the SLFP was ready to accept the MP as a party member, or any other title he may wish to hold within the part, except that of the SLFP General Secretary.",

        "date": "July 5, 2024 04:07 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced that the debt restructuring process will include USD 5 billion in loan interest relief from bilateral creditors and a USD 3 billion debt write-off from commercial creditors providing the country with a total relief of USD 8 billion. Wickremesinghe revealed this while addressing the Urumaya Freehold Land Deed Ceremony held in Kurunegala today (05), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that true socialism lies in granting free land rights to the people, dismissing mere talk about socialism. He highlighted that his government, credited with rescuing the country from bankruptcy, is actively addressing public issues. He pointed out that an additional 200,000 individuals will benefit from the Urumaya freehold land title initiative. The President underscored these initiatives, speaking at a ceremony held at the North Western Provincial Council Auditorium in Kurunegala, where symbolic deeds were presented to 463 recipients out of 73,143 eligible in the district under the Urumaya national program. Addressing the gathering, he noted that he assumed leadership during a period of governmental uncertainty. He emphasized that the nation is now recovering from economic turmoil due to effective economic management. He highlighted plans for inclusive development in Kurunegala district as part of advancing the countrys new economy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; In the Kurunegala district, our farmers, who are vital to our rice supply, have lacked rightful ownership of their lands for too long. Today, hundreds of thousands of people across our country face the challenge of living without legal rights to their homes. We launched the Urumaya program to ensure they receive the rights they deserve. When I took office, it was a time of great uncertainty. Leaders were scarce, but I stepped up to lead. We formed a government by uniting different parties, and together, weve made significant strides in addressing the peoples concerns. When our countrys economy collapsed, many lost hope. Today, I must express my gratitude to the residents of this area. Despite facing personal challenges akin to a house on fire, they prioritized community welfare and worked tirelessly to provide relief. Now, our country has emerged from bankruptcy. We have a four-year plan to repay our loans, offering reduced burdens and interest cuts that will yield USD 5 billion in savings. We are currently in negotiations with private contractors. As a result, approximately USD 3 billion has been withdrawn. In total, USD 8 billion has been allocated for our use. Additionally, we have been granted USD 2 billion under relaxed terms. This does not account for funds expected from China or assistance from India. As a result, we have saved USD 8 billion over the past two years. Before assuming office, during President Gotabaya Rajapaksas tenure, India provided USD 3.5 billion on favourable loan terms. Bangladesh also contributed USD 200 million. Despite economic challenges, we managed to repay USD 200 million. Ive had to make tough decisions to rebuild our economy. Raising VAT wasnt easy, but it was necessary to stabilize our economy. Some leaders urged people to protest and even burn houses, urging them not to support the government. Farmers were told to come to Colombo, but without fuel and fertilizers, they couldnt come. We provided essential fuel and fertilizers to support them. Eventually, they were asked to come to Colombo without planting crops. Thanks to the harvest in 2022-2023, the countrys production increased, and tourism thrived. As a result, weve achieved an USD 8 billion relief and paved the way to debt relief. When the economy collapses, it affects ordinary people the most. When it recovers, its benefits reach another segment. We launched the Urumaya freehold land deeds program to benefit ordinary people. Today, these individuals have full ownership rights to the land theyve lived on for generations. This is indeed a governments record. Others talk about socialism, but this is real socialism where land is given directly to the people. Only two countries in the world, Japan and South Korea, have implemented similar programs, but they charged some fee for the land. Here, we provide land for free, resulting in an additional 2 million beneficiaries under this program. Furthermore, the Aswesuma program has tripled the benefits of the Samurdhi program for the people. These initiatives were implemented despite the country being bankrupt. Government employees were granted a stipend of Rs.10, 000. Attention will also be given to increasing salaries in the coming year, along with wage hikes in the private sector. Income from tourism has increased, supporting a modern tourism industry that has raised peoples earnings. During the last Poson Poya, numerous dansal were held across the country. Before that people were suffering with food shortages. Thanks to your hard work in agriculture, we experienced an unprecedented number of dansals in Sri Lankas history. Foreign ambassadors expressed their surprise to me; this showcases our strength. We are committed to providing relief and developing the country in every possible way. Today, the Kurunegala district is rapidly developing. After Gampaha and Colombo, it houses one of the largest populations in the country. Our goal is to strategically develop this province. To this end, we have allocated approximately 1,000 acres for a trade zone in the Bingiriya area, along with the Iranawila Tourist Zone. The Bingiriya and Madampe areas are set to experience significant development. Additionally, plans are underway for a major industrial initiative in Kuliyapitiya. The largest program under the Agriculture Modernization Program is also being implemented in Kurunegala district. With new aid coming in, highway construction has commenced, complementing other road systems. Moreover, this province will soon host a new university, marking a period of substantial growth for Kurunegala in the coming years. Kurunegala District Coordination Committee Chairman, Kurunegala District MP Samanpriya Herath; The Urumaya program, aligned with the 2024 budget proposal, represents a significant initiative spearheaded by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. In ancient times, land use was problem-free for the people. However, after independence, many individuals in Sri Lanka found themselves with land licenses issued under various names but lacking actual ownership rights. Government intervention became necessary to resolve these land issues. Today, President Wickremesinghe has taken decisive actions to address these longstanding land problems. I am grateful to him for resolving the land issues faced by the people of the North-West Province. North-Western Province Governor Nazeer Ahamed; We are pleased that today, the Urumaya program, inspired by President Ranil Wickremesinghes noble vision, is being implemented in the North-West Province. The primary aim of this initiative is to grant legal ownership of land to the people. Many individuals in our country currently possess only licensed land, which can be revoked by the government at any time and holds little value. Since independence, President Wickremesinghe is the first leader to launch a program granting two million free land deeds to our citizens. The Urumaya program is, without a doubt, an investment in our future. Additionally, the Agricultural Modernization Program, based on the Presidents vision, has reached the villages. Our country has faced significant challenges in the past, but President Ranil Wickremesinghe stands out as the leader who rescued both our country and its people from economic crisis. He has brought about substantial positive changes in a remarkably short span of time. Some politicians oppose your right to Urumaya. We must not tolerate their disruptive actions. It is crucial for the President to retain power. Let us not forget that President Ranil Wickremesinghe was the leader who revitalized our nation. We must continue progressing under his leadership for the future development of our country. State Ministers Shantha Bandara and D.B. Herath, along with MPs Johnston Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Asanka Navarathna, Manjula Dissanayake, Sumith Udukumbura, Kurunegala District Secretary R.M.R. Rathnayake, North-Western Provincial Council Chairman Tikiri Adhikari, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Chandra Herath, Mahaweli Authority Director General Mahendra Abeywardana, and several other guests were present at the event. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 5, 2024 04:48 pm",
        "content": "It was a dream wedding, complete with picturesque outdoor setting, white lace gown and a delectable cake. The perfect day for golden retrievers - Bree and Bond - to tie the knot in front of their closest human and canine friends. Pet weddings are on the rise in China, where government policies have had little success in encouraging more humans to wed in this fast-ageing society where the population is declining and marriage and birth rates remain low. The popularity of pets and an increasing willingness to splurge on them are driving the trend. Spending on furry companions in 2023 rose 3.2 to 279.3 billion yuan (38.41 billion) from a year earlier, industry figures show. People have weddings. Why cant dogs have weddings? Brees owner Rye Ling said after escorting his female pet down the aisle, where she exchanged vows promising to always share treats and play with her husband Bond. As of 2023, there were more than 116 million cats and dogs in urban China, according to figures by research firm Acuity Knowledge Partners. If distributed evenly across Chinas urban population, roughly one in eight Chinese people own a cat or a dog, with a majority of owners under 40, according to the research firm. Ling and his girlfriend Gigi Chen, who said theyre in no rush to get married themselves, meticulously planned the canine ceremony for months, arranging professional photographers, designing wedding booklets and ordering a custom-made, 800-yuan cake complete with toppers that resemble Bree and Bond. Yang Tao, whose Shanghai-based pet bakery prepared the cake, said she was initially surprised that customers wanted wedding cakes for their dogs. I think there will be more and more dog weddings, Yang said, adding that she has already catered several similar ceremonies since her bakery was launched in 2022. We have already received an order for a few months from now ... and thats for a dog wedding. Ling said he hoped the ceremony would give Bree and Bond a sense of ritual. Ling, who said he wanted only one child, also hopes to welcome puppies soon. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 5, 2024 04:54 pm",
        "content": "A number of fuel stations were closed across Pakistan on Friday morning following a strike called by petroleum dealers against a new taxation measure introduced by the government to boost revenue and cover its financial shortfall. The Pakistani government has set a challenging revenue collection target to help clinch an International Monetary Fund bailout but faces public anger over new taxes, including taxes on dealers, which were introduced in the annual budget last month. There is a nationwide strike by dealers and pumps are shut in every city except Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Abdul Sami Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA), told Reuters, adding that the strike is due to the governments decision to impose a 0.5 tax on dealers turnover. Khan said it was too soon to give statistics on the number of pumps on strike. The Petroleum Ministry said in a statement that regulators and oil marketing companies (OMCs) have been advised to ensure that their sites remain operational with sufficient stocks of petroleum products to minimize the impact of strike. Oil tankers have been allowed to replenish stocks at retail sites during the day on Friday, as opposed to just at night, it added. The issueconcerns of PPDA have also been taken up with FBR and Finance Division for reviewsconsideration, according to the ministrys statement. Several pumps have chosen to remain operational in the country as dealers remain divided on the call to strike and are hoping to strike out an understanding with the government over the taxes. We are not participating in the strike because we were not taken into confidence over this decision. We also have demands that the union should have looked into, but they did not, said Mohammad Khan, a fuel pump owner in the northwestern city of Dera Ismail Khan. Pakistan has set a tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees (47 billion) for the fiscal year that began on July 1, a near 40 jump from the prior year, and is aiming to bring down its fiscal deficit to 5.9 of gross domestic product from 7.4 the previous year. While the budget may win approval from the IMF, high taxes on a struggling economy could fuel public anger, according to analysts. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The Labour leader had his meeting in Buckingham Palace after Rishi Sunak stepped down following the worst ever general election result for the Conservatives. Sir Keir now takes over as the first Labour prime minister in 14 years - and the seventh Labour prime minister ever. Much of the country was turned red overnight, with Mr Sunak conceding defeat just before 5am on Friday and Sir Keir claiming victory shortly after. Speaking on the steps of No 10, former prime minister Mr Sunak said he would not leave his role as Conservative Party leader immediately but would do so once a leadership race begins. I would like to say, first and foremost, I am sorry. I have given this job my all, he said. But you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change. And yours is the only judgement that matters. I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss. Mr Sunak also wished Sir Keir and his family well, adding: Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent, public-spirited man who I respect. He and his family deserve the very best of our understanding as they make the huge transition to their new lives behind this door and as he grapples with this most demanding of jobs in an increasingly unstable world.

        "content": "Samsung Electronics expects its profits for the three months to June 2024 to jump 15-fold compared to the same period last year. An artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted the prices of advanced chips, driving up the firms forecast for the second quarter. The South Korean tech giant is the worlds largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions. The announcement pushed Samsung shares up more than 2 during early trading hours in Seoul. The firm also reported a more than 10-fold jump in its profits for the first three months of this year. In this quarter, it said it is expecting its profit to rise to 10.4tn won (7.54bn; 5.9bn), from 670bn won last year. That surpasses analysts forecasts of 8.8tn won, according to LSEG SmartEstimate. Right now we are seeing skyrocketing demand for AI chips in data centers and smartphones, said Marc Einstein, chief analyst at Tokyo-based research and advisory firm ITR Corporation. Optimism about AI is one reason for the broader market rally over the last year, which pushed the SP 500 and the Nasdaq in the United States to new records on Wednesday. The market value of chip-making giant Nvidia surged past 3tn last month, briefly holding the top spot as the worlds most valuable company. The AI boom which massively boosted Nvidia is also boosting Samsungs earnings and indeed those of the entire sector, Mr Einstein added. Samsung Electronics is the flagship unit of South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group. Next week, the tech company faces a possible three-day strike, which is expected to start on Monday.

The Bribery Commission stated that the two suspects, who were apprehended inside the CCD premises in Dematagoda, had solicited a sum of Rs. 450,000 as a bribe and were apprehended while accepting the final payment of over Rs. 150,000 out of that. A resident of the Ibbagamuwa area of Kurunegala has lodged a complaint with the CCD in relation to a fraudulent money transfer through an online business of exchanging the electronic currency called USDT. The two suspected cops had allegedly stated to the complainant that two suspects connected to the incident were arrested and produced before the court. However, they have demanded a bribe of Rs. 454,200 to refrain from arresting the complainant as well. The individual in question has initially provided an amount of Rs. 300,000 to the two cops as the first payment of the bribe, the CIABOC said, adding that the duo were arrested while obtaining the remaining Rs. 154,200.

I have officially notified the Election Commissioner that the election should proceed as scheduled, he was quoted as saying by the Presidents Media Division. Wickremesinghe also told the Chief Prelate that back in 2015, he had proposed reducing the Presidents term in office from 6 years to 5 years. The President visited the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya headquarters this afternoon (05) in Alvitigala Mawatha, Narahenpita. There, he had a brief discussion with the Chief Prelate of the Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Ven. Makulewe Wimala Nayaka Thero, the PMD said. During the visit, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Thero chanted Seth Pirith, bestowed his blessings upon President Ranil Wickremesinghe and presented him with a commemorative gift. President Wickremesinghe further said: We have successfully concluded discussions with private creditors and commercial lenders regarding the debt restructuring process. I am pleased to announce that we have achieved a reduction of USD 8 billion in our debt burden. Additionally, we have secured a grace period of 4 years for loan repayment, extending the repayment timeline until 2043. We intend to leverage this opportunity to bolster Sri Lankas export economy. With strategic planning and actions over the next two years, we can position the country to avoid the need for further loans. Thailand, a Buddhist country, has developed a robust economy today through its open economy policy. In 1950, Thailand was twice as indebted as Sri Lanka. However, it has since built a thriving economy driven by exports. In 1991, the Vietnamese Minister of Industry sought advice from me on attracting industries and investments to Sri Lanka. Today, the roles are reversed, and I find myself seeking similar advice from Vietnam. I have officially notified the Election Commissioner that the election should proceed as scheduled. Back in 2015, I proposed reducing the Presidents term from 6 years to 5 years. Today, our nation faces economic challenges, prompting the government to initiate relief programs such as Aswesuma aimed at easing the burden on our citizens. --PMD",

        "content": "Uma Kumaran, daughter of a couple who sought refuge in the United Kingdom after having fled Sri Lanka at the height of the civil war, on Friday scripted history by becoming the first-ever Tamil woman to enter the British Parliament. Born and raised in London, Uma Kumaran is the first ever member of parliament for Stratford and Bow. Her parents hailed from Jaffna in the war-torn northern province of Sri Lanka and belong to a family that had deep connections with trade unions. They came to London in the 1980s. A member of the Labour Party, Uma Kumaran polled over 19,000 votes and defeated her nearest rival by over 12,000 votes. Working for NHS Professionals for 14 months, Uma Kumaran was a parliamentary researcher and caseworker for Labour MP Dawn Butler and worked with several lawmakers of the party before she contested the local body elections in 2010 but failed to get elected. She was also deputy director of Parliamentary Affairs for Labour Party leader Keir Starmer for over 18 months. It is the honour of my life to be elected to serve as the first ever member of parliament for Stratford and Bow. Thank you to all who placed your trust in me and in the Labour party. Ill always be your voice and your representative, she said on Friday after her victory. London has a significant Tamil population with a large portion of them being Sri Lankan Tamils who had fled the country during the war and settled there. In an interview with a website, Uma Kumaran had said last month that her Labour values run deep in her blood, through her family and her parents. My grandad was one of Jaffnas first Trade Unionists - his dad, my great-granddad, kicked him out of the house temporarily for joining the front of a trade union picket line calling for rights for sanitation workers. He was furious, I am told. It wasnt the done thing in respectable families. Both my grandfathers were civil servants and always had a sense of public service. This runs throughout my family, she had said. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin was one of the first to congratulate Uma Kumaran on her victory. Hearty congratulations to Uma_Kumaran on becoming the first-ever Member of Parliament for Stratford and Bow and the first-ever Tamil woman to become a member of the UK Parliament. You bring great pride to the Tamil community, he said.

Speaking at the press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre yesterday (05), he committed to prioritizing the demands of university non-academic staff, including addressing overtime allowances for April. These concerns will be forwarded to the Udaya Seneviratne Committee and proposed for inclusion in the 2025 budget, he added. State Minister Raghavan further explained, Fourteen thousand six hundred (14,600) non-academic employees from 17 universities and 19 joint post-graduate institutions have been on strike for 65 days, severely disrupting the higher education sector. This has adversely affected the lives of 250,000 young individuals, who are crucial to the future of the nation, by causing confusion and wasting their time. These youths, who have already faced significant mental strain from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019, economic crises in 2020, and various challenges in 2021, represent the 18 selected to enter universities despite these hardships. It is a national tragedy that their lives have been further complicated by this strike. As someone deeply committed to education, I am profoundly saddened that universities in our country remain closed during my tenure, knowing first-hand the value of education. While the Treasury did not approve their requested salary increase, citing similar demands from other sectors, they have assured that these requests will be considered for inclusion in the 2025 budget. It has been revealed that, the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) is behind this situation. Since 2010, they have continuously increased their salaries and are now attempting to raise the salaries of non-academic employees while imposing various conditions. In their latest letter, they stated that university funds should not be used to resolve this issue. How can they impose such conditions? Universities are funded by public tax money, not their private asset. They cannot be allowed to fall under the control of a professors mafia. Their professional goal should be to advance education and secure the future of our children. The demands of non-academic employees are reasonable. I promise that their requests will be forwarded to the Udaya Seneviratne Committee and included in the 2025 budget through President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Additionally, we are working to pay their two months salary and overtime for April. Days not reported to work will be treated as holidays, allowing them to return without any penalties. I urge the non-academic staff of all universities to resume work promptly to avoid further disrupting the lives of the youth who are the future of our country.",

        "title": "As long as country faces budget deficit, borrowing is necessary  CBSL Governor",
        "date": "July 6, 2024 11:28 am",
        "content": "In a recent interview, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe addressed misconceptions regarding Sri Lankas total debt, clarifying that the increase from USD 96 billion in December 2023 to a projected USD 100 billion by March 2024 is largely due to exchange rate fluctuations rather than new borrowing. Joining an interview held at the Presidential Media Centre on Friday (05), the CBSL Governor said that despite a detailed explanation of this made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament recently, some have mistakenly interpreted the rise as an increase from USD 70 billion to USD 100 billion. Commenting in this regard, Dr. Weerasinghe added: The status of the debt as of March 2024 was outlined in the Debt Bulletin you referenced. The entire loan amount is denominated in US dollars, totaling USD 100 billion. As you know, our country manages both domestic and foreign debts, with foreign loans typically in dollars. When including domestic debt in the table, it is converted into dollars. Previously, our exchange rate was 324, but it is now 301. Consequently, the foreign exchange position has strengthened, which is favorable. However, the higher exchange rate increases the dollar value of our debt in rupees. Thus, despite no additional borrowing, the debt appears higher due to the exchange rate fluctuation, he expressed. Meanwhile, the CBSL Governor also expressed: additionally, is it beneficial or detrimental to defer debt repayment? When a country progresses, a budget deficit inevitably arises if expenditure exceeds income. This deficit necessitates borrowing. We are not alone in this; other countries also borrow. This on-going process leads to automatic increases in loans. Furthermore, he highlighted that the challenge lies in maintaining debt at a sustainable level. Can borrowing continue, and if so, from where? Should loans come from the central bank? As you know, the central bank prints money, and we understand the implications of excessive money printing. Should we continue this to cover budget deficits? Should we increase or reduce our credit?, he questioned. Dr. Weerasinghe, who stated that achieving debt sustainability entails managing debt at a level sustainable for the country, mentioned that strengthening public financial management is essential alongside debt restructuring. The CBSL Chief pointed out that Sri Lanka must manage our finances prudently, emphasizing revenue growth and maintaining manageable expenses. By striking this balance, we can sustain a manageable budget deficit and progress forward, he added. I do not agree with those who argue against borrowing. As long as our country faces a budget deficit, borrowing is necessary. This has been a historical reality and will persist in the future, similar to other countries practices, said the CBSL Governor. Moreover, expenditure must align with income. For instance, approximately 80 of our income goes toward loan interest, leaving 20 for other expenditures. This proportion represents 19-20 of gross production costs, yet our income was only 8 in 2022, resulting in a 12 budget deficit. We have since increased income to around 11, reducing the deficit to 8, which is progress. Our expenditure is not the primary concern; rather, income must be bolstered. Despite this improvement, satisfaction remains elusive. Under the IMF program, we aim to raise income to 15, while capping costs at approximately 5. My message to the country is clear: I disagree with claims that a country can function without borrowing. However, loans must be utilized for productive purposes and non-consumptive economic activities. By channeling loans into investments that stimulate economic growth, we can enhance debt repayment capabilities. Debt accrues through a complex process, and comparisons should consider the financial context in which loans are secured, Dr. Weerasinghe said.",

        "date": "July 6, 2024 11:42 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the necessity of an advanced education system combined with modern technology to move the country forward with a new economy. He noted that educational reforms are currently underway to achieve this goal. President Rani Wickremesinghe made these remarks today (06) during a ceremony at Hall De Galle in Galle. The event marked a significant step towards educational modernization, with the provision of 200 Smart Classrooms and 2000 Tabs to 200 schools in the Southern Province. Following a request by the Minister of Health and Industry, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, the Government of India allocated RS. 300 million to the Southern Provincial Council for this project. Of the 200 schools selected schools, 150 are in the Galle district, while the remaining 50 schools are in the Hambantota and Matara districts. Additionally, 2000 Tabs were distributed, with each of the 200 classrooms receiving 10 tabs. Symbolizing this occasion President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented a commemorative gift to the Indian High Commissioner, Mr. Santosh Jha. In his further remarks, President Wickremesinghe stated: Currently, the world is advancing rapidly with modern technology. Consequently, our countrys education system must also progress in tandem with these technological advancements. The Ministry of Education has already initiated necessary educational reforms to achieve this goal. In the past, we introduced several educational policies that were appropriate for their time. However, given the current technological advancements of today, there is a pressing need for new reforms in the education sector to ensure our education system remains relevant and effective. Thus far, we have launched the establishment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) clubs in schools. Countries such as England and America began integrating AI technology years ago. To ensure the sustainability of our newly launched AI program this year, it is essential for teachers to undergo comprehensive training. The government is actively developing training programs and infrastructure to bolster this initiative. There is also a plan to elevate existing Central Colleges and National Schools into specialized institutions focusing on artificial intelligence. We deeply appreciate the support extended by neighbouring India in advancing modern technology. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed interest in establishing an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Sri Lanka, which is highly appreciated. Additionally, negotiations to enhance cooperation in the energy sector with India are progressing successfully. I had discussions with Mr. Elon Musk in Malaysia, and his internet technology is anticipated to be introduced in Sri Lanka following Parliamentary approval. This development will facilitate the provision of technical education to students in remote areas. Presently, the Southern Province has emerged as a region showcasing exceptional educational talent. Today, the first Dutch school in the Southern Province has evolved into Baddegama National School. By leveraging modern technology to nurture future-ready generations, we aim to position our country as a global leader. Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha: The Free Education Act has brought about a transformative change in Sri Lanka, significantly increasing the literacy rate from 46 to 93. In todays technological age, the integration of Artificial Intelligence and modern classrooms is crucial. We appreciate Indias assistance in this endeavour. Today, 200 schools in the Southern Province have been equipped with comfortable classrooms and 2000 Tabs. Moving forward, the schools will undergo digitization, with selected 1250 schools already being connected. Over the next three years, we aim to digitize 10,026 schools and provide necessary teacher training. Graduates with technical expertise from our universities enjoy a 93 employment opportunities in the job market. We must seize the opportunity to lead globally through modern technology. Minister of Health and Industry Dr. Ramesh Pathirana: We deeply appreciate the Government of India for their support in this endeavour. We are currently experiencing one of the greatest periods of this century. The Free Education Act introduced by a former Minister of Education Mr. C. W. W. Kannangara, a native of Galle, significantly increased school enrolment from 52 to 99. The numbers of schools expanded from 3000 to 10,000, and instead of a single government university, 13 universities were established. Annual university admissions surged from 250 to 45,000 students. This transformation has propelled Sri Lanka from lagging behind in the global industrial revolutions to progressing alongside the world. In the next century, leveraging Artificial Intelligence, computer knowledge and modern technology presents an opportunity to advance in parallel with the global community. A Smart educational framework must be established to achieve this goal. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is currently spearheading educational reforms with a visionary approach. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Mr. Santosh Jha: As Indias neighbour, we consistently extends support to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka holds a crucial position in our foreign policy. India remains steadfast in its commitment to providing essential infrastructure and technical knowledge support to Sri Lanka. The event was attended by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa, State Minister Mohan Priyadarshana, Member of Parliament Sampath Athukorala, along with a delegation of education officials, principals, and students from the Southern Province.",

        "title": "Reformist Pezeshkian wins Irans presidential runoff, besting hard-liner Jalili",
        "date": "July 6, 2024 01:00 pm",
        "content": "Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Irans runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the countrys mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Irans Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkians modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels. A vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalilis 13.5 million in Fridays election. Overall, Irans Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors. Supporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator. Dear people of Iran, the elections are over and this is just the beginning of our cooperation, Pezeshkian wrote on the social platform X, still banned in Iran. The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust. I extend my hand to you and I swear on my honor that I will not leave you alone on this path. Do not leave me alone. Pezeshkians win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war, Irans advancing nuclear program, and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Pezeshkians victory also wasnt a rout of Jalili, meaning hell have to carefully navigate Irans internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post. The first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the countrys Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Irans economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent. Government officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country. However, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets. Authorities put the turnout in Fridays election at 49.6, still historically low for an Iranian presidential election. They counted 607,575 voided votes in the contest  which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates. I dont expect anything from him  I am happy that the vote put the brake on hard-liners, said bank employee Fatemeh Babaei, who voted for Pezeshkian. I hope Pezeshkian can return administration to a way in which all people can feel there is a tomorrow. Taher Khalili, a Kurdish-origin Iranian who runs a small tailor shop in Tehran, offered another reason to be hopeful while handing out candy to passersby. In the end, someone from my hometown and the west of Iran came to power, Khalili said. I hope he will make economy better for small businesses. Pezeshkian, who speaks Azeri, Farsi and Kurdish, campaigned on outreach to Irans many ethnicities. He represents the first Iranian president from western Iran in decades  something people hope will aid the county as those in the West are considered more tolerant because of the ethnic and religious diversity in their area. The election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region  such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemens Houthi rebels  are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Iran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the countrys foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West. The campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Bidens administration, though theres been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehrans nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions. Though identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Irans theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it delivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender. More than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation. The late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a protégé of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.

        "title": "Establishing fresh economic and political system is essential  President",
        "date": "July 6, 2024 04:06 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently emphasized that as the country builds a new economy, it is crucial to establish a new political system. This system must foster individuals who can take responsibility and speak the truth fearlessly. He made these remarks during the bankers forum organized by the National Bankers Association at Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, yesterday (05). The President stated that he has openly communicated the economic challenges facing the country to the people and has outlined a clear program to lead the nation out of the crisis. The President emphasized that there is no alternative program for the country and that it is everyones responsibility to identify and support the necessary program for the countrys economy, rather than living in dream worlds. He pointed out that while some have cited Argentinas Martin Guzman as an example, he considers Guzman a failure. Additionally, although some have suggested that he ask for money from world leaders, the President stressed that the Sinhalese nation is not a beggar nation but one that rises through self-reliance. The President stated that his goal is to steer the country towards rapid development through an export-based economy. He mentioned that the necessary legal framework for creating an export economy has been presented to Parliament and highlighted the banking systems significant responsibility in advancing this program. The National Bankers Association also presented a special commemorative gift to the President at the occasion. Subsequently, a discussion was held featuring President Ranil Wickremesinghe, former Minister of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, and Senior Adviser to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga. The President further elaborated; Today, we have made significant economic progress. I need not remind you of what happened from the Jetwing Hotel to the Galle Face Hotel in those days. During that journey, my house was also burned down. Despite these challenges, we have moved forward, but there is still a long way to go. I made it clear back then that if we do not protect our banking system, we cannot safeguard our economy. A collapse in the banking system would lead to an economic collapse. At that time, I had to take charge of the country. Together, we initiated efforts to uplift the countrys economy, and today, we are seeing the results. Progress does not happen overnight. Efforts have been made to reduce the loan repayment by USD 8 billion over a period of four years. The economy is once again developing. Now, we have reached a crucial turning point as a country. With the USD 8 billion in debt relief, we are now free to pursue a new economy. We have submitted the necessary legal framework to Parliament to create an export-oriented economy. We need to progress from this point forward, and the banking system plays a crucial role here. How do we secure funding? Foreign investment is essential for the banks to thrive. We have not yet achieved this objective. While we have repaired the fractured economic system and made strides, the broken political system remains unresolved. Former leaders fled in fear during that time. What does this say about political leadership in our country? Can such leaders propel the nation forward without solutions? They fled in fear that day because they lacked answers. Following the former presidents resignation, the countrys peace and stability began to deteriorate. Some urged me to resign as Prime Minister. Can a country progress under such a political system? When we introduced the Economic Transformation Bill, Mr.Sunil Handunnetti filed a case advocating for an import-based economy. Today, our economic challenges stem from operating within an import-oriented economy. Regarding Argentinas Martin Guzman, some consider him a failure, while others suggest traveling the world to seek financial aid from leaders. Ive stated firmly that neither I nor the Sinhalese nation is beggars. Despite this, some still advocate for change. Does this imply advocating for an import-based economy? Once, I questioned former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa about his decision to lower taxes against the advice of the International Monetary Fund during an economic crisis. He explained that businessmen had urged for tax reductions, which is true. I am aware of this. People also questioned why I hadnt reduced taxes. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa acted, but today, few support his decision. Today Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has isolated. We must choose wisely and advance with the program that our country truly needs, avoiding the lure of unrealistic ideals. Its crucial to grasp the truth and take decisive action. The decisions we make today will shape our future. As we rebuild the nations economy, we must also reform our political system. This entails cultivating individuals who can shoulder responsibility and progress, and who bravely speak the truth without fear. Without this foundation, our country lacks a viable future. Honesty has always been our policy. In politics, there should be no fear of speaking the truth, irrespective of ones stance towards the government. I united people from various political factions to lead this government forward. While party discipline was lacking, governmental discipline prevailed. Despite challenges, we garnered support, including from young MPs of Podujana Peramuna, who joined us without regard for their political futures. Our political system has yet to match the economic groundwork weve laid today. This must be our focus moving forward. Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka; When Mr. Asela Fernando convened the association meeting on April 22, 2022, our country was amidst a severe crisis, nearing its peak. At that time, Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe was a Member of Parliament, the sole representative of our party. Everyone urged him to attend and address the bankers gathered there. I vividly recall the questions posed to him on that day and the guidance he imparted. During the meeting, he stressed the importance of engaging directly with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He had already raised this issue in Parliament and with government leaders. Upon assuming the presidency shortly afterward, he swiftly began addressing each of these challenges step by step, implementing the advice he had advocated. Initially, we prioritized law and order, implementing numerous reforms to shape the current state of our country. This included efforts to manage tax policies and public expenditures effectively. Sri Lanka achieved a significant milestone as the first country in the region to receive a Governance Assessment Report from the International Monetary Fund. Based on this report, we initiated measures to address 15 key issues, including combating fraud and corruption. As a result, we have attained a degree of stability today. Our on-going debt restructuring program is progressing successfully. We seek the support of the banking sector to bolster the countrys economy. With your collaboration, we can accelerate the countrys development significantly. The event was attended by Advisor to the President on Parliamentary Affairs Ashu Marasinghe, Director-General of Presidential Trade Unions Saman Rathnapriya, Colombo Port City Economic Commissions Chief Operating Officer, Revan Wickramasuriya, Chairmen of both public and private banks, Secretary of the National Bankers Association Asela Fernando, bank officers, executives, and various individuals from the banking sector.",

        "content": "Leader of the National Peoples Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake claims that the government burdened Sri Lankans immensely while implementing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and restructuring Sri Lankas debt. While commending the government on getting Sri Lankas debt repayments postponed, the NPP leader went on to highlight however, that the government celebrated a temporary treatment to self-inflicted problems. He made these remarks while addressing a meeting of medical professionals in Kurunegala district, organized by the National Intellectual Organization today (06). It would have been impossible to implement the IMF programme without restructuring Sri Lankas debt. What did we do with the IMF? We came to an agreement with the IMF and we fulfilled a lot of the conditions outlined in that agreement, Dissanayake said. A lot of those conditions were fulfilled by burdening the general public immensely, he added. Furthermore, the NPP Leader said: to successfully restructure debt, the government had to present an acceptable balance sheet, by controlling expenditure and increasing income. The balance sheet, prepared as such, indicates to the international community that the countrys debt servicing capabilities would improve in the future, establishing firm grounds for Sri Lanka to request for a postponement of debt service payments. How did the restructuring of debt become such a festive occasion, even prompting the president to address the nation?, he questioned. I recently observed how India celebrated their successful moon landing. Here, in Sri Lanka we celebrate postponing debt repayments. We have no victories to celebrate as a nation. If we agreed to abide by the IMF program, restructuring debt is a mandatory condition. However, they have indeed managed to postpone the repayment of debt. That is actually not too bad. But what actually happened was that they took on debt themselves, which they refused to pay. Then they negotiated an extension to the deadline for the repayment of debt and then celebrate it as an achievement, said Dissanayake.",

        "date": "July 7, 2024 09:13 am",
        "content": "At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured. The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said it struck several terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School. Meanwhile, there have been reports that 10 people were killed in a separate airstrike on a house at the camp. Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market. The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning, she said. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. The BBC is unable to verify this claim. Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted. More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders. Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158. In a statement posted to X - formerly known as Twitter - the IDF confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken numerous steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence. Hamas militants were using the location as a hideout to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel, it added. Hamas called the attack a massacre on defenceless displaced civilians. Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. Hopes have once again been rising in recent days that a deal between Israel and Hamas was on the horizon, following months of false starts. Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to pretty significant adjustments to its position regarding a potential ceasefire. A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israels military said it had conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the June incident as horrific and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was shocking but could not be confirmed. Israels war was triggered by Hamass unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israels offensive, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Three children, including a 10-month-old, were killed after fire ripped through a house in Sydney early on Sunday in an incident Australian police said they were treating as a homicide. Emergency services were called to the property in Lalor Park, about 35 km (20 miles) west of Sydneys city centre, around 1 a.m. (1500 GMT on Saturday), police said in a statement. Two boys, aged two and four, were treated at the scene but died shortly after being taken to the hospital, while a 10-month-old girl was found dead after the fire was extinguished, police said. A 28-year-old man, who frustrated police attempts to get into the property, was arrested and was being treated for fire-related injuries at the hospital under police guard, it said. Homicide squad detectives have taken control of the investigation and are treating it as a domestic-related homicide, said Homicide Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty. At this stage, it does appear the 28-year-old man is responsible for multiple deaths of young lives that have been tragically taken away, Doherty told a press conference. Four other children, aged from six to 11, were in stable condition in hospital, as well as the mother of the children, a 29-year-old who was being treated for smoke inhalation, police said.

        "date": "July 7, 2024 12:48 pm",
        "content": "Jon Landau - the Oscar-winning producer of some of the worlds highest-grossing movies of all time, including Titanic and Avatar - has died aged 63. Landau, who was the long-time producing partner of filmmaker James Cameron, reportedly died on Friday after living with cancer for more than a year. His sister Tina confirmed his death on social media, calling him the best brother a girl could ever dream of. My heart is broken but also bursting with pride  gratitude for his most extraordinary life, and the love and gifts he gave me - and all who knew him or his films, she wrote. Landau was the son of Hollywood producers Ely and Edie Landau and for a time was an executive at the film production company 20th Century Fox, overseeing films including The Last Of The Mohicans and Die Hard 2. Alongside Cameron, he helped to create the 1997 hit Titanic, which was the first film to make it past the 1bn mark at the global box office. Later films Avatar and its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water, which were released in 2009 and 2022 respectively, went on to break Titanics record. Landau also co-produced other hit films including Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Dick Tracy, and held a management position in Camerons production company Lightstorm Entertainment. Following news of Landaus death, Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter that a great producer and a great human being has left us. Jon Landau believed in the dream of cinema. He believed that film is the ultimate human art form, and to make films you have to first be human yourself, he said. He will be remembered as much for his vast generosity of spirit as for the movies themselves. Director Sir Peter Jackson and his screenwriter wife Fran Walsh, whose visual effects company was used for the Avatar films, said in a statement that they were devastated by the loss of Jon Landau. Jon brought unparalleled passion to the projects he worked on and his influence will continue to inspire for years to come. The actor Zoe Saldaña, who starred in the Avatar films, wrote a message to Landau on Instagram, saying that his death was hitting really hard. Your wisdom and support shaped so many of us in ways we will always be grateful for. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Jayasuriya will reportedly serve as the interim head coach for the upcoming home series against India and the Test tour to England. This decision comes as SLC continues its search for a permanent replacement for former head coach Chris Silverwood. The interim appointment follows the resignations of head coach Chris Silverwood and consultant coach Mahela Jayawardene after Sri Lankas underwhelming performance in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies. Under the leadership of Wanindu Hasaranga, the team failed to advance to the Super 8 round, prompting a need for significant changes in the coaching staff. Sri Lankas immediate challenge is the home series against the newly crowned T20 World Cup champions, India. The series will feature three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).",

        "title": "New UK leader Starmer declares Rwanda deportation plan dead and buried",
        "date": "July 7, 2024 02:39 pm",
        "content": "Britains new Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday he would scrap a controversial plan to fly thousands of asylum seekers from Britain to Rwanda in his first major policy announcement since winning a landslide election victory. The previous Conservative government first announced the plan in 2022 to send migrants who arrived in Britain without permission to the East African nation, saying it would put an end to asylum seekers arriving on small boats. But no one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges. At his first press conference since becoming prime minister, Starmer said that the Rwanda policy would be scrapped because only about 1 of asylum seekers would have been removed and it would have failed to act as a deterrent. The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started. Its never been a deterrent, Starmer said. Im not prepared to continue with gimmicks that dont act as a deterrent. Starmer won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history on Friday, making him the most powerful British leader since former Prime Minister Tony Blair, but he faces a number of challenges, including improving struggling public services and reviving a weak economy. At the press conference in Downing Street, Starmer answered about a dozen questions and was repeatedly asked about how and when he would start delivering on his promises to fix the nations problems, but he gave few specifics about what he planned. Asked if he was willing to take tough decisions and raise taxes if necessary, Starmer said his government would identify problems and act in areas such as tackling an overstretched prisons system and reducing the long waiting times to use the state-run health service. Were going to have to take the tough decisions and take them early, and we will. We will do that with a raw honesty, he said. But that is not a sort of prelude to saying theres some tax decision that we didnt speak about before. Starmer said he would set up and chair different mission delivery boards to focus on so-called missions or priority areas such as the health service and economic growth. Election issue The question of how to stop the asylum seekers crossing from France was a major theme of the six-week election campaign. While supporters say it would smash the model of people traffickers, critics have argued the Rwanda policy was immoral and would never work. Last November, the UK Supreme Court declared the policy unlawful, saying Rwanda could not be considered a safe third country, prompting ministers to sign a new treaty with the East African country and to pass new legislation to override this. The legality of that move was being challenged by charities and unions in the courts. The British government has already given the Rwandan government hundreds of millions of pounds to set up accommodation and hire extra officials to process the asylum seekers, money it cannot recover. Starmer has said his government would create a Border Security Command that would bring together staff from the police, the domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors to work with international agencies to stop people smuggling. Sonya Sceats, CEO of Freedom from Torture, one of the many organizations and charities which have campaigned to stop the Rwanda plan, welcomed Starmers announcement on Saturday. We applaud Keir Starmer for moving immediately to close the door on this shameful scheme that played politics with the lives of people fleeting torture and persecution, she said.
