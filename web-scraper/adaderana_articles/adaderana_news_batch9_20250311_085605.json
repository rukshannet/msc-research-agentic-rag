        "title": "IFC Regional Vice President signals support for Sri Lankas reforms and growth agenda",
        "date": "May 6, 2024 09:58 pm",
        "content": "Concluding a two-day visit, IFCs Vice President for Asia Pacific, Riccardo Puliti, signaled IFCs commitment to supporting Sri Lankas ongoing reforms and growth agenda, while emphasizing the importance of private sector-led development for inclusive economic growth. The visit served as an opportunity for Puliti to engage with key stakeholders, including meeting the President of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremasinghe, Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, private sector representatives, and development partners. Sri Lanka has immense potential. As the country recovers from the unprecedented economic crisis, it is crucial to maintain the momentum and continue implementing key measures to support the transition from economic stabilization to sustainable growth. By embracing necessary reforms, fostering a conducive business environment, and prioritizing sustainable, inclusive growth, Sri Lanka can unlock its full economic potential and create a bright future for its people, said Puliti. Puliti signed an agreement for a new equity investment in Sunshine Healthcare Lanka Limited to support the company in its growth plan to increase its pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and expand the pharmaceutical retail footprint. From providing banks with a much-needed cross-currency swap facility a year ago, to now investing in equity, IFC is committed to supporting Sri Lanka as it transitions from stabilization to sustainable growth. This is a vote of confidence in the countrys private sector and economic recovery, said Puliti. While in Colombo, Puliti also signed an advisory engagement with Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) to scale up green finance, fostering a sustainable future for Sri Lankas financial sector. Through this partnership, funded by the European Union, IFC aims to assist CBC in its transition towards net-zero and diversify its green finance portfolio. IFC will continue to assist Sri Lanka in developing and scaling up green finance to support the country in its path to a net-zero future, said Puliti. With over five decades of operations in Sri Lanka, IFCs efforts in the country focus on three strategic pillars: supporting innovation for growth (including export diversification, start-ups, niche market agriculture, value additions for export, and high tech manufacturing); growth-enabling sustainable infrastructure (including low-cost clean energy, and sustainable transport and logistics systems); and deepening social and financial inclusion (including digitization, and the economic participation of underserved people, especially women). We continue to work with the private sector to create a robust investment pipeline, along with supporting the government on the ongoing reform agendas. These moves are crucial in creating quality jobs, enhancing competitiveness, and bolstering growth, said Puliti. IFC intends to deepen our investments in the country, recognizing the potential and opportunities that lie ahead. Since the onset of the pandemic, IFC has invested over 800 million in Sri Lanka providing essential long-term capital and trade financing to help sustain businesses and preserve jobs. Recently, IFC partnered with Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) to help expand its climate finance product offerings and devise a carbon credit aggregation business model. IFC also collaborated with CBC to build a Supply Chain Financing (SCF) strategy that will enable the Bank to lend more to small and medium-sized enterprises and establish itself as a leading SCF bank in Sri Lanka.",

We wish to advise the general public to be more vigilant in order to avoid falling prey to such scams, they said issuing a joint statement. It pointed out that fraudsters use social media platforms, websites and online messaging platforms to carry out such fraudulent activities. It is important to note that these reported fraud cases are due to fraudsters gaining control of your mobile device and not due to any security vulnerability of bankingpayment apps, which are adhering to international security standards. To prevent falling victim to such scams, the public is advised to exercise caution and follow these guidelines:  Beware of online advertisements offering unrealistic deals.  Avoid clicking on links and downloading apps or files from unknown sources.  Exit from unknown and unfamiliar groups on social media platforms or online messaging platforms to which your are added without consent.  Avoid clicking on links shared via such groups.  Refrain from saving passwords on your device.  Download apps only from official app stores like the Apple App Store, Google Play Store etc  Use biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) to access bankpayment apps where available.  Regularly review app permissions and remove any excessive permissions granted to installed apps.

        "content": "Sri Lankas Cabinet of Ministers has approved a deal with Indian billionaire Gautam Adanis renewable energy wing Adani Green to develop wind power stations in the country. Adani Green Energy will be developing wind power stations in Mannar and Poonerin in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Cabinet has appointed a negotiation committee to evaluate the project proposal which was furnished by Adani Green. Based on the recommendations of that Committee, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to the resolution forwarded by the Minister of Electricity and Power to accept the last price as USD  8.26 cents, the government said. The renewable energy company got the approval in February 2023 to invest 442 million towards the development of the 484 megawatts wind power plants in the two areas located in Northern Sri Lanka. A power purchase agreement for 20 years has been signed between the two parties. As per the agreement, Adani will be paid USD  8.26 cents per kilowatt-hours (kWh) subject to payment in Sri Lankan Rupees as per the actual foreign exchange rate. Shares of Adani Green had spiked to Rs 1,790 per share on announcement of this development, before paring gains to Rs 1,770. It was trading with gains of around 0.25 per cent as on 10:10 am while benchmark indices were down 0.29 per cent. US government-backed International Development Finance Corp in 2023 extended a loan of around 553 million to Adani Ports for a container terminal in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, which faced severe power outages and fuel scarcities amid an economic downturn in 2022, has been expediting renewable energy initiatives to mitigate against spikes in imported fuel expenses. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "title": "Putin sworn in as Russian president for fifth term",
        "date": "May 7, 2024 03:55 pm",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin began his fifth term Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office after destroying his political opponents, launching a devastating war in Ukraine and concentrating all power in his hands. Already in office for nearly a quarter-century and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putins new term doesnt expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again. At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on. Since succeeding President Boris Yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, Putin has transformed Russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has become Europes biggest conflict since World War II, Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran and North Korea for support. The question now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the course of another six years, both at home and abroad. Russian forces are gaining ground in Ukraine, deploying scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv grapples with shortages of men and ammunition. Both sides are taking heavy casualties. Ukraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, especially in border regions. In a speech in February, Putin vowed to fulfill Moscows goals in Ukraine, and do what is needed to defend our sovereignty and security of our citizens. Shortly after his orchestrated reelection in March, Putin suggested that a confrontation between NATO and Russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks. At home, Putins popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary Russians. He began his term in 2018 by promising to get Russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be modern and dynamic. Instead, Russias economy has pivoted to a war footing, and authorities are spending record amounts on defense. Analysts say now that Putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military. At the start of a new term, the Russian government is routinely dissolved so that Putin can name a new prime minister and Cabinet. One key area to watch is the Defense Ministry. Last year, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu came under pressure over his conduct of the war, with mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin launching withering criticism against him for shortages of ammunition for his private contractors fighting in Ukraine. Prigozhins brief uprising in June against the Defense Ministry represented the biggest threat to Putins rule. After Prigozhin was killed two months later in a mysterious plane crash, Shoigu appeared to have survived the infighting. But last month, his protege, Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov, was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption. Some analysts have suggested Shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move as the war is still raging in Ukraine. In the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since Soviet times. There is no sign that this repression will ease in Putins new term. His greatest political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February. Other prominent critics have either been imprisoned or have fled the country, and even some of his opponents abroad fear for their security. Laws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms for anyone who discredits the military. The Kremlin also targets independent media, rights groups, LGBTQ activists and others who dont hew to what Putin has emphasized as Russias traditional family values.

        "content": "Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana said that a Cabinet paper was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers to increase the retirement age of certain healthcare services including nursing staff to 61 years. The minister revealed this in response to a question raised by MP Gamini Waleboda in Parliament today (07). MP Waleboda further stated that even though a decision was taken to extend the retirement age of nursing and certain healthcare services to 63 years, it was not implemented. Due to this the principal of the Nurses Training School in Ratnapura has retired and is now staying in the hospital without handing over the duties to another person or the next principal. He also claimed that even heads of departments do not know whether the retirement age of 63 years will be implemented or not. Therefore, it has been difficult to maintain the operations of the school, he said. In response to this, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana stated that there is an ongoing court case related to the issue. We were asked to agree to increase the age up to 61 years. We also submitted a paper to the Cabinet regarding this. There will be no extension beyond 61. In the meantime, the minister said that about 3,000 new nurses are to be recruited, and that the applications for this purpose have been called and the interviews have been completed. The minister stated that currently, there are 45,000 in the nursing service and there are only about 1,000 vacancies remaining to be filled.",

        "date": "May 8, 2024 07:26 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu hit a sensational hundred to set up a big win in the ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier final against Scotland. Sarah Bryce, standing in as skipper for her sister Kathryn Bryce who missed out due to a niggle, elected to bowl first after winning the toss in Abu Dhabi. Her decision was backed by her bowlers, with seamer Priyanaz Chatterji striking in the third over with the crucial wicket of Vishmi Gunaratne (9). Off-spinner Katherine Fraser then trapped Harshita Samarawickrama (8) before the end of the first Powerplay to give Scotland another success. Dynamic all-rounder Kavisha Dilhari came in at number four and tried to reconstruct the innings along with skipper Athapaththu. However, she fell after a couple of attacking fours, being stumped after coming down the track to leg-spinner Abtaha Maqsood. Having seen off the new ball, Athapaththu picked up the pace in Hannah Raineys third over. Taking advantage of a free hit call off the third ball, Athapaththu hit the pacer over covers for a four. She followed up with two more boundaries off the next two balls to bring her strike-rate over 100. A six and four off Chloe Abel helped Athapaththu close in on her second fifty of the tournament. There was little stopping the veteran southpaw after that. Athapaththu brought up her fifty with a six over Fraser in the 14th over. This was followed by another six against Chatterji in the next over. Fortune favoured Athapaththu twice in the 17th over, bowled by Maqsood. The batter got an inside edge which saw the ball going back and touching the stumps. However, the bails failed to dislodge. The very next ball Athapaththu went big once more, but the fielder in the deep put down a catch to the give the Sri Lankan another life. The unstoppable Athapaththu continued to punish Scotland, bringing up her hundred off merely 60 balls. This was also the first century of the tournament. Rachel Slaters double strike accounted for Athapaththu and Hasini Perera (0) but by then Sri Lanka had already placed themselves in a dominant position. Chasing 170 to win, Saskia Horley and Megan McColl began with positive intent, hitting three boundaries in as many overs. However, Horley fell in the third over itself trying to steal a quick single after deflecting the ball towards Nilakshika Silva in the mid-off region. Her partner, McColl, was trapped leg before by Udeshika Prabodhani in the very next over. Scotlands troubles compounded when skipper Sarah Bryce was bowled two balls later. Scotland had added six more runs before Sugandika Kumari removed Darcey Carter (3) to leave their chase in disarray at 234. After the first powerplay, Priyanaz Chatterji took the initiative by hitting a flurry of boundaries. Despite this, Scotland were at 484 at the halfway stage, needing over 12 runs per over to win the final. Chatterjis brisk 30 came to an end when she was cleaned up by Inoshi Priyadarshini in the 13th over. Sri Lankas win seemed a mere formality thereafter with Prabodhani picking up another wicket to finish as Sri Lankas top performer with the ball. By virtue of being finalists in the tournament, both sides had already qualified for the ICC Womens T20 World Cup 2024 in Bangladesh. With the win, Sri Lanka will now join Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan in Group A of the Womens T20 World Cup. Meanwhile, Scotland join hosts Bangladesh, England, South Africa and West Indies.",

        "date": "May 8, 2024 10:36 am",
        "content": "Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration. From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A29,710 (19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A24,505 from A21,041 in October. The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market. English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay. Home Affairs Minister Clare ONeil said warning letters had been sent to 34 education providers for non-genuine or exploitative recruitment practices. They could be jailed for up to two years and banned from recruiting students if found guilty, she said. Dodgy providers have no place in our international education sector. These actions will help weed out the bottom feeders in the sector that seek to exploit people and trash the reputation of the sector, ONeil said in a statement. International education is one of Australias largest export industries and was worth A36.4 billion (24 billion) to the economy in 202223. But record migration, mostly driven by international students, has put the government under pressure with rental prices soaring across the country. Net immigration rose 60 to a record 548,800 in the year to Sept. 30, 2023. The government expects its policies could halve Australias migrant intake over the next two years. We are significantly reducing migration levels - we are in the middle of the biggest drop in migration numbers in Australias history, outside of war or pandemic, ONeil said.

Defence Secretary, General (Rtd) Kamal Gunaratne emphasized that the operation was initiated jointly with the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and the Intelligence Units. Illegal foreign employment agents engage in human trafficking to send retired army personnel to the Russian-Ukrainian war front. They defraud money under the pretext of providing employment in the Russian army. These suspects also promise to grant land in popular areas like Petersburg if they join the Ukrainian war. Moreover, they pledge Russian citizenship for their families and more than Rs. 1 million in cash, Mr Gunaratne added. However, no money has been provided, nor have any salaries been paid. Additionally, in the event of death or serious injury, no compensation is provided. Deceived by these false promises, a significant number of retired army personnel have ventured to the Ukraine war front, with some losing their lives and others sustaining injuries. Their whereabouts remain unknown. We are diligently working to identify these individuals, as they have joined the war not as legitimate soldiers but recruited as mercenaries, he stressed.",

        "content": "(AP)  Ukrainian counterintelligence investigators have foiled a Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top military and political figures, Ukraines state security service said Tuesday. Two colonels in the State Guard of Ukraine, which protects top officials, were detained on suspicion of enacting the plan drawn up by Russias Federal Security Service, or FSB, a statement said. The colonels were recruited before Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to the statement. It quoted the head of the State Security Service, Vasyl Maliuk, as saying the plot foresaw an attack before Russian President Vladimir Putins inauguration for a fifth term on Tuesday. Maliuk said that he personally oversaw the top-secret operation to track the plot. Ukrainian claims of Russian efforts to kill Zelenskyy arent new. Zelensky said in 2022 there has been at least 10 attempts to assassinate him, and now the war with Russia has stretched into its third year. Also, prosecutors in Poland said last month that a Polish man had been arrested on allegations of being ready to spy on behalf of Russias military intelligence in an alleged plot to assassinate Zelenskyy. Zelenskyys movements are kept secret for security reasons, and his visits around the country are publicly announced only after he has left. News of events he holds in Kyiv is usually embargoed until they are over. Zelenskyy has proved to be a valuable asset for his country as the war against Ukraines bigger neighbor grinds on, and as Kyivs depleted forces wait for more troops and weapons. He has urged his people to keep fighting and instilled a belief that Ukraine can prevail. The Ukrainian statement said the Russian intelligence agents targeting Zelenskyy sought out members of the Ukrainian military close to the presidents security detail who could take the head of state hostage and later kill him. The operation was run from Moscow, it said, providing the names of three alleged Russian spies behind the conspiracy. The broader plan was to identify the location of senior Ukrainian officials and target them with a rocket attack, followed by drones and missiles. The two Ukrainian colonels were arrested on suspicion of treason, which carries a life sentence, the statement said. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

Authorities did not confirm whether Drake was at home at the time of the shooting, but said his team is cooperating. The shooting happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday in the affluent Bridle Path neighborhood of Toronto. Toronto Police Inspector Paul Krawczyk said video of the shooting had been recovered and the guard who was wounded remains hospitalized. In recent weeks, Drake has been engaged in a rap feud with Kendrick Lamar, with each artist dropping diss tracks attacking the other. Krawczyk was asked whether the feud was a factor in the shooting and he said while investigators are aware of it, it was too early to discuss motive. Drake, born Aubrey Drake Graham, is one of the best-selling artists of the modern era. He began his career as a child actor on the popular teen program Degrassi: The Next Generation before setting his sights on music, dropping some of the most influential albums of any genre in the 2010s: Take Care, Nothing Was the Same, and Views among them. Hes released 13 No. 1 hits across his career, including Gods Plan, Work featuring Rihanna, and One Dance with WizKid and Kyla. The Hotline Bling performer was named Spotifys most streamed artist of the decade, has won five Grammy awards, and is often credited for ushering in the new era of hip-hop where rappers sing, weaving RB sensibilities into the genre.

President Wickremesinghe emphasized on-going efforts to enact unified legislation addressing environmental protection and climate change. He highlighted the governments commitment to crafting economic policies geared not only towards fostering export-oriented competitiveness but also towards transitioning to a green economy, aiming to achieve net-zero by 2050. Acknowledging the recent prolonged spells of extreme climate conditions as indicative of future climate change impacts, the President stressed the urgency of addressing climate mitigation measures promptly. The inaugural Sri Lankan Climate Change Conference, hosted by the Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce, commenced yesterday under the theme Climate Action for our Nation and the Planet. Scheduled to run until May 09, the summit aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted climate crisis, both from a global and national standpoint. It seeks to assess potential disruptions to critical sectors of the economy and deliberate on policy reforms necessary for transitioning towards a low-emission, climate-resilient economic framework. During his address, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the nations proactive approach to combating climate change. He announced the establishment of a dedicated climate change centre in Sri Lanka and his instructions to the officials to model legislation based on the United Kingdoms Climate Act, endorsed by global financial institutions. The President emphasized the significance of Sri Lankas role in addressing climate change, particularly within the Indian Ocean and the tropical belt and outlined plans for the International Climate Change University to be established in the country. Addressing the gathering, the President further said: It gives me great pleasure to be here with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, primarily because the Chamber has been working with the government on the current issue of climate change. Today, you have organized this summit, which is a long-felt need for Sri Lanka, for the business community to meet here and to discuss the ways and means of how we could combat climate change. Since I took over as president, I have given top priority to climate change. In fact, I established the Climate Change Centre in my office and appointed an advisor. Until then, our focus has been on the environment. That doesnt mean that we should take our focus away from the environment, but we must also realize the important role that climate change plays within it. If climate change takes place, as some of you fear, then the environment itself will change for the worse. Therefore, how we can adapt to climate change, how we can combat climate change, is certainly a matter of importance for all of us. I need not say anything more. You know what it has been like in the last few days, walking around in the city. And this is just a sign of things to come. My task as president has been to restore the economy. In other words, to stabilize the economy. That task is nearing an end and we have to now focus on the next step. We cant carry on with this economic model, which certainly hasnt worked. And we have, as I mentioned many times before, transformed ourselves into an export-oriented economy and a highly competitive economy. For this purpose, the government will be introducing legislation in parliament, which will ensure that all government policies focus on the transformation to a highly competitive export-oriented economy. In fact, the bill will most probably be gazetted next week. But I am not going to deal at length with the bill, except to say that one of the items in the bill, inn carrying out this transformation, is to ensure that we achieve net-zero by 2050. And I can tell you we will achieve it before that. Sri Lanka can do it. So in making our policies, which are going to affect all of you, not merely a transformation of an economy into export orientation, but into an economy that is based on achieving net-zero. So thats how we are going to work this out. As it is, the first step is, we are already drafting a new law, which will deal with the environment and climate change. In some countries, we have different acts dealing with laws, but we decided that we will bring it together, one law, which will handle both environment and climate change. It retains the Central Environment Authority but will also bring in the Climate Change Centre. In the process of drafting, Ive asked the officials now, in doing so, let us as far as possible, follow the Climate Change Act of the UK, which I think is a good one and it puts the burden on the government and the minister to act on the advice of the Climate Change Committee and to table the regulations in Parliament. So that is the legislative aspect that we are bringing in. On that basis, we have to have a green economy. So green financing, and the whole aspect, the commercial and economic aspects become important. Thats where the Chamber of Commerce has an important role to play. We will promote the green economy. We will give priority to promoting a green economy. We might as well be the first in the region to do so. We are small enough to do that. And, our development, I hope, all of you will focus on seeing how we can succeed in becoming a green economy. So part of this will also, again, will depend on how we structure our new financial instruments. One reason for following the Climate Change Act of the UK is that it has been well accepted by the financial circle. So we will ensure that our green financing, the different options available, are certainly based on the same practices as the UK. The rest is how do we get these instruments together? What do we do? Well, thats why I think the Chamber of Commerce, the Stock Exchange, our investment ministry all should come together. So thats one area that will have to be developed once we announce the details of our policy on climate change. I would want it to cover every sector of the economy. We might as well start from the beginning. We need not be looking at different sectors and sequencing it. We are small enough, and where we are, we can start on all sectors together. But what, has engaged our attention is the energy sector. I remember when we started the accelerated Mahawali scheme as a member of the Cabinet at that time, was to ensure that we had a majority of hydroelectricity potential. So we built all these reservoirs just within a space of 10 years. But since then, as development came, we had to also bring in the fossil fuels. Now we have brought the fossil fuels, we brought the mini hydros, and whats the next stage? Are we going to stay on with fossil fuels, or move on? Now Sri Lanka certainly has potential for renewable energy. If you look at our solar capacity, and our capacity for wind power, we are looking at something like in the region of 30 to 50 gigawatts. One of the things that depends on determining the wind power now is the inquiry we are carrying out about how birds will be affected in the Mannar district. I have seen the CEB plant, and I have seen how it operates, and its automatic, so it switches off when a bird comes near. But nevertheless, lets exhaust that, it will take a bit of time, but I said lets get through this, and be sure that we avoid any harm to wildlife in the process. But we certainly have this potential. Its not merely on land, not only offshore, but on the high seas. It will start from about Puttalam and go all the way to Mulaitivu, and again, as far as wind power is concerned in Hambantota. Thats the wind power potential. Solar is anywhere. And in addition to land, the ancient kings left us with reservoirs, which we now find also becoming useful for floating solar. The interest in solar is just starting. We have a long way to go, but the vision statement I made with Prime Minister Modi included Sri Lanka selling energy to India. So we have now agreed to have the connectivity. Were also now working on another project near Poonakary or Pooneryn, to utilize the Poonakary reservoir. And that includes building the largest battery storage facility in Asia. So we are also now working on battery storage. Theres much more potential that is coming to place. But we want to make the best use of the renewable energy sources that we have. Some people have spoken about the biomass, but most of the reports that Ive received so far doesnt indicate that biomass has such a good future in Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, lets get our energy worked out. So this is one sector that we are looking at. Based on energy, we can do many changes. If theres green hydrogen, since we are developing the Trincomalee port, we have the, the Colombo port, and we have the Hambantota port, then we become more attractive as a regional logistics centre. So this is some part of the thinking that is going on as far as the economy is concerned. The rest of where we start, what we do, is left to the Chamber of Commerce and the other institutions and the smaller chambers outside there. So now its up to you to make use of the potential that we have in Sri Lanka. In keeping with this, weve also decided to emphasize on teaching technology. Again on the vision statement, Prime Minister Modi has been generous enough, to give us a campus of the IIT Chennai. So that will come into Kandy. In addition, the government is asking the universities to ensure that engineering faculties are started in all universities. And next is the emphasis on the teaching of AI. The government itself is starting another university in Kurunegala and another university in Sitawaka, affiliated on the same model as the KDU, which will focus on technology. And finally, theres one more university which we are planning again on technology. So this is important for us. But we need the personnel. We have a shortage of skilled people. I think, Duminda has been involved in restructuring the total system of vocational training. All this is necessary to go to the next stage of technological development and as far as the economy is concerned, a new area is agricultural modernization. So there will be far-reaching changes including making available about 300,000 new acres for agriculture to take place. So all this fits into agriculture, the green economy. The next issue is to go out of Sri Lanka into the world. The global community has still not been able to come together on an agreement of how we deal with the challenges. From COP meeting to COP meeting, weve gone there and theres a lot of talk but unfortunately there has been no agreement. I dont think we can go on and on meeting like this. In the next two meetings either we must come to some agreement or give this up. Thats what Sri Lanka plans to tell the COP. But on our own, weve taken three initiatives. Firstly, debt restructuring and debt restructuring must help the African nations. That funding is necessary. Money is necessary, to make it available for the African nations to push through. Otherwise, there would be a disaster on the continent. We ourselves went through debt restructuring. We didnt go and ask for money. We did it the hard way. Okay, thats all right, as Sri Lanka is a country that can make it. But the rest of them certainly need it. Secondly, funds that we are waiting for, which were promised in Glasgow, but either the money got lost or it never left the banks where it was stored. But that unfortunately happens to be the story of funding. Now that funding is required. We need that funding but the money hasnt turned up, while we are watching for this money to come we see for instance in the last few weeks a fairly large chunk of money being voted by the US congress to help Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel. The EU is also voting money to help Ukraine that may be in the region of about 100 billion and I dont know how much Russia is putting in to keep the war going in Ukraine. But certainly all this together must be coming to about  150 to 200 billion. Just imagine what that can do. We went from COP meeting to COP one conference of the party to another conference of the party to another conference of parties and where? We were promised all these monies we are standing watching the fight and all of a sudden all the money goes into Ukraine and Gaza and towards Taiwan. So remember that the developing world has to put up a fight. We have to put up a fight on one side and on the other side we must do all we can to develop it commercially. This is why in Sri Lanka I have promoted the concept of the tropical belt. After all, the tropical belt is the sink. So lets identify every area in the tropical belt, which is commercially viable as far as climate change is concerned for different projects. Lets do all that first. If the money is not coming to us as aid or a development, okay, let s take the money in for commercial development of the environmental projects. So I mean, you look at whats available in Africa. Look at whats available in Sri Lanka. So lets do that. But we will be pushing it at the next meeting or the conference of parties and in addition to that IORA. Here we are studying on the potential for the Indian Ocean. So take the tropical belt cross the Indian Ocean and there you get the big sink you want. That is what Sri Lanka will be pressing and that will make a big change. The money is there. We have to get the money. If its not coming through the traditional development assistance, well theres commercial potential lets exploit it. Why are we waiting? That s what we require. Then with Sri Lanka also bringing the legislation, weve been speaking with some of the countries to establish the international climate change university for climate adaptation. We ve already selected about 600 acres at the old Skanska camp and the surrounding area in Kothmale. So thats where well be working. We ve been talking with Korea and well be talking with India, China, Japan and some of the Western countries that have shown interest. So with the legislation ready, we hope to start that next year. But this is Sri Lanka s contribution that we are making as a country to climate change. I thought Id mention that here. I dont want to take any more of your time, because therell be a far more interesting discussion that will take place. So I thank you for inviting me to address this gathering. Source: PMD",

        "date": "May 8, 2024 11:50 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday (08) stressed that the enhancement of the rural economy pivots on agricultural advancement. He highlighted the pivotal role of dedicated government officials at the grassroots level in ensuring the success of various government initiatives aimed at rural development, notably the agricultural modernization program. The President made these remarks during his address at the ceremony held at the Temple Trees, where a total of 2,100 new Grama Niladhari officers were handed over their letters of appointment. Following the Grama Niladhari Service Examination held by the Department of Examinations on 02nd December, 2023, 2100 candidates with the highest scores at the Divisional Secretariat Divisional Level were granted Grama Niladhari positions. President Wickremesinghe, symbolically distributing the appointment letters, briefed the new GN Officers on government initiatives such as Aswesuma and Urumaya, aimed at uplifting low-income individuals, urging them to actively engage in these programs for the economic development of their communities. Commenting further President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; Today marks a significant milestone as I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all of you who have been appointed as GN Officers. With this appointment, you embark on a journey as integral members of the government service, contributing to the betterment of our country. Your role as GN Officers holds great importance, serving as the cornerstone of our countrys basic administrative structure. In our ongoing efforts to revitalize the economy amidst its challenges, todays implementation of a rapid development program is a crucial step forward. Collaborating with international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) signifies our commitment to overcoming obstacles and fulfilling necessary conditions for progress. This development initiative places the village at its core, recognizing its pivotal role in driving the development across the country. Our recent strides in agricultural productivity serve as proof to the effectiveness of our development strategy. Successful harvests in the Yala seasons of 2022 and 2023, followed by another prosperous Maha season in 2023, have bolstered our economic resilience. These achievements highlight the pivotal role of agriculture in our journey towards economic strength and prosperity. Today marks a significant juncture as we embark on the crucial task of appointing 2100 GN Officers, granting them the authority not only for administrative duties but also for spearheading rural economic development programs. This appointment underscores the pivotal role each of you plays in shaping the future of our communities. In this endeavour, collaboration between Divisional Secretaries and GN Officers is the most important thing. I emphasize four key areas where joint efforts are essential. The implementation of the Aswesuma program stands as a cornerstone in our efforts to uplift low-income earners, with plans to triple allowances compared to Samurdhi. Completing the computerization of beneficiary information by year-end streamlines program execution, ensuring smoother operations from the following year. Additionally, expanding the pool of beneficiaries reflects our commitment to increasing relief efforts, thereby fortifying village economies. Furthermore, enhancing income sources for these individuals is imperative, as their earnings contribute significantly to village economies. Initiatives such as providing 10 kilograms of rice to low-income families during the last New Year season not only alleviate financial burdens but also support local rice mill owners, thereby stimulating economic activity within villages. Sustaining and expanding these initiatives are vital steps towards fostering whole village development. Also, we have initiated another groundbreaking initiative, granting free land rights to its residents, a move poised to revolutionize their economy. This progressive step towards land ownership marks a significant transformation, bringing forth newfound economic opportunities that extend throughout the village community. Furthermore, the villages economic landscape undergoes further strengthening through an ambitious agricultural modernization endeavour. Historically, the region boasted agricultural prosperity, with lucrative exports such as spices, including cumin, flourishing from Dambadeniya to Kandy. The colonial era saw a thriving export economy cantered on tea, rubber, and coconut, indicative of the regions agricultural prowess. In a bid to reignite the countrys economy, a comprehensive agricultural development strategy has been devised, starting at the Divisional Secretariat Divisional Level. Collaborating with the private sector, agricultural modernization committees have been established at Govijana Seva centers, inspiring local farmers towards progress. Presently, 25 Divisional Secretariats have been earmarked for this transformative initiative, each receiving substantial financial backing. The path is set for expansion, with plans to extend this initiative to 100 Divisional Secretariat Divisions by the following year, signalling a resolute commitment to agricultural revitalization and economic revival. The eradication of village poverty pivots on the development of village agriculture, making the agricultural modernization program imperative. While certain southern regions have prospered through tourism, the overarching objective remains the development of the village economy. Active participation from all residents is crucial to drive these initiatives forward and foster economic growth within their respective areas. Additionally, a rural education and health improvement program has been initiated, necessitating the collective engagement of the community. Efforts to streamline land deeds related to the Urumaya program are underway, with plans to introduce a mobile service for enhanced efficiency. It is anticipated that all land deeds will be successfully processed within the next two months, facilitating smoother implementation of the programs objectives. --PMD",

The President also expressed that it is his expectation to conclude all negotiations by the middle of this year, and that the ultimate goal of debt restructuring is to reduce the total amount of debt to 95 of the GDP by 2032. Furthermore, he mentioned that during the first three months of the year, the exchange rate of the US Dollar was brought to a level below Rs. 300 and the foreign reserves were raised to a value of more than USD 5 billion, noting that he was able to achieve this situation as he followed a challenging, difficult but the correct path. Additionally, Wickremesinghe said a salary increment for government employees can be considered only next year based on the economic growth of 2024 and Government income since the current revenue of the government is not sufficient to consider such salary adjustment requests. Following is the full statement made by Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament; Hon. Speaker, Since assuming the responsibility of rebuilding the nation, I have regularly presented this House with updates on the true state of the economy. Over the past two years, I have shared with you information about the economy and outlined future economic strategies. When I assumed leadership, our nation was in crisis: the economy was severely contracted, with inflation soaring to 70. The budget deficit had surged to over 10-12  of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), prompting an increase in the interest rate to 30. Moreover, the value of the dollar had risen to approximately LKR 450, while our foreign exchange reserves had depleted to zero. There were insufficient funds to import food and essential goods, even for a week, leaving the nation on the brink of crisis. The majority of the population found themselves on the streets, with some enduring lengthy queues for necessities, while others faced prolonged struggles Against this backdrop, I willingly embraced the task of revitalizing both the nation and its economy. At that crucial moment, no one else volunteered to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. Instead, they put forth different conditions. I unconditionally embraced the task of leading the country, despite my party holding only one seat in parliament. I took on this mission amidst challenging circumstances. I undertook this daunting mission with confidence for three key reasons: I had a well-thought-out plan, relevant experience and established international connections. Consequently, I firmly believed that despite the countrys descent into chaos, recovery was possible. Hon. Speaker Since then, we have actively initiated economic stabilization and recovery programs. Consequently, economic growth began in mid-2023. We anticipate economic growth of at least 3 this year, a forecast supported by multiple domestic and international financial institutions. Inflation has significantly decreased to 1.5. Additionally, the primary account balance, previously in deficit for several years, turned into a surplus of 0.6 of GDP in 2023. For the first time in many decades, a surplus in the current account of the balance of payments was achieved in 2023. Furthermore, interest rates decreased substantially, reaching levels as low as 10-13. Tourism rebounded, and remittances from foreign workers rose significantly. By the first quarter of 2024, the exchange rate dropped to less than LKR 300 per US dollar. Furthermore, foreign exchange reserves exceeded US 5 billion, signalling a favourable trajectory in economic stability. We reached this progress by navigating a challenging and demanding path, one that we believed to be the right course of action. Despite facing criticism from certain groups within the country, we persisted in our efforts. Despite facing criticism at every turn, ranging from our endorsement of IMF support to the implementation of economic discipline, we persevered. Amidst the onslaught of criticism, slander, and rumours, we pressed on, recognizing that there was no alternative path forward. Starting from September 2023, we proceeded methodically, implementing measures to control public spending. Numerous price reforms were also initiated across various goods and services. Government revenues stood at below 8 of GDP, insufficient to cover government expenditure, which accounted for 20 of the Gross Domestic Product. Consequently, the only viable solution was to enhance state revenue. Numerous past administrations provided employment, raised salaries, subsidized fuel, electricity, and water services, and managed budget deficits by borrowing from foreign countries or printing money. We opted to alter this approach. Adapting to such a change all at once was challenging, given the years of conditioning to operate in this manner. For the country to undergo reconstruction, someone must spearhead this transformation. Hon. Speaker Through a series of reforms, we established financial discipline within the country. Another crucial reform for economic stability was restructuring our debt. This was a significant consideration for finalizing the IMF agreements in September 2022. By December 2022, the total debt as a percentage of GDP had reached 128, a concerning level. Hence, we devised a debt restructuring program, which was structured into three primary phases. The initial phase involved restructuring domestic debt. The first phase was finalized in 2023. The second phase focused on restructuring loans obtained through official agreements with foreign countries. Following negotiations with these nations, a policy agreement on debt restructuring was successfully reached by November 2023. For this purpose, both the Paris Club and non-Paris Club countries, including China, have reached a policy agreement. The next step involves signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the creditor countries to finalize the process. The Sri Lankan government is presently in discussions regarding the draft with the Official Creditors Committee. Additionally, negotiations are underway with Chinas EXIM Bank. The third phase identified for restructuring is commercial debt. Consulting firm Lazard and Clifford Chance, representing the Sri Lankan government, are currently engaged in negotiations with the creditors committee. Negotiations are progressing positively, with both parties considering proposals. We aim to conclude these discussions by the middle of this year. The overarching objective of debt restructuring is to decrease our total debt to 95 of GDP by 2032, maintain the governments gross financial requirement at 13 annually, and limit external debt servicing to 4.5 annually. Ensuring debt sustainability is paramount for long-term economic advancement. Without it, sustaining economic progress becomes untenable. As part of our efforts, weve initiated an anti-corruption program based on the Governance Diagnostic Report, conducted with support from the IMF. Over the past couple of years, our government has diligently endeavoured to bring relief to our citizens through the outcomes of our economic recovery initiative. We arranged to directly grant substantial sums of money to economically disadvantaged groups in our country under the Aswasuma program and other relief initiatives. Moreover, allowances granted to kidney patients, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities have been increased by 50. Under this program, economically disadvantaged groups receive more than three times the existing Samurdhi subsidy. In 2024, a total of Rs. 205 billion will be spent for these relief programs. Relief programs in Sri Lanka trace their origins back to the Second World War. Since then, there has not been such a significant allocation of funds to aid the impoverished. Over the course of the 2022 Yala season, 202223 Maha season, 2023 Yala season and 202324 Maha season, our agricultural practices have yielded successful harvests. The government has contemplated providing a portion of the crops to the impoverished free of charge. Accordingly, arrangements were made last year and this year during the Sinhala and Tamil New Years to provide free rice to the impoverished. The government intends to continue supporting those in need in the future. It is expected to allocate an expenditure of Rs.12 billion a for this purpose in 2024. Starting from January 2024, government employees began receiving a monthly living allowance of Rs.5000, which has now been increased to Rs.10,000. Additionally, starting from April, retired government employees also receive a monthly pension allowance of Rs.2, 500. While these allowances may not fully address the broader cost of living concerns, the government has extended the maximum level of concessions it can afford. It can be seen that the prices of imported goods have significantly decreased in recent months due to the strengthening of the rupee. This strengthening has caused a notable decrease in the prices of gas, mineral oil, milk powder, and other essentials. Additionally, the decrease in interest rates has provided a boost to the entrepreneurial sector. Despite receiving numerous requests for salary revisions, there is currently no government revenue growth allocated to address this in 2024. Past instances of indiscriminate concessions have had detrimental effects on our economy and the livelihoods of people. It is imperative that we do not revert to such practices. The economic crisis has affected every part of society, and everyone has been going through a very difficult time over the past two years. Based on the trajectory of economic growth in 2024 and the corresponding increase in government revenue, reconsideration of public sector salaries next year is a realistic possibility. Leaving the current economic program could lead us back into a huge disaster. We have realized several positive outcomes through the program initiated under the IMFs guidance since September 2022. It is imperative to exceed mere economic stabilization and recovery efforts and transition our economy onto a sustainable path. Implementing a formal and swift program to achieve this transformation is essential. We have not yet begun repaying our foreign debt. At the conclusion of the debt restructuring process, we will be required to settle these debts. To do so, it is essential to increase government revenue. Also, it requires building up our foreign exchange reserves. We must avoid further contributing to uncertainty about the countrys future by continually taking on foreign loans. Such actions would only burden the next generation of the country. Its essential to utilize the countrys resources effectively and manage the economy efficiently to ensure a positive transformation without wasting those valuable assets. As a small economy heavily reliant on foreign transactions, we must pay more attention to exports. Additionally, we must focus on transitioning towards a green economy while safeguarding the environment. New technical dimensions, including information technology, must be incorporated into economic tasks. Without these measures, an economy cannot be sustained over the long term. Establishing a social-market economic foundation, ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits from economic reforms across all parts, is crucial. To boost our economic prowess, we must pursue a trajectory of swift economic expansion. Heightened economic growth will alleviate our debt burden and reduce the cost of living. Our economy cannot sustainably support loss-making state enterprises that weigh heavily on the people. The government has presented an alternative procedure to address this issue. If private sector intervention can effectively manage government enterprises, those entities burdening the people with taxes and losses should be re-evaluated. A significant portion of the countrys land is presently under government control, lacking proper utilization and burdening the public. In the past, these lands were effectively managed by the private sector as thriving agricultural enterprises, generating substantial income for the government. They also contributed significantly to the countrys foreign exchange reserves during that period. Therefore, we have initiated steps to establish a commercial export-oriented agricultural economy, with active involvement from local private entities focused on commercial exports, to address the said issue. The Urumaya program, aimed at granting land rights to approximately two million farming families after the 1930s, is moving forward effectively. This grants them full freehold ownership of the land. In such a situation, it is impossible to prevent the emergence of thousands of agribusinesses across Sri Lanka based on this program. Also, maximizing the utilization of existing agricultural land to its fullest potential is paramount. Accordingly, an initiative for agricultural modernization has been initiated to enhance the agricultural productivity. Empowering farmers through modern technology is one of the key objectives of this process. Currently, this initiative has been implemented in 26 Divisional Secretariat Divisions. Plans are underway to extend its reach to an additional 75 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the coming months. The economic crisis has forced many small and medium-scale enterprises, which constitute a vital sector of the Sri Lankan economy, to halt operations. A program has been formulated to restore these businesses to their former vitality. The government has made significant investments in this regard, with numerous loan schemes organized to support the sector. Shortly after the amendment of the Parate Law, further relief measures were swiftly implemented. Additionally, a special unit dedicated to small and medium-scale enterprises has been established within the Treasury to coordinate related activities. Tourism has emerged as a rapidly growing sector in our economy. In comparison to the first four months of 2023, there has been a remarkable growth of over 75 percent in tourist arrivals during the corresponding period in 2024. To date, nearly 800,000 tourists have visited Sri Lanka this year. Both the government and the private sector are actively engaged in implementing a comprehensive program aimed at enhancing the infrastructure necessary for the tourism industry. Enhancing our foreign investment sector is pivotal for long-term economic growth. Given the finite nature of investments that can be mobilized domestically, the establishment of formal laws and a modern institutional framework is imperative to attract foreign investments into the country. To this end, we anticipate the establishment of a new Economic Commission through the amalgamation of various existing out-dated institutions. Furthermore, a new consolidated law has been drafted to supersede out-dated legislation pertaining to investments. It is anticipated that the requisite procedures will be undertaken within this month. Numerous sectors necessitate modernization to facilitate rapid economic growth in the country. These include education, healthcare, transportation, vocational training, urban development, defence, information technology, foreign relations, supply chains, export industries and the workforce. An approach has been adopted to enact reforms aimed at fostering holistic growth across the power sector. We anticipate sustaining our foreign relations network grounded in economic activities. Initial groundwork for establishing an international trade institute within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been completed, with a new law also prepared for this purpose. In the past two years, over 30 new laws and amendments have been enacted in this parliament with the objective of economic reforms in the country. Additionally, several similar laws are anticipated to be presented to this house in the near future. Notably, the Economic Transformation Bill, the Public Finance Bill and the Public Debt Management Bill are among the prominent legislations slated for submission. The Economic Transformation Bill encompasses provisions for the establishment of key entities such as the Sri Lanka Economic Commission, Investment Infrastructure Corporation, International Trade Institute, National Productivity Commission and Sri Lanka Economic and Trade Institute. The Economic Transformation Bill incorporates a range of measures intended to guide the governments actions over the long term. Irrespective of which government assumes power in the future, it is imperative that the provisions outlined in the Act are upheld to prevent the economy from descending into turmoil once more. I have consistently emphasized the necessity of implementing a continued and long-term program that garners widespread consensus to address the crises facing our nation and prevent recurrence of such tragedies. It is noteworthy that the opposition has provided crucial support for the economic reforms we have undertaken thus far. Continued support will be crucial to sustain the momentum of the reform process into the future. Despite facing various challenges, the people have demonstrated their backing for the governments economic reform program over the past two years. As a result of the strides made in transitioning from a struggling economy to one that is now stable, our country has surpassed its position from two years ago. Despite the progress, there are certain groups that, unable to tolerate this advancement, trivialize our journey by likening it to an interval in hell. Allow me to address this notion. Indeed, we found ourselves in a state of economic turmoil akin to hell. However, through meticulous planning and strategic measures, we are gradually emerging from this dire situation. Its crucial to recognize that deviating from our current trajectory, driven by short-term and narrow objectives lacking a long-term vision, could lead us back into the depths of economic despair. Should this occur, we would all endure a prolonged period of profound hardship and adversity. Its encouraging to witness rival political factions increasingly recognizing the success of the programs weve implemented thus far. Recent observations during the New Year period, reflected in social media comments, indicate a growing trend of cooperative income on the rise, as evidenced by images depicting people flocking to cooperative stores. While those pictures and comments may have been posted with political intentions, they inadvertently reflect a truth: the improved conditions of the people compared to two years ago. Somewhat more promising than before. I emphasized the challenging nature of the mission I undertook for our nation by likening it to traversing a vine bridge. Even those who initially disregarded the gravity of the situation now acknowledge its severity. This underscores the undeniable reality that we have no alternative but to steer clear of such precarious paths. Presently, many concede that there exists no alternative route forward. I reiterate once more: there exists no alternative path to reconstructing our economy. No other program rivals the efficacy of the one currently in place, nor does any other plan offer a viable alternative. This underscores the critical need for a unified agreement and consensus on our economic reform program. Achieving consensus extends beyond the representatives within this House. It necessitates a unified consensus which is not solely the responsibility of public representatives in Parliament, but also falls upon religious leaders, trade unions, professionals, the business community, non-governmental organizations, various opinion leaders, individuals with social influence, and every citizen. By advancing with agreement and consensus, we have the potential to swiftly elevate our standing as a developed nation on the global stage. Otherwise, prioritizing personal interests over the nations well-being during this critical juncture, could mark the onset of significant devastation. We implore everyone to recognize these perils and strive towards a unified agreement and consensus for the greater good of the country. Lets seize this opportunity to contribute to the recovery and betterment of our country for the benefit of future generations. Together, lets nurture this endeavour to propel the nation. Our actions today will shape the judgment in the future. Will we be labelled as traitors to our nation, or will we get recognized as a group that genuinely cared for our country? That is the decision we must make today.",

Issuing a statement in this regard, the Minister highlighted the presence of a human trafficking network that is currently facilitating the recruitment of Sri Lankan youths for military service in Russia. Under the guise of offering lucrative positions within the Russian army, retired military personnel are being enlisted by these traffickers. However, instead of legitimate military service, these individuals are being deployed to serve in the Russian mercenary group known as Wagner, the minister revealed. The statement further disclosed that these recruits are being assigned to frontline security duties and that they have gone unpaid for several months. Minister Nanayakkara stressed that no individual will be dispatched abroad for military service without prior approval from the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and the Government of Sri Lanka. Therefore, the SLBFE also requests the citizens to refrain from seeking employment opportunities abroad on tourist visas under any circumstances. In the meantime, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested two retired army officers in Kurunegala area for fraudulently obtaining money from individuals on the promise of securing them employment in the Russian army.

Additionally, he highlighted plans for the drafting of the National Cyber Security Act in May. The State Minister made these remarks during a press conference conducted today (09) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. State Minister Kanaka Herath further said; The cabinet approval has endorsed the National Digital Strategy 2030, featuring six key points. Among these, the initial focus is on infrastructure, connectivity, access, skills, literacy, industries, jobs, and establishing a connected digital government. Moreover, emphasis is placed on cyber security, data security, privacy, digital financial services, and the digitization of small and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, a global project promotion conference, in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Investment Promotion, is scheduled to hold on 25th June. Additionally, we have worked on the provision of 1000 user-friendly classrooms for schools. Before the end of this year, arrangements are underway to extend this provision to another 500 schools. Efforts are also directed towards creating job opportunities for non-IT graduates and holders of NVQ level 4 qualifications. Moreover, after a period of 28 years, the amended bill for amending the Telecommunications Regulatory Act will be presented to Parliament tomorrow (10). Previously, regulations concerning undersea cables were non-existent. Now, legislation addressing this matter has become feasible. The user base across all social networks has surged from 60 million to 74 million. However, there is an imperative for a National Cyber Security Act. Consequently, plans are underway to draft the pertinent legislation by May 2024. Additionally, collaborative efforts involving 29 government agencies, alongside Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT), have been undertaken to strengthen cyber security, resulting in the implementation of five projects.

        "content": "AI could make your relatives haunt you from beyond the grave, researchers are warning. The budding digital afterlife industry could cause serious psychological harm to those in mourning if left unchecked, according to a new study out of the University of Cambridge. Griefbots or deadbots are starting to crop up, researchers said, and it sounds like something right out of an episode of Black Mirror. These bots use generative AI to allow people to have text and voice conversations with the deceased, using their past digital footprints to conjure a likeness. Some examples include Project December and HereAfter AI, according to the study, which also imagined fictional companies to explore the possible consequences. But AI ethicists at Cambridges Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence warn that AI could one day push ads on grieving relatives or confuse children. The researchers imagined scenarios in which a child is tricked by an AI recreation of their dead parent to meet someone in real life, or a woman gets pitched a food delivery app from her dead grandmother. The study said greifbots need to have an off button. That way users can disengage with the replica and wont feel haunted. But this could also prove difficult depending on the kind of service contract a deceased person has consented to, researchers noted. Co-author Dr. Tomasz Hollanek suggested a griefbot might even need to be retired via a digital funeral. This area of AI is an ethical minefield, added co-author Dr. Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska. The rights of both data donors and those who interact with AI afterlife services should be equally safeguarded. Researchers came up with a list of principles to ethically create griefbots. In addition to allowing them to be shut down, researchers suggested the bots should have visible disclaimers about risks, restrictions that bar children from using them, and emphasizing mutual consent for both the deceased and users.

The fertility rate in South Korea has been severely hit and continues on a dramatic decline in 2023 as women concerned about their careers and the financial cost of raising children are either delayed childbirth or deciding not to have babies. Women have cited the heavy emotional and physical burden of raising a child mostly by themselves, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost, setting the first such trend impacting a national demographic globally. On Thursday, Mr Yoon said South Korean parliament will be requested for cooperation to set up what he called the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-Planning. We will mobilise all of the nations capabilities to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, he said, announcing a new policy push. The demographic crisis in the country is blamed on a number of factors, but largely Korean couples frustrations with rising cost of living and declining quality of life have been considered as the primary reasons. Addressing his first press conference in 21 months, the president pushed for improving the economy performance as he flagged the emergency of declining birth rates the coming three years of his term. I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy. Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them, the South Korean leader said. He was standing behind a plaque which read: The Buck Stops Here. The ministry will address the challenges contributing to the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population. This is not a matter we can take time to work on, he said. The South Korean government and policymakers have been striving to find new and innovative measures to address the crisis of dwindling child birth rates. The birth rates in the country dropped to 0.72 babies per woman in a lifetime in 2023, the lowest national birth rate. Under the governments scheme to motivate parents, South Korean couples receive financial assistance ranging from 35m won (20,566) to 50m won (29,380) through different incentive and support programs from the time of their childs birth until they reach the age of seven. It comes as the boss of a South Korean firm is offering employees up to 59,000 to have children and help lift the countrys birth rate. Booyoung Group, a construction firm based in Seoul, plans to pay employees 100m Korean won each time they have a baby. Source: Independent --Agencies",

        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has raised significant concerns regarding the prolonged delay in appointing judges to fill vacancies in the Court of Appeal. In a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the BASL highlighted the pressing issue of as many as five vacancies currently existing within the Court of Appeal. The Bar Association has emphasized its duty to express deep concern over the situation, stressing the urgent need for attention. The association also underscored the pivotal role of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law, ensuring justice, and safeguarding citizens rights. The letter further highlighted the detrimental effects of prolonged vacancies on the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system. the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system are significantly hampered when key positions remain vacant for extended periods. The backlog of cases would increase, leading to delays in the dispensation of justice, erosion of public trust in the legal system, and ultimately, the denial of justice to citizens. This could, in addition, further reduce Sri Lankas ratings in ease of doing business, which in turn, would hamper efforts at economic recovery, it added. Furthermore, the absence of a full bench in the superior courts was noted to diminish the diversity of perspectives and expertise crucial for comprehensive and balanced adjudication. While acknowledging the complexity of the appointment process, the Bar Association has urged the President to prioritize the matter and ensure that the situation does not persist indefinitely. Meanwhile, the BASL reiterated its commitment to safeguarding the principles of democracy and the sovereignty of citizens enshrined in the Constitution, expressing hope for an expeditious and favourable response from the authorities.",

        "date": "May 10, 2024 10:10 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized his recognition of the challenges women face in safeguarding their families amidst the economic crisis. He highlighted the governments swift action by presenting two bills to the Parliament aimed at empowering women during this initial phase of economic recovery. The President indicated that these bills are anticipated to be ratified by the Parliament in June, thereby enforcing a national policy on gender equality and womens empowerment, the Presidents Media Division said. This includes the establishment of a National Commission on Women and mechanisms to protect womens rights and prevent violations thereof, including legal recourse. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his keynote address at the unveiling of three Anti-Violence Global Gestures handprints against sexual violence targeting women and girls in public spaces, organized by DP Education at the Nelum Pokuna Theater in Colombo today (10), the PMD reported. Addressing the gathering President Ranil Wickremesinghe said: Mr. Dhammika Perera has initiated a transformative movement. His initiative against violence towards women deserves recognition. Enterprises such as DP Education should play a pivotal role in shaping future education. Historically, education was conducted outdoors under trees, using stone slabs as tools. Over time, buildings and books became integral to the educational process. However, the advent of mobile phones has introduced new dynamics. Education has evolved from traditional temple-based learning to modern classroom settings. Today, technology such as smart classrooms is revolutionizing education. Mr. Dhammika Pereras introduction of DP Education represents a new paradigm in education. This foundation has provided resources to 600 schools, reshaping tuition classes as well. With the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), education stands poised for further revolution. It is imperative that children benefit from these advancements and efforts should be made to ensure universal access to quality education. While addressing violence against women, todays event introduced techniques for prevention. Legislation against such violence is being introduced in parliament. These hand signals serve as practical tools to combat violence against women, signalling our commitment to safeguarding womens rights. Action must accompany words and through these signals, society can become more vigilant against violence towards women, fostering a culture of resistance. I anticipate significant publicity for this initiative, given the presence of both capitalists and philanthropists in our nation. Philanthropists, individuals who amass wealth and engage in social endeavours, exemplify this spirit. Mr. Dhammika Perera stands as a prime example through his altruistic actions. This endeavour holds promise in empowering women against the scourge of violence they face, particularly exacerbated by economic crises. Upon assuming office, I witnessed first-hand the dire plight of women, many heading households amidst scarcity. Hence, our dedication to bolstering their empowerment. Presented before Parliament are the Womens Empowerment Bill and the Gender Equality Bill, pivotal instruments for enacting a national policy on gender parity and womens empowerment. These bills advocate for the establishment of a National Commission on Women, equipped to safeguard womens rights and pursue justice for any violations thereof. Furthermore, a specialized commission will address instances of violence against women, providing prompt remedies as needed. Remarkably, women are increasingly excelling in education, yet impediments persist. It falls upon us to dismantle these barriers. The Womens caucus in the Parliament has been established, underscoring their pivotal role in this endeavour. We are committed to fostering social justice by redressing the challenges confronting women and girls. Both bills are slated for passage in June. I have initiated discussions with the Prime Minister to augment female representation in local government elections following the presidential and general elections. It is our aspiration to ensure at least a 25 representation of women in parliamentary seats and to bolster their presence in provincial councils. Additionally, efforts are underway to acknowledge womens political rights. By 2030, amendments to the law should establish recognition for a womens political party. Our focus remains on affirming womens rights in Sri Lanka and ensuring their rightful representation. Founder of DP Education and Chairman MP Dhammika Perera: Dhammika and Priscilla Perera Foundation was founded in 2016 with the vision of cultivating a nation abundant in educational opportunities. Today, we have successfully equipped schoolchildren with essential resources, benefiting around 1.5 million students. Additionally, our foundation has initiated a dedicated program tailored for pre-school children, emphasizing early education and development. As advised by child psychiatrists, we endeavoured to design a program tailored to the rich traditional heritage of Sri Lanka. Through our efforts, we have established 1000 preschools aimed at nurturing the complete childhood development of children. Recognizing the unique cultural richness of South Asia and the high quality of Sri Lankas education system, our foundation is dedicated to shaping a youth steeped in both tradition and technology. We achieve this by imparting knowledge in information technology and language skills. --PMD",

        "title": "UN General Assembly backs Palestinian bid for membership",
        "date": "May 10, 2024 10:28 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member by recognizing it as qualified to join and recommending the U.N. Security Council reconsider the matter favorably. The vote by the 193-member General Assembly was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full U.N. member - a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state - after the United States vetoed it in the U.N. Security Council last month. The assembly adopted a resolution with 143 votes in favor and nine against - including the U.S. and Israel - while 25 countries abstained. It does not give the Palestinians full U.N. membership, but simply recognizes them as qualified to join. The resolution determines that the State of Palestine ... should therefore be admitted to membership and it recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favorably. The Palestinian push for full U.N. membership comes seven months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the U.N. considers to be illegal. We want peace, we want freedom, Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the assembly before the vote. A yes vote is a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. ... It is an investment in peace. Voting yes is the right thing to do, he said in remarks that drew applause. Under the founding U.N. Charter, membership is open to peace-loving states that accept the obligations in that document and are able and willing to carry them out. As long as so many of you are Jew-hating, you dont really care that the Palestinians are not peace-loving, U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who spoke after Mansour, told his fellow diplomats. He accused the assembly of shredding the U.N. Charter - as he used a small shredder to destroy a copy of the Charter while at the lectern. Shame on you, Erdan said. An application to become a full U.N. member first needs to be approved by the 15-member Security Council and then the General Assembly. If the measure is again voted on by the council it is likely to face the same fate: a U.S. veto. ADDITIONAL U.N. RIGHTS Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood told the General Assembly after the vote that unilateral measures at the U.N. and on the ground will not advance a two-state solution. Our vote does not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood; we have been very clear that we support it and seek to advance it meaningfully. Instead, it is an acknowledgement that statehood will only come from a process that involves direct negotiations between the parties, he said. The United Nations has long endorsed a vision of two states living side by side within secure and recognized borders. Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, all territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war with neighboring Arab states. The General Assembly resolution adopted on Friday does give the Palestinians some additional rights and privileges from September 2024 - like a seat among the U.N. members in the assembly hall - but they will not be granted a vote in the body. The Palestinians are currently a non-member observer state, a de facto recognition of statehood that was granted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2012. They are represented at the U.N. by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank. Hamas ousted the Palestinian Authority from power in Gaza in 2007. Hamas - which has a charter calling for Israels destruction - launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered Israels assault on Gaza. Erdan said on Monday that, if the General Assembly adopted the resolution, he expected Washington to cut funding to the United Nations and its institutions. Under U.S. law, Washington cannot fund any U.N. organization that grants full membership to any group that does not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood. The United States cut funding in 2011 for the U.N. cultural agency, UNESCO, after the Palestinians joined as a full member. On Thursday, 25 Republican U.S. senators - more than half of the partys members in the chamber - introduced a bill to tighten those restrictions and cut off funding to any entity giving rights and privileges to the Palestinians. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, which is controlled by President Joe Bidens Democrats. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 11, 2024 10:22 am",
        "content": "Debt owed by various countries, especially in South Asia and Africa, to China has multiplied in recent years. China is either the sole or the major lender for the majority of these countries. In other words, these nations owe a large share of their external debt only to China. Only the top 20 countries that owe the most debt to China in absolute terms in 2022 are depicted. External debt stock is the debt owed by a country to non-residents repayable in currency, goods, or services. It is the sum of all public, publicly guaranteed, and private non-guaranteed long-term debt, and short term debts. The debt owed by South Asian, African, and South American countries to China increased significantly post the 2010s. According to the World Banks latest International Debt Report 2023, this was due to Chinas Going Global Strategy, which was initiated in 1999 to improve Chinese investment and lending abroad. By the end of 2022, low-and-middle-income countries owed China a total of 180 billion. In comparison, the low-and-middle-income countries total debt owed to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a global development cooperative owned by 189 nations, was just a little higher at 223 billion. Interestingly, China has given a big chunk of its new loans in recent years to neighbouring countries, while its loans to African and South American economies have fallen. Pakistans total external debt stocks owed to China rapidly surged from 7.6 billion in 2016 to 26.5 billion in 2022. In the same period, Sri Lankas total debt owed to China almost doubled from 4.6 billion to 8.8 billion. Bangladeshs increased from 0.97 billion to 6 billion. Maldives increased from 0.3 billion to 1.2 billion. Nepals increased from 0.07 billion to 0.26 billion. Most of the debts owed to China are in the form of loans for infrastructure projects. However, in recent years, China has cut back its overall lending due to two factors. According to the World Bank debt report, this is because Chinas own economic position is not strong. And some of the countries it lent to are defaulting on their payments because the investments funded by China have not been financially successful. After months of food and fuel shortage, Sri Lanka defaulted on foreign debt in 2022. According to a Reuters story, Sri Lankas interest payments will form nearly 54 of the countrys revenue this year, whereas Pakistans share is even higher at around 57. Bangladeshs interest payments will be 31.5 of its revenue. And most of these nations owe a large share of bilateral debt to China. Notably, China too, during high levels of economic expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, increasingly accumulated foreign debt from countries such as Japan, Germany and France. But its external debt stocks have rapidly fallen in recent years due to repayments. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "date": "May 11, 2024 12:14 pm",
        "content": "An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week. NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For most people here on planet Earth, they wont have to do anything, said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues. Thats really the gift from space weather  the aurora, said Steenburgh. He and his colleagues said the best aurora views may come from phone cameras, which are better at capturing light than the naked eye. Snap a picture of the sky and there might be actually a nice little treat there for you, said Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center. The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii. We are not anticipating that but it could come close, said NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl. This storm poses a risk for high-voltage transmission lines for power grids, not the electrical lines ordinarily found in peoples homes, Dahl told reporters. Satellites also could be affected, which in turn could disrupt navigation and communication services here on Earth. An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003, for example, took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa. Even when the storm is over, signals between GPS satellites and ground receivers could be scrambled or lost, according to NOAA. But there are so many navigation satellites that any outages should not last long, Steenburgh noted. The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday, resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption  known as a coronal mass ejection  can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the suns outer atmosphere, or corona. The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot thats 16 times the diameter of Earth, according to NOAA. Its all part of the solar activity thats ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle. NASA said the storm posed no serious threat to the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The biggest concern is the increased radiation levels, and the crew could move to a better shielded part of the station if necessary, according to Steenburgh. Increased radiation also could threaten some of NASAs science satellites. Extremely sensitive instruments will be turned off, if necessary, to avoid damage, said Antti Pulkkinen, director of the space agencys heliophysics science division. Several sun-focused spacecraft are monitoring all the action. This is exactly the kinds of things we want to observe, Pulkkinen said. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Protesters attempt to storm Germanys Tesla factory",
        "date": "May 11, 2024 03:53 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of climate protesters have clashed with police in Germany after attempting to storm the Tesla factory near Berlin. Several people were injured, including three police officers, during Fridays demonstration against the proposed expansion of the electric car giants only European plant. Police made several arrests and prevented activists from gaining access to the facility. Campaigners have been camped out in woods in Grünheide, in the state of Brandenburg, since February, claiming Teslas plans to double the size of its factory would damage the environment. Demonstrators on Friday blocked a nearby motorway and interrupted the railway service by sitting on the tracks, police said. There was also a sit-in on a country road near the factory. Footage on social media shows hundreds of people, many donning blue caps and holding blue flags, running towards the site attempting to gain access. One video, verified by the BBC, shows protesters breaking through the police cordon and entering the grounds of the factory, which is located around 30km (18 miles) from the capital. They can be seen heading towards an outlying building at the northeast corner of the Gigafactory grounds. Police confirmed that protesters who tried to enter the facility were prevented from doing so, with several people taken into custody. Tesla said earlier this week that the site would be closed for the day due to the demonstration, with employees reportedly allowed to work from home. In a post on his social media platform X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said the group did not manage to break into the facility. Why do the police let the left-wing protesters off so easily? Musk wrote in another post. The Disrupt Tesla group had been calling for mass protests against the expansion to take place between 8 and 12 May. Speaking to Reuters news agency on Friday, Ole Becker, a spokesman for Disrupt Tesla, said the protesters aimed to draw attention to the environmental destruction in Grünheide. Some activists have occupied part of the forest expected to be cleared for the expanded factory for months, building tree houses and erecting signs in opposition. Known as the Gigafactory, the facility currently employs an estimated 12,000 people and makes around 500,000 cars a year. Production had to be briefly halted in March after a power outage was triggered by a suspected arson attack. The far-left activist group known as Volcano Group claimed responsibility.

I will support members of marginalized populations, accountability, truth and reconciliation, and transparency and justice in Sri Lanka, she said, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday (May 09).

She emphasized the United States role in providing aid during the 2022 crisis and reiterated continued support for Sri Lankas economic recovery. Security collaboration between the two nations was also emphasized, particularly in addressing transnational crime, enhancing maritime security, and responding to natural disasters in the strategically significant Indian Ocean region. If confirmed, I will reiterate our shared commitment to a free and open Indo Pacific region, collaborative maritime security, the rules-based international order, and stability throughout the Indian Ocean, she added. The US Presidents nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka expressed eagerness to deepen people-to-people ties, including with the Sri Lankan American community, and to support marginalized populations, accountability, truth, and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
