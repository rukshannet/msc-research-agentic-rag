        "date": "March 18, 2025 06:38 am",
        "content": "Lebanons Defence Minister Michel Menassa and his Syrian counterpart Murhaf Abu Qasra agreed on a ceasefire, the Lebanese and Syrian defence ministries said in statements on Monday, as cross-border clashes in the last two days left 10 dead. Three soldiers in Syrias new army and seven Lebanese were killed in border clashes during the past two days, the Syrian defence ministry and Lebanese health ministry said. On the Lebanese side, 52 people were wounded, the health ministry said. The Lebanese and Syrian defence ministers also agreed on continuing contacts between the army intelligence directorates to prevent more deterioration on the border. The mountainous frontier has been a flashpoint in the three months since Islamist rebels toppled Syrias Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Tehran and Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, and installed their own institutions and army. Meanwhile, Lebanons Foreign Affairs Minister Youssef Raji met his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shibani in Brussels to discuss the cross-border developments and agreed to maintain contacts, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported. Late on Sunday, Syrias defence ministry accused Hezbollah of crossing into Syrian territory and kidnapping and killing the three members of Syrias new army. Hezbollah denied any involvement. A Lebanese security source told Reuters the three Syrian soldiers had crossed into Lebanese territory first and were killed by armed members of a tribe in northeastern Lebanon who feared their town was under attack. Syrian troops responded by shelling Lebanese border towns overnight, according to the Syrian defence ministry and the Lebanese army. Residents of the town of Al-Qasr, less than 1 kilometre (0.6 mile) from the border, told Reuters they fled further inland to escape the bombardment. Lebanons army said in a statement on Monday that it had handed over the bodies of the three killed Syrians to Syrian authorities, and that it had responded to fire from Syrian territory and sent reinforcements to the border area. Syrias army sent a convoy of troops and several tanks to the frontier on Monday, according to a Reuters reporter along the border. Syrian troops fired into the air as they moved through towns on the way to the border. Large military reinforcements were brought in to reinforce positions along the Syrian-Lebanese border and prevent any breaches in the coming days, said Maher Ziwani, the head of a Syrian army division deploying to the border.

        "date": "March 18, 2025 08:07 am",
        "content": "The Academy of Health Professionals has launched a token strike today (March 18) in protest against the governments decision to cut allowances for paramedical professionals under its maiden budget. The strike, which began at 7.00 a.m. today, is being carried out across all hospitals islandwide, with the backing of multiple trade unions. Seven unions from the Joint Federation of Paramedic Professionals and eleven unions from the Joint Front of Paramedic Services have extended their support. According to Co-Convenor of the Academy of Health Professionals Upul Rohana, the strike was called following unsuccessful discussions held yesterday (March 17) with Ministry of Finance officials. However, Chalith Amaradiwakara, the Co-Convenor of the Joint Federation of Paramedic Professionals, has deemed the strike unjustified, signaling a division in opinion among paramedic trade unions. Meanwhile, the Joint Postal Trade Union Front has confirmed that its ongoing postal workers strike will continue today, as negotiations remain unresolved. Co-Convenor of the association Chinthaka Bandara stated that since the strike began the day before yesterday, more than one million mails and parcels have accumulated in post offices across the country. However, Jagath Mahinda, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Postal Services Association, has claimed that the strike has been largely unsuccessful, further deepening the divide within the postal trade unions.",

        "date": "March 18, 2025 08:09 am",
        "content": "The Adani Group is still keen to get Adani Green Energys 1-billion renewable energy power project in Sri Lanka back on its agenda, sources said. In February, the company had said it had decided to withdraw from the project, but it has maintained a foot in the door, as both sides are likely to come to an agreement on the tariffs to be charged, sources with knowledge of the ongoing developments said. Talks and negotiations on the tariffs are still on and a mutually-agreeable tariff rate will soon be settled on, said the sources. Around 7 cents per kWh has been tentatively suggested, while Sri Lanka had earlier asked for 5-6 cents per kWh compared to the originally-proposed 8.26 cents for the 20-year power purchase agreement. Work on the project could begin as early as June, sources indicated provided all the preliminaries and paperwork could be concluded by them. The Indian government is also understood to be in favour of the project going ahead in the island country, which it sees as a strategic investment, the sources said. The Adani Group did not reply to an e-mail sent seeking clarification on the project. Discussions between Adani Green and Sri Lankan government officials, including those from Ceylon Electricity Board, had broken down over tariffs to be charged for the 484-MW renewable energy wind farms at Mannar and Pooneryn. The project had associated transmission lines and additional 220 kv and 400 kv transmission network expansion. Adani Green has already spent 5 million on pre-development activities for the project. Sources pointed out that while the company had written to Sri Lankas Board of Investment about its decision to withdraw from the project, it had taken no legal steps as such to abort it altogether. It also left open a window for future collaborations saying that it would always be available if there were any development opportunities in Sri Lanka. The project has also received most of the regulatory clearances, barring environmental approval in Mannar. The project and the investment, which had been initiated during the previous regime in Sri Lanka, received a setback when the government under the new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a committee to review the project and aim for a lower tariff than had been proposed.

        "content": "Perus president declared a state of emergency in the capital Monday and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address a surge of violence, amid widespread outcry a day after the killing of a popular singer. President Dina Boluartes government published a decree saying that the state of emergency will last 30 days, and authorities will restrict some rights, including the freedom of assembly and movement. That means the police and the army would be able to detain people without a judicial order. Peru has seen an increase of killings, violent extortion and attacks on public places in recent months. Police reported 459 killings from Jan. 1 to March 16, and 1,909 extortion reports in January alone. But outrage crested after the killing Sunday of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. In Congress, opposition lawmakers requested a vote of no confidence against Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez for what they say is a lack of a plan to fight rising violence. The vote is expected to be discussed in the Congress plenary later this week. Flores was shot to death early Sunday when assailants attacked the bus he and bandmates were traveling after a concert in Lima. Cumbia is a Latin music style that people dance to the rhythm of drums, maracas and other instruments. The attack against the popular singer was not the only violent event over the weekend. On Saturday, an object exploded at a restaurant in the capital, injuring at least 11 people. Boluartes government previously decreed a state of emergency in an attempt to stem the violence between September and December. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "March 18, 2025 12:11 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military says it is carrying out extensive strikes in the Gaza Strip, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that at least 220 Palestinians have been killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting what it called terror targets belonging to Hamas. Mahmoud Abu Wafah, the deputy interior minister in Gaza and the highest-ranking Hamas security official in the territory, has reportedly been killed in a strike. This is the largest wave of airstrikes in Gaza since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have failed to reach an agreement. Many people were having their pre-dawn meal, due to it being the holy month of Ramadan, when explosions started in Gaza, witnesses say. More than 20 Israeli war planes flew over, they said. The planes then began to hit targets in Gaza City, Rafah and Khan Younis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered the strikes on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the PMs office. This follows Hamass repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators, it said. Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength, it added. The plan for the strikes was presented by the IDF over the weekend and approved by the political leadership, it said. Israels Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, warned Hamas to release all the hostages, stating we will show no mercy on our enemies. Hamas has responded furiously, accusing Israel of treachery for overturning the ceasefire agreement. It also says Israel is exposing the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza to an unknown fate. But Hamas has not yet declared that it is resuming the war, instead calling on mediators and the United Nations to intervene. US President Donald Trumps administration was consulted by Israel prior to carrying out the strikes, a White House spokesperson told Fox News. Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March. The US proposed extending the first phase until mid-April, including a further exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But a Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Israel and Hamas disagreed over key aspects of the deal set out by Witkoff at the indirect talks. The latest war between Israel and Hamas started on 7 October 2023, when Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage. The assault triggered an Israeli military offensive that has since killed more than 48,520 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others. Most of Gazas 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times. An estimated 70 of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, healthcare, water, and sanitation systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

        "content": "Indias television entertainment industry has recently been left in shock over a fraud case. 25 personalities including Ankita Lokhande, Tejasswi Prakash, Adrija Roy and Aayush Sharma have allegedly been duped for nearly INR 15 million. A police complaint has been registered against five people including the owners of an Indore-based company, Sky 63 Energy Drinks, in a INR 14.8 million fraud case. However, the Mumbai police have reportedly booked Tanish Chhajed and Manu Shrivastava, along with their associates-, Faizal Idrii, Abdul, and Riitik Panchal, under fraud-related charges. Further investigations are currently underway. The police are trying to track down the suspects and recover the money. The energy drink company allegedly cheated a celebrity management firm, Ayman Entertainment. The owner of the management firm, Roshan Bhinder, has filed a complaint against two men, Chhajed, and Shrivastava, at Chembur police station. Chhajed and Shrivastava reportedly approached in 2024 and claimed to be the owners of the energy drink company. According to the reports, the accused allegedly hired the firm to arrange celebrity ad campaigns and promotions on social media. Bhinder reportedly arranged 25 celebrities for the promotions. However, Shrivastava initially claimed that he had transferred INR 01 million as an advance, but Bhinder never received the payment. Despite this, Bhinder started planning the campaign and organized a glamorous event in Dadar, Mumbai on August 10, 2024. The promotional event was notably attended by 100 celebrities including, Arjun Bijlani, Abhishek Bajaj, and Harsh Rajput. Among these, 25 celebrities were selected for the ad campaign. As per the agreement, the celebrities were to receive a total payment of INR 13.2 million, while Bhinders commission would amount to INR 1.6 million. In an attempt to establish credibility, the accused shared an image of a 1.5 million cheque as a payment guarantee, reassuring that the funds would be transferred to Bhinders account shortly. Bhinder then started the ad campaign filming, with videos being shared on social media platforms. The accused then assured her that the payment would be transferred within 35 days. Bhinder had allegedly already paid INR 3.5 million in advance to some celebrities. Source: Money Control --Agencies",

        "date": "March 18, 2025 04:30 pm",
        "content": "The Office of the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued a statement today denying the claims that the former Head of State and his spouse Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe travelled to London for a private visit in 2023 using state funds. The statement noted that Wickremesinghe visited London three times in 2023. The first visit was on May 9, 2023, to attend the coronation of King Charles III. The second visit was for the 40th anniversary session of the International Democratic Union (IDU), while he was attending the Paris Summit, the statement noted. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also attended the G77 Summit in Havana, visited New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) before traveling to London for his third visit. The ceremony to confer the title of Professor on Mrs. Maithree Wickramasinghe by the University of Wolverhampton in the United Kingdom took place during this time and Ranil Wickremesinghe was invited to the ceremony and attended it while returning from New York, the statement said. During these visits, Ranil Wickremesinghe also met with numerous heads of state. As the wife of the then President, Professor Maithree Wickramasinghe participated in meetings and workshops organized at the international level, according to the statement. Furthermore, the statement clarified that although it was initially planned for Ranil Wickremesinghe to leave the city of London in the evening after arriving from New York, his return to Sri Lanka was delayed until the next day due to several meetings scheduled for that evening. The former Presidents Office stated that it is misleading to claim that a substantial amount of government funds was spent on a visit to London by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and officials. This also demonstrates that the current government lacks an understanding of diplomatic trips, it further said. As the President, Ranil Wickremesinghe did not make any private visit to London at government expense in 2023 while all statements made regarding this matter are false, the statement concluded. The statement has been issued by the Office of the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe in response to a statement made by the Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Ratnayake in Parliament last week.",

        "date": "March 18, 2025 04:53 pm",
        "content": "NASAs two stuck astronauts headed back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday to close out a dramatic marathon mission that began with a bungled Boeing test flight more than nine months ago. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams bid farewell to the International Space Station  their home since last spring  departing aboard a SpaceX capsule alongside two other astronauts. The capsule undocked in the wee hours and aimed for a splashdown off the Florida coast by early evening, weather permitting. The two expected to be gone just a week or so after launching on Boeings new Starliner crew capsule on June 5. So many problems cropped up on the way to the space station that NASA eventually sent Starliner back empty and transferred the test pilots to SpaceX, pushing their homecoming into February. Then SpaceX capsule issues added another months delay. Sundays arrival of their relief crew meant Wilmore and Williams could finally leave. NASA cut them loose a little early, given the iffy weather forecast later this week. They checked out with NASAs Nick Hague and Russias Alexander Gorbunov, who arrived in their own SpaceX capsule last fall with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner duo. Well miss you, but have a great journey home, NASAs Anne McClain called out from the space station as the capsule pulled away 260 miles (418 kilometers) above the Pacific. Their plight captured the worlds attention, giving new meaning to the phrase stuck at work. While other astronauts had logged longer spaceflights over the decades, none had to deal with so much uncertainty or see the length of their mission expand by so much. Wilmore and Williams quickly transitioned from guests to full-fledged station crew members, conducting experiments, fixing equipment and even spacewalking together. With 62 hours over nine spacewalks, Williams set a record: the most time spent spacewalking over a career among female astronauts. Both had lived on the orbiting lab before and knew the ropes, and brushed up on their station training before rocketing away. Williams became the stations commander three months into their stay and held the post until earlier this month. Their mission took an unexpected twist in late January when President Donald Trump asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to accelerate the astronauts return and blamed the delay on the Biden administration. The replacement crews brand new SpaceX capsule still wasnt ready to fly, so SpaceX subbed it with a used one, hurrying things along by at least a few weeks. Even in the middle of the political storm, Wilmore and Williams continued to maintain an even keel at public appearances from orbit, casting no blame and insisting they supported NASAs decisions from the start. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing after the shuttle program ended, in order to have two competing U.S. companies for transporting astronauts to and from the space station until its abandoned in 2030 and steered to a fiery reentry. By then, it will have been up there more than three decades; the plan is to replace it with privately run stations so NASA can focus on moon and Mars expeditions. Both retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams stressed they didnt mind spending more time in space  a prolonged deployment reminiscent of their military days. But they acknowledged it was tough on their families. Wilmore, 62, missed most of his younger daughters senior year of high school; his older daughter is in college. Williams, 59, had to settle for internet calls from space to her mother. Theyll have to wait until theyre off the SpaceX recovery ship and flown to Houston before the long-awaited reunion with their loved ones. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in coordination with Sri Lanka Embassies in Myanmar and Thailand, and with the support of the Governments of Myanmar and Thailand have successfully facilitated the rescue of 14 Sri Lankans who had been trafficked and forcibly employed in cybercrime centers in Myawaddy, Myanmar. The 14 Sri Lankans are scheduled to be repatriated to Sri Lanka on Tuesday (18), the ministry said in a statement. It said this development follows sustained diplomatic efforts made by Sri Lanka including recent telephone conversations with the Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, U Than Swe, on 3 February 2025, and Thailands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maris Sangiampongsa, on 13 February 2025 by Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism Minister, Vijitha Herath. In both engagements, Minister Herath emphasized the need for urgent assistance for the rescue and repatriation of the trafficked Sri Lankan nationals, the statement said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism expressed its sincere appreciation to the Governments of Myanmar and Thailand for their invaluable assistance in the rescue and safe repatriation of the trafficked Sri Lankans. The ministry also extended appreciation to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for provision of international air passage and internal transportation and other International Non-Governmental Organizations in Myanmar for welfare assistance provided during this process. The Ministry said it remains committed to securing the rescue and repatriation of the remaining trafficked Sri Lankans, with continued support from the Myanmar and Thai authorities and in collaboration with Sri Lanka Embassies in Thailand and Myanmar. The Ministry strongly urged the public to remain vigilant against human trafficking schemes when seeking foreign employment. Sri Lankans are advised to strictly adhere to government-approved procedures and verify job opportunities with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) before securing foreign employment.",

        "date": "March 18, 2025 07:33 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas ODI captain Charith Asalanka and Test captain Dhananjaya de Silva have filed a petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to levy Withholding Tax on the players of the Sri Lanka national cricket team by considering them as employees of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). The petition was taken up today for the confirmation of facts before a bench comprising the Acting Chairman of the Appeals Court, Justice Mohamed Lafar Tahir and Justice K.P. Fernando. The court ordered that the petition be called on March 28 for the confirmation of the facts. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, its Deputy Commissioner, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its Executive Committee members, the Auditor General and several others have been named as respondents in the petition. The petitioners state that after Sri Lanka awarded Test cricket status in 1983, written contracts were signed by the national cricket team players with the Sri Lanka Cricket Board after winning the World Cup in 1996. The petitioners claim that the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, which met on January 17, decided to classify the players playing at the national level under contracts with Sri Lanka Cricket as employees working under contract basis of that institution. The petitioners, who point out that the said decision is completely against the law, stated that national level players are not members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) or the Employees Trust Fund (ETF) and that they have no such rights. The petitioners state that they have sought legal advice from legal experts in this regard and that they have received legal advice that they are independent service providers to Sri Lanka Cricket and not its employees. Under that situation, the Inland Revenue Department has decided to levy Withholding Tax on them considering them as employees of Sri Lanka Cricket, and as a result, the petitioners point out that this has caused severe prejudice towards national level cricketers. Accordingly, the petitioners have requested the Court of Appeal to issue writ orders to quash the decision of the Sri Lanka cricket board to classify national level players as SLC employees and the decision of the Inland Revenue Department to levy Withholding Tax on them. In addition, the petitioners have further requested that an interim injunction be issued to prevent the implementation of the decision of the Inland Revenue Department until this petition is heard and a final decision is announced.",

        "date": "March 19, 2025 07:26 am",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin has rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, following a call with US President Donald Trump. The Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trumps team recently worked out with Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia. He said a comprehensive truce could only work if foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine came to an end. Ukraines European allies have previously rejected such conditions. In the grinding three-year war, Russia has recently been taking back territory in its Kursk region that was occupied by a Ukrainian incursion six months ago. The results of Tuesdays Trump-Putin call amount to a retreat in the US position from where it stood a week ago, although the two leaders did agree that further peace talks would take place immediately in the Middle East. When a US delegation met Ukrainian counterparts in Jeddah last Tuesday, they convinced Kyiv to agree to their proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire, across land, air and sea. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who arrived in Helsinki, Finland, for an official visit on Tuesday shortly after Trump and Putins call ended, said Ukraine was open to the idea of a truce covering energy infrastructure, but wanted more details first. He later accused Putin of rejecting a ceasefire following a barrage of Russian drone attacks. Among the places targeted was a hospital in Sumy, and power supplies in Slovyansk, said Ukraines leader. Unfortunately, there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure, Zelensky said on X. Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire. Trump posted earlier on social media that his call with the Russian leader was very good and productive and that many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed. We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine, the US president said on Truth Social. About 80 of Ukraines energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombs, Zelensky said last September. Kyiv has in turn conducted drone and missile strikes deep into Russian territory, on oil and gas facilities. Following last weeks talks in Jeddah, Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said the ball was in Russias court, after the Ukrainians accepted Washingtons proposal for a full ceasefire. But the White Houses statement following the Trump-Putin call on Tuesday made no reference to that agreement with Kyiv. It instead said the two leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, followed by negotiations over a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. But the Kremlins own statement on the call noted what it said were a series of significant issues around enforcing any agreement with Kyiv. And it said the end of foreign support and intelligence for Ukraine was a key condition for Russia. Trump and Putin agreed to immediate technical-level talks towards a longer-term settlement, which the Kremlin said must be complex, stable and long-term in nature. But its unclear if this means further negotiations between the US and Russia, or bilateral talks between Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin also said Trump supported Putins idea of holding ice hockey matches between professional US and Russian players. Russia was frozen out of ice hockey events overseas after the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv will probably see the outcome of Tuesdays much-anticipated phone call as Putin playing for time, while he adds crippling conditions on any settlement. Putin has previously insisted Russia should keep control of Ukrainian territory it has seized and has called for Western sanctions to be eased as part of any eventual peace settlement. The Russian leader has already tasted Trumps readiness to cut off US support to Ukraine, and is trying to get him to repeat it - while tossing the ball back to Kyiv. Earlier this month the US temporarily suspended military and intelligence aid to Ukraine after Trump and Zelensky had an altercation in the Oval Office. Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance dressed down Zelensky in front of the worlds media, accusing him of being ungrateful for American support. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday in Berlin with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the limited ceasefire plan was an important first step, but he again called for a complete ceasefire. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Zelensky after the Trump-Putin call and reiterated the UKs unwavering support, a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has appeared before the Matara Magistrates Court this morning (19), sources told Ada Derana. The Matara Magistrates Court had previously ordered the arrest of eight former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD), including former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, and named them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. Following this, the CID was instructed to arrest and present the eight individuals, including former Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court. Meanwhile, police investigations were ongoing to locate Tennakoon, who had been evading arrest for several days. On March 17, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ petition filed by Tennakoon, in which he sought an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court in connection with the shooting incident. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID to take immediate steps to arrest and present Tennakoon before the court. The ruling was delivered by the Court of Appeal bench, comprising Acting President of the Court of Appeal Mohamed Lafar Tahir and Justice Sarath Dissanayake, who announced that the petition would be dismissed without a hearing. The petition had been taken up for consideration on March 12, during which Tennakoons legal representatives requested an interim injunction to stay the arrest warrant issued against him. Meanwhile, Tennakoons legal representative submitted a motion yesterday to the Court of Appeal regarding the petition, requesting permission to submit additional documents related to the case. This motion was filed ahead of the appeal decision on his writ petition. Additionally, an agreement was reached between the Attorney General (AG) and the legal counsel of the suspects implicated in the 2023 shooting incident near a hotel in Weligama. In this regard, the AG issued a special notice on March 16 regarding the order to arrest Tennakoon and six other suspects in connection with the incident. As per the agreement, the AG directed the CID not to arrest the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and five other accused individuals, excluding Tennakoon, who was wanted in connection with the incident and had been absconding.

        "content": "The Supreme Court today (19) dismissed a fundamental rights petition filed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, challenging the governments decision to reduce his security detail to 60 personnel without proper evaluation. The Court issued this order after considering the details of the petition filed on behalf of Mahinda Rajapaksa. The case was initially taken up for consideration on February 6, with the Supreme Court deciding to reconvene on March 19, 2025, to review the petition. The petition sought the redeployment of his security detail, which had been reduced. Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, representing Rajapaksa, presented facts and argued that the reduction in security had been made without a proper security assessment. The Presidents Counsel further stated that decisions about reducing or increasing security should be made based on a formal evaluation of security needs. The petition, filed by Rajapaksas attorneys on January 24, claimed that the reduction of his security personnel violated his fundamental rights. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and other members of the Cabinet of Ministers had been named as respondents in the petition. The petition alleged that the security detail had been reduced to 60 personnel, with no armed forces personnel assigned for his protection, leaving only police officers for his security. Rajapaksa, who played a key role in ending the countrys nearly three-decade-long civil war, expressed concerns about ongoing threats to his life, including potential terrorist threats. He requested the Court to determine that his fundamental human rights were violated by the arbitrary reduction of his security detail. Accordingly, despite these claims, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition without taking it up for hearing.",

You really have to ask the government about their plans. Because we dont know, there was an SOE committee in charge under the previous government, looking at specific institutions, but that committee is disbanded now.

        "date": "March 19, 2025 04:17 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trumps reciprocal tariffs have started a global trade war and it will reduce not only the growth of the United States (US) and the world but also push up inflation and delay Federal Reserve rate cuts in US according to a report by Fitch Ratings. The rating agency has cut the growth forecast of US to 1.7 per cent from 2.1 per cent in its December 2024, Global Economic Outlook (GEO) and the growth forecast for 2026 was cut to 1.5 per cent from 1.7 per cent. These rates are well below the trend if we compare it with almost 3 per cent annual growth in 2023 and 2024. Fitch says fiscal easing in China and Germany will cushion the impact of higher US import tariffs, but this year growth in the Eurozone will still be a lot weaker than its forecast of December GEO. Mexico and Canada will experience technical recessions given the scale of their US trade exposures. Fitch Ratings has cut Mexico and Canada annual 2025 forecasts by 1.1pp and 0.7pp respectively. It says the average world growth will slow to 2.3 per cent this year, well below the trend and down from 2.9 per cent in 2024. This is a downward revision of 0.3pp and reflects broad-based reductions in developed and emerging economies. World growth will remain weak at 2.2 per cent in 2026. Fitch Ratings says The size, speed, and breadth of US tariff hike announcements since January is staggering. The effective tariff rate (ETR) of US has risen to 8.5 per cent from 2.3 per cent in 2024 and is likely to rise further. Fitch estimates an effective US tariff rate of 15 per cent on Europe, Canada, Mexico, and others in 2025, and 35 per cent on China. This will push the US ETR to 18 per cent this year before moderating to 16 per cent next year as the ETR on Canada and Mexico falls to 10 per cent. This would be highest rate for 90 years. Fitch Ratings adds There is huge uncertainty about how far the US will go and our assumptions could be too harsh. But there are also risks of a larger tariff shock including from an escalating global trade war. Moreover, the US administration has set out an import substitution agenda - aimed at boosting US manufacturing and reducing the trade deficit - which it believes can be achieved with higher tariffs. Tariff hikes will also impact US negatively, it will result in higher US consumer prices, reduce real wages, and increase companies costs, and the surge in policy uncertainty will take a toll on business investment. Retaliatory tariffs will hit US exporters. Export-oriented global manufacturers in East Asia and Europe also will be affected. Fitch calculation suggests tariff increases will reduce GDP by about 1pp in the US, China, and Europe by 2026. Germanys recent pivot to fiscal stimulus will do a lot to cushion the blow and will allow its economy to recover modestly in 2026. More aggressive policy easing will also help to offset the impact in China. The tariff shock is estimated to add 1pp to US near-term inflation, the Fed will delay further easing until 4Q25. Fitch believes that now Fed will cut rate just once this year, but it may go for three more cuts in 2026 as the economy slows and tariff levels stabilise. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 19, 2025 04:59 pm",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that a vow by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin not to attack energy infrastructure was very much at odds with reality following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country. Zelenskyy said that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later in the day and expected to hear more about the American leaders phone call with Putin about a ceasefire and to discuss the next steps to be taken. Even last night, after Putins conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb. The strikes, which hit civilian areas and damaged a hospital, followed Putins refusal to back a full 30-day ceasefire during discussions with Trump. The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a movement to peace that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. Zelenskyy said that one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions. For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian, he said. We will not go for it. Shortly after the lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter. Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions. The Russian Defense Ministry reported Wednesday that its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions  the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula. Separately, authorities in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, reported that a drone attack there started a fire at an oil depot.

        "date": "March 19, 2025 07:25 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the trade union actions by healthcare professionals cannot be justified, considering that the largest salary increase in history granted by a government without any demands or pressure from professional associations has already been implemented. The President made these remarks during a meeting held today (19) at the Presidential Secretariat with the Public Services United Nurses Union (PSUNU), the PMD reported. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake highlighted that despite operating within a constrained economic framework, the government has prioritized increasing the basic salaries of public sector employees in this years budget. This initiative aims to enhance the efficiency of the public service, attract skilled professionals, and ensure the sustainability of the sector, he said. The President stated that salaries have been increased under six key categories in the budget. These include a minimum increase of Rs. 15,000 in the basic salary, an increment in overtime and holiday allowances, an 80 increase in salary increments, an upward revision of pension benefits in line with the revised total salary, and an increase in the taxable income threshold. Officials from the PSUNU expressed their appreciation for the salary increments, highlighting that they have been well received by a significant portion of the public sector workforce. They also brought to the Presidents attention the existing challenges within the nursing profession and requested prompt solutions to address these issues, the statement said.

        "date": "March 19, 2025 09:12 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya emphasized the urgent need to increase womens participation in the economic sector, both globally and in Sri Lanka. She made these remarks yesterday (18) at the launch of the Womens Entrepreneurial Financial Fund, organized by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, held at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Further addressing the event, the Prime Minister stated: There are stark gender disparities in labor force participation, with only 47 of women globally and 32 in Sri Lanka being economically active, compared to 72 and 71 of men, respectively. It is crucial to address systemic barriers such as limited access to finance, markets, skilled labor, and technology, which hinder the entrepreneurial endeavors of women. Women in Sri Lanka also face numerous challenges due to unsafe public transport and workplace environments, as well as socio-cultural norms that place significant domestic responsibilities on them, she said. According to the International Finance Corporations (IFC) MSME Finance Gap Report, there is an estimated global finance gap of USD 5.2 trillion for formal MSMEs and USD 2.9 trillion for informal MSMEs. Sri Lankas finance gap for MSMEs stands at approximately USD 17 billion, accounting for 21 of the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A significant contributing factor to this gap is the disproportionate impact on women-led MSMEs. Closing the financing gap for women entrepreneurs could unlock an additional USD 5-6 trillion in global economic value, the statement said. The Prime Minister also highlighted the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Goal (We Finance Goal), a global initiative aimed at enhancing access to finance for women entrepreneurs through leadership, action, and data-driven approaches. She further emphasized that Sri Lanka is among the first 24 countries to pilot this initiative, with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supporting its implementation and successfully formulating the National Definition for Women-led Businesses in August 2024. Commending the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for its comprehensive support, the Prime Minister stated that the initiative has facilitated improved data collection and reporting, leading to better policy-making. She reaffirmed the governments commitment to establishing a national coalition to support Women-led Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (WMSMEs), strengthening womens economic empowerment, it added. The event was attended by Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Mr. Mahinda Siriwardhana, Secretary to the Treasury; officials from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development; and representatives from banks and financial institutions.",

        "title": "Trump, Zelenskiy pledge in phone call to work for end to war in Ukraine",
        "date": "March 20, 2025 07:23 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed on Wednesday to work together to end Russias war with Ukraine, in what the White House described as a fantastic one-hour phone call. In their first conversation since an Oval Office shouting match on February 28, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for U.S. support and the two leaders agreed that technical teams would meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days. Zelenskiy asked Trump for more air defence support to protect his country against Russian attacks and the U.S. president said he would help locate the necessary military equipment in Europe, the White House said. Trump briefed Zelenskiy on his phone call on Tuesday with Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian president rejected a proposed full 30-day ceasefire sought by Trump that Ukraine said it would be prepared to accept, but agreed to pause attacks on energy infrastructure. That narrowly defined pause appeared in doubt on Wednesday, however, with Moscow saying Ukraine hit an oil depot in southern Russia while Kyiv said Russia had struck hospitals and homes, and knocked out power to some railways. Still, the two sides carried out a prisoner exchange, each releasing 175 troops in a deal facilitated by the United Arab Emirates. Moscow said it freed an additional 22 wounded Ukrainians as a goodwill gesture. Zelenskiy, describing his conversation with Trump as positive, very substantive and frank, said he had confirmed Kyivs readiness to halt strikes on Russian infrastructure and to accept an unconditional frontline ceasefire as the U.S. proposed earlier. One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it, he said on social media. Later, the Ukrainian president told reporters in a video call that Trump understands Kyiv will not recognize occupied land as Russian. Zelenskiy said the Russian strikes, which he said were carried out since Trumps call with Putin, showed that Russia was not ready for peace. He said the U.S. should be in charge of monitoring any ceasefire, adding a halt to infrastructure attacks could be quickly established. The Kremlin said it had called off planned attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure, including by shooting down seven of Russias own drones heading towards Ukraine. It accused Kyiv of failing to call off its own attacks in what it called an attempt to sabotage the agreement. Trump suggested to Zelenskiy the U.S. could help run, and possibly own, Ukraines nuclear power plants, according to a statement by the U.S. administration. Europes largest nuclear power plant, in Ukraines Zaporizhzhia region, has been shut down since Russian troops occupied it in 2022. Zelenskiy said Ukraine has begun talks with the U.S. about its possible involvement in restoring the Zaporizhzhia plant. Europeans Wary Trump has long promised to end Europes deadliest conflict since World War Two. But his outreach to Putin has unnerved European allies, who fear it heralds a fundamental shift after 80 years in which defending Europe from Russian expansionism was the core mission of U.S. foreign policy. Some European leaders said Putins rejection of Trumps proposed full truce was proof Moscow was not seeking peace. The offer to temporarily stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities counted for nothing and Trump would have to win greater concessions, Germanys defence minister said. Putin is playing a game here and Im sure that the American president wont be able to sit and watch for much longer, Boris Pistorius told German broadcaster ZDF. The EUs foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she would present a proposal to European leaders in Brussels on Thursday to provide Ukraine with 2 million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Scores of Attacks For most of the past three years, Russia has relentlessly attacked Ukraines power grid, arguing that civilian infrastructure is a legitimate target because it facilitates Kyivs fighting capabilities. Ukrainians say such attacks have subsided in recent months. Kyiv has steadily developed capabilities to mount long-range attacks into Russia, frequently using drones to target distant oil and gas sites, which it says provide fuel for Russias troops and income to fund the war. In the attacks overnight, Ukrainian regional authorities said Russian drones damaged two hospitals in the northeastern Sumy region, causing no injuries but forcing the evacuation of patients and staff. Near Kyiv, a 60-year-old man was injured and airstrikes hit homes and businesses in the Bucha district north of the capital. Attacks damaged power systems for railways in Dnipropetrovsk in the south on Wednesday, the state railway said. Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya. No one was injured. The depot is a rail terminal for Russian oil supplies to a pipeline linking Kazakhstan to the Black Sea. A representative of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium operator said oil flows were stable. Two industry sources said the attack could reduce Russian supplies to the pipeline. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A 2023 Sinhala-language black comedy film, Tentigo (Nelum Kuluna) directed by Ilango Ram and produced by Hiranya Perera under Silent Frames Productions, has made waves in the international film scene. Notably, Tentigo has become the first Sri Lankan film to be remade in several languages, including Spanish, Italian, English, Hindi, Telugu, and Malayalam, with future remakes planned for French and Belgium. In addition to its international reach, the film was remade in Tamil by Ilango Ram himself, titled Perusu (2025), and has also been adapted into Pedha in Telugu. The film has received critical acclaim at numerous international film festivals, winning the Special Jury Award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in 2023. It has also been showcased at the Glasgow Film Festival and Mostra in 2024. Moreover, Tentigo was selected to compete in the International Competition: Fiction category at the 2nd Eikhoigi Imphal International Film Festival in 2025. The film is based on a quirky concept and has now been remade into Tamil as Perusu, featuring stars Vaibhav and Niharika NM, among others. Director Ilango Ram spoke about his efforts in adapting the film to suit Tamil cinema sensibilities: I am always particular about the setting in my filmswhether its the people residing in the area or the way they conduct their weddings and festivals. Tentigo reflects the local people and their way of life. In India, every state has its own distinct culture. Keeping that in mind, we worked hard to add a comedic flavor that would resonate with Tamil audiences. Tentigo continues to enjoy its success, both in its original Sinhala version and its subsequent remakes, cementing its place in international cinema. --With Agencies Input--",

        "content": "Indias Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) has strongly denied recent speculation regarding alleged changes to its renewable energy agreement in Sri Lanka. In an official statement, the company categorically refuted claims that it had revised its pricing to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, calling such reports false and without foundation. The company reaffirmed its full commitment to the original terms of the agreement established with the Sri Lankan authorities, emphasizing that its investment plans and project parameters remain unchanged. However, the statement also confirmed that Adani Green Energy SL Ltd. has voluntarily withdrawn from the proposed wind project. While the company has wilfully and respectfully withdrawn from the proposed wind project, Adani Group reaffirms that it would always be available to undertake any development opportunity if the Sri Lankan government ever considers it to participate, the statement said.",

        "date": "March 20, 2025 03:05 pm",
        "content": "The former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Deshabandu Tennakoon has been ordered to be further remanded until April 03 by the Matara Magistrates Court. Tennakoon, who was subject to an arrest warrant in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama in 2023, surrendered to the court by submitting a motion yesterday (19), after evading arrest nearly 20 days. Following his surrender, the Matara Magistrate ordered that he be remanded until today (20). In compliance with this order, Tennakoon was transferred to Angunakolapelessa Prison under special security last evening (19), according to prison sources. The Matara Magistrates Court had previously issued an arrest order for eight police officers, including former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, naming them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was instructed to arrest and present the eight individuals, including Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court. However, CID teams were unable to locate the former police chief, who had been evading arrest for several days. On March 17, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ petition filed by Tennakoon, in which he sought an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court in connection with the shooting incident. The Court of Appeal subsequently directed the CID to take immediate steps to arrest Tennakoon and present him before the court. Additionally, it was reported that an agreement was reached between the Attorney General (AG) and the legal counsel of the suspects implicated in the 2023 shooting incident near the hotel in Weligama. In this regard, the AG issued a special notice on March 16 concerning the order to arrest Tennakoon and six other suspects in connection with the incident. As per the agreement, the AG instructed the CID not to arrest the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and five other accused individuals, excluding Tennakoon, who had been absconding and was wanted in connection with the incident.",

        "date": "March 20, 2025 03:32 pm",
        "content": "Social media giant X (formerly Twitter), owned by US billionaire Elon Musk, has filed a lawsuit in the Karnataka High Court against Government of India, challenging what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship. It raised concerns over the Centres interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online. The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A. X claimed this approach contradicts the Supreme Courts 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A. According to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (IB), Section 79(3)(b) mandates online platforms to remove illegal content when directed by either a court order or a government notification. If a platform fails to comply within 36 hours, it risks losing its safe harbor protection under Section 79(1) and could be held accountable under various laws, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, X has contested this interpretation, arguing that the provision does not grant the government independent authority to block content. Instead, it accused authorities of misusing the law to impose arbitrary censorship without following due process. Under Section 69A of the IT Act, the government has the power to block public access to digital content if it is deemed a threat to national security, sovereignty, or public order. However, this process is regulated by the 2009 Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, which require a structured review process before blocking decisions are made. X has argued that instead of following these procedures, the government is using Section 79(3)(b) as a shortcut, allowing content to be removed without the necessary scrutiny. The platform sees this as a direct violation of legal safeguards meant to prevent arbitrary censorship. Another major point in the social media platforms legal challenge is its opposition to the governments Sahyog portal. Created by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs, this platform was designed to streamline takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and facilitate direct communication between social media platforms and law enforcement agencies. However, X has refused to onboard an employee onto the Sahyog portal, claiming it acts as a censorship tool that pressures platforms to remove content without proper legal review. The lawsuit argues that this is yet another attempt by the government to control online discourse without judicial oversight. Source: PTI Agencies",

        "title": "At least 70 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza, health authorities say",
        "date": "March 20, 2025 04:54 pm",
        "content": "At least 70 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Thursday after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the enclave, a Gaza health official said. Medics said Israeli strikes targeted several houses in northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip. Asked for comment, the Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The military has resumed its air assaults on Gaza since Tuesday and launched ground operations on Wednesday, effectively abandoning a ceasefire with the Palestinian militant group Hamas that had held since January. It said on Thursday that its forces had been engaged for the past 24 hours in what it described as a targeted ground operation to expand a buffer zone separating the northern and southern halves of Gaza, known as the Netzarim corridor. Israel ordered residents to stay away from the Salahuddin road, the main north-south route, and said they should travel along the coast instead. Tuesdays first day of resumed airstrikes killed more than 400 Palestinians, one of the deadliest days of the war. At least 510 Palestinians have been killed in the past three days, more than half of them women and children, Khalil Al-Deqran, the spokesperson of the territorys health ministry told Reuters. In a blow to Hamas as it sought to rebuild its administration in Gaza, this weeks strikes have killed some of its top figures, including the de facto Hamas-appointed head of the Gaza government, the chief of security services, his aide, and the deputy head of the Hamas-run justice ministry. Hamas, severely weakened but still standing, has not hit back even though Israel has warned the latest onslaught was only the beginning. The militant group said the Israeli ground operation and the incursion into the Netzarim Corridor were a new and dangerous violation of the two-month-old ceasefire agreement. In a statement, it reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire deal and called on mediators to assume their responsibilities. A temporary first phase of the ceasefire ended at the start of this month. Hamas wants to move to an agreed second phase, under which Israel would be required to negotiate an end to the war and withdrawal of its troops, and Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. Israel has offered only a temporary extension of the truce, cut off all supplies to Gaza and says it is restarting its military campaign to force Hamas to free remaining hostages. The resumption of air strikes has sent Palestinian residents again fleeing for their lives from homes they had begun to reinhabit among the ruins of the devastated enclave. Some Palestinians who tried to use the Salahuddin road said they saw cars come under fire from Israeli troops advancing towards Netzarim. The fate of the passengers in the vehicles was unknown. Bulldozers protected by some tanks were heading to the west coming from the areas where they are stationed near the fence east of the Salahuddin road, one taxi driver told Reuters, asking not to be identified for fear of reprisals. He said it had become clear the Israelis were advancing on Netzarim when Egyptian and foreign inspectors stationed there under the ceasefire abruptly withdrew. Some residents turned to social media to report the disappearance of some relatives, while others reported cases to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Speaking to Reuters on Thursday, a Hamas official said mediators had stepped up their efforts with the two warring sides but added that no breakthrough has yet been made. Hamas has yet to make clear threats to retaliate in response to the Israeli escalation. Asked why the group had not yet responded, the Hamas official said it was giving a chance for things to be contained. Some residents said there were no signs yet of preparations by Hamas on the ground to resume fighting. But an official from one militant group allied to Hamas told Reuters on Thursday that fighters, including from Hamas, had been put on high alert awaiting further instructions. Fighters and leaders of the resistance were also advised to avoid the use of cellular phones as a means of precaution, said the official, who asked not to be identified. The war started after Hamas militants attacked Israeli communities in October, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies. More than 49,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing conflict, according to Gazas health authorities, with the enclave reduced to rubble. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 20, 2025 10:08 pm",
        "content": "Kirsty Coventry has been elected president of the International Olympic Committee and become the first woman and first African to get perhaps the biggest job in global sports. The Zimbabwe sports minister and two-time Olympic swimming gold medalist got a stunning first-round win in the seven-candidate contest after voting by 97 IOC member on Thursday. She gets an eight-year mandate into 2033 aged just 41  youthful by the historical standards of the IOC. It was the most open and hard-to-call IOC presidential election in decades with no clear front-runner before the vote. Many predicted an absolute majority could take several rounds of votes but she got the exact total of 49 needed. Coventrys win also was a victory for outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach, who has long been seen as promoting her as his successor. He did not use his right to vote. I will make all of you very, very proud and hopefully extremely confident in the decision you have taken, Coventry said in her acceptance speech. Now we have got some work together. Walking to the podium, she was congratulated and kissed on both cheeks by Juan Antonio Samaranch, her expected closest rival who got 28 votes. Third-placed Sebastian Coe got just eight. Also in the race were four presidents of sports governing bodies: Track and fields Sebastian Coe, skiings Johan Eliasch, cyclings David Lappartient, and gymnastics Morinari Watanabe. Also contending was Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan. Coventry will formally replace her mentor Bach on June 23  officially Olympic Day  as the 10th IOC president in its 131-year history. Bach reached the maximum 12 years in office. Key challenges for the 41-year-old Coventry will be steering the Olympic movement through political and sporting issues toward the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, including engaging in diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump. Coventrys IOC will also need to find a host for the 2036 Summer Games which could go to India or the Middle East. The strongest candidates in a five-month campaign with tightly controlled rules drafted by the Bach-led IOC seemed to be Coventry  who gave birth to her second child  IOC vice president Samaranch and Coe. Samaranch tried to follow his father, also Juan Antonio Samaranch, who was the IOCs seventh president from 1980 to 2001. Coe aimed to add to a remarkable career of Olympic triumphs: A two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, he led a bidding team for the 2012 London Olympics, then worked for the next seven years to head the organizing team of those widely praised Games. It has been a stellar week for Bach, who greeted Coventry and shared warm smiles after her acceptance speech. Bach was feted on Wednesday in an emotional start to the IOC annual meeting, getting lavish praise and the title of honorary president for life. His hands-on executive-style presidency will deliver over a financially secure IOC, on track to earn more than 8 billion in revenue through the 2028 LA Olympics, and with a slate of future hosts through 2034: in Italy, the United States, France, Australia and finally the U.S. again, when the Winter Games return to Salt Lake City. A signature Bach policy also has been gender parity, with equal quotas of men and women athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and giving a better balance of female members of the IOC and the executive board he chairs, which now has seven women among its 15 members, including Coventry. Her win on Thursday will only add to Bachs legacy for promoting women. Coventry won back-to-back titles in 200-meters backstroke at the 2004 Athens Olympics and Beijing four years later. She joined the IOC in 2013, almost one year after a disputed athlete election at the London Olympics. Her place among the four athletes elected was eventually awarded after Court of Arbitration for Sport rulings against two opponents. The next president can oversee the IOC making a statement choice for its host for the 2036 Summer Games. There is one and one only, Samaranch said on Wednesday when asked about challenges ahead. We must concentrate (on) successful and relevant Olympic Games. The rest comes with success in the Games. The voters in the exclusive invited club of IOC members include royal family members, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders, sports officials and Olympic athletes. Even an Oscar-winning actress, Michelle Yeoh. Members voted without hearing further presentations from the candidates in an election that swung on a discreet network of friendships and alliances largely forged out of sight.

Finland once again tops the World Happiness Reports rankings while the United States  at No. 24  earned its lowest ranking yet in the 2025 report. Sri Lanka, which ranked 128th in last years report, has dropped down to the 133rd place in the 13th edition of the annual report, released to mark the United Nations International Day of Happiness on March 20. According to the report, Sri Lanka has an Average Life Evaluation of 3.891 (out of 10) and is only ranked above countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Seirra Leone and Afghanistan. Finland, the worlds happiest country, has managed to keep its No. 1 ranking for eight years running. The US fell to its lowest-ever ranking in the 2025 edition of the World Happiness Report amid rising social isolation and political polarization.

        "date": "March 21, 2025 08:11 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka must embrace rapid economic growth and bold reforms to secure its future, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe asserted, warning that the country cannot afford to remain stagnant. Joining Ada Deranas current affairs programme hydepark, the former President emphasized that reforms are required for the countrys economy to move forward, while questioning whether the current government is willing to take the necessary steps. This economy is not a fully market economy. We have to do the reforms. To go ahead, we have to make major changes, he said, adding that I dont know if the current government is willing to make the changes from the statements they have made. But without major changes, without getting foreign money, being friendly with countries We have to work with India as the first step. We cant be by ourselves in this world. Speaking on Sri Lankas foreign relations, economic policies, and the challenges ahead, Wickremesinghe defended his leadership during the financial crisis and outlined the necessary steps to drive recovery and long-term stability. Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe defended his handling of Sri Lankas foreign relations and economic crisis during his tenure, stating that his government pursued a strategy of multi-alignment rather than balancing between global powers. We align with all our friends. We had a good relationship with China, and that relationship continued. We had big projects like Hambantota Port, Port City, but unless Sri Lanka grows, they cant get a return on these projects. However, he warned that Sri Lanka must grow significantly to ensure returns on these investments, stating, We must grow at least fivefold, they will be happiest if we grow tenfold because that means returns on their projects will come fast. China is willing to help us, but if we dont grow, theyll forget about us. China is also going to create an economy inside the Indian Ocean. We must also be a part of it. The former president also emphasized the evolving economic landscape of the Indian Ocean, stating that Sri Lanka must integrate itself into Chinas economic ambitions in the region while recognizing Indias emerging dominance. The big player here is going to be India. Then we have China, Japan, and Indonesia growing. Australia is also trying to position itself as a regional superpower for renewable energy. The framework has been laid during my tenure, the question is if they are going to continue or not. If you stand by your word and youre really upto performance, your economy is strong. If you dont do that, the rest is useless. Sri Lanka needs fast growth. This economy is not a fully market economy. We have to do the reforms. To go ahead, we have to make major changes. I dont know if the current government is willing to make the changes from the statements they have made. But without major changes, without getting foreign money, being friendly with countries We have to work with India as the first step. We cant be by ourselves in this world, he noted. On IMF Agreement and Economic Recovery Addressing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of maintaining policy consistency. We have stabilized the economy. The next phase is recovery. Investments lead not only to recovery but also to growth, and you the current government have to start now. He dismissed suggestions that Sri Lanka could have avoided an IMF bailout, stating, We could not recover without going through the IMF. If not, where will you find the money? All our creditor nations and bondholders wanted an IMF certificate. Sri Lanka has broken many agreements with the IMF in the past, but under my leadership, we did not. Furthermore, the former President added: You should continue the same policies, if you are amending the IMF agreement, it must be within the framework and the debt sustainability analysis and the EFF agreements and it must be agreed to by the IMF. Everyone has to take responsibility. IMF is also answerable to creditor nations and private bond holders. They are very very careful, you cant be changing things like earlier. You have to stick to it. If you want to change the economic transformation act, you have to say what it is. I mean theres a lot of loose talk here. So far, I dont see much of implementation taking place which I think is going to be the major problem. He also expressed views over the government borrowing Rs. 700 billion from the domestic market despite previous assurances against it, citing revenue shortfalls. One treasury official said yesterday that they lost about Rs. 60 billion due to tax amendments, but some claim it to be even more. When the IMF review team arrives in early April, they will have to address this. But its a bit worrying that we have these figures. On His Leadership and Political Role When asked if he could have handled the crisis differently, Wickremesinghe confidently replied, I handled the crisis. I dont think anyone would have handled it differently. Rejecting allegations that he manipulated political events to assume the presidency in 2022, he stated, Did I manipulate people to come and burn my house? No one else wanted the job. We all thought the Leader of the Opposition should become Prime Minister, but he didnt want it. The present President didnt want it. I have done my bestI dont know if anyone else could have done better than me. Regarding his involvement in the current administration, he clarified, No, they are not working with me. When asked about his views on the Batalanda commission report he said: I am always committed to democracy. As far as the report is concerned, I made a statement, I have nothing more to say about it. This is a 25 year old report. I am not interested now in talking about Batalanda, but the global affairs going on are more interesting. Let the parliament debate it. As for his future in politics, Wickremesinghe indicated that he is stepping away from national politics, saying, Im keeping out of national politics, and take a holiday for Sinhala New Year and added that he is more interest in global affairs right now. Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe concluded: We need not to be poor. We can have a trillion dollar economy. You must go for it. But to do that, you must understand the realities of economics and the current geopolitics. We have to live with it. We must know to get the best out of the world. Watch the full programme above",

        "title": "Trump signs order aimed at dismantling US Department of Education",
        "date": "March 21, 2025 10:42 am",
        "content": "Flanked by students and educators, U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order intended to essentially dismantle the federal Department of Education, making good on a longstanding campaign promise to conservatives. The order is designed to leave school policy almost entirely in the hands of states and local boards, a prospect that alarms liberal education advocates. Thursdays order was a first step to eliminate the department, Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room of the White House. Shuttering the agency completely requires an act of Congress, and Trump lacks the votes for that. Were going to be returning education, very simply, back to the states where it belongs, said Trump in front of a colorful backdrop of state flags. Young students invited to the event sat at classroom desks encircling the president and signed their own mock executive orders alongside him. The signing followed the departments announcement last week that it would lay off nearly half of its staff, in step with Trumps sweeping efforts to reduce the size of a federal government he considers to be bloated and inefficient. Education has long been a political lightning rod in the United States. Conservatives favor local control over education policy and school-choice options that help private and religious schools, and left-leaning voters largely support robust funding for public schools and diversity programs. But Trump has elevated the fight to a different level, making it part of a generalized push against what conservatives view as liberal indoctrination in Americas schools from the university level down to K-12 instruction. He has sought to re-engineer higher education in the United States by reducing funding and pushing to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies at colleges and universities, just as he has in the federal government. Columbia University, for example, faced a Thursday deadline to respond to demands to tighten restrictions on campus protests as preconditions for opening talks on restoring 400 million in suspended federal funding. The White House also argues the Education Department is a waste of money, citing mediocre test scores, disappointing literacy rates and lax math skills among students as proof that the return on the agencys trillions of dollars in investment was poor. Local battles over K-12 curricula accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic, which saw parents angrily confront officials at school board meetings nationwide. It was a discontent that Trump, other Republican candidates and conservative advocacy groups such as Moms for Liberty tapped into. Trump was joined at the ceremony by Republican governors such as Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida. Democrats acknowledged on Thursday that Trump could effectively gut the department without congressional action. Donald Trump knows perfectly well he cant abolish the Department of Education without Congress - but he understands that if you fire all the staff and smash it to pieces, you might get a similar, devastating result, U.S. Senator Patty Murray said in a statement. SEEKING CLOSURE Trump suggested on Thursday that he will still seek to close down the department entirely, and that he wants Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who attended the White House event, to put herself out of a job. The department oversees some 100,000 public and 34,000 private schools in the United States, although more than 85 of public school funding comes from state and local governments. It provides federal grants for needy schools and programs, including money to pay teachers of children with special needs, fund arts programs and replace outdated infrastructure. It also oversees the 1.6 trillion in student loans held by tens of millions of Americans who cannot afford to pay for college outright. For now, Trumps executive order aims to whittle the department down to basic functions such as administering student loans, Pell Grants that help low-income students attend college and resources for children with special needs. Were going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible, Trump said. Its doing us no good. Though Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Democratic support would be required to achieve the needed 60 votes in the Senate for such a bill to pass. At the event, Trump said the matter may ultimately land before Congress in a vote to do away with the department entirely. Trump has acknowledged that he would need buy-in from Democratic lawmakers and teachers unions to fulfill his campaign pledge of fully closing the department. He likely will never get it. See you in court, the head of the American Federation of Teachers union, Randi Weingarten, said in a statement. A majority of the American public do not support closing the department. A ReutersIpsos poll found last month that respondents opposed shuttering the Department of Education by roughly two to one - 65 to 30. The ReutersIpsos poll, which was conducted online and nationwide, surveyed 4,145 U.S. adults and its results had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points. Federal aid tends to flow more to Republican-leaning states than Democratic ones. It accounted for 15 of all K-12 revenue in states that voted for Trump in the 2024 election, compared with 11 of revenue in states that voted for his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, according to a Reuters analysis of Census Bureau data. Two programs administered by the Department of Education -- aid for low-income schools and students with special needs -- are the largest of those federal aid programs. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 21, 2025 11:30 am",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court has directed the Illegal Assets Investigation Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to further investigate Piumi Hansamali under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and report progress to the court. The motion filed by Hansamalis legal representatives alleging that her business operations have been negatively impacted due to the actions of the CID officers was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake today (20). When the motion was taken up, OIC of the Illegal Assets Investigation Division of the CID Sampath Rajakaruna appeared before the court in response to a prior court notice. Hansamalis legal representative, Attorney-at-Law Sumudu Hewage, stated during the trial that his client operates a cosmetics business and has sold products to over 34,506 customers via courier services. Attorney-at-Law Hewage refuted media reports claiming that his client Hansamali was selling products bought at lower prices at an excessively high price of Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 40,000, asserting that these allegations were false and impacting her business. The attorney further argued that police investigations had led to customers being questioned and discouraged from purchasing, which was negatively impacting the business. Accordingly, he requested the court to issue necessary orders to ensure that the investigation is conducted without causing harm to his clients business. However, OIC Rajakaruna denied the claims, pointing out that Hansamali herself had acknowledged selling cosmetics to over 30,000 customers. He further revealed that during the Police Narcotics Bureaus (PNB) arrest of a notorious cocaine trafficker on November 22, 2023, links between Hansamali and the suspect were discovered. Additionally, he stated that a BMW car belonging to Hansamali was found at the drug traffickers residence, raising suspicions that illegal substances might have been sold through courier services under the guise of cosmetic sales. Accordingly, he emphasized the need to record statements from those relevant parties and conduct a thorough investigation. Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake acknowledged that police have the authority to record statements but instructed that the investigation be conducted strictly under the Money Laundering Act, ensuring that Hansamalis business is not unduly harmed. Accordingly, the police were ordered to submit progress reports on the investigation to the court in due course.",

The Matara Magistrates Court had issued an arrest order on February 27 for these officers, including the then Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon, in connection with the incident. However, as Tennakoon had evaded arrest, the Attorney General instructed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) not to arrest these officers, including the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the CCD, until the completion of preliminary investigations. This decision was made based on an agreement reached at the Court of Appeal. Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was suspended from his post as IGP, surrendered to the Matara Magistrates Court on the morning of March 19, after evading arrest for 20 days.

        "date": "March 21, 2025 12:56 pm",
        "content": "Britains Heathrow Airport was closed for the day Friday after a fire knocked out its power, disrupting flights for hundreds of thousands of passengers at Europes busiest travel hub. At least 1,350 flights to and from Heathrow were affected already, including several from U.S. cities that were canceled, flight tracking service FlightRadar 24 said. Several jets were diverted to Gatwick Airport outside London, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Irelands Shannon Airport, tracking services showed. To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, we have no choice but to close Heathrow for the full day, the airport said. We expect significant disruption over the coming days, and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens. Heathrow is one of the worlds busiest airports for international travel. It had its busiest January on record earlier this year, with more than 6.3 million passengers, up more than 5 for the same period last year. January also was the 11th month in a row it averaged over 200,000 passengers a day, with the airport citing transatlantic travel as a key contributor. The disruption was reminiscent of 2023 delays that hit U.K. airports when Britains air traffic control system was hit by a breakdown that slowed takeoffs and landings across the country on one of the busiest travel days of the year. Heathrow said in its statement it will provide an update on its operations when it has more information on when power will be restored. Seven United Airlines flights returned to their origin or diverted to other airports and its flights Friday to Heathrow were canceled, the airline said. The FlightAware website showed more cancelations including two from John F. Kennedy International in New York, a Delta Airlines flight and an American Airlines flight. National Rail canceled all trains to and from the airport. The London Fire Brigade had 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters worked to control the blaze hours after flames soared into the sky when a transformer at an electrical substation caught fire in west London late Thursday night. The fire continued to smolder after daybreak. Thousands of homes also lost power and about 150 people were evacuated. Footage posted to social media showed huge flames and large plumes of smoke coming from the facility. The fire has caused a power outage affecting a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimize disruption, Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a post on X the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes. Emergency services were called to the scene at 11.23 p.m. Thursday. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Goulbourne urged people to take safety precautions and avoid the area as crews worked to extinguish the blaze. Heathrow normally opens for flights at 6 a.m. due to nighttime flying restrictions. It said the closure would last until 11:59 p.m. Friday. The U.K. government earlier this year approved building a third runway at the airport to boost the economy and connectivity to the world. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "March 21, 2025 01:50 pm",
        "content": "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit All I Want for Christmas Is You from other songwriters. Judge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Careys request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial. In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana  who goes by the stage name Vince Vance  and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the 20 million lawsuit alleging that Careys 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title. Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said hes disappointed in an email to The Associated Press. Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges. Stone and Powers suit said their All I Want For Christmas Is You contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus. They said there was an overwhelming likelihood Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song  which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboards Hot Country chart  and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. After hearing from two experts for each side, Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Careys song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar. Ramírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs attorneys made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support. She said they must pay at least part of the defendants attorney fees. Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Careys Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboards Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row  measuring the most popular songs each week  not just the holiday-themed  by airplay, sales and streaming. Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement  though not one thats gone to court  over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.

        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court has ordered ten suspects arrested in connection with the shooting and killing of the notorious criminal figure and drug trafficker Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne alias Ganemulla Sanjeewa to be remanded further until April 04. The suspects were virtually produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali via Skype technology today (21). Presenting facts before the court during the trial, the officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) said that information have been uncovered that the police constable attached to Negombo Police Station, who has been named as the third suspect of the case, had connections with the fugitive accomplice of the case, Ishara Sewwandi. The CCD officers stated that Sewwandi had sent pictures of two firearms to the constable from her mobile phone and that the suspect had later deleted them from his phone. However, the pictures have been recovered during the investigation, according to the CCD. Meanwhile, the police informed the court that one of the firearms in question was the revolver used in Ganemulla Sanjeewas murder and that further investigations are underway regarding the remaining firearm. Furthermore, the police informed the court that statements have been recorded from around 55 individuals in relation to the incident and that around 25 more evidence have been gathered from public institutions in this regard. The court was also told that direct evidence have been uncovered against the officer attached to Athurugiriya Police Station who was arrested in connection with the crime. Accordingly, the police requested the court to remand the suspects further as investigations into the incident continue. After considering the facts presented, the Chief Magistrate ordered the suspects to be remanded further until April 04.",

        "date": "March 21, 2025 03:37 pm",
        "content": "A South Korean court has ruled against chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans which had sought to cut ties with its record label Ador. The court said the band, which had renamed themselves NJZ and began organising their own appearances, must not conduct any independent activities, from making music to signing advertising deals. Earlier last year, NewJeans said that they were leaving their agency Ador, after accusing them of mistreatment. Ador subsequently sued to have NewJeans contracts upheld and, after accusing the group of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, filed an injunction against them in January. On Friday, a Seoul court granted Ador the injunction. The ruling casts some uncertainty around the release of the groups new song, slated for Sunday. It also means they will now face difficulty re-debuting under their new name, NJZ, without facing severe financial penalties for breach of contract. NewJeans and Ador have been embroiled in a dramatic dispute since August 2024, when Hybe, the parent company of Ador, allegedly forced out NewJeans mentor, Min Hee-Jin. The band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored  and, when Hybe refused, went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim it had deliberately undermined their careers. One of the groups members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label. In a press conference in November, NewJeans announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists. They subsequently filed court papers seeking a legal separation from the agency. Since then, the five band members  Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein  have continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name jeanzforfree. They have also said they would fight to keep their name, and their career, and would remain NewJeans at heart even if they lost the fight against Ador. NewJeans were considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, thanks to a playful blend of 1990s RB and sugar-coated pop melodies. In 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The suspects were each ordered released on two surety bails of Rs. 200,000 while they were also ordered to appear before the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) tomorrow to record statements. The six CCD officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had surrendered to the Matara Magistrates Court today (21) through a motion. The Matara Magistrates Court on February 27 had issued an arrest order for these officers in question as well as the former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon. However, as Tennakoon had evaded arrest, the Attorney General instructed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) not to arrest these officers, including the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the CCD, until the completion of preliminary investigations. This decision was made based on an agreement reached at the Court of Appeal between the AGs Department and the legal counsels of the accused. Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was suspended from his post as IGP, surrendered to the Matara Magistrates Court on the morning of March 19, after evading arrest for nearly 20 days. The shooting incident on December 31, 2023 resulted in the death of a police sergeant attached to the CCD, and the Matara Magistrates Court is proceeding with the case based on this incident.",

When I become President, I will receive a pension provided to an MP. That means that in addition to the presidential salary, I will also receive the MPs pension. I gave a letter today saying that I do not want the MPs pension. We have to start fixing this country. I actually did not know that I would receive it that way, but I found out later that I would receive it that way. That is why I gave a letter to Parliament saying that I do not want the pension. Also, when an MP becomes a minister, he will receive the MPs salary and the ministerial salary. We have decided that ministers and deputy ministers will only receive the MPs salary. However, ministers will receive a fuel allowance in addition to the MPs salary. We will remove the fuel allowance from the MPs salary. We will also remove the MPs pension.
