        "content": "Following days of heavy rainfall, several roads in Bulathsinhala and Walallawita Divisional Secretariat divisions in Kalutara district are inundated, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) says. The DMC said it has taken measures to provide special transportation facilities to the students who are sitting for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination and exam invigilators who were affected without means to reach the exam centres on time. According to Ada Derana correspondent, the exam centre set up at the Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya in Bulathsinhala educational zone is completely swamped by flood water after the downpours reported in the area. Swinging into action, Sri Lanka Navy deployed relief teams to assist the communities in the inclement weather-affected localities. Boat services too were provided to transport the OL candidates to exam centres. The members of the public are urged to contact the DMCs hotline 117 in the event of any emergency.",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers, on Monday (June 05), gave its approval for a resolution pertaining to the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and the Simplified Value-Added Tax (SVAT). The resolution was put forward by President Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies. Accordingly, the government will remove most of the releases from the VAT, further retaining releases that ease the pressure on low-income families in order to secure the fundamental sectors of the economy as well as the releases for sectors such as education, health and agriculture. The resolution also seeks to revise the provisions applicable to the VAT Act so that the SVAT methodology can be cancelled with effect from January 01, 2024, by introducing a more formal methodology for repaying the VAT. Further, the Cabinet also approved a proposal to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft Bill for the purpose. The Government Information Department says two major reformations with regard to the VAT should be introduced pursuant to the comprehensive funding facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Thereby, removing most of the releases, the reformation of the VAT scheme and cancellation of the SVAT methodology should be applied. Approximately 1.2 of the gross domestic product (GDP) from the tax income can be increased by reactivating the logic of the existing release of VAT, the Government Information Department explained.",

The Jaffna District parliamentarian, who represents the All Ceylon Tamil Congress or Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress (AITC), is accused of his complicity in obstructing the duties of police officers and verbally abusing them during a recent event in Vadamarachchi. Soon after the incident, MP Ponnambalam was asked to record a statement with the Maruthankerny Police on Monday (June 05). However, he has failed to appear before the police, citing a parliamentary meeting in Colombo. Thereby, Sri Lanka Police had presented facts related to the matter to court on Monday. Taking to Twitter this afternoon, MP Ponnambalam said the Kollupitiya Police served him a written notice, asking him again to appear before the Maruthankerny Police, which he refused to accept as he can neither read nor speak in Sinhala. The subsequently read it to me in Sinhala saying that all they needed to do was to inform me. The parliamentarian says the Kollupitiya Police officers then proceeded to ask him to produce himself at the Maruthankerny Police at 10.00 a.m. on June 08. On Sunday (June 04), Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles had called for a detailed report on the recent heated situation involving the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress leader and a group of police officers in Jaffna. Accordingly, the minister stated that the Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) of Police of Jaffna had been informed to provide a special report on the incident as soon as possible. A recent video circulated on several social media platforms showed a heated exchange of words between the MP and several officers, believed to be attached to the Jaffna Police, while Ponnambalam was engaging with area residents. The tense situation had ensued when the police officers asked MP Ponnambalam to call off his public meeting at the Thalaiyadi playground, in consideration of the students sitting for the Ordinary Level examination at the nearby Thalaiyadi Roman Catholic Mixed School. Meanwhile, the female organizer of the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) was remanded until Wednesday (June 07) after being produced before the Kilinochchi Magistrates Court earlier today. She was arrested on Monday, along with a man, on charges of obstructing the duties of police officers.",

        "title": "Ukraine dam supplying water to nuclear plant and Crimea is breached, unleashing floods",
        "date": "June 6, 2023 03:16 pm",
        "content": "A torrent of water burst through a gaping hole in a dam on the Dnipro River that separates Russian and Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war zone and forcing villagers to flee. Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam from the inside in a deliberate war crime. Russian-installed officials gave conflicting accounts, some blaming Ukrainian shelling, others saying the dam had burst on its own. The Nova Kakhovka dam supplies water to Ukraines Crimean peninsula and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, both under Russian control. The vast reservoir behind it is one of the main geographic features of southern Ukraine, 240 km (150 miles) long and up to 23 km (14 miles) wide. A swathe of countryside lies in the flood plain below. The destruction of the dam creates a new humanitarian disaster in the centre of the war zone and transforms the front lines just as Ukraine is unleashing a long-awaited counteroffensive to drive Russian troops from its territory. Russia has controlled the dam since early in the war, although Ukrainian forces recaptured the northern side of the river last year. Both sides had long accused the other of planning to destroy it. Russian terrorists. The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Russians had carried out an internal detonation of the structures of the dam. About 80 settlements are in the zone of flooding, he said on Telegram. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraines Kherson region accused Kyiv of striking the dam with missiles to distract attention from what he said were the failures of Ukraines counteroffensive in the east. However, other Russian-installed officials said the dam had burst on its own due to earlier damage. Neither side offered immediate evidence proving who was to blame. The vast reservoir above the dam supplies fresh water to huge swathes of agricultural land, including the Crimea peninsula, which Russia claims to have annexed in 2014. It also provides cooling water for Europes largest nuclear power plant, located in Russian-held territory on the southern bank. The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Twitter it was closely monitoring the situation, but that there was no immediate nuclear safety risk at the plant. Russias state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom also said the dam breach did not pose a threat for now to the plant and said the situation was being monitored. SURGING WATERS The water level at the town immediately adjacent to the breached dam could rise by up to 12 metres, its Russia-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, said on the Telegram messaging app. Video showed water surging through the remains of the dam - which is 30 metres (yards) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long. Some 22,000 people living across 14 settlements in Ukraines southern Kherson region are at risk of flooding, Russias RIA news agency quoted the Moscow-installed head of the region as saying. Kherson is one of five regions, including Crimea, that Moscow claims to have annexed. The Russian-backed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said there was a risk that water levels in the North Crimea Canal, which carries fresh water to the peninsula from the Dnipro river, could fall. Crimea had sufficient water reserves for the moment, and the level of risk would become clear in coming days. A Russian-installed official in the town of Nova Kakhovka said residents of around 300 houses had been evacuated, state-owned news agency TASS reported. He said it would likely be impossible to repair the dam. The dam breach came as Ukraine prepares its long-awaited counteroffensive to drive Russian forces from territory they have seized during more than 15 months of fighting. Russia said it had thwarted another Ukrainian offensive in eastern Donetsk and inflicted heavy losses. Kyiv has maintained strict silence on the counteroffensive but has dismissed Russias claims to have thwarted Ukrainian assaults. Russia also launched a fresh wave of overnight air strikes on Kyiv. Ukraine said its air defence systems had downed more than 20 cruise missiles on their approach to the capital. The Shebekino district of Russias Belgorod region near the Ukrainian border came under renewed shelling on Tuesday, local authorities said, urging residents to take cover. Anti-government Russian fighters based in Ukraine claim to have infiltrated the area, seizing villages near the border. Ukraines military intelligence agency said on Telegram that Russian forces had blown up the dam in a panic, in what it said was an obvious act of terrorism and a war crime, which will be evidence in an international tribunal. Zelenskiy will hold an emergency meeting about the dams collapse, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraines National Security and Defence Council, said on Twitter. UKRAINIAN ATTACKS Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year in what the Kremlin expected to be a swift operation, but its forces suffered a series of defeats and regrouped in the countrys east. Tens of thousands of Russian troops dug in over the winter, besieging the eastern city of Bakhmut for months and bracing for an expected Ukrainian counterattack. Ukrainian officials have made clear they will not comment on the start of their campaign, although in his nightly address on Monday Zelenskiy was enigmatic, hailing the news we have been waiting for and forward moves in Bakhmut in Donetsk. Russia says it thwarted a major Ukrainian attack in the Donetsk region over the weekend and on Tuesday the defence ministry said a fresh Ukrainian assault had also been repelled. Writing on Telegram, Russias Wagner militia leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said Moscows claims of huge Ukrainian losses were simply wild and absurd science fiction. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 6, 2023 05:14 pm",
        "content": "Hollywoods actors union voted to authorize a strike if contract talks break down, turning up the heat on major film and television studios already grappling with a monthlong work stoppage by writers. After voting closed on Monday, SAG-AFTRA said 97.91 of ballots cast supported a strike authorization. Nearly 65,000 members, or about 48 of those eligible, voted on the measure. Bravo SAG-AFTRA. We are in it to win it, Fran Drescher, the unions president, said in a statement. Talks between the 160,000-member union, Hollywoods largest, and the major studios are scheduled to start on Wednesday. No new negotiations are scheduled with the striking Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents 11,500 film and TV writers. Their walkout has disrupted production of late-night shows and shut down high-profile projects including a new season of Netflixs Stranger Things and a Game of Thrones spinoff for Warner Bros Discoverys HBO. Over the weekend, the studios likely averted a second work stoppage by reaching a tentative deal with the Directors Guild of America (DGA). That pact will take effect if DGA members vote to ratify it in the coming weeks. With the actors, we are approaching these negotiations with the goal of achieving a new agreement that is beneficial to SAG-AFTRA members and the industry overall, said the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents Walt Disney Co, Netflix Inc and other studios. A strike by actors would lead to a broader shutdown across Hollywood and increase pressure on studios that need programming to feed their streaming services and the fall TV broadcast schedule. In the negotiations, actors are seeking higher pay and safeguards against unauthorized use of their images through artificial intelligence. Their current deal expires June 30. SAG-AFTRA leaders said the industry had changed dramatically with the rise of streaming television and the emergence of new technology such as generative AI. The coming talks may be one of the most consequential negotiations in the unions history, said chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. Inflation, dwindling residuals due to streaming, and generative AI all threaten actors ability to earn a livelihood if our contracts are not adapted to reflect the new realities, he said.

The lineup is completed by Thailands Thipoatcha Putthawong, who aims to emulate teammate Naruemol Chaiwais Player of the Month prize in April. Her bowling prowess helped her side claim gold in the Southeast Asian Games in Phnom Penh. In the mens section, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam has been nominated alongside Bangladesh batter Najmul Hossain Shanto and Irelands middle-order batter Harry Tector. The Pakistan skipper and holder of the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy is nominated for his performances at the latter end of his sides series 4-1 victory over New Zealand. Babar joined Imam-ul-Haq for a century second-wicket stand on May 3, finishing with 54 off 62 balls, as his side went on to post 2876. The skipper stepped up a gear in the next match two days later, claiming Player of the Match honours in his sides 102-run win to go 4-1 up. He compiled 107 (117), his 18th ODI century, helping the hosts to 3346. If successful, Babar will become the first player to win the ICC Mens Player of the Month award on three separate occasions (April 2021 and March 2022). Bangladesh batter Shanto is shortlisted for the first time following a prolific spell of run-scoring as his side triumphed over Ireland. He claimed the Player of the Series award for 196 runs across the tourists hard-fought 2-0 sweep. The final candidate in line is Irelands Harry Tector, who continued his fine international form against Bangladesh, albeit in a losing cause. Tector becomes Irelands first nominee for the ICC Mens Player of the Month award since Paul Stirling was shortlisted back in January 2021 and his maiden nomination comes on the back of a sustained period of good form in international colours.

        "date": "June 6, 2023 06:12 pm",
        "content": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through the European Union (EU)-funded BESPA-FOOD (Best Standardized Practices for the Agri-Food Sector) project will support the government to establish a well-coordinated food safety system in the country. Through the 6.5 million Euro project, FAO will work closely with the Ministry of Health to implement institutional revisions in the countrys food safety policy and regulatory framework towards adopting preventive, risk-based measures across the supply chain. The current food safety regulatory policies in Sri Lanka focuses largely on end-product checks and regulations. Governed by a regulatory framework established in 1980, the challenges facing Sri Lankas food safety sector include weak regulatory and institutional frameworks that have led to vulnerabilities in supply chains, and infrastructure as well as an approach that does not consider every aspect of the food supply chain from farm-to-table. To respond to these gaps, FAO will also work with the Ministries related to agriculture, livestock development, and fisheries sectors, as well as other agri and food sector stakeholders including private enterprises, SMEs, and consumers to achieve a complete transformation of food safety standards in the country via institutional as well as attitudinal shifts. Food safety requires a collaborative effort. That is why in Sri Lanka we work together with United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), FAO and local partners to promote a transition to a sustainable and fair food system that can provide sufficient and safe food for all, said Chargé daffaires, Delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka, Mr. Lars Bredal. Ensuring safe food for all Sri Lankans is not only a public health priority but also an economic necessity. We must continue to strengthen our capacity for food safety, invest in research and innovation, and prioritize consumer awareness and education. At FAO, we remain committed to working closely with our partners to achieve a food-secure and safe Sri Lanka, said FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Mr. Vimlendra Sharan. BESPA-FOOD, which is jointly implemented by FAO and UNIDO, and funded by the EU, recognizes that current levels of poor food safety standards not only impacts public health but also hampers Sri Lankas potential in international trade, particularly when trading with regions where markets are highly regulated. Strengthening the food safety sector will not only alleviate the high cost of healthcare services but also create a resilient and competitive food industry in both domestic and international markets, and combat the issue of food loss and waste, thereby contributing to overall food security in the country. A recent study by UNIDO revealed that an improvement in food safety practices in Sri Lanka through a 30 million USD investment and an annual net budgetary commitment of 9 million could prevent at least 113 deaths annually and significantly boost annual export values, projected to increase by 24 over a decade. On this World Food Safety Day, the EU, UNIDO and FAO reaffirms commitment to enhancing food safety in Sri Lanka through the BESPA-FOOD project. This collaborative effort aims to create a safer, more resilient, and economically vibrant food sector, ensuring the well-being and sustainable development of the country and its people.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka-born Ayesha Smart living in the United Kingdom has become the youngest ever non-white and minority ethnic judge in the Crown Court  which predominantly deals with serious cases of criminal offences in England and Wales. Smarts family moved to the UK when she was 14 years old. After successfully pursuing an undergraduate degree in medical sciences at the University of Leeds, Smart initially worked as a pathologist at Harrogate District Hospital before transitioning to law. She completed a conversion course in Leeds and managed to secure a pupilage place to get through her training. The 34-year-old was called to the bar in 2014 and has since been working in crown courts around Yorkshire. She is now part of Exchange Chambers where she specializes in crime, clinical negligence and regulatory law. Following a lengthy process of exams, interviews and approval from King Charles III, Smart was appointed a crown court judge, which means she can now sit as Recorder in crown courts across North East England. Speaking to British local news website Legal Cheek on her appointment, Ayesha said she is really proud of the achievement. As someone that has faced various prejudices in my life and career, its really positive to showcase that people of colour and women can be just as successful as their white or male counterparts and that youth doesnt necessarily mean ineptitude. Smart says the appointment also helps in dispelling the myth that judges have to be more senior, come from a privileged background or gone to Oxbridge (a portmanteau of Oxford and Cambridge). -with input from agencies",

This would be the third encounter for the group that includes representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and current Group of 20 (G20) major economies leader India after one in Bengaluru in February followed by an April meeting in Washington, during the IMF-World Bank spring meetings. The initiative was formally launched late last year amid continued delays in securing debt treatment for countries in default such as Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka, that are in talks with a wide variety of stakeholders like the Paris Club, India and China - the worlds largest bilateral creditor. As part of the technical talks, the latest meeting will focus on cut-off dates, one of the sources said, as consensus is needed on the starting date from which new loans are excluded from a restructuring. The sources, who did not specify who would participate in the Friday meeting, declined to be named because the talks are private. The IMF and World Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Bilateral creditors representatives participated in previous meetings, as well as government officials from countries that have requested debt treatments under the G20 Common Framework. Some private sector creditors have also been part of the talks in both Bengaluru and Washington. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, who is accused of obstructing the duties of police officers, was arrested this morning (June 07). The parliamentarian was taken into custody by a team of officers attached to Maruthankerny Police at his residence in Colombo. The Jaffna District MP, who represents the Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress (AITC) or the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress in the parliament, is complicit in obstructing the duties of police officers and verbally abusing them during a recent event in Vadamarachchi. A recent video which went viral on several social media platforms showed a heated exchange of words between the MP and several officers, believed to be attached to the Jaffna Police, while Ponnambalam was engaging with area residents. The tense situation had ensued when the police officers asked MP Ponnambalam to call off his public meeting at the Thalaiyadi playground, in consideration of the students sitting for the Ordinary Level examination at the nearby Thalaiyadi Roman Catholic Mixed School. In a Twitter thread posted this morning, Ponnambalam said the police arrived at his residence at around 6.30 a.m. to take him to Maruthankerny Police to record a statement. He said it is evident that the police are desperate to prevent him from raising the breach of privileges matter in parliament today. I managed to contact the speaker and inform him of the chronology of events. The speaker then informed me that I can attend parliament sessions and make the statement as requested on the 12th June or after. Soon after the relevant incident in Vadamarachchi, Ponnambalam was asked to record a statement with the Maruthankerny Police on Monday (June 05), however, he failed to make an appearance citing a parliamentary meeting in Colombo. Later, the police presented facts related to the matter to the court. On Tuesday (June 06), the officers of Kollupitiya Police served him a written notice asking him to appear before the Maruthankerny Police at 10.00 a.m. on June 08. However, as the MP refused to accept the notice, saying he can neither read nor speak in Sinhala. Ponnambalam, in his Twitter thread this morning, said the police later served him a translation of the respective written notice last night. He also said he has given a written notice to the Speaker of Parliament, pertaining to a breach of his MP privileges. He also told the Speaker that he would record a statement with the police after June 12 after attending the parliamentary sessions. Meanwhile, after taking into account a request made by the police, the Kilinochchi Magistrates Court issued an overseas travel ban on the parliamentarian. On Sunday (June 04), Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles had called for a detailed report on the recent heated situation involving the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress leader and a group of police officers in Jaffna. Accordingly, the minister stated that the Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) of Police of Jaffna had been informed to provide a special report on the incident as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the female organizer of the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) was remanded until today (June 07) after being produced before the Kilinochchi Magistrates Court. She was arrested on Monday, along with a man, on charges of obstructing the duties of police officers.",

The Labour Ministry has taken into account the concerns raised by both employers and employees and has formulated a new unified law that aligns with the current trends in employment worldwide.

The modern labour law includes provisions that embrace the flexible nature of todays job market.

The shooting outside the Atria Theater sent students in graduation gowns running for safety, US media reports. School officials say the shooting took place during a ceremony for the Huguenot High School. Another graduation scheduled for Tuesday was been postponed and all classes are cancelled on Wednesday. The victims who killed were an 18-year-old man who was part of the graduating class and his 36-year-old father, police say. Police have not yet released their identities. A 19-year-old suspect has been taken into custody, according to Interim Richmond Police Chief Rick Edwards. He said that police believe that he knew at least one of the victims. Another person was found armed with a handgun and was initially detained, but police now believe he was not involved in the attack. The shooting took place in Monroe Park after the ceremony had ended at the Virginia Commonwealth University campus. Is nothing sacred any longer? Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney asked at a news conference. A child should be able to go their graduation and walk at their graduation and enjoy the accomplishment with their friends and families, he said, calling the shooting a selfish act. In an alert sent to students on Tuesday, the university said that police were on the scene to respond to the shooting. There is no ongoing threat to the community but there is a heavy police presence at Monroe Park, the alert said. Chief Edwards added that three off-duty officers were working inside the theater and seven more were stationed outside to direct traffic when the shots broke out. At 17:13 local time (22:13GMT), police in the building reported hearing shots outside, he said. As well as five injured by gunfire, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries, two people suffered falls and a nine-year old girl was hit by a car during the melee, he continued. Superintendent of Richmond Public Schools Jason Kamras said the attack occurred on what is supposed to be a joyous day when our kids walk the stage and get their diploma.

Sri Lanka confirmed its first two monkeypox cases in November 2022, three months after the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the infection a global emergency. Monkeypox, a viral zoonotic infection, is usually observed in central and western Africa. The infection saw a rapid spread in many parts of the world earlier last year. The most common symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes followed or accompanied by the development of a rash which can last for two to three weeks. Rashes can be found on the face, palms of the hand, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and genital or anal regions of the body. The symptoms typically last two to three weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care such as medication for pain and fever.

        "date": "June 7, 2023 03:34 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis is going to the hospital Wednesday for abdominal surgery to treat an intestinal blockage, two years after he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of an inflammation and narrowing of the large intestine. The Vatican said Francis, 86, would be put under general anesthesia and would be hospitalized at Romes Gemelli hospital for several days. The pope was undergoing what the Vatican said was a laparotomy and abdominal wall plastic surgery with prosthesis to treat a recurrent, painful and worsening constriction of the intestine. A laparotomy is open abdominal surgery. It can help a surgeon both diagnose and treat issues. The statement said Francis was suffering from a blocked laparocele, which is a hernia that formed over a previous scar. The stay at the health facility will last several days to allow for the normal post-operative course and full functional recovery, the statement said. In July 2021, Francis spent 10 days at Gemelli to remove 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his large intestine. He had suffered what the Vatican said was a severe inflammation and narrowing of the colon. In an interview with The Associated Press in January, Francis said the diverticulosis, or bulges in his intestinal wall, that prompted the 2021 surgery, had returned. Francis had come out of the 2021 surgery saying he could eat whatever he wanted, but he lamented that he hadnt responded well to the general anesthetic used in the longer-than-expected procedure. That reaction in part explained his refusal to have surgery to repair strained knee ligaments that have forced him to use a wheelchair and walker for over a year. The fact that he is going back for surgery suggests he had little choice but to treat the intestinal issue, especially given the rigorous upcoming travel schedule this summer. The Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man. He also suffers from sciatica nerve pain. Francis initially went to the Gemelli on Tuesday for what the Vatican said were medical tests. It revealed no details at the time. The 86-year-old had appeared in good form Wednesday morning at his audience in St. Peters Square, zipping around the square in his popemobile greeting the faithful. He also had two meetings beforehand, the Vatican said. Francis has had a packed schedule of late, with multiple audiences each day. The Vatican has recently confirmed a travel-filled August, when the Holy See and Italy are usually on vacation, with a four-day visit to Portugal the first week of August and a similarly long trip to Mongolia starting Aug. 31. In a sign that the trips were very much on, the Vatican on Tuesday released the planned itinerary for Francis visit to Portugal for World Youth Day events from Aug. 2-6. The itinerary confirms a typically busy schedule that includes all the protocol meetings of an official state visit plus multiple events with young people and a day trip to the Marian shrine at Fatima.

        "date": "June 7, 2023 04:04 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas national carrier is expecting a profit of USD 50 million for the upcoming year, SriLankan Airlines CEO Richard Nuttall revealed, adding that he also expects passenger traffic to surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2023 owing to the economic boom in tourism. In an interview with Channel News Asia (CNA), Nuttall said that he expected a stronger outlook for next year, with matters gradually returning to normalcy in terms of the countrys economy and its tourist arrivals. Assuming that the world stays the same for the year ahead, which we expect, and the Sri Lankan economy is rebounding, tourism is coming back, were forecasting perhaps a 50 million profit next year, he said in this regard. Speaking on the impact Sri Lankas economic crisis has had on the loss-making airline, Nuttall explained that while they were initially faced with a challenge at the start of 2022, owing to the severe dollar crisis Sri Lanka was facing at the time, the airline later got through it by around September that year. Moreover, he also noted that albeit several persons and industries were affected by the Sri Lankan currencys devaluation, SriLankan Airlines remained mostly unaffected. The currency devalued, thats been a challenge for many people in the country. But actually for the airline it doesnt really matter, because in practice 80 of our revenues come from overseas and actually even in the country the underlying fares are set in dollars. So, we are somewhat protected against currency moves, he explained. Commenting on the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines and a solution for servicing its debts, Nuttall spoke of the potential privatisation of the institution owing to the Sri Lankan governments decision to no longer fund inefficient State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), a decision Nuttall believed was taken in a bid to absolve from liability. He emphasised however, that the national carrier has not received any funds from the government for nearly two years, adding that almost 10 of their revenue went towards paying unsustainable interest rates between 12 - 15 on dollar debt that had nothing to do with the airline. When questioned on the potential privatisation of the national carrier and if any offers have been received thus far, Nuttall explained that he remains unaware of this, as the process in this regard has not yet called for their involvement in the matter. Were not managing it, the Governments managing it. But we expect, at some time in the process, that they will ask for expressions of interest and then well see. Do we get a good partner that works? Maybe. Maybe not, he said.",

The two nations restarted deal negotiations in January, months after a severe financial crisis engulfed Sri Lanka, as its foreign exchange reserves fell to a record low. Both sides are enthusiastic and there is strong political will, Sri Lankas chief FTA negotiator, K.J. Weerasinghe, told Reuters. There will be several more rounds of talks, but I am confident we can conclude the agreement for signature by March 2024. A Thai delegation is expected to visit Colombo from June 26 to 28 for the next round of talks, covering goods, customs cooperation, investment, dispute settlement and services, he added. Two-way trade was about 460 million in 2021, Sri Lankan central bank data shows. Sri Lanka exports mainly tea and precious stones to Thailand, from which it imports electronic equipment, food, rubber, plastics and pharmaceuticals. Last week President Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would focus on boosting foreign investment, exports and jobs, as it shifts gears from tackling the crisis to growth. Economic prospects have benefited from moderating inflation, a stronger currency and lower interest rates in recent months. The IMF expects Sri Lankas economy to shrink by about 3 this year after a contraction of 7.8 in 2022. The government expects to return to growth next year. The island also expects FDI inflows to rise by a fifth this year, to 1.3 billion, as it takes steps to attract investment. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 7, 2023 05:22 pm",
        "content": "Floodwaters in southern Ukraine were expected to crest on Wednesday, with tens of thousands of civilians fleeing in peril from the destruction of a vast dam that both sides called an act of wartime sabotage. Residents waded through flooded streets carrying children on their shoulders, dogs in their arms and belongings in plastic bags while rescuers used rubber boats to search areas where the waters reached above head height. Ukraine and Russia each accuse the other of deliberately destroying the Nova Kakhovka dam in desperation at a major turning point in the war. Everything is submerged in water, all the furniture, the fridge, food, all flowers, everything is floating. I do not know what to do, said Oksana, 53, in the city of Kherson downriver from the dam. Ukraine says 42,000 people are at direct risk from flooding and hundreds of thousands will be left without access to drinking water. A roof of a house could be seen whisking in the torrent of the Dnipro River. If the water rises for another metre, we will lose our house, said Oleksandr Reva, in a village on the bank, who was moving his familys belongings into the abandoned home of a neighbour on higher ground. Residents blamed the disaster on Russian troops who controlled the dam from their positions on the opposite bank. They hate us, Reva said. They want to destroy a Ukrainian nation and Ukraine itself. And they dont care by what means because nothing is sacred for them. Russia imposed a state of emergency in the parts of Kherson province it controls, where many towns and villages lie in lowlands below the dam. Residents there have told Reuters by telephone that Russian troops patrolling the streets in waders were threatening civilians who approached. A zoo by the riverbank on the Russian side flooded, killing all the animals inside, staff said. The consequences of the disaster will be felt for decades in southern Ukraine. The huge reservoir behind the dam was one of Ukraines main geographic features, and its waters irrigated huge swathes of agricultural land in one of the worlds biggest grain exporting nations, including Crimea, seized by Russia in 2014. The flood will have grave and far-reaching consequences for thousands of people in southern Ukraine on both sides of the front line through the loss of homes, food, safe water and livelihoods, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told the Security Council. The sheer magnitude of the catastrophe will only become fully realised in the coming days. Targeting dams in war is explicitly banned by the Geneva Conventions. Neither side has presented public evidence demonstrating who was to blame. The whole world will know about this Russian war crime, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address, calling it an environmental bomb of mass destruction. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday Ukraine had sabotaged the dam to distract attention from a new counteroffensive he said was faltering. Washington said it was still gathering evidence about who was to blame, but that Ukraine would have had no reason to inflict such devastation on itself. Why would Ukraine do this to its own territory and people, flood its land, force tens of thousands of people to leave their homes - it doesnt make sense, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood told reporters. SHELLING ACROSS RIVER Even as the evacuation was under way, Russia shelled Ukrainian-held territory across the river. Cracks of incoming artillery sent people trying to flee running for cover in Kherson. Reuters reporters heard four incoming artillery blasts near a residential neighbourhood where civilians were evacuating on Tuesday evening. The governor said one person was killed. Russia said a Ukrainian drone had struck a town on the opposite bank during evacuations there and accused the Ukrainian side of continuing shelling despite the flooding. The vast Dnipro River that bisects Ukraine forms the front line across the south in a war that reached a turning point this week, with the apparent start of a long-awaited Ukrainian counterattack using Western tanks. Ukraine has kept largely silent about the counterattack, apart from suggesting troops had advanced around the eastern city of Bakhmut, finally captured this month by Russia after nearly a year of Europes deadliest ground combat since World War Two. Russia claims to have thwarted major Ukrainian assaults in heavy fighting along the front since Sunday. The emptying reservoir supplies water that cools Europes biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia upstream. The U.N. nuclear watchdog said the plant should have enough water to cool its reactors for some months from a separate pond. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe convened a meeting today with a delegation composed of members from the esteemed Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) and the prestigious International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The delegation comprised distinguished leaders, including Mr. Jagath Abeysinghe, President of SLRCS, Dr. Mahesh Gunasekara, Director General of SLRCS, Mr. Alexander Matheou, IFRC Regional Director for Asia Pacific, and Mr. Udaya Regmi, IFRC Head of Country Cluster Delegation for South Asia. The primary objective of the meeting was to provide President Wickremesinghe with a comprehensive update regarding the ongoing South Asia National Societies Leadership meeting held in Colombo on June 6th and 7th. Eminent leaders from eight South Asian Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies graced this noteworthy event. To inaugurate the gathering, the South Asia Launch of the World Disasters Report 2022 (WDR 2022) took place on June 6th. In a gesture of gratitude, President Wickremesinghe received a copy of the WDR 2022. Throughout the meeting, the delegation also apprised the President of the pressing necessity for the enactment of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Act. This legislation aims to fortify the operational capacity of the Sri Lanka Red Cross and provide efficacious support to vulnerable individuals across the nation. The President attentively absorbed the briefing and engaged in deliberations concerning potential measures to enhance the functionality of the Sri Lanka Red Cross, thereby ensuring the welfare of the Sri Lankan people. This meeting between President Wickremesinghe and the collective team of SLRCS and IFRC leaders epitomizes Sri Lankas steadfast commitment to collaborating with international humanitarian organizations in tackling crucial issues and fostering a more robust and resilient society.

        "date": "June 7, 2023 09:55 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) Prof. Ranjith Bandara has taken stern exception at the non-compliance of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) that despite this being the third time it was summoned before the committee, no redress had been made for outstanding issues. The Chairman especially voiced his displeasure at the fact that this entity had the unceremonious honor of having the highest number of public petitions against them amongst other Public Enterprises, the Parliamentary Communications Department reported. The meeting commenced with the Chairman being extremely critical of the fact that per the Auditor Generals report, there were insufficient measures to rehabilitate lands that have been excavated. Further inquiries led to the understanding that the monetary consideration taken as security for land rehabilitation was found to be insufficient resulting in the inability to rehabilitate the excavated lands. Meanwhile, directions have been given to review the percentage that was charged as a security to ensure that it would be sufficient enough to cover the cost of rehabilitating excavated lands, it added. In addition, on scrutiny of data with regards to licenses, it was found that the practical procedure for licenses to be issued was inconsistent with the governing act and found to be arbitrary, the Parliamentary Communications Department said, adding that there was evidence to show that issued licenses had been arbitrarily cancelled without any methodology and this was indicative of malpractice and possibly fraud. Thus, it has been found that despite the authority given to the bureau to issue licenses, applications were still being forwarded to the Minister of Environment for the issuance of licenses. Thereby, the committee members had expressed their serious concern with the lack of governing independence with this practice. Moreover, Prof. Ranjith Bandara has proceeded to implement a stern directive via an independently contracted legal officer to sort through any and all misappropriation within the bureau. Further, a sub-committee already appointed by COPE to look into the processes within the entity and ensure that procedural propriety was ensured will continue with their mandate, it said. The review meeting was chaired by Prof.Ranjith Bandara, while MPs Jagath Pushpakumara, Janaka Wakkumbura, Shantha Bandara, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dayasiri Jayasekera, Eran Wickremaratne, Nimal Lanza, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Sudarshana Denipitiya, Premnath Dolawatte, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha, Madhura Withanage, Charitha Herath had also taken part, according to the Department of Communications of the Parliament.",

        "date": "June 7, 2023 10:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced plans to establish a Digital Promotion Agency aimed at developing computer applications for the collection and monitoring of data from various government entities in Sri Lanka. Previously, private companies had been responsible for creating such applications for government organizations, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. However, the President emphasized the need for a dedicated agency to carry out this task in the future. President Ranil Wickremesinghe shared these intentions during a meeting with Governing and Opposition Members of Parliament at the Parliament Complex. The purpose of the gathering was to address the overlapping work of the Oversight Committee and expedite its progress, according to the PMD. As per the Presidents recommendation, Opposition Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha De Silva, was appointed as the new Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, further said: Standing orders should be followed when appointing chairmen of committees and advisory bodies. According to the existing standards, the chairmanship of the Committee on Public Finance Committee should be offered to members of the opposition. Harsha de Silvas name and the names of several other members were proposed for this purpose. MP Mayantha Dissanayake has resigned as chairman. If the opposition suggests it, MP Harsha de Silva should be appointed head of the Committee on Public Finance. The IMF agreement was approved by Parliament. The newly appointed chairman should conduct himself appropriately. The rules and regulations of committees and advisory councils should be set by the MPs who meet in those bodies. If the committee meeting cannot be held in the Parliament, we can find another location. The participating members could be paid separately. One thing should be mentioned here. Before presenting a bill to the Parliament, it should be presented to the MPs in advance to discuss and to be aware of it. It should be presented to them at least a week before the debate instead of delivering the bill today to be submitted tomorrow. It will be meaningless. It would be preferable if MPs were given at least two weeks notice. Under World Bank support, funds have been secured to build an Interim Budget Office. We need your assistance to keep it running. The council should recognize its own obligations and designate Chairmanships of committees and advisory councils, as well as their representatives, with suitable targets. In the past, District Revenue Officers (DRO) was assigned to Local Councils in Sri Lanka to collect government taxes. In India, there were Collecting Officers. However, when the Regional Secretariats in Sri Lanka expanded, the DROs disappeared and later they became Assistant Government Agents. As a result, these Assistant Government Officials spent the governments money rather than collecting revenue for the government. Consequently, the government will have to recruit at least 200 new DROs to collect the income if necessary. Moreover, until recently, the private sector was responsible for the development of computer apps to gather and store data from government institutions for the functioning of government institutions. It should be stopped. Prompt measures have been made to establish a Digital Promotion Agency (DPA) for this purpose. As a result, DPA will develop computer applications for all government organizations in Sri Lanka in the future. Furthermore, two months before the budget, the Sectorial Oversight Committees shall provide a report on how the governments money has been utilized. Member of Parliament Mr Harsha De Silva: Honourable President, Id like to thank you for appointing me as the new Chairman of the Government Finance Committee. We questioned the Committee on Public Finance not to disrupt these efforts, but to steer the committee and its responsibilities in the appropriate direction. We collaborated with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to establish an Interim Budget Office. Member of Parliament Mr Patali Champika Ranawaka, In the Parliament, there are around 73 Committees and Advisory Councils. Human and physical resources are insufficient to support these Committees. If a rapid progressive committee program is required, the infrastructure should be strengthened. Member of Parliament Mr. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Committees and advisory groups can have a significant impact. However, the representatives who have been appointed are engaged in a political process rather than performing their official duties. They are attempting to address the media through media shows. This is something we should avoid. It needs a quick program as it contains sensitive issues in these areas. This discussion was attended by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Education Minister and Leader of the House Dr. Susil Premajayanth, Parliamentary Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera, Presidents Senior Advisor on Economic Affairs Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, Presidents Parliamentary Affairs Secretary Prof. Ashu Marasinghe, and members of the Government and Opposition. --PMD--",

The agreement on cultural cooperation will provide the opportunity for both countries to cultivate and develop closer and stronger cultural relations between the Maldives and Sri Lanka.

        "date": "June 8, 2023 10:30 am",
        "content": "Schools across the U.S. East Coast canceled outdoor activities, airline traffic slowed and millions of Americans were urged to stay indoors on Wednesday as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted south, blanketing cities in thick, yellow haze. The U.S. National Weather Service issued air quality alerts for virtually the entire Atlantic seaboard. Health officials from Vermont to South Carolina and as far west as Ohio and Kansas warned residents that spending time outdoors could cause respiratory problems due to high levels of fine particulates in the atmosphere. Its critical that Americans experiencing dangerous air pollution, especially those with health conditions, listen to local authorities to protect themselves and their families, President Joe Biden said on Twitter. U.S. private forecasting service AccuWeather said thick haze and soot extending from high elevations to ground level marked the worst outbreak of wildfire smoke to blanket the Northeastern U.S. in more than 20 years. New Yorks famous skyline, usually visible for miles, appeared to vanish in an otherworldly veil of smoke, which some residents said made them feel unwell. It makes breathing difficult, Mohammed Abass said as he walked down Broadway in Manhattan. Ive been scheduled for a road test for driving, for my driving license today, and it was canceled. The smoky air was especially tough on people toiling outdoors, such as Chris Ricciardi, owner of Neighbors Envy Landscaping in Roxbury, New Jersey. He said he and his crew were curtailing work hours and wearing masks they used for heavy pollen. We dont have the luxury to stop working, he said. We want to keep our exposure to the smoke to a minimum, but what can you really do about it? Angel Emmanuel Ramirez, 29, a fashion stylist at a Givenchy outlet in Manhattan, said he and fellow workers began feeling ill and closed up shop early when they realized the smell of smoke was permeating the store. Its so intense, you would think the wildfire was happening right across the river, not up in Canada, Ramirez said. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called the situation an emergency crisis, saying the air pollution index for parts of her state were eight times above normal. Reduced visibility from the haze forced the Federal Aviation Administration to slow air traffic into the New York City area and Philadelphia from elsewhere on the East Coast and upper Midwest, with flight delays averaging about a half hour. Schools up and down the East Coast called off outdoor activities, including sports, field trips and recesses. A Broadway matinee of Prima Facie was halted after 10 minutes when actress Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing due to poor air quality. The show was restarted with understudy Dani Arlington going on for Comer in the role of Tessa, a production spokesperson said in a statement. Even Major League Baseball was impacted, as the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies both postponed home games scheduled for Wednesday. A National Womens Soccer League match in Harrison, New Jersey, was also rescheduled, as was a WNBA womens basketball game in Brooklyn. In some areas, the air quality index (AQI), which measures major pollutants including particulate matter produced by fires, was well above 400, according to Airnow, which sets 100 as unhealthy and 300 as hazardous. At noon (1600 GMT), Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was recording the nations worst air quality index, with an AQI reading of 410. Among major cities, New York had the highest AQI in the world on Wednesday afternoon at 342, about double the index for chronically polluted cities such as Dubai (168) and Delhi (164), according to IQAir. Smoke Crossing from Canada The smoke billowed over the U.S. border from Canada, where hundreds of forest fires have scorched 9.4 million acres (3.8 million hectares) and forced 120,000 people from their homes in an unusually early and intense start to the wildfire season. The skies above New York and many other North American cities grew progressively hazier through Wednesday, with an eerie yellowish tinge filtering through the smoky canopy. The air smelled like burning wood. Wildfire smoke has been linked with higher rates of heart attacks and strokes, increases in emergency room visits for asthma and other respiratory conditions, eye irritation, itchy skin and rashes, among other problems. A Home Depot store in Manhattan sold out of air purifiers and masks. New York Road Runners canceled events intended to mark Global Running Day. This is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event with your children, New York Mayor Eric Adams advised. If you are older or have heart or breathing problems or an older adult, you should remain inside. Pedestrians donned face masks in numbers that brought to mind the worst days of the coronavirus pandemic. Tyrone Sylvester, 66, playing chess in Manhattans Union Square as he has on most days for 30 years, but wearing a mask, said he had never seen the citys air quality so bad. When the sun looks like that, he said, pointing out the bronze-like orb visible through the smoky sky, we know somethings wrong. This is what global warming looks like. Poor air quality is likely to persist into the weekend, with a developing storm system expected to shift the smoke westward across the Great Lakes and deeper south through the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic region, AccuWeather said.

        "date": "June 8, 2023 11:37 am",
        "content": "The Chinese Embassy in Colombo on Tuesday organised a special ceremony in Colombo to felicitate the diving team of the Sri Lanka Navy, which engaged in a heroic diving operation to recover the capsized Chinese fishing vessel LU PENG YUAN YU 028. The Chinese vessel capsized in the Australian Search and Rescue Region, south of Sri Lanka on May 16. The event was presided over by the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Qi Zhenhong and the Chief of Presidential Staff and Senior Adviser on National Security to the President, Sagala Ratnayaka. As per Sri Lankas commitment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) Colombo established at the naval headquarters is responsible for coordinating and facilitating maritime search and rescue operations in its designated region as well as neighbouring regions. At the directives of Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, a diving team onboard SLNS Vijayabahu was dispatched to the SAR Region to engage in a challenging diving operation at the overturned Chinese fishing vessel. Having reached the location, the Sri Lanka Navy divers meticulously searched for air pockets within the upturned vessel, hoping to find any survivors. After strenuous diving in challenging conditions for three days, they retrieved 02 bodies from the accommodation area and located 12 more decomposed bodies of the crew from other compartments. In less than 24 hours after the challenging diving operation, the distressed Chinese vessel sank into the deep depths of the ocean. The Sri Lanka Navy said its exceptional diving operation, carried out under such hazardous circumstances, thus received international acclaim. Upon completion of its intended task, SLNS Vijayabahu then commenced the return journey. On its way home, the ship retrieved an ill fisherman from a local multi day fishing trawler at sea about 460 nautical miles (851km) off Galle and brought him ashore for medical attention on May 26. Speaking at the felicitation ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador said the special diving operation carried out by the Navy was a testament to the friendly and strong relationship between the two countries.",

        "date": "June 8, 2023 02:26 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday said it has approved Sri Lankas eligibility to access concessional financing. The availability of concessional assistance, offered at low interest rates, broadens Sri Lankas options to bridge its urgent development financing needs to restore economic stability and deliver essential services, particularly to the poor and vulnerable, the Philippines-based regional development bank said in a press release. Eligibility for concessional resources among the ADBs developing member countries is based on gross national income per capita and creditworthiness. ADB explained that its decision was considered based on a request from the Sri Lanka government in view of the severe and unprecedented economic crisis that has reversed hard-won development gains. ADB is committed to further enhancing its support for the people of Sri Lanka as the country responds to this deep crisis that has severely undermined their livelihoods and well-being, said ADB Director General for South Asia, Kenichi Yokoyama. The availability of concessional assistance will help Sri Lanka to lay the foundation for economic recovery and sustained, inclusive growth. Thus, Sri Lanka is now eligible for ADB support including concessional and market-based financing, technical assistance, policy advice, and knowledge solutions that together comprise a comprehensive suite of options to address the crisis. The ADB notes that access to concessional financing will also ease debt servicing pressures through more favourable lending terms.",

        "title": "UK to host worlds first global summit on Artificial Intelligence",
        "date": "June 8, 2023 02:40 pm",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday announced a world-first summit on artificial intelligence, seeking a leading role for the UK in limiting potential doomsday risks as he visited Washington. Sunak will meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday for talks during which he will also voice unstinting support for Ukraine, as the young Conservative leader wages an often uphill battle to show the UKs post-Brexit relevance. Opening his two-day trip, the prime minister announced that Britain would hold the worlds first summit on artificial intelligence in the second half of the year. AI has an incredible potential to transform our lives for the better. But we need to make sure it is developed and used in a way that is safe and secure, Sunak said. Time and time again throughout history we have invented paradigm-shifting new technologies and we have harnessed them for the good of humanity. That is what we must do again, he added. The Group of Seven called for action on AI during a summit in Japan last month. But the United States also held talks last week on an AI code of conduct with the European Union. Sunak is pitching for a future global AI regulator to be based in London. The UK is well placed to play a leadership role. Outside of the US, we are probably the leading AI nation amongst democratic countries. We have an ability to get regulation right to protect our citizens, Sunak told TalkTV. - Ultimate sacrifice - Sunak opened his two-day US visit by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, with soldiers firing a 19-gun salute. In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in order that we might live free. We will remember them, said a hand-written message from Sunak on the wreath. The Ukraine war is expected to dominate his conversations with Biden, with Britain joining the United States in championing robust military support to Kyiv. The visit comes as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over who blew up the large Kakhovka dam, triggering devastating floods. Any intentional targeting of the dam would represent the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war, and just would demonstrate the new lows that we would have seen from Russian aggression, Sunak told reporters aboard his plane from London. The United States and Britain have not yet identified a culprit. But in an interview with ITV News, Sunak said that Russia has pursued a deliberate strategy to target civilian infrastructure. It is wrong, its barbaric, and its appalling. Thats why were providing such strong support to them and will continue to do so, he said of the Ukrainians. Sunak has also been talking up British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace as a candidate to lead NATO before the Western military alliance holds a summit next month in Lithuania, with the prime ministers of Denmark and Estonia also seen as contenders. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergs term in the job is due to end in October. - Keeping hopes on business - A day before meeting Biden, Sunak met Washingtons top Republican, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who lauded the longstanding alliance. When our bond is stronger, the world is safer and democracy grows, McCarthy said. Despite broad US support for Britain, Sunak has all but given up on a post-Brexit trade deal from the Biden administration, which has shown limited enthusiasm. Sunak pointed to the US-UK military alliance as he made a case for the economic relationship. Just as interoperability between our militaries has given us a battlefield advantage over our adversaries, greater economic interoperability will give us a crucial edge in the decades ahead, said Sunak, a wealthy former banker who studied in the United States and retains a property in California. The prime minister is pushing for US relief to UK carmakers, via greater access to critical minerals used in batteries, after Bidens Inflation Reduction Act offered vast subsidies to companies with US operations. Sunak was due later to watch the Washington Nationals baseball team play the Arizona Diamondbacks for the second annual UK-US Friendship Day, marking 238 years of diplomatic relations. But the keen cricketer ducked the opportunity to throw the ceremonial first pitch -- sparing his blushes if the throw goes astray in front of thousands. Source: AFP",

A man armed with a knife attacked a group of children aged around three years old at 9:45 am (07:45 GMT) on Thursday at a park near the lake in the town, a security source who asked not to be named and a local official told AFP. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin tweeted that the culprit has been arrested thanks to the rapid reaction of security forces.

He attacked the children - some in pushchairs - as they visited the park, before fleeing the scene and stabbing an elderly man nearby. Police intervened and the perpetrator was shot in the legs. Frances National Assembly has observed a minute of silence and roads are blocked around the scene of the attack.

The Contract Agreement was signed, a short while ago, at the Presidential Secretariat, following the recommendations of the Cabinet Appointed Special Committee, the Presidents Media Division said. US-based petroleum company RM Parks in a collaboration with Shell PLC signed the agreement to enter the Sri Lanka petroleum business today. RM Parks will be the 4th supplier to enter the domestic market and will operate under the Shell branding. They signed a 20-year agreement to import, distribute and sell petroleum products through 150 fuel stations allocated from CPC, Sri Lankas Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said. In a tweet, he said that approval was also granted for 50 new fuel stations to be established island-wide and that they will upgrade the fuel stations with new automated dispensers, electric charge stations, mini markets and cafes. In March, the Cabinet of Ministers had granted approval to award licenses to Chinas Sinopec, Australias United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell plc, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka. Thereby, they are be granted a license to operate for 20 years to import, store, distribute and sell petroleum products in Sri Lanka. In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lankas fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations. In October the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy. The US-based oil company RM Parks Inc. and the British multinational oil and gas company Shell PLC had held discussions with Minister Wijesekera on commencing retail fuel sales in Sri Lanka in the first week of June this year. Wijesekera, joining the political talk show 360 on TV Derana earlier in April, revealed that each company will handle 150 CPC dealer-operated filling stations in the local market. At present, a total of 1,142 filling stations are under the purview of the CPC, however, the corporation fully owns only 234 of them, the minister explained, adding that 450 out of the remaining 908 filling stations owned by private distributors would be allocated to the three foreign oil companies.

        "content": "The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to import hatching eggs through the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB). Thereby, arrangements have been made to import 176,000 hatching eggs instead of mother hens in a bid to solve the current shortage of chicken meat and eggs in the country. NLDB chairman, Prof. H.W. Cyril mentioned that Sri Lanka is expecting 44,000 eggs per week within a period of one month. A discussion was held at the Ministry of Agriculture this morning (June 08) to discuss the steps to be taken to eliminate the shortage of chicken meat and eggs in the country. Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera, and the Minister of State Minister for Livestock Development D.B. Herath and other respective officials were in attendance at this meeting. Hatching eggs are being imported as the importation of mother hens delays availability of eggs and chicks, the Agriculture Ministry explained. This move makes it easier to get chickens for eggs and meat within a short period of time, the ministry added. Thus, Minister Amaraweera has instructed the officials to take steps to provide the chicks obtained from this stock of 176,000 hatching eggs imported from the Netherlands to the private sector chicken farms, which were closed during the Covid-19 epidemic situation, at a subsidized price. This stock of hatching eggs is to be received in Sri Lanka within the next month. Meanwhile, the Agriculture Minister has made arrangements to hold another discussion with the owners of poultry egg storage farms as well as the owners of egg producing farms at 11.00 a.m. tomorrow (June 09) to further discuss the matter.",

Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne told the court that the order under which the detainment of his client is being carried out was completely against the law, and thus requested that an interim order be issued preventing his further detention. Deputy Solicitor General Shanil Kularatne, however, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, vehemently objected to the said request, claiming that the writ petition in question had been filed on the basis of assumptions instead of proper facts, thereby requesting the court to dismiss the petition. Chinthaka has been in the custody of the CID since 15 March, following his arrest in Madagascar on 01 March, thus a petition was filed by his lawyers, on his behalf, claiming that his life was in danger.",

        "date": "June 9, 2023 07:07 am",
        "content": "Former US President Donald Trump has been indicted over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. Mr Trump, 76, faces seven charges including unauthorised retention of classified files, US media reported, but further details are unclear. It is the second indictment of Mr Trump and the first-ever federal indictment of a former president. He is campaigning to make a stunning return to the White House in 2024. In a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump said he was innocent and had been summoned to appear at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday. I never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former President of the United States, he wrote. He added: This is indeed a dark day for the United States of America. We are a country in serious and rapid decline, but together we will Make America Great Again! The BBCs US partner CBS News reported a source as saying the indictment was linked to the documents case and involved multiple charges. Other US media, including CNN and ABC News, said the indictment involved at least seven charges. An indictment enables the prosecution of a suspect for offences they are charged with. The Department of Justice declined to comment and the indictment has not been released. Special prosecutor Jack Smith has been considering evidence in the documents case since he was appointed to oversee it by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November. Last year, Mr Trumps Florida resort Mar-a-Lago was searched and 11,000 documents were seized, including around 100 marked as classified. Some of these were labelled top secret. It was reported last week that prosecutors had obtained an audio recording of Mr Trump in which he acknowledged keeping a classified document after leaving the White House. It is against US law for federal officials, up to and including a president, to remove or retain classified documents at an unauthorised location. Mr Smith, a former war crimes attorney who is known as a dogged investigator, is also overseeing a separate probe into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Mr Trump lost. Mr Trump became the first former president to be charged with a crime in April, after he pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records over a hush-money payment to a porn star. He faces a trial in that case in New York next year. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The decision was taken at the first meeting of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) for the fourth session of the ninth Parliament on Wednesday under the chairmanship of MP Dr. Harsha de Silva. The COPF chairman pointed out that the establishment of a regulatory authority regarding the casino business was previously discussed and that the Finance Ministry has prepared a time frame for this regulatory authority to get cabinet approval by January 31, 2023. However, since this has not been done, the COPF mentioned that a new timeframe is needed and a period of one week would be given to prepare it. Accordingly, it was decided to convene a COPF meeting in a week to consider the Betting and Gaming Levy (Amendment) Bill. In addition, the approval of the COPF was also given for the regulation under Appropriation Act No. 30 of 2021. The Cabinet of Ministers in March 2023 gave the nod for the Betting and Gaming Levy (Amendment) Bill, proposed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policy.

        "date": "June 9, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security has issued recommendations against the privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, citing the possible leakage of matters sensitive to national security. This was mentioned in a report titled The Effects of Privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom on National Security, presented to the parliament by the committees chairman MP Sarath Weerasekara today (June 09). Sri Lanka Telecom  the national information and communications technology solution provider and the leading broadband and backbone infrastructure services provider in the country  is already partially privatized with international companies holding 44.98 of the stake and the government holding 49.5. Thus, further privatization would expose the countrys critical communication infrastructuresensitive information to private entities whose profit-oriented interests can compromise national security, the SOC opined. Pointing out that SLT fixed connections are provided to diplomatic missions, high-level public sector cooperates, businesses, defence services, and the police, the SOC noted that there is a high risk of information of important subscribers getting leaked out, if the company is privatized. Voice and data could be passed to a third party both locally and overseas. It the privatization move goes ahead, the SOC said the government would lose control and will be impossible to understand which subscribers are tapped and monitored and the call detail records of VVIPs and security agencies can be easily extracted from billing systemsnetwork elements and passed to wrong hands. The committee went on to note that in the mobile network, without the knowledge of the user, the private operator can also do geo fencing (allow or disallow certain areas), know the location of SIM card user, track the path, get browsing data, switch off a mobile device remotely using MDM software. The SOC report stresses that the government must ensure that non-state actors do not have easy access to vital information that can be detrimental to national security. National Security is not only the protection against military attack, but it involves non-military dimensions such as economic security, energy security, food security, etc. and most importantly cyber security. Further, a successful cyber attack on telecommunications could disrupt service for thousands of phone subscribers, deny internet to millions of customers, cripple business, shut down government operations gravely affecting the national security. The committee says private companies may not commit funds to ensure adequate counter measures cyber attacks (such as firewalls, electronic surveillance and access control devices) as national security is not their priority. Private companies have a legal obligation to maximize profits for their shareholders and as such will not operate in the public interest. In its recommendations, the SOC said any individual or organization that is blacklisted or has helped terrorists or extremists in any form, should not be allowed to buy any share and have any control over the countrys national assets.

        "date": "June 9, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "As concerns are rife after two monkeypox cases were identified earlier this week, the health authorities have urged the members of the public not to have any undue fears about the viral infection. A mother-daughter duo, who had returned to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE, was tested positive for monkeypox at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake. They were subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) for treatment. This brought the total number of monkeypox cases found in Sri Lanka to four. The first two cases were identified in November 2022, three months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the infection a global emergency. As human-to-human transmission of monkeypox is at a very low level, Dr. Samitha Ginige, Acting Chief Epidemiologist of the Health Ministry, urged the members of the public not to have unnecessary fears about the viral infection. According to the UN health agency, human-to-human transmission of monkeypox happens through prolonged direct contact with a monkeypox-infected person, such as face-to-face, skin-to-skin and mouth-to-mouth contact or through droplets from coughing or sneezing. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection caused by a virus belonging to the family Poxviridae. These viruses are transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. As they are highly resistant in dry environments or at high temperatures, they persist on infected surfaces for a longer period of time. However, despite the resistance of the virus, monkeypox is not a highly contagious disease, since prolonged direct contact is needed for the virus to spread from human to human. Rashes can be found on the face, palms of the hand, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and genital or anal regions of the body. The symptoms typically last two to three weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care such as medication for pain and fever.",
