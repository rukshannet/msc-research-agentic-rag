        "title": "Columbia agrees to Trumps demands in attempt to restore funding",
        "date": "March 22, 2025 08:47 am",
        "content": "Columbia University has agreed to changes demanded by the Trump administration as a precondition for restoring 400 million in federal funding that was pulled this month over allegations the school tolerated antisemitism on campus. The New York-based university, acquiescing to several demands in a memo released on Friday, opens new tab, laid out plans to ban some face masks on campus, empower security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and appoint a new official with broad powers to review departments that offer courses on the Middle East. What Columbia would do with its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department, opens new tab was among the biggest questions facing the university as it confronted the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in government grants and contracts. The Trump administration had told the school to place the department under academic receivership for at least five years, taking control away from its faculty. Academic receivership is a rare step taken by a universitys administrators to fix a dysfunctional department by appointing a professor or administrator outside the department to take over. It is unheard of for the U.S. government to make such a demand. While Columbia, in its memo, stopped short of referring to a receivership, its move appeared to meet that demand. The school said it would appoint a new senior administrator to review curriculum and faculty to make sure they are balanced, and review leadership at several departments. Professor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania and a proud graduate of Columbia, called it a sad day for the university. Historically, there is no precedent for this, Zimmerman said. The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university. Todd Wolfson, a Rutgers University professor and president of the American Association of University Professors, called President Donald Trumps demands arguably the greatest incursion into academic freedom, freedom of speech and institutional autonomy that weve seen since the McCarthy era. It sets a terrible precedent, Wolfson said. I know every academic faculty member in this country is angry about Columbia Universitys inability to stand up to a bully. In a statement released alongside the memo, interim President Katrina Armstrong said the changes were part of a broader effort to advance our mission, ensure uninterrupted academic activities, and make every student, faculty, and staff member safe and welcome on our campus. The White House had yet to respond to Columbias memo as of Friday evening, and the status of the funding remained unclear. Trumps demands were a precondition before Columbia could enter negotiations with the government over funding. The Ivy League universitys response is being watched by other universities that the administration has targeted as it advances its policy objectives in areas ranging from campus protests to transgender sports and diversity initiatives. Private companies, law firms and other organizations have also faced the prospect of cuts in government funding and business unless they agree to adhere more closely to Trumps priorities. Powerful Wall Street law firm Paul Weiss came under heavy criticism on Friday over a deal it struck with the White House to escape an executive order imperiling its business. The administration has warned at least 60 other universities of similar action. Columbia has come under particular scrutiny, following the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled its campus last year, when its lawns filled with tent encampments and noisy rallies against the U.S. governments support of Israel. ARREST POWERS Among the outlined changes, Columbia has hired three dozen special officers who have the power to arrest people on campus and has revised its anti-discrimination policies, including its authority to sanction campus organizations, the memo said. Face masks to conceal identities are no longer allowed, and any protesters must now identify themselves when asked, the memo said. The ban does not apply to face masks worn for medical or religious purposes. The school also said it is searching for new faculty members to ensure intellectual diversity. The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia this month was already disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said. Canceled projects included the development of an AI-based tool that helps nurses detect the deterioration of a patients health in hospital two days earlier than other early warning systems. The Trump administration also canceled funding for a study designed to improve the safety of blood transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns, and research on uterine fibroids, non-cancerous tumors that can cause pain and affect womens fertility.

        "date": "March 23, 2025 06:06 am",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike in southern Gazas Khan Younis killed Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel, Hamas and Palestinian media reported in the early hours of Sunday. Pro-Hamas media said the airstrike killed Bardaweel, who is a member of the groups political office, and also killed his wife. Israeli officials had no immediate comment. Israel resumed significant strikes on Gaza on Tuesday, blaming Hamas, abandoning a ceasefire agreement that began on January 19 and ending almost two months of calm. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said the main aim of the war is to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. He has said the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages. Hamas de facto government head Essam Addalees and internal security chief Mahmoud Abu Watfa were among those killed by Israeli strikes on Tuesday, in addition to several other officials. Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people, more than half of them women and children, were killed on Tuesday. Palestinian medics said an Israeli plane bombed a house in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the terms of the January ceasefire agreement by refusing to begin negotiations for a final end to the war and a withdrawal of its troops from Gaza but has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying Witkoffs bridging proposals. The return to the air strikes and ground operations that have devastated Gaza has drawn calls for a ceasefire from Arab and European countries. Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement calling on Israel to restore access for humanitarian aid. Israel has blocked the entry of goods into Gaza and Falk accused Hamas of taking aid for its own use, a charge Hamas has previously denied. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a devastating Hamas attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023 that killed some 1,200 people, according to an Israeli tally, and saw 251 abducted as hostages. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated much of the coastal enclave leaving hundreds of thousands of people in tents and makeshift shelters.

        "date": "March 23, 2025 10:12 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for more than five weeks, will be discharged from hospital on Sunday but will need a further two months of rest at the Vatican, the head of his medical team said on Saturday. Francis, 88, was admitted to Romes Gemelli hospital on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. They said they had prescribed the pope two months of repose, and had advised him against taking any meetings with large groups, or that require special effort. The recommendation for a period of convalescence of at least two months is very important, Sergio Alfieri, head of the popes medical team, told the press conference. Francis, who was fighting double pneumonia, suffered four acute attacks of what the Vatican called respiratory crises during his time in hospital. Alfieri said that two of the crises had been critical, with the pope in danger of his life. The pontiff no longer has pneumonia, but is also not completely healed from a complex infection involving several microorganisms, said the doctor. Alfieri emphasized that while Francis had used non-invasive ventilation through a mask over his mouth and nose to help breathe, the pope had never been intubated during his stay in hospital. One senior cardinal had said on Friday that the pope would need to relearn to speak after battling a respiratory infection for so long. It will take time before his voice returns to what it was before, said Alfieri. The doctor said the pope, who had gained some weight in recent years after using a wheelchair for knee and back pain, has now lost some weight. We havent weighed him, but he has lost weight, surely, said Alfieri. But, lets say, he had some in reserve, so it doesnt worry us, he added. POPE TO MAKE PUBLIC APPEARANCE SUNDAY Dr. Luigi Carbone, vice director of the Vaticans healthcare service, said the pope would have a nurse caring for him when he returns to his Vatican residence. The Vatican said earlier on Saturday that Francis would make his first public appearance in more than five weeks on Sunday, to offer a blessing from the window of his hospital room before being discharged. The pope has been seen by the public only once during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel. Francis wants to come to the hospital window around noon on Sunday to give a greeting and blessing, the Vatican said in its brief statement earlier on Saturday. A period of two months rest for Francis could lead to significant changes to the Vaticans calendar of upcoming events. The pope had been set to meet with Britains King Charles on April 8, and to lead the Vaticans annual celebrations for Easter on April 20. A spokesperson said on Saturday that the Vatican would decide about those appointments at a later date. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 23, 2025 11:46 am",
        "content": "Negotiations on a potential contract between Elon Musks satellite internet operator Starlink and the Italian government have stalled, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions, Italys defence minister said on Saturday. Prime Minister Giorgia Melonis government is aiming to guarantee encrypted communications between the government, diplomats and defence officials operating in risky areas and Starlink is among the contenders to provide the system. It seems to me that everything has come to a standstill, Guido Crosetto was quoted as saying by newspaper La Repubblica. He said it was partly due to the fact that discussions moved from technical aspects to statements by and about Musk, without elaborating about those statements. Starlink is a dominant force in the sector with around 7,000 active low-orbit satellites and it has been offering its services in Italy since 2021. Sources have told Reuters Rome was considering a five-year deal worth a total of 1.5 billion euros (1.62 billion) with the company that is part of Musks SpaceX group. But talks between the government and Starlink have sparked outrage among opposition politicians who question the wisdom of handing a national security contract to a foreign businessman and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Meloni has put the alliance with the United States at the heart of Italys foreign policy, but Trumps actions, which have antagonised Romes European allies, are forcing her to perform a political balancing act. At home, she is under pressure from her coalition partner, the far-right League, to keep supporting Trump and Musk. On Friday, the Leagues leader and Melonis deputy Matteo Salvini said he had a phone call with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in which he praised the remarkable American capabilities in key areas such as satellite communications. U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, ending well off their lows, with the Dow and SP closing marginally higher while the Nasdaq added half of one percent. Crosetto said that when the situation calmed down, talks would move back to a technical level. The point is: what is most useful and safe for the nation, said the minister, who in the same interview described Musk as a visionary genius. Andrea Stroppa, a representative for Musk in Italy, said on Saturday it made sense for Italy and its European partners to create their own independent satellite infrastructure for low-orbit telecommunication, but Starlink could be the best solution for the short term. In the next 3-5 years, theres an operating necessity that should be fulfilled, he said during a live interview on X. Stroppa said Crosetto had visited SpaceX facilities in the U.S. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Venezuela has reached an agreement with the United States to resume repatriation flights of migrants, President Nicolas Maduro announced in a televised address on Saturday. Maduro said the flights would commence on Sunday. Tomorrow, thanks to the governments perseverance, well resume flights to continue rescuing and freeing migrants from prisons in the United States, Maduro said. The move comes amid a diplomatic spat between the United States and Venezuela over the recent deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. The White House did not reply to a request for comment. As part of President Donald Trumps rapid U.S. deportation program, hundreds of Venezuelan migrants were sent to a prison in El Salvador. To Nayib Bukele, El Salvadors President, we say that youre responsible, Maduro said, adding that migrants hadnt committed crimes in the U.S. or El Salvador. You have to guarantee their health and sooner rather than later, you have to free them and hand them over, Maduro said. El Salvadors government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Maduros speech came after Venezuelas Parliament President Jorge Rodriguez released a statement earlier in the day announcing the deal to resume flights. Migrating isnt a crime, and we wont rest until everyone who wants to return is back and we rescue our kidnapped brothers in El Salvador, the statement said. The families and lawyers have been seeking news about relatives and clients whom they could no longer reach, and demanding their return to Venezuela. The United States said the deportees sent to El Salvador were members of Venezuelas Tren de Aragua gang, a claim that Venezuelas interior minister denied. The Trump administration now faces a March 25 deadline to respond to a judicial request for more details on the deportations to El Salvador, as Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg considers whether officials violated his order temporarily blocking the expulsions.

On March 21, two individuals were killed in a shooting incident on Sinhasana Road, in front of the southern entrance of the Devinuwara Sri Vishnu Devalaya, at around 11.45 p.m., according to the police. Furthermore, police have uncovered more details regarding the double murder, with investigations pointing to notorious criminal Shehan Sathsara, infamously known as Bale Malli, as the prime suspect behind the crime. According to the police, the shootings were allegedly carried out due to a dispute between the two victims, identified as Pasindu Tharaka (29) and Yomesh Nadeeshan, and Bale Malli. The suspect is reported to be currently hiding in Dubai. The victims, both residents of the area, were returning home from a birthday party in Kapugampura when they were ambushed by a group of attackers traveling in a van.

        "title": "50,000 killed in Gaza since start of Israel-Hamas war, health ministry says",
        "date": "March 23, 2025 04:47 pm",
        "content": "More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israels war with Hamas began, the territorys health ministry said Sunday, a grim milestone for a war with no end in sight as Israel resumes fighting and warns of even tougher days ahead. The ministry reported 41 more deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the toll to 50,021. Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children. And the true toll could be much higher, with many thousands believed to still be under the rubble. The death toll surged as Israel resumed its war with Hamas this week, ending a two-month ceasefire in Gaza. Tuesdays renewed airstrikes made it one of the deadliest days for Palestinians since the war began, with more than 400 killed by Israeli fire, according to the health ministry. By Wednesday, Israel had also resumed its ground operation in the enclave. Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant groups surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Hamas called the latest offensive a new and dangerous breach of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group says it is committed to the ceasefire agreement it signed with Israel in January, but on Thursday fired its first rockets at Israel since the truce collapsed. Gazans are left with little hope that the killing will slow as Israeli officials warn that whats to come will be significantly worse. Defense Minister Israel Katz this week vowed to make Gazas residents pay the full price if Israeli hostages are not returned and Hamas remains able to govern in the strip. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you  including going to other places in the world for those who wish, he said. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation. In a televised address Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: I want to assure you: This is just the beginning. Almost all of Gazas population of more than 2 million has been displaced from their homes. The enclaves healthcare system has been severely damaged, with hospitals often becoming the center of fighting. A humanitarian crisis and famine in parts of Gaza are unfolding, as Israel blocked aid from entering Gaza earlier this month and as its latest operation impedes distribution. Negotiations to extend the ceasefire have been moribund nearly from the day it went into effect January 19. Hamas has insisted on sticking to the initial framework signed with Israel in January, which would have seen parties move to a second phase on March 1. Under the terms of the second phase, Israel would have had to withdraw entirely from Gaza and commit to a permanent end of the war. In exchange, Hamas would release all living hostages. The second phase never happened, and Israel resumed the war, citing Hamas alleged rejection of two concrete mediation proposals presented by the US and its threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities as justification for its attacks on Gaza. Israel does not dispute that a significant number of Palestinian civilians have been killed in its war in Gaza. It has however long argued that the health ministrys figures are exaggerated, and that Hamas embeds itself between civilians, using them as human shields. The United Nations and United States State Department have repeatedly said they believe the health ministrys figures to be accurate, and independent academic studies have estimated that the true toll is likely to be far higher. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers and the Israeli government does not allow foreign journalists to independently enter Gaza. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "PM Harini calls for urgent action to tackle womens challenges and discrimination",
        "date": "March 23, 2025 06:37 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has emphasized the urgent need for prompt and decisive measures to address the challenges, barriers, and discriminatory practices encountered by women both domestically and globally. The Prime Minister made these remarks on Saturday (22) while addressing the International Womens Day celebration organized by the United Nations Association in Sri Lanka, held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. During the event, awards were presented in appreciation of women who have achieved significant accomplishments and earned societal recognition in different fields. Delivering the key note speech, the Prime Minister further stated: Equally all women including young female must be protected irrespective of their socio-economic status, educational background, religion, ethnicity, disability, or any other personal identity. Their fundamental rights must be safeguarded. Sri Lanka has a proud history of strong women who have contributed significantly to the development of the nation and I am well aware that many such remarkable individuals are present in this esteemed audience today. Women are driving transformational change by assuming leadership roles in politics, business, and social initiatives. The government has implemented different policies and programme to empower women. The 2024 Womens Empowerment Act has laid the foundation for new legal protections and the establishment of an Independent National Womens Commission leading a significant step toward institutionalizing gender equality. The government has prioritized increasing the participation of women in workforce by introducing entrepreneurship and digital financial literacy programme for rural women, along with establishing nine ministries for uplifting the economic level of women and the entire nation. Several initiatives were also incorporated into the recently approved budget. Nevertheless, female representation in leadership, decision-making, and economic participation remains disproportionately low. While efforts have been made to create opportunities in education, economic development, and healthcare for women and young female, it is imperative to acknowledge that there are much more remains to be done. Although the womens representation in Parliament has been doubled, it remains at approximately 10. A greater representation of women is essential in political spheres, decision-making, and leadership roles. Currently, womens participation in the formal workforce with pay is at 32, which is significantly lower compared to the male counterparts. Some individuals assert that achieving work-life balance is an unattainable goal for women, while simultaneously expecting them to manage all responsibilities. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not possible to do everything. What is truly required is the opportunity for women to pursue what they aspire to do, within families and a society that values and respect women. It is imperative to foster an environment that offers greater support for women. In this regard, recognizing and appreciating the caregiving responsibilities undertaken by unpaid women is essential. Gender-based violence and discrimination remain prevalent in society. Addressing these issues requires urgent legal and social reforms. The journey toward gender equality cannot be undertaken in isolation. As a nation committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5 on Gender Equality, it is essential to maintain strong global partnerships and take sincere steps toward the empowerment of women. In a rapidly evolving world, empowering women must go hand in hand with ensuring their active contribution to national development and the United Nations in Sri Lanka continues to serve as a valuable advisor and advocate for womens rights. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya reiterated the importance of implementing effective measures to identify and address the challenges, barriers, and discriminatory practices faced by women both locally and internationally, the statement added. The event was attended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, Vijitha Herath; Secretary-General to United Nations Association of Sri Lanka Mr. M.M. Rushaudeen; Assistant Secretary-General to United Nations Association of Sri Lanka Ms. Panchali Ratnayake; and several other distinguished guests.",

        "title": "Pope Francis returns to Vatican after five weeks in hospital",
        "date": "March 23, 2025 08:34 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis returned to the Vatican on Sunday after surviving a five-week battle in hospital against double pneumonia that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. The 88-year-old pope, who also made his first public appearance since February 14 before being discharged from Romes Gemelli hospital, left the facility shortly after noon. A car carrying the pontiff was accompanied by police vehicles through Rome, making a short detour to take flowers to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, a church to which Francis has a special devotion and visits frequently. Though the pope has returned from hospital, his doctors have said it would still take a lot of time for his ageing body to heal fully. They have prescribed a further two months of rest at the Vatican and told him to avoid large or stressful meetings, leaving unclear how much activity Francis will undertake in the coming months. Just before leaving the hospital on Sunday, Francis smiled and waved at a group of well-wishers gathered outside. He used a wheelchair, as he has done for several years. His face looked swollen and there were bandages visible on both arms underneath his white cassock during the appearance, which lasted only a few moments. He spoke briefly, with a feeble voice, to thank 79-year-old Carmela Vittoria Mancuso in the crowd below. Mancuso, who visited the hospital each day during the popes treatment, had brought yellow flowers for him. She told Reuters afterwards that her heart was bursting when the pope noticed her. Francis had only been seen by the public once before during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel. The pope, who has been receiving oxygen to help him breathe throughout his hospital stay, was breathing on his own during the public appearance. But he was seen using a small hose under his nose for oxygen while travelling in his car. In the moments before the pontiffs appearance on Sunday, the crowd of hundreds of well-wishers called out for him, chanting Francis, Francis, Francis. Thanks Doctors for Tireless Care Francis, pope since 2013, was first admitted to hospital for a bout of bronchitis that developed into double pneumonia, caused by what his doctors called a complex infection involving several microorganisms. During his 38 days in hospital, the pope suffered four acute episodes of what the Vatican called respiratory crises, which involved serious coughing fits caused by constrictions in his airways, akin to asthma attacks. Two of the crises were critical, putting Francis in danger of his life, Sergio Alfieri, the head of the popes medical team, told a press conference on Saturday. While Francis no longer has pneumonia, he is also not completely healed, the doctor said. Alfieri said it would also take time for him to regain full use of his voice, after battling a respiratory infection for so long. On Sunday, the Vatican released a brief text it said was prepared by Francis, in which he thanked his doctors for their tireless care. Many Catholics around the world had been praying for the popes recovery, and pilgrims at the Vatican on Sunday expressed relief at his leaving hospital. This discharge cheers us all up and gives us joy and hope, said Grazia Mara, an Italian. We wish him a safe return home and a speedy recovery. The pope had continued to lead the Church from hospital. He was making usual appointments of Catholic bishops around the world and also launched a new three-year reform process for the global institution. But a period of two months rest for Francis could lead to significant changes to the Vaticans calendar of coming events. The pope had been set to meet with Britains King Charles on April 8 and to lead the Vaticans annual Easter celebrations on April 20. The Vatican has not said whether Francis will be able to keep those appointments. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump looms over Canadas election as campaign begins",
        "date": "March 24, 2025 07:44 am",
        "content": "Canadas newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney has called a snap election, sending the country to the polls on 28 April. The election comes as Canada faces a trade war with the US and calls from President Donald Trump for it to become the 51st American state, issues which are expected to be top of mind for voters. It also comes nine days after Carney, a Liberal, was sworn in as Canadas prime minister following Justin Trudeaus resignation. Carney must now face Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party had been leading in national polls since mid-2023, though recent polls suggest the race is now neck-and-neck. Speaking in Ottawa on Sunday, Carney said he needed a clear, positive mandate to deal with Trump. We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trumps unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty, he said. The Liberals  once written off for this election - now have a chance of forming a government for the fourth consecutive time under Carney. Carney, 60, the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, has never served as an MP and is untested politically. Carney made the most of his short days in office, meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron and stopping in Canadas Arctic to announce a partnership with Australia to develop a new northern radar system. He also ended Trudeaus signature carbon tax climate policy, which had faced heavy criticism by the Conservatives. Now he will face the general electorate, which is concerned about Canadas rapidly shifting relationship with the US, its historically close ally, as well as the countrys high cost of living. In a campaign launch shortly before the election call, Conservative leader Poilievre, 45, sought to link Carney to the Liberals under Trudeau, who left office as a deeply unpopular leader. He called Trudeaus time in office a lost Liberal decade. He accused the party of weakening the country by blocking resource development, failing to fund the military, and mismanaging immigration and the economy, saying its post-national globalist ideology made Canada more vulnerable to Trumps trade war. President Trumps current and threatened tariffs on Canadian goods could usher in economic instability in the country and push Canada towards a recession. Trump placed 25 tariffs on Canadian goods on 2 March before partially pausing them for a month. On 12 March, a blanket 25 duty on all aluminium and steel imports went into effect, hitting Canadian importers. The Trump administration plans further global tariffs on 2 April, in the campaigns second week. Canada has retaliated so far with tariffs on about C60bn (42bn; 32bn) worth of US goods. Carney on Sunday called the trade war with the US one of the most significant threats of our lifetimes. Referring to Trump, he said: He wants to break us so America will own us. We will not let that happen. Carney has promised further retaliation, though he has conceded there is a limit to Canadas tariff response given the different size of the two economies. Poilievre said that Canada must respond firmly to threats from the White House. We have to convert our anger and our anxiety into action, he said. We have to become strong, self-reliant and sovereign to stand up to the Americans. The campaign will last just five weeks - the shortest allowed. Besides the US-Canada relationship, much of the focus will be on the economy, including cost-of-living issues. Who else is contesting? In the Canadian federal election, voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. Instead, the leader of the party with the most members of parliament traditionally becomes PM. Four main parties will contest the election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Québécois, who only run candidates in the French-speaking province of Quebec with a focus on their regional interests. The Green Party and the Peoples Party of Canada are also in the running. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said on Sunday that neither Carney nor Poilievre are the right choices for Canada, accusing them of protecting the wealthy, not ordinary Canadians. You deserve a prime minister you can trust to make decisions in your best interest, he said. The Bloc is facing pressure from a surge of support for the Liberals in Quebec. Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet pitched his party as a voice for industries in Trumps sights - from aluminium to dairy and lumber - that are all significant in the province. The Greens for the first time are running with co-leaders: Jonathan Pedneault and Elizabeth May. We must vote now as though our country depends on it, because more than ever before, it does, said Pedneault on Sunday. At dissolution of Parliament at the time the election was called, the Liberals held 153 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. The Bloc had 33 seats, the NDP had 24 and the Green Party held two. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 24, 2025 11:37 am",
        "content": "A lack of financial literacy is the primary reason many Sri Lankans fall victim to pyramid schemes, says the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. Speaking at an event aimed at educating the public on new financial technologies offered by CBSL-registered institutions, Dr. Weerasinghe emphasized the dangers of fraudulent investment schemes that exploit legal loopholes. Even if you have money in hand, there is a high chance of misusing it and falling prey to fraud due to a lack of financial literacy, he stated. Highlighting the growing prevalence of scams, particularly online, he warned against deceptive advertisements promising unrealistic returns. We see advertisements on the internet, emails offering discounts, and now large-scale promotions claiming you can earn massive profits by investing in agriculturewhether its growing trees, fruits, or even wallapatta Gyrinops walla. People are losing their money under the guise of investment, with funds ultimately funnelled into pyramid schemes or unauthorized deposits. So if they promise such large returns, the first thing you need to ask is how that crop provides such a huge benefit,  the CBSL Governor cautioned. Dr. Weerasinghe also underscored the need for financial education, particularly as Sri Lanka embraces digital financial services. One of the main drawbacks of digitalization is the lack of financial and economic literacy. When people do not fully understand financial transactions and economic activities, they become more vulnerable to wrongdoing. Therefore, while the Central Bank is promoting digitalization, we are also implementing a special program on financial literacy, he added.",

Joining Ada Deranas current affairs programme Hydepark recently, Wickremesinghe also expressed frustration over Sri Lankas uncertain stance on these projects, particularly in relation to its commitments under the 2023 Indo-Sri Lanka Vision Document. Most of the Indians I met recentlyit was embarrassing for me. I told them these projects were under consideration, but the truth is, I dont know whether they are still being considered or have been rejected, Wickremesinghe admitted. He warned that delays in these investments could damage Sri Lankas economic ties with India and deter other potential investors. Once India invests in us, others will follow. By 2050, India will be the worlds second-largest economy. We need growth, and the only way to achieve it is by working with other countries and creating an attractive environment for foreign investment, he stated. While acknowledging that Sri Lanka has reached a point of economic stabilization, Wickremesinghe stressed the need for long-term reforms. Right now, we are only stabilizingnothing more. To move ahead, we need major changes. We dont need to be poor. We can build a trillion-dollar economy, and we must go for it, he noted.

        "date": "March 24, 2025 12:47 pm",
        "content": "Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty, bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020. The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajputs father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajputs sister and doctor. The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said. Rheas lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case. Rajput was found dead 6 days after his PR manager Disha Salian fell off the 14th floor of a Malad tower and died. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14, 2020, six days after his PR manager Disha Salian died. Mumbai police, which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging. Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Dishas father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that those people responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy. The CBI FIR in Rajputs case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi. The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police, had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation. After Rajputs cremation at Vile Parles Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajputs girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none. Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists. Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case. The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning. An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau. In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajputs sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well. This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said. In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "date": "March 24, 2025 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Apple is reportedly developing an Apple Watch with built-in cameras as part of its broader push to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) more deeply across its hardware, according to Mark Gurmans latest newsletter published in Bloomberg. Apple is apparently targeting a 2027 release for the Apple Watch. Gurman reports that Apple is actively exploring ways to embed cameras in both its standard Series models and the rugged Ultra line. For the standard Series, the camera could be housed within the display itself, similar to the front-facing camera on the iPhone. However, for the Ultra model, Apple is said to be testing a design where the camera is positioned near the digital crown and side button â a location that offers more space and may make it easier for users to aim the device for scanning objects. The thickness of the two watches also differ quite a bit to enable different camera placements. The addition of cameras would work in tandem with Apple Intelligence, which was launched with iOS 18.1 last October. Apple Intelligence includes tools like Visual Intelligence that are designed to use your camera to identify objects and landmarks in the environment and deliver contextually relevant information. By giving the Apple Watch the ability to see its surroundings, Apple could significantly improve the functionality of these AI features, enabling users to interact with their environment in new ways. Apple has not officially commented on the report. Rumours about the Apple Watch sporting a camera arent new. In fact, one of the earliest reports that leaked about an Apple Watch with a built-in camera was back in 2015. At the time, Apple was believed to be working on integrating the camera into the second generation of the watch. Obviously that wasnt true, but a lot of that rumour aligns with the latest report by Mark Gurman. The 2015 report suggested that Apple Watch will integrate a FaceTime camera on the top bezel. At the time, AI on devices was still a far-fetched dream, so it was assumed that the camera would be used for placing and receiving video calls. Apple is reportedly also working to expand its AI ecosystem across other devices. Gurman previously reported in December that Apple is developing AirPods with infrared cameras, potentially launching by 2026. These sensors could allow for features such as hand gesture recognition and environmental awareness, particularly when paired with devices like the Apple Vision Pro headset. Apples move to bring AI hardware to the Apple Watch and AirPods is part of a wider ambition to reduce reliance on external AI services like OpenAIs ChatGPT and Googles AI models. The company reportedly plans to build out its proprietary AI tools â such as its Visual Intelligence platform â which it sees as central to the next generation of its devices. According to Gurman, Apple aims to integrate Visual Intelligence across its product range, making it a core part of future Apple Watches, AirPods, and other devices. However, much depends on the progress of Apples AI division, which is currently undergoing internal restructuring following a recent leadership shake-up. But if things stay on track, the rumoured Apple Watch with built-in camera and an AirPod with a camera are believed to hit the market by 2027. Source: India Today --Agencies",

        "date": "March 24, 2025 04:59 pm",
        "content": "The Sub-Committee of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has disclosed that Sri Lanka Youth Services (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of the National Youth Services Council, had registered as a supplier and submitted price quotations to the council itself at higher rates. The matter emerged at the COPE Sub-Committee meeting chaired by Member of Parliament Chandima Hettiarachchi, which met recently in Parliament to review the Auditor Generals reports for the years 2022 and 2023, the current performance, and the progress of implementing recommendations made during the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meetings held on February 18 and 20, 2025. During the meeting held, the Sub-Committee inquired officials regarding the recommendation given to former Chairman of the Council Pasindu Gunaratne to provide all video footage related to the Smart Youth program, including the musical concert held, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Officials informed the Committee that the relevant video footage had been handed over. The Committee extensively inquired regarding the payment of Rs. 120 million paid to the respective production entities for this purpose. It was disclosed that Sri Lanka Youth Services (Pvt) Ltd., a subsidiary of the National Youth Services Council, had obtained the contract at a higher cost and then outsourced the work to other institutions, the statement mentioned. Furthermore, although the former chairman stated that the Smart Youth program and exhibition had been conducted following a survey report, officials of the National Youth Services Council informed the Committee that no such report was available with them. The Chair of the Sub-Committee stated that a massive financial fraud had occurred in the conduct of the Smart Youth program. He instructed officials to conduct an independent investigation at the Ministerial level and submit a comprehensive report to the Sub-Committee within three months. He also directed the National Youth Services Council to conduct its own investigation and take legal action accordingly. Furthermore, the Committee discussed the issue of compensation payments to 40 officials who had faced complications due to political reasons. A Cabinet decision had been issued to appoint a committee of retired officials to handle these payments, but instead, three separate committees had been appointed by the council to grant compensation. The Sub-Committee instructed officials to submit a full report within two weeks, detailing the names of the officials who received compensation, the amounts paid, the dates of promotions, the dates of payments, the dates of approvals, and the names of officials who made the decisions. Moreover, the Committee extensively discussed a complaint regarding a diploma awarded by the National Youth Services Co-Operative Society Ltd (NYSCO). It was revealed that the Sri Lanka National Youth Services Council had no involvement in this diploma program operated by NYSCO. The Chairman of the National Youth Services Council further stated that NYSCO was no longer under the councils control, the statement highlighted. Additionally, it was disclosed that the age limit for selecting the General Manager of NYSCO, which was previously set at 35 years, had now been raised to 50 years. The Chair of the Sub-Committee emphasized that the National Youth Services Councils name should not be misused and directed the councils board of directors to investigate and take necessary actions. Furthermore, he instructed the Secretary to the Ministry to summon NYSCOs top officials for an inquiry and stated that the Sub-Committees recommendations on this matter would be forwarded to the Cooperative Commissioner for necessary action. The Sub-Committee also held extensive discussions on the submission of annual reports and financial statements of the National Youth Services Council and Sri Lanka Youth Services (Pvt) Ltd to Parliament within the stipulated timeframes, as well as the proper functioning of audit and management committees. The meeting was attended by Hon. Members of Parliament Samanmali Gunasinghe, Jagath Manuwarna, Asitha Niroshana Egoda Vithana, Lakmali Hemachandra, Attorney at Law, Auditor General W.P.C. Wickramaratne, and several other officials, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

In line with this directive, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) has confirmed that the vaccination requirement will also apply to Sri Lankan workers traveling to Bahrain. The vaccination program for Sri Lankans will be implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Bahrain, in collaboration with the State of Bahrain and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), following the instructions of Bahraini health authorities and the GCC, it said. Meningococcal disease is a serious infectious illness caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which can be fatal if left untreated. Meningitis and meningococcemia remain significant causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability in both developed and developing countries. The GCC guidelines emphasize the importance of meningococcal vaccination as a key component of their immunization strategy, particularly in regions with high numbers of migrant workers, to reduce the spread of the disease. This new vaccination requirement aligns with the broader public health objectives aimed at safeguarding the health of workers and preventing potential outbreaks. Bahrain has long been a popular employment destination for Sri Lankan migrant workers, with the demand continuing to grow. According to the Foreign Employment Bureau, over 4,000 Sri Lankan workers migrated to Bahrain in 2024.",

Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, David Lammy, said: The UK government is committed to human rights in Sri Lanka, including seeking accountability for human rights violations and abuses which took place during the civil war, and which continue to have an impact on communities today. I made a commitment during the election campaign to ensure those responsible are not allowed impunity. This decision ensures that those responsible for past human rights violations and abuses are held accountable. The UK government looks forward to working with the new Sri Lankan government to improve human rights in Sri Lanka, and welcomes their commitments on national unity. During her January visit to Sri Lanka, Minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West MP, held constructive discussions on human rights with Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, civil society organisations, as well as political leaders in the north of Sri Lanka. For communities to move forward together, there must be acknowledgement, and accountability for past wrongdoing, which the sanctions listings introduced today will support. We want all Sri Lanka communities to be able to grow and prosper, the FCDO statement said. The UK government said it remains committed to working constructively with the Sri Lankan Government on human rights improvements as well as their broader reform agenda including economic growth and stability. As part of our Plan for Change, the UK recognises that promoting stability overseas is good for our national security. The UK said it has long led international efforts to promote accountability in Sri Lanka alongside partners in the Core Group on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council, which includes Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. The UK also said it has supported Sri Lankas economic reform through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, supporting debt restructuring as a member of Sri Lankas Official Creditor Committee and providing technical assistance to Sri Lankas Inland Revenue Department. The UK and Sri Lanka share strong cultural, economic and people to people ties, including through our educational systems. The UK has widened educational access in Sri Lanka through the British Council on English language training and work on transnational education to offer internationally accredited qualifications.",

        "title": "Israeli strikes kill scores in Gaza as Egypt offers new ceasefire proposal",
        "date": "March 24, 2025 11:58 pm",
        "content": "Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed more than 65 Palestinians over the past day, including women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. In less than a week of air and ground operations since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas, its forces have killed hundreds of people in Gaza  sending the death toll from 17 months of war soaring above 50,000. Meanwhile, officials say Egypt has introduced a new proposal to try and get the ceasefire back on track. Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza and a weekslong pause in the fighting, an Egyptian official said Monday. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A Hamas official said the group had responded positively to the proposal, without elaborating. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks. Heres the latest: Israel says it intercepts rockets fired from Gaza Two rockets were intercepted after crossing into Israeli territory next to the Gaza Strip, setting off air raid sirens on Monday evening, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, claimed responsibility for firing a barrage of rockets toward the area of southern Israel bordering Gaza. Militants in Gaza have fired a handful of rockets at Israel in the days since it broke the ceasefire, which have been intercepted or fell in open areas. Islamic Jihad is the smaller of Gazas two main Palestinian militant groups. Israeli strike kills 5 people, including 2 women An Israeli strike killed at least five people including two women in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the Health Ministrys emergency service said. The strike Monday afternoon hit a house in the Qisan al-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis, it said. UN says it will reduce its footprint in Gaza after a deadly Israeli strike on its compound and the cutoff of aid The United Nations said Monday it will reduce its footprint in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds, killing one staffer and wounding five others last week. Israel has denied it was behind the March 19 explosion at the U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza. In a statement Monday, U.N. Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said that based on the information currently available, the strikes on the site were caused by an Israeli tank. The Israeli military did not immediately comment. Dujarric also said the U.N. would be cutting back about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers in Gaza. He said the U.N. is not leaving Gaza, pointing out that it still has about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. The U.N. has made taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organizations footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar, he said. The move comes as Israel has cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gazas around 2 million people for more than three weeks. EU says resuming talks on the Gaza ceasefire is the only way forward Violence feeds more violence, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday at a briefing in Jerusalem, where she met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, less than a week after Israel broke the ceasefire in Gaza. What we are witnessing now is a dangerous escalation. It is causing unbearable uncertainty for the hostages and their families and is likewise causing horror and death for the Palestinian people, she added. Saar said the war can end tomorrow with releasing our hostages, the demilitarization of Gaza and the withdrawal of the armed Hamas and Islamic Jihad forces. Strike damages a Red Cross office in southern Gaza The building was hit by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement decrying the attack Monday. No staff members were hurt, but damage to the office in Rafah has a direct impact on the ICRCs ability to operate at a time when the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah is treating casualties from the war, the statement said. The ICRC statement did not say who mightve been responsible for attacking their office. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Israeli forces have been advancing into Rafah in recent days. Israeli strikes kill 2 journalists in Gaza, including a contributor to Al Jazeera Qatars Al Jazeera satellite news network says one of its Palestinian freelance reporters, Hossam Shabat, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his car in northern Gaza. Shabat was killed Monday while covering the war for the broadcasters Arabic-language TV channel, the network said. He had been wounded by an Israeli strike last November, the network reported at the time. Another Palestinian journalist was killed in a separate Israeli airstrike earlier Monday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Mohammed Mansour was a correspondent for the news website Palestine Today. Al Jazeera is one of the few international media outlets to remain in Gaza throughout the war. The channel is owned by Qatar, which alongside Egypt and the U.S. has been a key negotiator for the ceasefire. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike that killed Shabat. Israel has accused other Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.

        "content": "The government has decided to revise the tariff paid per unit of electricity generated by rooftop solar panels, with the proposed rates set to vary based on the scale of energy production. According to the Ministry of Energy, a cabinet paper outlining these amendments has been submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers, following recommendations from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The revision aims to adjust the existing payment structure for solar power generation, aligning it with current energy policies and market conditions. At present, solar energy producers receive Rs. 27 per unit of electricity supplied to the grid. Under the proposed changes, this rate is expected to be reduced, with payments determined by the capacity of the solar system: Rs. 19 per unit for solar systems generating less than 20 kilowatts (kW) Rs. 17 per unit for systems producing between 20 kW and 100 kW Rs. 15 per unit for larger systems generating between 100 kW and 500 kW The Ministry of Energy clarified that these new tariff rates will apply only to newly installed rooftop solar systems, while existing installations will continue to receive payments at the current rate.",

As a result, vehicle prices in the market are expected to remain unchanged this year, he said. Hulangamuwa made these remarks while joining TV Deranas current affairs program 360 last night (24). Addressing a question about the forecasted importation of vehicles worth around one billion US dollars this year, Hulangamuwa provided insights into the expected revenue in rupees. We anticipate revenue between 300 to 350 billion rupees. With the current economic growth, we are taking a wait-and-see approach regarding vehicle imports. If anyone expects a tax reduction, it will not happen this year. Our agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) clearly states that vehicle taxes cannot be reduced this year, he explained. Hulangamuwa also commented on speculation regarding his potential appointment as the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. When asked whether he would be the next Finance Secretary, he responded, That decision lies with the President. He further clarified that there had been no formal discussions between himself, the President, or the Ministry of Finance regarding his suitability for the position. If the President invites me to take up the position, I would need to carefully consider my decision. I have been with EY Sri Lanka for four years, and there are commitments and expectations there as well.

As of Sunday night, nearly 9,000 firefighters, police and civil servants and 120 helicopters had been dispatched to five areas to fight the fires. By Monday morning, firefighters facing the additional challenge of dry and windy conditions had quashed all but four of the blazes. A spark from a lawn mower started the first wildfire, which ignited Friday afternoon in Sancheong, South Gyeongsang province, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of the capital Seoul, according to an Interior Safety Ministry situation report.

        "date": "March 25, 2025 09:46 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa has strongly condemned the UKs decision to impose sanctions on senior Sri Lankan military figures who played a pivotal role in defeating terrorism. Calling the move a result of relentless LTTE-backed lobbying, Rajapaksa accused Western politicians of undermining Sri Lankas reconciliation process for political gain. In a pointed challenge to the government, he questioned President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the ruling administrations response to the sanctions. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), he demanded to know whether the government would stand by Sri Lankas war heroes when foreign powers attack those who secured peace for Sri Lanka or remain silent in the face of foreign pressure. Sri Lanka was the first nation to fully defeat terrorism, yet the West continues to selectively target our war veterans while ignoring those who funded and justified LTTE brutality. The latest UK sanctions arent about human rightstheyre the result of relentless LTTE-backed lobbying, manipulating foreign governments to act against those who brought lasting peace, he noted. Furthermore, Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa stated on his X post that This is not justice; some Western politicians are enjoying the perks of lobbying money, putting our nations reconciliation at risk. People from both the North and South must understand that the freedom we enjoy today comes from tough decisions. These sanctions will lower the morale of our forces, and if another crisis arises, they may lack the courage to fight if we dont support them now. Rajapaksa mentioned that those behind these sanctions dont care about the safety of the Tamil communitythey are only creating more problems and further jeopardizing reconciliation, adding that their real goal is to disrupt the progress made, especially as Tamil communities in the North and East now have a clear path to vote for national parties. We will never allow anyone to hamper reconciliation between communities, he said. I want to reiterate once againthe war was against terrorism, not against any ethnic group. I urge the Tamil community not to fall for the agenda of certain Tamil politicians who receive perks to fuel divisions between communities through certain INGOs. MP Rajapaksa questioned the government of their response, stating, AnuraKumara VijithaHerathYour government came to power with support from those who have always undermined our militarys sacrifices. Will you defend them now when foreign powers attack those who secured peace for Sri Lanka, or will you stay silent? We will always protect our war veteransnow and forever. Their sacrifices secured our peace, and we will never allow anyone to undermine their legacy, he signed off.",

        "date": "March 25, 2025 10:49 am",
        "content": "It has been revealed at the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) that due to the failure to charge the prescribed fees for the registration of 296 motorcycles falling under the engine capacity category of 201 to 450cc, the government has incurred a loss of Rs. 78.15 million, the Parliamentary Communications Department stated in a statement. Additionally, it has been disclosed that 3,088 motorcycles had been registered without Cabinet approval and without the necessary legal documentation required for registration. This issue was discussed during a recent meeting of COPA, chaired by Member of Parliament Aravinda Senaratne, held on March 21 at Parliament. The discussion focused on the Auditor Generals reports for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, pertaining to the Department of Motor Traffic and its current performance, according to the statement. Although the Department of Motor Traffic had previously been summoned before the Committee on 10.03.2025 to discuss these concerns, it was sent back due to a lack of proper preparation. Furthermore, COPA inquired into the implementation of recommendations issued during its meetings held in 2019. A detailed discussion took place regarding 25 points presented by the Auditor General concerning illegal vehicle registrations that had occurred before the integration of the Sri Lanka Customs computer system. The investigations conducted on this matter and the disciplinary actions taken against the responsible officials by the Department of Motor Traffic were also reviewed. During this discussion, the committee strongly criticized the departments failure to take disciplinary action against the responsible officials. It was emphasized that the reports submitted in this regard were entirely unsatisfactory, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. As a result, the Chairman recommended that immediate disciplinary measures be taken and that an independent team of officials be appointed to conduct the necessary investigations. COPA also addressed fraudulent vehicle registration certificates issued by incorporating the engine and chassis numbers of illegally imported vehicles into pre-existing registered vehicle numbers. It was revealed that this had resulted in a loss of Rs. 1.2 billion to the government. Additionally, the committee examined the fraudulent issuance of vehicle registration certificates for unused vacant registration numbers by the Department of Motor Traffic, which had caused a loss of Rs. 6.2 million to the government. Moreover, the misuse of diplomatic vehicle registration numbers to register other vehicles had led to a financial loss of Rs. 122 million. The Auditor General emphasized the importance of making the public aware of these issues, it added. Following an inquiry into the corruption, fraud, and irregularities within the Department of Motor Traffic, the committee recommended that disciplinary actions be taken against all responsible officials and that the progress of these actions be reviewed monthly. It was also recommended that the relevant legal enforcement authorities take the necessary steps to implement the law regarding any criminal activities that had taken place. The meeting was attended by committee members, including Deputy Ministers Major General (Retd.) Aruna Jayasekera, Sugath Tilakaratne, Sundaralingam Pradeep, Nalin Hewage, and Members of Parliament J.C.

        "title": "iPhone 17: What to expect from new series in September",
        "date": "March 25, 2025 10:54 am",
        "content": "The next-generation iPhone series is expected to introduce significant upgrades beyond the usual annual Apple Silicon refresh and iOS update. The Pro models in the anticipated iPhone 17 line-up are likely to undergo a major redesign, both in terms of internal hardware and external appearance. Below are the key changes expected for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models. iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: What to expect Design and construction According to a report by MacRumors, Apple may shift away from the titanium frame design used in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 Pro models. Instead, this years Pro models could feature a new part-aluminium, part-glass construction. Additionally, Apple is expected to revamp the rear camera module with a raised rectangular glass section extending across the top of the device. This design change could reposition the flash and LiDAR sensor to the right side while retaining the existing triangular triple-camera arrangement. The iPhone 17 Pro models are also expected to introduce an improved anti-reflective coating on the display. This enhancement aims to reduce glare and improve resistance to scratches. Apple Silicon and performance upgrade The iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to be powered by the next-generation A19 Pro chipset, built on TSMCs (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) new 3nm process. This chip is anticipated to deliver improved performance and efficiency over the A18 Pro, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models. Additionally, Apple is expected to increase RAM capacity to better support Apple Intelligence features and on-device AI processing. To enhance thermal management, Apple is reportedly making internal design modifications across the iPhone 17 line-up. The Pro models, in particular, may include a vapour chamber cooling system for improved heat dissipation. Apple is also expected to introduce its in-house Wi-Fi 7 chip with the iPhone 17 series, potentially replacing the Broadcom chip used in current-generation models. Camera upgrade Significant improvements are expected in the camera system of the iPhone 17 Pro models. The telephoto camera is rumoured to feature a 48MP sensor, a notable upgrade from the 12MP sensor on the iPhone 16 Pro models. Additionally, the front-facing camera is expected to feature a new 24MP sensor, doubling the resolution of the existing 12MP front camera. iOS 19 According to Bloomberg, Apple is planning a significant software revamp with its next major iOS release. Reportedly codenamed Luck, iOS 19 is expected to adopt design elements from visionOS, the operating system powering the Vision Pro headset. This update may introduce refreshed app icons, a more streamlined navigation experience, and improved consistency across Apple devices. Additionally, new Apple Intelligence features could be integrated into the operating system. Bigger battery The iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to be slightly thicker than their predecessors, which could allow for a larger battery capacity. Source: The Business Standard --Agencies",

        "title": "Oscar-winning Palestinian director attacked by Israeli settlers and detained by army",
        "date": "March 25, 2025 11:53 am",
        "content": "Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary film  No Other Land  on Monday in the occupied West Bank before he was detained by the Israeli military, according to two of his fellow directors and other witnesses. The filmmaker Hamdan Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya, according to attorney Lea Tsemel. Police told her theyre being held at a military base for medical treatment and she said she hasnt been able to speak with them. Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers  some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform  attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones. We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us, Adra told The Associated Press. This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment. The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a violent confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians  a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed. The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment. No Other Land, which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor. The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary. Adra said that settlers entered the village Monday evening shortly after residents broke the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A settler  who according to Adra frequently attacks the village  walked over to Ballals home with the military, and soldiers shot in the air. Ballals wife heard her husband being beaten outside and scream Im dying, according to Adra. Adra then saw the soldiers lead Ballal, handcuffed and blindfolded, from his home into a military vehicle. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said Ballals blood was still splattered on the ground outside his own front door. Some of the details of Adras account were backed up by another eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. A group of 10-20 masked settlers with stones and sticks also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, smashing their car windows and slashing tires to make them flee the area, one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the AP. Video provided by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards  and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time. During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Source: AP --Agencies",

He mentioned that Bangladesh has already placed orders for this purpose. The CPC Chairman, while addressing a function of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Employees Union, further added, Until now, our lubricant oil industry had completely collapsed. I am happy to say that we have been able to double our production during this period. I am also pleased to announce that production will reach its maximum in two months. During that time, we will begin exporting CEYPETCO lubricants abroad. We have already received an order from Bangladesh. Rajakaruna further noted that the CPC has now collaborated with airlines on the supply of aviation fuel and reduced the cost to below that of the region. He added that as a result, the aviation fuel trade is now increasing at a faster rate than last year. Regarding the issue of employees annual bonuses, Rajakaruna explained, There is a current issue regarding whether or not the bonuses can be given. I have no intention of halting the bonus, but there are laws and circulars that need to be followed. I have looked into how we can give the bonuses in accordance with those regulations. Approval from the Treasury is required, and it also needs to be submitted to the Cabinet. We are working on the necessary processes to carry out that procedure. Unfortunately, we cannot complete it within this month. Additionally, the CPC chairman reassured the employees that the bonus payments will not be halted. He clarified that although they couldnt provide the bonus this month, the New Year allowance of Rs. 50,000 would be provided as a temporary solution.",

        "date": "March 25, 2025 01:46 pm",
        "content": "Saturns iconic rings have mysteriously vanished from sight this week, leaving stargazers in awe. This rare celestial illusion is the result of a fascinating astronomical phenomenon. Every 13 to 15 years, Saturns rings align precisely with our line of sight from Earth, making them almost invisible. This rare event, called a ring plane crossing, started showing on Sunday, 23 March, at 12:04 p.m. EDT (1604 GMT) when Earth moved through Saturns ring plane, according to In-the-Sky.org. Why does Saturns ring become invisible? The phenomenon occurs because Saturn maintains a 26.7-degree axial tilt. As it orbits the Sun over its 29.4-year cycle, the rings appear to change orientation. At times, Saturns rings are angled in a way that gives us a clear view of them, while at other times, they align edge-on with Earth. When this happens, the rings either become nearly invisible or appear as a thin line across the planets surface. The rings will reappear after March 2025, and due to Saturns axial tilt, they will disappear again in November 2025. Its rings will come back into full view by 2032. The Saturn ring stretches 170,000 miles across (273,600 kilometres), they are only about 30 feet (10 metres) thick, making them appear thin and wispy when viewed from any angle. Saturns Rings Saturns rings have been a topic of discussion among astronomers for centuries. The origin theories range from the remnants of a destroyed moon or comet torn apart by Saturns gravity to material leftover from the planets formation over 4 billion years ago. Saturns rings are primarily made of ice particles, rocky debris, and cosmic dust, presenting a spectacular view from Earth with a telescope. The ring particles change greatly in size from tiny sand-like grains to massive chunks as large as houses or school buses. Source: Business Standard --Agencies",

        "title": "White House mistakenly shares Yemen war plans with a journalist",
        "date": "March 25, 2025 03:05 pm",
        "content": "Top Trump administration officials mistakenly disclosed war plans in a messaging group that included a journalist shortly before the U.S. attacked Yemens Iran-aligned Houthis, the White House said on Monday, following a first-hand account by The Atlantic. Democratic lawmakers swiftly blasted the misstep, saying it was a breach of U.S. national security and a violation of law that must be investigated by Congress. The Atlantics editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the Houthi PC small group. In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a tiger team to coordinate U.S. action against the Houthis. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic. U.S. President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemens Houthis on March 15 over the groups attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he warned Iran, the Houthis main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. Hours before those attacks started, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing, Goldberg said. His report omitted the details but Goldberg termed it a shockingly reckless use of a Signal chat. Accounts that appeared to represent Vice President JD Vance, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and senior National Security Council officials were assembled in the chat group, Goldberg wrote. Joe Kent, Trumps nominee for National Counterterrorism Center director, was apparently on the Signal chain despite not yet being Senate-confirmed. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. I dont know anything about it. Im not a big fan of The Atlantic, Trump said. A White House official said later that an investigation was under way and Trump had been briefed on it. The NSCs Hughes said in a statement: At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security. Hegseth denied sharing war plans in the group chat. Nobody was texting war plans, and thats all I have to say about that, he told reporters while on an official trip to Hawaii on Monday. Goldberg responded to Hegseths denial in an interview on CNN late on Monday by saying, No, thats a lie. He was texting war plans. European Free-Loading According to screenshots of the chat reported by The Atlantic, officials in the group debated whether the U.S. should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether U.S. allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved U.S. help. PeteHegseth if you think we should do it lets go, a person identified as Vance wrote. I just hate bailing Europe out again, the person wrote, adding: Lets just make sure our messaging is tight here. A person identified as Hegseth replied: VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. Its PATHETIC. The Atlantic reported that the person identified as Vance also raised concerns about the timing of the strikes, and said there was a strong argument in favor of delaying them by a month. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. Theres a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices, the account wrote, before saying he was willing to support the groups consensus. Yemen, Houthi-ally Iran and the European Unions diplomatic service did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Under U.S. law, it can be a crime to mishandle, misuse or abuse classified information, though it is unclear whether those provisions might have been breached in this case. Messages that The Atlantic report said were set by Waltz to disappear from the Signal app after a period of time also raise questions about possible violations of federal record-keeping laws. As part of a Trump administration effort to chase down leaks by officials to journalists unrelated to the Signal group, Gabbard posted on X on March 14 that any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such. On Tuesday, Gabbard is due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on worldwide threats to the United States. Created by the entrepreneur Moxie Marlinspike, Signal has gone from an exotic messaging app used by privacy-conscious dissidents to the unofficial whisper network of Washington officialdom. Signal does not use U.S. government encryption and is not hosted on government servers. Democratic lawmakers called the use of the Signal group illegal and demanded an investigation. This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, adding that he would ask Majority Leader John Thune to investigate. Were just finding out about it. But obviously, weve got to run it to ground and figure out what went on there. Well have a plan, said Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. There was no immediate suggestion from the White House that the breach would lead to any staffing changes. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Reuters. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X the use of Signal to discuss highly sensitive national security issues was blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief. Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime  even if accidentally  that would normally involve a jail sentence, Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on X.

        "content": "The Colombo High Court has sentenced a 59-year-old individual to 15 years of rigorous imprisonment for sexually abusing a nine-year-old underage girl. High Court Judge Navaratne Marasinghe delivered the verdict following the conclusion of the trial. In addition to this, the judge imposed a fine of Rs. 75,000 on the accused and ordered that if the fine is not paid, the accused will be sentenced to an additional one-year term of lenient imprisonment. Furthermore, the accused was ordered to pay Rs. 300,000 in compensation to the victim. The judge also stated that if the compensation is not paid, the accused will face an additional one-year lenient prison term. A 59-year-old mobile vegetable vendor was sentenced by the court in this manner. During the trial, it was revealed that the accused had sexually abused a 9-year-old schoolgirl in 2011 after befriending her by giving chocolates and sweets. Delivering the verdict, the judge described the incident as a very serious incident. The judge pointed out that the evidence presented by the victim was consistent with the findings of the judicial medical officer. Stating that such incidents are not tolerated by a civilized society, the judge emphasized that they are acts fundamentally incompatible with humanity. Accordingly, the judge asserted that such reprehensible acts cannot be dealt with lightly, and as a result, the accused is being sentenced to 15 years of rigorous imprisonment.",
