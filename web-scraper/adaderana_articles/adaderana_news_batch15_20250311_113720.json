        "title": "Driver in fatal New Orleans truck ramming may not have acted alone, had Islamic State flag",
        "date": "January 2, 2025 09:43 am",
        "content": "A US Army veteran with an Islamic State flag on his truck swerved around makeshift barriers and ploughed into New Orleans crowded French Quarter on New Years Day, killing 15 people in an attack officials believe was carried out with the help of others. The suspect, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a US citizen from Texas who once served in Afghanistan, was killed in a shootout with police after ramming the crowd. The attack injured about 30 other people, including two police officers wounded by gunfire from the suspect. It took place around 3.15 am (5.15pm, Singapore time), near the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets, a historic tourist destination known for its music and bars where crowds were celebrating the new year. Police and political leaders vowed to capture any accomplices. With the perceived danger ongoing, officials postponed the Sugar Bowl, a classic college football game played in New Orleans each year on New Years Day. The game between Notre Dame and Georgia was put off for 24 hours until Thursday night as police swept parts of the city looking for possible explosive devices and converged on neighbourhoods in search of clues. The city will also host the NFL Super Bowl on Feb 9. The FBI said that police found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle and that two potential explosive devices were found in the French Quarter and rendered safe. An ISIS flag was attached to the trailer hitch of the rented vehicle, prompting an investigation into possible links to terrorist organisations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE: FBI We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible. We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan told reporters. Asked how many potential accomplices the FBI was looking into, she said it was a range of suspects and urged anyone who had contact with Jabbar in the previous 72 hours to contact authorities. CNN and the Associated Press had reported that surveillance video captured three men and a woman placing an improvised explosive device in the French Quarter, but the law enforcement sources they cited later backed off that conclusion, saying it was unclear what the people in the video had done. The FBI, which is the lead investigator on the case, also said it and the Harris County Sheriffs Office were conducting an operation in a north Houston neighbourhood in an area matching one of Jabbars known residences. US President Joe Biden condemned what he called a despicable act and said investigators were looking into whether there might be a link to a Tesla truck fire outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas. So far, there was no evidence linking the two events, Biden said. The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social media indicating that hes inspired by ISIS, expressing the desire to kill, Biden said of the New Orleans suspect. CNN, citing officials briefed on the investigation, said the suspect recorded videos in which he mentioned dreams about joining ISIS. Officials told CNN the suspect, obscured by darkness in the videos, spoke about his divorce and plans to gather his family for a celebration with the intent of killing them. He later changed his plans and said that he joined ISIS, CNN said. ISIS - often called Islamic State or ISIL - is a Muslim militant group that once imposed a reign of terror over millions of people in Iraq and Syria until it collapsed following a sustained military campaign by a US-led coalition. Javed Ali, an associate professor of practice at the University of Michigans Gerald R Ford School of Public Policy, said such car attacks are tactics long encouraged by Islamic State leadership to sow fear and panic. By 2015, there was guidance from senior ISIS figures for people around the world who believe in the ISIS ideology to basically use any means at their disposal to conduct attacks, he told CNAs Asia First. After those messages were sent out, we started to see vehicle ramming attacks all over Europe. Fast forward to New Years Day 2025 in New Orleans, its a replay of the similar messages we heard almost a decade ago from ISIS leaders. Public records show Jabbar worked in real estate in Houston. In a promotional video posted four years ago, Jabbar describes himself as born and reared in Beaumont, a city about 130km east of Houston, and saying he spent 10 years in the US military as a human resources and IT specialist. Jabbar was in the regular Army from March 2007 until January 2015 and then in the Army Reserve from January 2015 until July 2020, an Army spokesperson said. He deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010 and held the rank of Staff Sergeant at the end of service. SCREAMING AND DEBRIS Mike and Kimberly Stricklin of Mobile, Alabama, said they were in New Orleans for a bluegrass concert and heading back to their hotel just 20m from where the truck made impact with some pedestrians. There were people everywhere, Kimberly Strickland said in an interview. You just heard this squeal and the rev of the engine and this huge loud impact and then the people screaming and debris - just metal - the sound of crunching metal and bodies. About 400 officers were on duty in the French Quarter at the time of the incident, including a number of officers who had established a makeshift barrier to prevent anyone from driving into the pedestrian zone, police said. This is not just an act of terrorism, this is evil, Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters. She said the two wounded police officers are in stable condition. In response to vehicle attacks on pedestrian malls around the world, New Orleans was in the process of removing and replacing the steel barriers known as bollards that restrict vehicle traffic in the Bourbon Street area. Construction began in November and was due to be completed in time for the Super Bowl, officials said. In the meantime, police vehicles and officers attempted to provide a barrier, Kirkpatrick said. This particular terrorist drove around, onto the sidewalk and got around the hard target, Kirkpatrick said. Jon Alterman, Middle East expert at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies, said ISIS, though diminished in the field, has long attempted to radicalise people online, with only occasional success. It doesnt take a huge operation to find individuals in personal distress and give them a sense that their life can have some greater meaning, he said in an email. While mass shootings are more commonly a threat in the United States, vehicle rammings have been used to kill civilians in the US and around the world. Last month in Germany, a 50-year-old man was charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder after police said he ploughed a car through crowds at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing five people and injuring scores.

        "content": "At least 10 people, including two children, were killed and four others were seriously wounded on Wednesday in a shooting rampage that followed a bar brawl in a western Montenegrin city, officials said. The shooter was on the run. Police identified the attacker as 45-year-old Aco Martinovic. He killed the owner of the bar in the city of Cetinje, the bar owners children and his own family members, Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic said at a news conference. At this moment, we are focused on arresting him, Saranovic told reporters. Police dispatched special troops to search for the attacker in Cetinje, located some 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. All the roads in and out of the city have been blocked as police swarmed the streets. Saranovic described the suspect as dangerous and appealed on the residents to stay indoors. The level of rage and brutality shows that sometimes such people ... are even more dangerous than members of organized criminal gangs, Saranovic said. Martinovic was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted, said Police Commissioner Lazar Scepanovic. He said that Martinovic then went home, brough back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. He killed four people at the bar, before heading out and then continued shooting at three more locations, said Scepanovic. He tried to take the lives of four more people, and then fled with the vehicle he was using, which we have found. He said that the suspect received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and has appealed his latest conviction for illegal possession of weapons. Montenegrin media have reported he was known for erratic and violent behavior. Small Montenegro, which has some 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. Wednesdays shooting was the second shooting rampage over the past three years in Cetinje, Montenegros historic capital. An attacker also killed 10 people, including two children, in August 2022 before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje. President Jakov Milatovic said he was shocked and stunned by the tragedy. Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives, Milatovic said on the social media platform X. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic went to the hospital where the wounded were being treated and announced three days of mourning. He said all police teams were out searching for the suspect. This is a terrible tragedy that has affected us all, Spajic said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The first and only Bone Marrow and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Unit in a government hospital for children with cancer in Sri Lanka was inaugurated at the Apeksha Cancer Hospital in Maharagama today (Jan. 02). This landmark achievement was made possible through the financial support of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya and the dedicated labor contribution of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). The inauguration ceremony was graced by the Minister of Health and Mass Media, Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Commander of the Air Force Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, and the Basnayake Nilame of the Kataragama Devalaya, Dishan Gunasekara. The project began in response to the increasing need for space for children receiving residential treatment at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital. In 2023, the Basnayake Nilame of Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya pledged financial resources from the Kataragama Devalaya Fund for the project. The initial plan, sponsored by the Sri Lanka Air Force, aimed to build a three-story ward complex. However, with the labor contributions of the Air Force, the project expanded to a four-story complex, which was completed and opened to the public in 2024. The newly established transplant unit occupies the third and fourth floors of the complex, providing advanced care for children battling cancer. This unit represents a beacon of hope for families who previously had limited treatment options. The Commander of the Air Force has vowed to ensuring the long-term maintenance of the facility, underscoring the Air Forces continued support for this vital initiative.",

        "title": "Education qualifications alone wont fix governance - Dilith calls for fresh perspectives in politics",
        "date": "January 2, 2025 01:01 pm",
        "content": "The Sarvajana Balaya Member of Parliament Dilith Jayaweera underscored the urgency for innovation, creativity, and strategic planning in terms of both governance and economic stability in order to provide pragmatic solutions to the countrys deep-rooted issues. Joining Ada Deranas current affairs programme State of the Nation, MP Jayaweera argued that while political leadership may change, the fundamental challenges of governance and national strategy remain constant. He noted that the key to overcoming these challenges lies in fostering motivation, creativity, and a strategic vision that aligns with the nations long-term goals, while underscoring the importance of creativity in politics and decision-making. Jayaweera began by acknowledging the educational background of many of the current Parliamentarians, particularly those who were elected with the promise of bringing a fresh perspective to the nations politics. It is the quality of the parliament that we should talk. This, as they call it historic, I dont see it being very historic, other than the building being historic. Its 169 MPs come from one single party. I have seen them, to be in the parliament. I see an issue. They said to bring in the fresh faces to the parliament irrespective of their experience, but their main trust was the education. The doctors, the professors, the lawyers, the engineers, and they were promoting them always with their title - the engineer, the professor, the doctor during the campaign. However, Jayaweera argued that education alone does not guarantee effective governance. He remarked that while he, as a lawyer, might possess qualifications, it is his experience in business, management, and entrepreneurship that equips him with a different perspective on governance. Now I see them. Actually, Im sure, all of them, in conventional sense, theyre educated. Though some of them, try to over claim their educational qualifications, more or less, they are educated. But this the point, parliament is not a place where you need so called educated people only. Either the basic thing of the democracy is that its a representation of the people. Whether they actually represent the ground, you know, the representation of the ground universally, it means something else. A critical issue, according to Jayaweera, is the tendency of politicians to view problems from conventional perspectives. He explained, If you look at a problem from the same perspective as others, even 225 people in the parliament will not be able to offer different solutions. Jayaweera pointed out that despite the promise of change by the current government, many of the same excuses and rhetoric from previous parliaments are still being used. The excuses we hear now are no different from the ones used in past parliaments. The rhetoric of we cant change things overnight and were not magicians is what weve been hearing for years, he noted. The Sarvajana Balaya Parliamentarian also lamented the lack of creativity and imagination among the current parliamentarians, particularly those who were touted as reformists. His expectations were high, given their academic credentials, but he expressed disappointment with the reality. I thought that people like university professors and others in positions of power would bring fresh ideas. Instead, they lack imagination to this extent, he said. He further emphasized that without creative solutions, the country would continue to face the same challenges without making meaningful progress. Citing Albert Einsteins famous definition of insanitydoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different resultsJayaweera argued that the country cannot afford to keep repeating the same approaches to governance. If we dont think differently, well be stuck in the same place, facing the same problems without any real solutions, he warned. He also highlighted the disconnect between the governments promises and the practical realities of governance. For example, the current administrations promises to reduce electricity bills by 30, lower oil prices, and reduce VAT from 18 to 12 were ambitious but lacked clear financial planning and implementation strategies. Jayaweera pointed out that these promises, while popular with the electorate, ignored the fundamental principle of managing a countrys finances. In a business sense, you cant promise cuts without knowing where the revenue will come from, he explained, emphasizing the importance of a clear, practical financial plan in delivering on such promises. Jayaweera reiterated the importance of creative leadership in overcoming Sri Lankas economic and social challenges. We need to think differently if we are to move forward, he asserted. The problems we facefood security, energy, unemploymentare universal, but it is how we approach them that will determine if we succeed. He also raised concerns about the current governments approach to dealing with issues like the rice shortage. The promise to not import rice, only to import it later, exemplified a lack of foresight and strategic planning. One promise that they gave us that they were not going to import rice. Thats I think among the promises that they gave, the worst and the silliest one is that because no government can say that. Because you dont know for sure, he added. Furthermore, he went on to highlight the broader social consequences of ineffective governance, particularly the sense of hopelessness that is spreading among the people. As Sri Lankans lose faith in their leaders, they also lose their motivation to contribute to the nations progress. This erosion of hope affects all sectorsagriculture, construction, public service, healthcare, and beyond. A nation without hope and belief cannot progress, Jayaweera argued, stressing that without addressing this widespread despair, no amount of policy change will make a difference.

Speaking during an event held yesterday (Jan.1), he also explained that the government faced a serious crisis in the past due to the inability to collect tax revenue. He further added that businessmen who use their own money for welfare activities should be praised. Only when successful businessmen contribute their fair share of tax can society truly benefit. However, we have experienced a significant tragedy in the past due to the inability to collect these taxes, he stated. Referring to the countrys financial struggles, the MP continued, Everyone knows that our treasury was nearly depleted. During that time, the President made a strong effort to provide school books and uniforms to children. Yet, when this matter was raised in Parliament, it was met with distractions and chaos. This brought the entire Parliament into a very poor situation. If the members of Parliament had not acted with great discipline at that time, these books and uniforms would not have been provided to the children this year. In such a situation, when the government was trying to provide school uniforms and books to children, we should commend a private businessman from Biyagama for sacrificing his personal wealth for social needs, he added.",

The import of salt will take place under two phases, where 20,000 Metric Tonnes of salt will be imported under the first phase and 10,000 Metric Tonnes of salt will be imported to the island under its second phase. Accordingly, the tenders will be opened for the import of 20,000 Metric Tonnes of salt from tomorrow. Meanwhile, it was reported that the imported salt will be distributed under the supervision of the Ministry of Industries and that the imported salt will only be utilised for the industrial purposes. On December 19, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the import of up to 30,000 metric tons of non-iodized salt by the State Trading Corporation to address the ongoing salt shortage in the market. Recently, the Chairman of Lanka Salt Company in Hambantota, T. Nandana Thilaka urged the public to avoid panic-buying and hoarding salt amidst rumors of a shortage, reassuring the public that the Hambantota Lanka Salt Company currently has 6,000 metric tons of salt in stock, sufficient to last until January. However, the chairman announced that development activities for the Jaffna salt pans are set to commence by mid-January, with production expected to begin by March 2025. Earlier in December last year, the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development launched an investigation into a reported decline in salt production within the country. The salt production companies had submitted reports indicating a 40 drop in output over the past two years, citing adverse weather conditions as the primary cause. It was reported that the decline has already impacted the availability of salt locally.",

        "content": "At least one person was killed and seven wounded when a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside a hotel belonging to US President-elect Donald Trump in Las Vegas, police said Wednesday. The electric vehicle pulled up to the Trump International Hotels glass entrance before a large explosion, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters. Video footage shows the stainless steel truck parked at the hotel entrance before bursting into flames, followed by smaller explosions that appeared similar to fireworks. McMahill said there was one deceased individual inside the Cybertruck while seven people received minor injuries. He said the hotel had been evacuated. US President Joe Biden said authorities were investigating any possible link between the blast and an attack earlier Wednesday in New Orleans, in which a truck rammed a crowd, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens. Thus far, theres nothing to report on that score, Biden said. FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz described the Las Vegas blast as an isolated incident, adding: We do not believe that theres a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this. Tesla chief Elon Musk said that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks andor a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck, adding in a post on X that it was unrelated to the vehicle itself. Earlier, he said the whole Tesla senior team was investigating the blast, adding: Weve never seen anything like this. Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the explosion. US media including NBC and CBS reported that authorities were investigating it as a potential terror attack, citing unnamed sources. There had been indications that the suspect in the New Orleans attack had been inspired by the Islamic State group, Biden said. McMahill said that so far they had no indication that the blast in Las Vegas had any similar links to the Islamic State group. However, he added, Its a Tesla truck, and we know Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and its the Trump tower. So theres obviously things to be concerned about there and thats something we continue to look at. Musk, who backed Trump in the November election and was named by the Republican to head up a commission to trim government spending, said he would post more information as soon as we learn anything.

Matara Prison Superintendent Mangala Weliwita said that the decision was prompted by the limited space in the Matara Prison and the need to manage the aftermath of the accident. Meanwhile, the prison authorities have ensured heightened security at the prison following the incident, with the police and Police Special Task Force (STF) providing external security, while officers from the Galle and Matara prisons are overseeing internal security. Despite the tragic event, Weliwita confirmed that regular prison activities are continuing as usual. An unfortunate incident occurred at the Matara Prison on January 1, when a branch of a Bo tree fell, causing significant damage to two prison wards, G and F. The accident resulted in one inmates death and left 11 others injured, with one inmate reported to be in serious condition. The deceased, identified as a resident of the Midigama Turki village, was incarcerated for failing to pay a Rs. 20,000 fine related to drug trafficking. The injured inmates have been transported to the Matara General Hospital for treatment, where they are receiving medical care for their injuries. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, as prison officials work to address the damage caused and prevent further mishaps in the future.",

Dr. Jayatissa revealed this today (02), while speaking at the inauguration of the first and only bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cell transplant unit in a government hospital, established at the Apeksha Cancer Hospital in Maharagama. This was made possible through the financial support of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya and the dedicated labor contribution of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF). The Ministry of Health is usually a place where any government will provide funds if asked. More funds are allocated from the Treasury every year to the Health Ministry than even the Kataragama Deviyo. But this year, the highest amount of funds ever allocated for the Ministry of Health in history will be set aside in the budget, the Minister noted. The Minister highlighted the ongoing support the Ministry receives, both locally and internationally, to further strengthen the health sector, stating, The Ministry of Health is backed not only by local tycoons but also by foreign and international institutions at times. What we aim to do is systematically and strategically deploy all these provisions, he explained. Furthermore, Dr. Jayatissa emphasized that the development initiatives would no longer be driven by political considerations. From now on, we cannot cater to anyones sentimental desires based on political expediency. We are implementing these developments as part of a national plan that spans the next 20 years, he affirmed. While acknowledging that many NPP Members of Parliament may have aspirations to upgrade their local hospitals, the Minister stressed the importance of aligning those ambitions with national priorities. The first and only Bone Marrow and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Unit in a government hospital in Sri Lanka for children with cancer was inaugurated at the Apeksha Cancer Hospital in Maharagama today (Jan. 02).",

        "date": "January 2, 2025 04:14 pm",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence has been reshaping the way rewrite and search for things on the internet, but it looks like Meta may have another use for the technology. According to a recent report by the Financial Times, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company might bring AI bots on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The report states that to retain its user base and attract a younger audience, the company will roll out a bunch of new AI products, including one that helps users create AI characters on both Instagram and Facebook. Connor Hayes, the vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta told the publication that they expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do. He went on to say that just like our profiles, these AI bots will have bios and profile pictures and will be even able to generate and share content powered by AI. As it turns out, Meta will be developing the AI-generated characters using AI Studio. For those not in the loop, Metas AI Studio allows users to create an AI character based on their interests and even create an AI extension of themselves. While the product is currently limited to the United States, Meta plans to expand its availability sometime this year. While the decision may not be welcome by the majority of social media users, it does have its fair share of advantages. For example, if someone shares fake news on Facebook, an AI bot could help flag it and warn others that the information shared is false. However, the opposite could be true as well.

        "date": "January 2, 2025 04:33 pm",
        "content": "Actor Blake Lively sued It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Livelys suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign. The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media. Livelys suit said that Baldoni, the films production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out. She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a multi-tiered plan to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits. The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively. The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath discussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life. Baldonis attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Livelys lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious. Livelys lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least 250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. Others who are defendants in Livelys suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: We Can Bury Anyone: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine. Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit. The libel lawsuit says the newspaper relied almost entirely on Livelys unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care. A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error, the statement said. But Baldonis lawsuit says that If the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign. Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Livelys California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today. The romantic drama It Ends With Us, an adaptation of Colleen Hoovers bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a 50 million debut. But the movies release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for Deadpool  Wolverine at the same time. Lively came to fame through the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and bolstered her stardom on the TV series Gossip Girl from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including The Town and The Shallows. Baldoni starred in the TV comedy Jane the Virgin, directed the 2019 film Five Feet Apart and wrote Man Enough, a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that It Ends With Us romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were absolutely entitled to that opinion. He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds. Baldonis attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that the New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful untouchable Hollywood elites. In doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Livelys self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public, he added. The irony is rich. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has announced new restrictions on marketing food and beverages to children, effective January 1, 2025, under the Food (Labelling  Advertising) Regulations 2022. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, through its Food  Beverage Steering Committee, was a key partner in shaping these regulations by providing inputs on food science, nutrition, international regulatory practices, and legal frameworks during an over decade-long consultation process with the Ministry of Health. Under the new rules, the industry must ensure that children under 12 are not featured in advertisements for FB products. Further, the industry must ensure that FB products are not advertised or promoted to children below 12 years without prior approval from the Ministry of Health. Additionally, updated food labelling requirements, effective July 1, 2025, will empower consumers with essential information, including nutritional values and detailed ingredient lists, to make informed food choices, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce stated in a statement. These updates address gaps in the regulations established in 2005 and align the framework with international standards, it said. Mr. Buwanekabahu Perera, CEO of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, stated: We commend the Ministry of Health for modernising Sri Lankas food regulatory framework after 20 years. Transitioning entrenched industry practices will be challenging for businesses, from SMEs to large-scale operators. However, it is vital to balance consumer protection with the continued availability of packaged food, and preserving longstanding brand equity. A corrective and collaborative approach to implementing these regulations will be important to ensure a smooth transition.",

        "date": "January 3, 2025 07:45 am",
        "content": "Two people were killed and 18 injured when a small plane crashed through the rooftop of a commercial building in Southern California on Thursday, police said. Police got a report at 2:09 p.m. about the crash in the Orange County city of Fullerton, said Kristy Wells, a Fullerton police spokesperson. Firefighters and police arrived on scene and battled a blaze that broke out, and evacuated surrounding businesses, Wells said. The fire damaged the warehouse, which appeared to contain sewing machines and textile stock. The building was occupied by Michael Nicholas Designs, a furniture upholstery manufacturer, according to a sign on a door. Ten people were taken to the hospital, while eight were treated and released at the scene, police said. There were two confirmed deaths, according to Wells. It was not immediately known what type of plane it was or whether those injured were in the aircraft or on the ground, Wells said. The flight-tracking website FlightAware shows a four-seat, single-engine aircraft crashed about a minute after takeoff. Security camera footage from Rucci Forge, a wheel manufacturer across the street, shows a fiery explosion and a large plume of black smoke as the plane appeared to dive into the building tilted on its side. The plane crashed near the Fullerton Municipal Airport, a general aviation airport in Orange County that is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Disneyland. It has one runway and one heliport. Metrolink, a regional train line, is nearby, and flanks a residential neighborhood and commercial warehouse buildings. Another four-seat plane crashed into a tree a half-mile from the airport last November while making an emergency landing right after it had taken off, the Orange County Register reported. Both people on board suffered moderate injuries. Fullerton is a city of about 140,000 people some 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "January 3, 2025 08:33 am",
        "content": "On an index measuring religion-related hostilities for 2022, India scored the highest among 198 nations, according to a report recently published by the Pew Research Center. A higher score on the social hostilities index (SHI) indicates greater levels of religion-related harassment, mob violence, terrorism, militant activity, and conflicts over religious conversions or the use of religious symbols and attire. India scored 9.3 on a scale of 10 on the SHI. Scores above 7.2 are considered very high. The report also assessed countries based on the governments restrictions on religion, using the government restrictions index (GRI).The GRI measures laws, policies, and actions that regulate or limit religious beliefs and practices. These include policies banning particular beliefs or practices, the unequal granting of benefits to certain religious groups, and bureaucratic rules requiring religious groups to register to access benefits. India had a high GRI score of 6.4 out of 10 in 2022. Scores above 6.6 are classified as very high. Many of these countries experienced religion-related wars, militant activity or ongoing sectarian violence. For example, sectarian tensions and violence have been reported in multiple years during this period in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Iraq, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Thailand and Yemen, the report indicated Also in this category are a handful of countries in South Asia that, for many years, have had religion-related violence by nongovernmental actors while also having high or very high government restrictions. India and Pakistan, for example, have had high or very high GRI and SHI scores every year since the study began in 2007, while Bangladesh has had high or very high scores in most years, it highlighted. Only 12 (25 countries) had high or very high GRI scores and SHI scores in 2022: India, Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt, Afghanistan, Israel, Libya, Palestinian territories, Ukraine, Bangladesh, France, Jordan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Tunisia, Indonesia, Yemen, Laos, Nepal, Algeria, Maldives, and Armenia. In about 62 of the countries, including Canada and South Korea, the GRI and SHI scores were low or moderate. In 16 of the countries, the GRI was very high or high, but the SHI was low or moderate; these include Cuba and China. In 10 of countries, the GRI was low or moderate, but the SHI was high or very high. These include Brazil and the Philippines. The number of countries with high or very high GHI scores rose to 59 (30 of 198 countries) in 2022 from 55 in 2021. In 2007, when the index was started, only 40 nations (20) had high or very high scores. The number of countries with high or very high SHI scores rose to 45 (23 of all countries analysed) in 2022 from 43 countries in 2021. In 2012, 65 countries had high or very high scores  the highest share (33). The report said that government restrictions and social hostilities often align closely, i.e., the lower the score on one index, the lower the score on the other too generally, and vice-versa. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "China faces new virus outbreak five years after Covid Crisis",
        "date": "January 3, 2025 09:56 am",
        "content": "China is dealing with an outbreak of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), five years after the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports and social media posts suggest that the virus is spreading rapidly, with some claiming that hospitals and crematories are overwhelmed. Videos shared online show crowded hospitals, with some users saying that multiple viruses, including influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19, are circulating. There are even claims that China has declared a state of emergency, though this has not been confirmed. HMPV is known to cause flu-like symptoms and can also present symptoms similar to Covid-19. Health officials are closely monitoring the situation as the virus spreads. A social media post by an X handle known as SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) wrote in a post: China is facing a surge in multiple viruses, including Influenza A, HMPV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Covid-19, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums. Childrens hospitals are particularly strained by rising pneumonia and white lung cases. Meanwhile, a news report by Reuters has said that Chinas disease control authority said on Friday that it was piloting a monitoring system for pneumonia of unknown origin, with cases of some respiratory diseases expected to rise through the winter. The move to establish a dedicated system is aimed at helping authorities set up protocols to handle unknown pathogens, in contrast to the lower level of preparedness five years ago when the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 first emerged. The National Disease Control and Prevention Administration will establish a procedure for laboratories to report and for disease control and prevention agencies to verify and handle cases, state broadcaster CCTV reported, quoting an administration official at a news conference. Data for acute respiratory diseases showed an upward trend in overall infections in the week of December 16 to 22, according to an official statement released on Thursday. China is likely to be affected by various respiratory infectious diseases in winter and spring, Kan Biao, another official, said at the news conference. He said without elaborating that the overall number of cases this year would be smaller than last year. Recent cases detected include pathogens such as the rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, with cases of the human metapneumovirus among people under the age of 14 showing an upward trend, especially in northern provinces. In a recent interview with the state-backed National Business Daily, a respiratory expert at a Shanghai hospital warned the public against blindly using antiviral drugs to fight human metapneumovirus, for which there is no vaccine but whose symptoms resemble those of a cold.

On average, around 25,000 to 30,000 individuals reportedly seek human rabies vaccines from across the Uva Province. In addition to this, hospital records also reveal that foreign tourists, particularly those bitten by toque macaque monkeys and dogs in the Ella area, have also sought medical treatment at the Badulla Teaching Hospital.

        "date": "January 3, 2025 04:22 pm",
        "content": "Apple agreed to pay 95 million in cash to settle a proposed class action lawsuit claiming that its voice-activated Siri assistant violated users privacy. A preliminary settlement was filed on Tuesday night in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Mobile device owners complained that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri unintentionally, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Voice assistants typically react when people use hot words such as Hey, Siri. Two plaintiffs said their mentions of Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants triggered ads for those products. Another said he got ads for a brand name surgical treatment after discussing it, he thought privately, with his doctor. The class period runs from Sept. 17, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2024. It began when Siri incorporated the Hey, Siri feature that allegedly led to the unauthorized recordings. Class members, estimated in the tens of millions, may receive up to 20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones and Apple Watches. Apple denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The Cupertino, California-based company and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests. They may seek up to 28.5 million in fees, plus 1.1 million for expenses, from the settlement fund. The 95 million is about nine hours of profit for Apple, whose was 93.74 billion in its latest fiscal year. A similar lawsuit on behalf of users of Googles Voice Assistant is pending in the San Jose, California federal court, in the same district as the Oakland court. The plaintiffs are represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case. The case is Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-04577.

        "date": "January 3, 2025 07:22 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas presidential guards and military troops prevented the authorities from arresting impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Jan 3 in a tense six-hour stand-off inside his compound in the heart of Seoul. Mr Yoon is under criminal investigation for insurrection over his Dec 3 martial law bid that stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant being issued for a sitting president. It was judged that it was virtually impossible to execute the arrest warrant due to the ongoing stand-off, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) said in a statement. The CIO officials and police evaded hundreds of Mr Yoons supporters who gathered in the pre-dawn hours near his residence on Jan 3, vowing to block the arrest with our lives. Some chanted President Yoon Suk Yeol will be protected by the people, and called for the head of the CIO to be arrested. Officials from the CIO, which is leading a joint team of investigators looking into possible insurrection charges related to Mr Yoons brief declaration of martial law, had arrived at the gates of the presidential compound in central Seoul shortly after 7am local time (6am Singapore time), and entered on foot. Once inside the compound, the CIO officials and police were outnumbered by cordons of Presidential Security Service (PSS) personnel, as well as military troops seconded to presidential security, a CIO official told reporters. More than 200 PSS agents and soldiers formed several layers of human chains to block the CIO officials and police, the official added. While there were altercations and PSS agents appeared to be carrying firearms, no weapons were drawn in the stand-off, the official said. Mr Yoon, who has been isolated since he was impeached and suspended from power on Dec 14, was not seen during the stand-off, the official added. The Defence Ministry said the troops were under the control of the PSS. The CIO called off the effort to arrest Mr Yoon around 1.30pm due to concerns over the safety of its personnel, and said it deeply regretted his non-compliance. The CIO said it would consider its next steps. The police, who are part of the joint investigation team, have designated the PSS chief and deputy as suspects in a criminal case for obstruction of official duty and issued summonses for them to appear for questioning on Jan 4, Yonhap news reported. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. Mr Yoons arrest warrant, approved by a court on Dec 31 after he ignored multiple summonses to appear for questioning, is valid until Jan 6. In a statement after the arrest effort was suspended, Mr Yoons legal team said the CIO had no authority to investigate insurrection, and that it was regrettable that it had tried to execute an illegal warrant in a sensitive security area. The statement warned police against supporting the arrest effort. The presidential office filed a criminal complaint against three broadcasters and YouTube channel owners for unauthorised filming of the presidential residence, which it said was a secured facility directly linked to national security. The current warrant gives investigators only 48 hours to hold Mr Yoon after he is arrested. Investigators must then decide whether to request a detention warrant or release him. Korea University law professor Kim Seon-taek said targeting the PSS leadership may allow the investigators to sap the services ability to put up resistance so they can try again to execute the warrant, which is a rough way to proceed. A better way, he said, would be for Acting President Choi Sang-mok to exercise his power to order the PSS to cooperate. Later on Jan 3, the CIO said it would ask Mr Choi to give that order. Surprise martial law Mr Yoon sent shock waves through Asias fourth-largest economy and one of the regions most vibrant democracies with a late-night announcement on Dec 3 that he was imposing martial law to overcome political deadlock and root out anti-state forces. Within hours, however, 190 lawmakers had defied the cordons of troops and police to vote against his order. About six hours after his initial decree, Mr Yoon rescinded it. He later issued a defiant defence of his decision, saying domestic political opponents are sympathetic to North Korea and citing uncorroborated claims of election tampering. Two South Korean military officials, including army chief Park An-su who was named martial law commander during the short-lived declaration in December, have been indicted on insurrection charges, Yonhap reported on Jan 3. Kim Yong-hyun, who resigned as Mr Yoons defence minister after playing a major role in the martial law decree, has been detained, and was indicted last week on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. Separate from the criminal investigation, Mr Yoons impeachment case is before the Constitutional Court to decide whether to reinstate or permanently remove him. A second hearing in that case was held on Jan 3, and the court set the first oral arguments for Jan 14. Mr Bae Jin-han, one of the lawyers for Mr Yoon, told reporters that Mr Yoon may not appear for the first arguments but will likely do so at a future hearing to argue his position. North Koreas state media published a detailed report on the political turmoil in the South, including the arrest warrant issued for Mr Yoon, who it said stubbornly refuses to be investigated, totally denying his crimes with sheer lies.

        "date": "January 3, 2025 10:08 pm",
        "content": "Israeli strikes killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including children, overnight and into Friday, hospital staff said, as often-stalled ceasefire talks to end the Israel-Hamas war were set to resume in Qatar. Sirens sounded across Israel for missiles fired from Yemen. Staff at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said that more than a dozen women and children were killed in strikes in central Gaza, including in Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al-Balah. Dozens of people were killed across the enclave the previous day, bringing the total killed in the past 24 hours to 56. We woke up to the missile strike. We found the whole house disintegrated, Abdul Rahman Al-Nabrisi said in the Maghazi refugee camp. The Israeli army said in a statement Friday that during the past day, it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. The army asserted that measures were taken to mitigate civilian harm, such as using aerial surveillance. And it issued a warning for people to leave an area of central Gaza immediately, saying it would attack following launches from there toward Israel. The military said that a few projectiles entered Israel from central and northern Gaza, with no injuries reported. Freelance journalist Omar al-Derawi was among those killed on Friday. Associated Press reporters saw friends and colleagues mourning over his body, with a press vest laid on his shroud. The Committee to Protect Journalists said last month that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel hasnt allowed foreign journalists to enter Gaza except on military embeds. Israelis also woke up to attacks. Israel said that missiles were fired into the country from Yemen, setting off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel and sending people scrambling to shelters. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Israels army said that a missile was intercepted. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen often claim responsibility. Efforts at ceasefire negotiations were expected to resume Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office has said that he authorized a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar. The delegation was leaving for Qatar on Friday. The U.S.-led talks have repeatedly stalled during nearly 15 months of war. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. But the militants, while greatly weakened, have repeatedly regrouped, often after Israeli forces withdraw from areas. The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israels offensive in retaliation has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territorys Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry doesnt distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. Israels military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90 of Gazas population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump must be sentenced in hush money case, judge signals no jail",
        "date": "January 4, 2025 10:13 am",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on Jan. 10 in the criminal case in which he was convicted on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star, but is unlikely to face jail time or other penalties, a judge said on Friday. Justice Juan Merchans ruling means Trump will be required to appear at a court hearing just 10 days before his Jan. 20 inauguration - an unprecedented scenario in U.S. history. Before Trump, no U.S. president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime. The judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually. He wrote that he was not inclined to sentence Trump to jail, and that a sentence of unconditional discharge - meaning no custody, monetary fine, or probation - would be the most viable solution. The imposition of the sentence would pave the way for Trump to appeal. Merchan acknowledged in his ruling that Trump has made clear he intends to appeal. In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said there should be no sentencing in the case. This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed, Cheung said. Merchan announced his plan for the sentencing in denying Trumps motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory. Trumps defense lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern. Merchan rejected that argument, writing that setting aside the jurys verdict would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways. Defendants status as President-elect does not require the drastic and rare application of (the courts) authority to grant the (dismissal) motion, Merchan wrote in the decision. Merchan also rejected Trumps argument in a Dec. 3 court filing that dismissal was warranted because his civic and financial contributions to this city and the Nation are too numerous to count. While acknowledging Trumps service as president, the judge said Trumps public statements excoriating the justice system were also a factor for him in determining how Trumps character would factor into the decision. Merchan criticized what he called Trumps unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks against the integrity of the criminal proceeding, and noted that he had found him guilty of 10 counts of contempt during the trial for repeatedly violating an order restricting out-of-court statements about witnesses and others. Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole, Merchan wrote. Defendants character and history vis-a-vis the Rule of Law and the Third Branch of government must be analyzed, the judge said, referring to the judiciary. In that vein, it does not weigh in his favor. EXTREME REMEDY The case stemmed from a 130,000 payment that Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The payment was for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it. A Manhattan jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment. He had pleaded not guilty and called the case an attempt by Manhattan District Attorney Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor who brought the charges, to harm his 2024 campaign. Trumps sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, 2024, but has been pushed back several times. On Thursday, Merchan said Trumps request in August that the sentencing be pushed back until after the election implied that he consented to being sentenced during the transition period. Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendants victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous, Merchan wrote. Bragg did not oppose delaying the sentencing until after the election. Merchan in September pushed it back to Nov. 26. After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election, the judge delayed the sentencing indefinitely to figure out next steps. Braggs office had argued there were measures short of the extreme remedy of overturning the jurys verdict that could assuage Trumps concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president, such as delaying the sentence until after Trump leaves the White House in 2029. Merchan wrote on Thursday he found that alternative less desirable than sentencing Trump before the inauguration. PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY Trump on Dec. 16 lost a separate bid to toss the hush money conviction in light of the U.S. Supreme Courts July 1 decision that presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted over their official actions, and that evidence of their official actions cannot be presented in criminal cases over personal conduct. In denying Trumps motion to dismiss, Merchan said the prosecution over decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison, but incarceration is not required. Before his election victory, legal experts said it was unlikely Trump would be locked up due to his lack of a criminal history and advanced age. Trump was charged in three other state and federal criminal cases in 2023: one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. He pleaded not guilty in all three cases. The Justice Department moved to dismiss the two federal cases after Trumps election victory. Trumps state criminal case in Georgia over charges stemming from his effort to overturn his 2020 election loss in that state is in limbo. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Seasonal spikes are expected, particularly as people reacclimate to common pathogens after Covid-19 lockdowns.

Tomiko Itooka died in a nursing home in the city of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, according to officials. She became the oldest person in the world after Spains Maria Branyas Morera passed away in August 2024 at age 117. Ms Itooka gave us courage and hope through her long life, Ashiyas 27-year-old mayor Ryosuke Takashima said in a statement. We thank her for it. Ms Itooka was born in May 1908  six years before the World War One and the same year that the Ford Model T car was launched in the US. She was verified as the worlds oldest person in September 2024 and was presented with the official GWR certificate on the Respect for the Aged Day, which is a Japanese public holiday celebrated annually to honour the countrys elderly citizens. Ms Itooka, who was one of three siblings, lived through world wars and pandemics as well as technological breakthroughs. As a student, she played volleyball and climbed the 3,067-metre (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice.

        "title": "Russia vows retaliation after saying it downed eight US-made long-range missiles",
        "date": "January 4, 2025 09:34 pm",
        "content": "Russia has vowed retaliation after claiming to have shot down eight US-made ATACMS missiles fired by Ukraine on Saturday morning. Moscow sees the use of such missiles, which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), as a major escalation. The countrys air defenses shot down the eight ballistic missiles alongside 72 aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Russias Ministry of Defense said. It added that these actions by the Kyiv regime, which is supported by Western curators, will be met with retaliation. The statement said several drones were destroyed in the Leningrad region in the north-west and one in Kursk, where Ukraine launched a surprise attack late last summer. The outgoing US President Joe Biden approved Kyivs use of ATACMS in November  saying in part it was in response to Russia expanding the conflict by deploying North Korean troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to respond to Ukrainian strikes using ATACMS with Russias new nuclear-capable ballistic missile Oreshnik. Last month, Putin suggested that it could be fired at the capital Kyiv as a test of Western-supplied air defense systems. The first and only launch of the experimental weapon targeted Ukraines Dnipro region on the morning of November 21. The Ukrainian drone attacks forced temporary restrictions to be introduced at an airport in St. Petersburg, Russian state media agency TASS reported. The governor of Leningrad oblast, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said in a statement on Telegram that the night and morning of January 4 were record-breaking in terms of the number of UAVs destroyed, with four shot down over his region. A Ukrainian security official, Andrii Kovalenko, said a seaport in Leningrad was targeted, calling it an instrument of economic and military survival for Russia in isolation. Meanwhile, Russia launched a total of 81 drones at Ukraine overnight on Friday into Saturday, according to Ukraines Air Force Command, including Iranian-made Shahed drones and various types of imitation drones. Some 34 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones were downed, according to a statement, although the downed drones caused damage in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. Ukraine enters the year on the back foot in the conflict, which began with in February 2022, with Russian making gains on the eastern frontlines. Russias defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had taken control of the village of Nadiya in Ukraines eastern Luhansk region. In Donetsk, the hub of Pokrovsk is under growing Russian pressure as Ukrainian forces lose ground to the south and east of the town. Ukraine is also concerned that the incoming Trump administration could cut vital military aid; Trump himself has vowed to end the conflict. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 4, 2025 10:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is poised to make a significant leap in its tourism industry, aiming for 3 million tourist arrivals in 2025. This ambitious target comes on the heels of a projected 2.1 million visitors in 2024 as the nation steadily recovers from the economic challenges it faced in recent years. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), under the leadership of its newly appointed chairman, Buddhika Hewawasam, is spearheading several reforms and initiatives to strengthen the sector and attract more international visitors. A Unified Vision for Tourism Growth To streamline and enhance the industrys operations, a National Tourism Commission is being established. This new governing body will consolidate four state agencies currently overseeing tourism, including a hotel school. The commission will ensure cohesive policy implementation and foster industry growth. Additionally, a Tourism Policy Formulation Council comprising experts from diverse fields will be set up to provide strategic guidance and support to the sector. Hewawasam announced these initiatives at the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards ceremony, held in Colombo on December 27, marking the awards revival after a five-year hiatus. The event celebrated excellence in the tourism sector, with honors for the best resort and tourism service providers. Economic targets and revenue growth Sri Lankas government has set a goal of generating 5 billion in tourism revenue by 2025, providing much-needed foreign exchange for the recovering economy. Tourism revenue surged from 1.1 billion in 2022 to 2.1 billion in 2023. For the period between January and November 2024, revenue reached 2.8 billion, up from 1.8 billion during the same period in 2023. Tourist arrivals have shown a consistent upward trend. From January to November 2024, Sri Lanka welcomed 1.8 million visitors, compared to 1.3 million during the same period in 2023. The year-end target for 2024 is set at over 2 million arrivals, with key source markets including India, Russia, the UK, Germany, and China. Leveraging Sri Lankas rich heritage At the tourism awards ceremony, PATA CEO Noor Ahmad highlighted Sri Lankas unique identity as a destination steeped in history and culture. He emphasized the countrys compelling legends, ancient kingdoms, and vibrant Buddhist festivals, which form the backbone of its tourism appeal. Sri Lankas iconic landmarks, such as the Nine Arch Bridge and Sigiriya Rock Fortress, continue to draw travelers from around the globe. The islands lush landscapes, pristine beaches, and warm hospitality further enhance its reputation as a must-visit destination. Overcoming challenges to drive recovery The tourism sector was severely impacted by the dual crises of the Covid-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic downturn. These challenges forced the government to seek financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund and implement debt restructuring measures. Today, Sri Lanka is on a steady path to recovery, with tourism positioned as a cornerstone of its economic revival. To support the sectors growth, the government is enhancing infrastructure, simplifying visa processes, and fostering international collaborations. Plans to develop a direct air route with Japan, a key partner, exemplify these efforts. Such initiatives aim to open new markets and boost tourist exchanges between the two nations. Aiming for sustainable tourism development Sri Lanka is also prioritizing sustainability in its tourism strategies. The countrys natural beauty and cultural heritage are central to its appeal, and efforts are being made to preserve these assets for future generations. Promoting eco-tourism and responsible travel practices will be integral to achieving long-term growth. Building on key attractions Sri Lankas tourism offerings cater to a wide range of interests, including: Historical Landmarks: Sites like Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa showcase the countrys rich cultural heritage. Natural Wonders: From the lush tea plantations of Nuwara Eliya to the wildlife-rich Yala National Park, Sri Lanka offers diverse experiences for nature enthusiasts. Beach Destinations: Coastal hotspots like Bentota, Mirissa, and Arugam Bay are popular for relaxation and water sports. Adventure Tourism: Activities like trekking in the Knuckles Mountain Range and surfing in Weligama attract thrill-seekers. Looking ahead to 2025 The ambitious goal of 3 million tourist arrivals and 5 billion in revenue reflects Sri Lankas commitment to reclaiming its position as a leading travel destination. With policy reforms, infrastructure development, and international partnerships, the country is well-positioned for success. By leveraging its unique cultural identity, breathtaking landscapes, and strategic location, Sri Lanka aims to attract travelers seeking authentic and memorable experiences. As the nation continues to rebuild and innovate, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for Sri Lankas tourism industry. Source: TTW --Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2025 10:47 am",
        "content": "The US Department of State has notified Congress of a planned 8bn (6.4bn) arms sale to Israel, an American official has confirmed to the BBC. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells and other munitions. The move comes just over a fortnight before President Joe Biden leaves office. Washington has rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed during the war in Gaza. In August, the US approved the sale of 20bn in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel. The latest planned shipment contains air-to-air missiles, Hellfire missiles, artillery shells and bombs, the US official said. A source familiar with the sale told the BBC on Saturday: The president has made clear Israel has a right to defend its citizens, consistent with international law and international humanitarian law, and to deter aggression from Iran and its proxy organisations. We will continue to provide the capabilities necessary for Israels defence. Biden has often described US support for Israel as iron-clad. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69 of Israels imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023. In May 2024, the US confirmed it had paused a single consignment of 2,000lb and 500lb bombs over concerns Israel was going ahead with a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. But Biden immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Netanyahu who appeared to compare it to an arms embargo. Biden has since partially lifted the suspension and not repeated it. The planned shipment is one of a number of steps taken by the Biden administration in recent weeks, as the outgoing president attempts to shore up his legacy. It will likely also be the last planned weapons sale to Israel before he leaves the White House on 20 January 2025, when his successor Donald Trump is inaugurated. The president-elect has previously spoken of ending foreign conflicts, and of reducing US involvement, including during his re-election bid. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, but has urged the American ally to finish its military operation in Gaza quickly. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the groups unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 45,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Golden Globes kicks off the awards party tonight",
        "date": "January 5, 2025 12:03 pm",
        "content": "Angelina Jolie, Adrien Brody, Timothee Chalamet, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are some of the stars in the running for acting awards at this years Golden Globes, which take place in LA later today. While the Oscars bestows the film industrys highest honours, the Golden Globes is the ceremony that gets the awards season party started. Emilia Perez, which stars Selena Gomez and tells the story of a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, leads the nominations with 10, while postwar epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody, has seven, and papal thriller Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, has six. After surpassing Mamma Mia earlier this week to become the highest-grossing film ever adapted from a Broadway musical, Wicked has four nods - and seems certain to follow in the perfectly arched footsteps of Barbie by clinching the prize for cinematic and box office achievement. The Golden Globes also celebrates TV - with The Bear, Shogun, Only Murders In The Building, Baby Reindeer, The Penguin and Monsters among the big nominees. This years ceremony takes place in Los Angeles later today, so youll have to stay up late if you plan to follow in the UK. Ahead of the show, here are a few things to look out for. Musicals lead the way All singing, often dancing - it seems the world has really been holding space for musicals over the past 12 months. Operatic musical Emilia Perez comfortably has the most nominations of all the films in the running, while Wicked, starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, has been the most talked about film of the year (not least because of the viral press tour). Both Erivo and Grande are nominated in acting categories - for Grande, it is her first Golden Globe nod for her performance as Glinda, and she competes in the best supporting female actor in a motion picture category against fellow pop star Gomez and Zoe Saldana, who also stars in Emilia Perez. Erivo is up for the award for best female actor in a motion picture musical or comedy, alongside Zendaya for romantic sports film Challengers, Karla Sofia Gascon for Emilia Perez, Demi Moore for The Substance, Amy Adams for Nightbitch, and a breakout performance from Mikey Madison for Anora, a film about a young sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. Surprise surprise Last years nominations were led by Greta Gerwigs Barbie and Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer, the latter of which went on to win pretty much every award going, including best picture at the Oscars. While the Barbenheimer buzz was fun for a while, Oppenheimers domination made awards season pretty predictable (and, some might say, a little dull). This year, Wicked aside, there are no such obvious contenders. The Brutalist, which follows Brody as a Hungarian architect attempting to build a life in the US after the Second World War, seems to be a favourite for best drama, as well as a best actor win for its star, and best director for Brady Corbet. But it faces tough competition from Conclave, in which Fiennes plays a priest who has to select a new pope, as well as A Complete Unknown, starring Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan. Awards voters love a biopic, after all. In the musicalcomedy category, experts for awards prediction site Gold Derby seem to be split three ways, between Wicked, Emilia Perez, and Anora - whose star Madison is also tipped to beat the likes of Erivo and Moore in her category. Celeb spotting After a difficult few years, the Golden Globes are still in comeback mode. Following an expose over a lack of diversity among members, the ceremony was held in private and boycotted by celebs in 2022 and didnt quite fully bounce back in 2023. Now, with a new organising body and after appearances by lots of A-listers last year, it looks set to bring some mega-watt star appeal once again. Angelina Jolie - a favourite for best actress for her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas in Maria - Denzel Washington, Nicole Kidman, Chalamet and Moore are just a few of the big-name nominees, alongside Grande and Gomez. Pamela Anderson is also on the list - nominated for best actress in a drama for her performance in The Last Showgirl. British and Irish hopefuls And its not just Hollywood making up the star-studded guest list, as loads of British celebs are in the running for awards, too, from Eddie Redmayne for his performance in Skys The Day Of The Jackal, to Keira Knightley for Netflixs Black Doves. Other British stars on the shortlists include Kate Winslet (nominated in both the TV and film categories for The Regime and Lee), Gary Oldman for hit Apple TV series Slow Horses, Hugh Grant for horror movie Heretic, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Colin Farrell for The Penguin, and Daniel Craig for his film Queer, based on the 1985 novella by William S Burroughs. And Erivo, too. Robbie Williams also gets a nod for best original song for his unique biopic, Better Man - his life story told through the medium of a computer-generated monkey. The stars who missed out Unlike the Oscars, the Globes covers both TV and film and also includes genre splits - with separate awards for dramas, and comedies and musicals. It means there are a lot of nominees in the running for awards. Still, there were a few big names absent from the shortlists. While his co-star Washington is up for a supporting award, Gladiator II star Paul Mescal missed out on a nod - as did director Sir Ridley Scott. The original film won the best picture Golden Globe in 2001 and star Russell Crowe was nominated in the best acting category for his performance. British director Sir Steve McQueens Second World War drama film Blitz, starring Saoirse Ronan, is also absent from the nominations. And while Dune: Part Two is up for best picture and best original score by Hans Zimmer, director Denis Villeneuve has not been recognised. First female solo host Yes, you read that right. While Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the ceremony several times as a double act, comedian Nikki Glaser will be the first woman to take the reins solo. Some of the ceremonys most memorable moments have come not from the stars, but the hosts themselves - Ricky Gervaiss caustic takedowns of the A-listers in the audience were always a favourite. Its a big gig, with not just the audience to impress, but the millions who will watch and see the clips all over social media later on. Jo Koy, who hosted last year, didnt go down particularly well. Fortunately, this years show should be suitably sharp in the hands of US stand-up Glaser, a comedian who is not afraid of being savage. Its the best of TV and film coming together with one common goal: to receive the love and validation they never got as children from their parents, she said. Sunday night is a night to celebrate TV and film, actors and directors, Xanax and tequila. The Golden Globes take place in LA, with the red carpet starting at about 11.30pm UK time and the ceremony starting at 1am on Monday. Source: Sky News --Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2025 12:39 pm",
        "content": "Tax expert N.R. Gajendran says Sri Lankas inability to meet tax revenue targets despite tax hikes is due to the tax leakages spurred by tax evasion. Joining Ada Deranas current affairs program HydePark, Gajendran further expressed that digitalization of proceedings of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will significantly contribute to bolstering efficiency while also eradicating loopholes which facilitate tax evasion. All the taxes have gone up, but were still struggling to achieve 13.9 to 14 tax revenue. Next year, 2025, were hoping to reach 15, which is still below what we achieved in the early 90s, 22 tax to GDP ratio. Most of the countries, even developing countries achieve 18 - 22 taxes, Gajendran mentioned. If you want to have macroeconomic stability, when we consider a developed country, tax to GDP ratio should be about 28 - 30. Now we still have this gap. Were collecting so much from people and were still falling short. Next year, at our best, well reach 15. We had 22 before, in 2022. Where is this 5 - 7 gap? Im telling, that is the evasion and fraud and corruption, he added. This money is not with the small taxpayers. It is with the big taxpayers. Reforms cannot take place when it is corrupt. If higher-ups are corrupt, all subordinates will be corrupt, as the former President said, Gajendran emphasized. Meanwhile, Tax Consultant, Attorney-at-Law Suresh Perera revealed that tax evasion is most often committed by top tax payers and not those in the lower tax brackets, although they have been at the centre of attention when drafting tax legislation. Commenting regarding the matter, Perera emphasized the tax leakage exists due to improper enforcement of laws, reiterating that the tax leakage takes place due to evasion by top tax payers. The law is there, but its not been followed. What is happening in here is that now the focus is on small man, perera added. Furthermore, he emphasized that policymakers focus on individual tax payers, stressing that the policies should be made focusing on large corporations, from which a huge tax revenue is being collected.

The decision has been made during a discussion chaired by the Minister of Health Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa on January 04, focusing on the current status and future development of the Thriposha Company. Highlighting the lack of a formal, targeted program by previous administrations, the Minister pointed out that this had led to the public missing out on the full benefits of the company. In response, the Minister assured that the government is determined to transform the company into a thriving entity that actively contributes to addressing the nations nutritional challenges. The Minister emphasized that instead of liquidating the Thriposha Company, the government will implement a structured development plan to make it a profitable venture. This approach aims to strengthen the companys role in supporting the nutritional requirements of the population while ensuring its long-term sustainability, according to the Minister. An integral part of this plan includes fostering partnerships with local farmers and entrepreneurs, he added, noting that a continuous procurement system will be established, enabling the Thriposha Company to source maize and soy from local suppliers, thereby encouraging agricultural development and creating a mutually beneficial relationship between the company and the farming community.

The letter of demand, sent through Attorney-at-Law Sampath Yalewatte on December 24, accuses Palitha of engaging in a deliberate and planned campaign of false and defamatory propaganda against the CPC Chairman. According to reports, the statement in question contained allegations that Rajakaruna believes were designed to harm his personal and professional reputation. The legal notice seeks restitution for the damages caused by what has been described as hateful and baseless accusations.",

        "content": "The Department of Wildlife Conservation has initiated an operation to use GPS technology in managing the movement of wild elephants from several areas in Anuradhapura to the Wilpattu National Park. The operation, which began in Oyamaduwa, involves fitting GPS collars on wild elephants to track their locations and study their migration routes. This effort aims to better understand elephant movements and mitigate the human-elephant conflict, a persistent issue in many parts of Sri Lanka. Wildlife officials, local residents, and the Sri Lanka Navy are collaborating in this initiative. According to surveys, wild elephants are among the leading causes of crop damage in the country, with incidents reported daily from various regions. In response to this growing problem, a program to relocate wild elephants to designated reserves was recently launched in Anuradhapura, a district severely affected by crop damage caused by elephants. However, local residents claim that the abrupt halting of the relocation process has worsened the situation, leaving several areas vulnerable to increased elephant activity.",

        "date": "January 5, 2025 04:11 pm",
        "content": "Shigemi Fukahori, a survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, who devoted his life to advocating for peace has died. He was 93. Fukahori died at a hospital in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan, on Jan. 3, the Urakami Catholic Church, where he prayed almost daily until last year, said on Sunday. Local media reported he died of old age. The church, located about 500 meters from ground zero and near the Nagasaki Peace Park, is widely seen as a symbol of hope and peace, as its bell tower and some statues and survived the nuclear bombing. Fukahori was only 14 when the U.S. dropped the bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killing tens of thousands of people, including his family. That came three days after the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, which killed 140,000 people. Japan surrendered days later, ending World War II and the countrys nearly half-century of aggression across Asia. Fukahori, who worked at a shipyard about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from where the bomb dropped, couldnt talk about what happened for years, not only because of the painful memories but also how powerless he felt then. About 15 years ago, he became more outspoken after encountering, during a visit to Spain, a man who experienced the bombing of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War when he was also 14 years old. The shared experience helped Fukahori open up. On the day the bomb dropped, I heard a voice asking for help. When I walked over and held out my hand, the persons skin melted. I still remember how that felt, Fukahori told Japans national broadcaster NHK in 2019. He often addressed students, hoping they take on what he called the baton of peace, in reference to his advocacy. When Pope Francis visited Nagasaki in 2019, Fukahori was the one who handed him a wreath of white flowers. The following year, Fukahori represented the bomb victims at a ceremony, making his pledge for peace, saying: I am determined to send our message to make Nagasaki the final place where an atomic bomb is ever dropped. A wake is scheduled for Sunday, and funeral services on Monday at Urakami Church, where his daughter will represent the family. Source: AP --Agencies",

President Joe Biden ordered flags lowered to half-staff for 30 days from the day of Carters death on Dec. 29, as is custom when a U.S. president dies. Trump, who has announced plans to attend Carters memorial service in Washington on Jan. 9, took issue in a Truth Social post on Friday with the flags remaining in the mourning position during his swearing-in ceremony. The Democrats are all giddy about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at half mast during my Inauguration, Trump said, employing a term frequently used for the lowered position when the flag is on a ship. They think its so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they dont love our Country, they only think about themselves, Trump said. Trump said that due to Carters death last week the American flag would for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast. Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Lets see how it plays out, he said.

Universities must remain places where diverse opinions, including critiques of government policies, can be freely expressed and discussed without fear of suppression.

This pest infestation has been reported in several areas, compounding the woes of farmers who were already struggling to recover from the destruction caused by recent floods. The flooding left many paddy fields buried under layers of sand, forcing farmers to undertake the arduous task of clearing their lands while navigating a cumbersome process to claim compensation for their losses. Adding to their plight, wild elephants have been reported to cause significant damage to crops in various parts of the island, further jeopardizing livelihoods. Amid this situation, in districts like Anuradhapuraparticularly in areas such as Oyamaduwa and Vilachchiyafarmers report that this new pest has severely affected paddy fields. Despite using a variety of insecticides, the pest remains uncontrollable, raising fears of a drastic decline in harvests. Farmers warn that if the responsible authorities do not act swiftly, the pest could spread to other regions, exacerbating the agricultural crisis. They urge prompt intervention to prevent further devastation to their crops and livelihoods.",

        "date": "January 6, 2025 08:31 am",
        "content": "A blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures stirred up dangerous travel conditions in parts of the central U.S. on Sunday, as a disruptive winter storm brought the possibility of the heaviest snowfall in a decade to some areas. Snow and ice blanketed major roadways in nearly all of Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the states National Guard was activated to help any motorists who were stuck. At least 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow were expected, particularly north of Interstate 70, as the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 45 mph (72 kph). The warning extended to New Jersey for Monday and into early Tuesday. For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade, the weather service said. Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at a thick coating of ice on his SUV Sunday in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri. Wright said he will work remotely for the University of Missouri-Columbia on Monday, but wanted to scrape off his vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. Hes also in the market for boots for their two older dogs, who wont budge at all when their paws hit the cold ground. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and stretches south. Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip. Snow and ice in the forecast, and even possible tornadoes In Indiana, snow fully covered portions of Interstate 64, Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 41, prompting Indiana State Police to plead with motorists to stay off the roads as plows worked to keep up with the pace of the precipitation. Its snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a half hour the roadways are completely covered again, Sgt. Todd Ringle said. Roughly 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow had fallen in parts of Kansas, with snow and sleet totals predicted to top 14 inches (36 centimeters) for parts of that state and northern Missouri. In Kentucky, Louisville recorded 7.7 inches (19.5 centimeters) of snow on Sunday, a new record for the date that shattered the previous mark of 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) set in 1910. Lexington, Kentucky, also set a snowfall record, with 5 inches (12.7 centimeters). Parts of upstate New York saw 3 feet (0.9 meters) or more of snow from a lake effect event expected to last until late Sunday afternoon. The storm was forecast to move into the Ohio Valley and reach the Mid-Atlantic states later Sunday and Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida. Damaging winds brought down trees across the Deep South. The weather service issued tornado warnings Sunday in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Car wrecks proliferate as storm hits Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after his patrol car was hit on Interstate 65. At least 600 motorists were stranded in Missouri, that states highway patrol said. Highways in northeastern Kansas were closed due to impassable conditions, according to the states Transportation Department. The closures included roughly 220 miles (354 kilometers) of the states main artery, Interstate 70, from the Missouri border into central Kansas. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who declared a state emergency ahead of the storm, said state buildings would be closed Monday. We see far too many wrecks out there for people that do not have to be on the roads, so I want to ask: Stay inside. Stay safe with your family, the governor said. Virginia State Police reported at least 135 crashes as the storm entered the state Sunday. A handful of injuries were reported. In Charleston, West Virginia, where several inches of snow had fallen by Sunday night, authorities urged motorists to stay home. The Kanawha County Sheriffs Office said deputies were responding to crashes and 911 calls countywide. Please be patient if you have called 911 for assistance. A deputy will call you or respond to you as soon as possible, the sheriffs office said in a statement. Air and rail travel also snarled The storms caused havoc for the nations passenger railways. More than 20 cancellations were planned on Sunday, 40 for Monday and at least two for Tuesday. If local authorities are telling people not to travel, its counterintuitive to try to run a full slate of services when people are being told to stay home, Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari said. The Midwest was hit especially hard. A train between Chicago and New York and several regional trains between Chicago and St. Louis were among those canceled Sunday. Nearly 200 flights in and out of St. Louis Lambert International Airport were canceled, according to tracking platform FlightAware. Temperatures dip, though no records break Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters said. Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) below normal. In Chicago on Sunday, temperatures hovered in the teens (minus 7 to 10 Celsius) and around zero in Minneapolis, while dropping to 11 below (-11.7 Celsius) in International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border. The Northeastern states are more likely to experience several days of cold following what has mostly been a mild start to winter, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine. A plume of cold air coming down from Canada is likely to result in a cold but dry week, he said. The cold air will likely grip the eastern half of the country as far south as Georgia, Palmer said, with parts of the East Coast experiencing freezing temperatures and lows dipping into the single digits in some areas. Wind might also pick up as the week gets going, making for potentially dangerous conditions for people exposed to the elements for long periods of time, Palmer said. Disruptions extend southward The National Weather Service predicted 8 to 12 inches (about 20 to 30 centimeters) of snow for the Annapolis, Maryland, area. In a statement on X, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm and encouraged residents to vote before the states special elections on Tuesday. Similar declarations were issued in Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and in central Illinois cities. Classes canceled School closings were likely to be widespread Monday. Districts in Indiana, Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky were already announcing cancellations and delays on Sunday afternoon. Kentuckys Jefferson County Public Schools canceled classes, extracurricular activities and athletics Monday for its nearly 100,000 students. The day would have been students first one back after winter break. This is a traditional snow day with no online learning, the district announced. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "No direct talks with foreign missions: New circular tightens Sri Lankas diplomatic protocols",
        "date": "January 6, 2025 11:41 am",
        "content": "The government has introduced a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at streamlining and ensuring coordinated communication between the state institutions and foreign entities. Accordingly, the government has issued a circular, effective from January 1, 2025, in order to safeguard national interests and prevent diplomatic complications. As per the new circular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will serve as the lead institution for all international relations while making it compulsory to obtain the Presidents pre-approval for all foreign visits by government officials. The guidelines emphasize strengthening the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ensuring clarity in communication protocols, and establishing a clear framework for international agreements, foreign financing, and diplomatic protocols. At the core of the circular lies the assertion that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will serve as the lead institution for conducting international relations, as outlined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Going forward, all communication with foreign governments or international organizations must be coordinated through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The circular also establishes clear communication protocols, stressing that no direct communication with foreign governments should occur without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All Provincial Councils and Local Government institutions are strictly prohibited from engaging with foreign missions, both in Sri Lanka and abroad, without Ministry of Foreign Affairs approval. Meanwhile, the circular also noted that the ministries such as Finance or Defence may still engage with foreign entities on specific issues, such as loans or technical matters, but only after prior consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In response to the growing complexities of international travel and participation in diplomatic events, the circular introduces new rules for foreign visits: - All foreign visits must be pre-approved by the President and coordinated through the MFA to prevent last-minute complications or overlooked diplomatic nuances. - Senior officials travelling for official purposes must inform the MFA well in advance. - The Ministry will also coordinate visa requests for these officials, which must be submitted at least four weeks prior to departure. In addition, the circular stipulates that senior officials travelling for official purposes are entitled to transportation and consular support; however, private visits will not be funded by the Ministry unless explicitly authorized. The circular also states that costs related to accommodation, travel, or communication services are typically borne by the respective ministry organizing the trip. The circular also includes protocols for emergency contacts by foreign missions and informal communications. - In the event of an emergency, foreign missions are permitted to contact the relevant ministries directly. - However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be notified promptly to avoid misunderstandings or the potential for diplomatic fallout. Similarly, any informal correspondence with foreign missions must be reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially if it could evolve into a more significant policy issue. When meeting foreign ministers, dignitaries, or ambassadors, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are mandatory to be invited. If not, a report must be submitted to the Ministry detailing the discussion that took place during the meeting. The circular further states that senior officials of the Government of Sri Lanka should not attend events hosted by representatives of countries with which Sri Lanka does not have diplomatic relations or recognition. In such cases, inquiries can be directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for clarification. Before initiating discussions for bilateral, regional, or multilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding with foreign entities, ministries must first notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Any formal agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) must be cleared by the Ministry to assess potential policy or legal implications. The circular also outlines participation in diplomatic events. It states that the Cabinet will nominate a Minister each month to represent Sri Lanka at the National Day celebrations of foreign countries. If the nominated Minister is unable to attend, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be informed at least two weeks in advance to make alternative arrangements.",
