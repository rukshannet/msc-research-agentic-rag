        "title": "UAE makes historic decision to teach holocaust in schools",
        "date": "January 9, 2023 02:35 pm",
        "content": "The United Arab Emirates will begin teaching about the Holocaust in history classes in primary and secondary schools across the country, the countrys embassy in the U.S. says. The embassy provided no details on the curriculum and education authorities in the Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, did not immediately acknowledge the announcement on Monday. However, the announcement comes after the UAE normalized relations with Israel in 2020 as part of a deal brokered by the administration of President Donald Trump. In the wake of the historic (hashtag)AbrahamAccords, (the UAE) will now include the Holocaust in the curriculum for primary and secondary schools, the embassy said in a tweet, referring to the normalization deal that also saw Bahrain and ultimately Morocco also recognize Israel. Ambassador Deborah E. Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, praised the announcement in her own tweet. Holocaust education is an imperative for humanity and too many countries, for too long, continue to downplay the Shoah for political reasons, Lipstadt wrote, using a Hebrew word for the Holocaust. I commend the UAE for this step and expect others to follow suit soon. The announcement comes ahead of a planned meeting of the Negev Forum Working Groups in Abu Dhabi this week, which grew out of the normalization. The meeting will see officials from Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, the UAE and the U.S. attend. Egypt has diplomatically recognized Israel for decades. The Holocaust saw Nazi Germany systematically kill 6 million European Jews during World War II. Israel, founded in 1948 as a haven for Jews in the wake of the Holocaust, grants automatic citizenship to anyone of Jewish descent. Other Arab nations have refused to diplomatically recognize Israel over its decades-long occupation of land Palestinians want for a future state. The announcement by the UAE also comes after it and other Arab nations condemned an ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet minister for visiting a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site for the first time since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus new far-right government took office. The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, is the holiest site in Judaism, home to the ancient biblical Temples. Today, it houses the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. Since Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there.

The petitioning party has highlighted that the relevant petition has no legal basis and that the petitioner has failed to establish that there is a reasonable legal basis to continue the hearing of the petition. The intervening petitions further alleged that erroneous and misleading information has been filed before the court through this writ petition.

The State Minister revealed that the relevant circular will be issued within this week. The PAYE tax has been imposed as a tax to be paid to the government by individuals who earn an income beyond a certain limit, while some state institutions and semi-government institutions have previously been paying the relevant tax, Siyambalapitiya stressed. Furthermore, he also emphasizes that such irregularities cannot be allowed in view of the current economic situation of the country. If anyone earns more than a certain limit, they are subject to the PAYE tax even if it is the government, semi-government or the private sector, he said. But previously, especially in the semi-government sector and in corporations, we have experienced cases where the PAYE tax is paid by the relevant intuition itself under certain service agreements. This is not the time for such inefficiencies, he added. The State Minister also expressed that a clear circular will be issued to all government and semi-government institutions preventing such tax payments, after clearly looking into the issue.",

In a twitter message, Wickremesinghe said he is deeply concerned about the recent violence that erupted in Brasilia. He added that not too long ago, Sri Lanka had also experienced similar attempts by groups to overthrow democratic structures through unconstitutional means. Such hostilities are condemned, and we stand in solidarity with the President, Government and people of Brazil in this hour of confrontation, he emphasized. Wickremesinghe said it is imperative that democracy and its institutions are universally respected by all citizens. I am deeply concerned about the recent violence that erupted in Brasilia.

The demonstrators refused to accept his legitimate October election defeat to leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The riots came a week after Lulas inauguration as president and saw Bolsonaros followers bypass security barricades and vandalize all three buildings, resulting in more than 400 arrests after hours of clashes with security forces. The coup plotters who promoted the destruction of public property in Brasilia are being identified and will be punished, Lula said in a tweet Sunday night, vowing to resume work in the palace on Monday. The new president was forced to declare emergency powers and to close off the center of the capital for 24 hours until order is restored. World leaders have condemned the violence and the attacks on Brazilian government buildings. In a tweet Sunday night, U.S. President Joe Biden condemned what he called the assault on democracy and the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil. Biden added, Brazils democratic institutions have our full support and the will of the Brazilian people must not be undermined. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday also condemned any attempt to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and the democratic will of the people of Brazil. Sunak said Lulas government has the U.K.s full support and that he looked forward to building on the two countries ties in the years ahead. The Brazilian president received words of support from Moscow, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Russia condemned the instigators in the strongest terms, according to Reuters. --With inputs from agencies",

        "title": "More than 1,200 detained following storming of govt buildings in Brazil",
        "date": "January 9, 2023 11:28 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  Brazilian authorities vowed Monday to protect democracy and punish thousands of supporters of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro who stormed and trashed the nations highest seats of power in chaos with striking similarities to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The protesters swarmed into Congress, the Supreme Court and presidential palace on Sunday. Many have said they want the Brazilian army to restore the far-right Bolsonaro to power and oust the newly inaugurated leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Justice Minister Flávio Dino said the acts amounted to terrorism and coup-mongering and that police have begun tracking those who paid for the buses that transported protesters to the capital. In a news conference late Sunday, Brazils minister of institutional relations said the buildings would be inspected for evidence including fingerprints and images to hold people to account, and that the rioters apparently intended to spark similar uprest nationwide. They will not succeed in destroying Brazilian democracy. We need to say that fully, with all firmness and conviction, Dino said. We will not accept the path of criminality to carry out political fights in Brazil. A criminal is treated like a criminal. Rioters donning the green and yellow of the national flag on Sunday broke windows, toppled furniture, hurled computers and printers to the ground. They punctured a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting in five places, overturned the U-shaped table at which Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justices office and vandalized an iconic statue outside the court. The monumental buildings interiors were left in states of ruin. So far, more than 1,200 people have been detained, the justice ministrys press office said Monday. But police were noticeably slow to react - even after the arrival of more than 100 buses - leading many to ponder whether authorities had either simply ignored numerous warnings, underestimated the protesters strength, or been somehow complicit. Public prosecutors in the capital said local security forces had at very least been negligent. A supreme court justice temporarily suspended the regional governor. Another justice blamed authorities for not swiftly cracking down on budding neofascism in Brazil. After his Oct. 30 electoral defeat, Bolsonaro, who has gone to Florida, has been stoking belief among his hardcore supporters that the electronic voting system was prone to fraud  though he never presented any evidence. His lawmaker son Eduardo Bolsonaro held several meetings with former U.S. President Donald Trump, Trumps longtime ally Steve Bannon and his senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller. Results from Brazils election  the closest in over three decades  were quickly recognized by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of governments. And Bolsonaro surprised nearly everyone by promptly fading from view. He neither conceded defeat nor emphatically cried fraud, though he and his party submitted a request to nullify millions of votes that was swiftly dismissed. Brazilians have used electronic voting since 1996 that security experts consider less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because they leave no auditable paper trail. Brazils system is, however, closely scrutinized and domestic authorities and international observers have never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud. Still, Bolsonaros supporters refused to accept the results. They blocked roads and have remained camped outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene. Dino, the justice minister, referred to the encampments as incubators of terrorism. Protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but isolated threats  including a bomb found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilias airport  prompted security concerns. Two days before Lulas Jan. 1 inauguration, Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. and took up temporary residence in Orlando. Many Brazilians expressed relief that, while he declined to participate in the transition of power, his absence allowed it to occur without incident. Or so it had been, until Sundays havoc. Bolsonarism mimics the same strategies as Trumpism. Our Jan. 8  an unprecedented manifestation in Brazilian politics  is clearly copied from Jan. 6 in the Capitol, said Paulo Calmon, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia. Todays sad episodes represent yet another attempt to destabilize democracy and demonstrate that the authoritarian, populist radicalism of Brazils extreme right remains active under the command of former President Bolsonaro, the Trump of Latin America. U.S. President Joe Biden tweeted that the riots were an assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil, and that he looked forward to continue working with Lula. In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to assume control of security in the federal district. He said that the so-called fascist fanatics, as well as those who financed their activities, must be punished, and also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging their uprising. Bolsonaro repudiated the presidents accusation late Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are exceptions to the rule. He made no specific mention of the protesters actions in Brasilia. He is evidently the intellectual mentor of what is happening, so he cannot dissociate from it, said Mario Sérgio Lima, political analyst at Medley Advisors. These groups were created by him, by the radicalism he imposed on politics. There is no way to undo that. ... It seems his group has already crossed the Rubicon. Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials would have been working in the top government buildings on a Sunday. And videos showed limited presence of the capitals military police. One video showed one group of protesters easily pushing through a police barricade, with only a few officers using pepper spray. Another showed officers standing by as protesters stormed the Congress, including one using his phone to record what was happening. This was a gross error by the federal districts government. It was a tragedy foretold, said Thiago de Aragão, director of strategy at Brasilia-based politican consultancy Arko Advice. Everyone knew they (the protesters) were coming to Brasilia. The expectation was that the federal districts government was going to mount a response to protect the capital. They didnt do any of that. Lula said at his news conference there was incompetence or bad faith on the part of police, and he promised some would be punished. Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter he had fired the capital citys head of public security, Anderson Torres. Local media reported that Torres is in Orlando for vacation, and that he denied having met with Bolsonaro there. Soon after, Brazils Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Rocha removed from his position as governor for 90 days. He wrote in his decision that the days events could only have transpired with the consent, and even effective participation, of the competent public security and intelligence authorities, and called Rochas actions intentionally omissive. Two years since Jan. 6, Trumps legacy continues to poison our hemisphere, U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, who chairs the Senates foreign relations committee, tweeted, adding that he blamed Bolsonaro for inciting the acts. Protecting democracy  holding malign actors to account is essential.

        "date": "January 10, 2023 11:02 am",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan gemstone company, that was key to sanctioned terrorist facilitator Ahmed Luqman Talibs revenue generation in support of al-Qaida, continued doing business after Talib was sanctioned and arrested, according to Kharon, a global security and commerce intelligence company. Talib and a gemstone business that he owned in Australia were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in October 2020, an action followed by his arrest by Australian police in 2021 and the designation of two of his relatives and business associates more recently by the U.S. government in November 2022. Right Gems, a gemstone trading company based in Sri Lanka, was a key partner in Talibs revenue generation to support al-Qaida. The trading company shares an address in the south-west coast of Sri Lanka with Mohammed Haris Nizar, who is one of Talibs relatives and business partners most recently sanctioned by the U.S. government on November 9. In the fall of 2020, Right Gems shipped precious stones worth more than USD 100,000 to Talib and Sons Pty Ltd, the Australian gemstone company owned by Talib that was sanctioned in 2020, according to trade data reviewed by Kharon. Talibs and Nizars business dealings in Sri Lanka have generated nearly USD 200,000 per year in profit since 2018, and the majority of Talibs income was derived from one-third of those proceeds, according to the US Treasury. Right Gems continued to ship products to customers in 2021 after Ahmed Talib and his company were sanctioned by the U.S. government. The international trail of Talibs al-Qaida facilitation network extends into South America. Al-Qaida facilitator Ahmed Talib was also a managing partner of the Brazil-based company Ottoman Trade Caravan Importacao e Exportacao Ltda. in 2020, according to corporate data. Another manager of Ottoman Trade Caravan is Kais Altabbaa, who simultaneously worked for Brazilian jewelry business Aisha Stones, which shares an address and telephone numbers with Ottoman Trade Caravan. Altabbaa himself sold and shipped repeated small amounts of rough gemstones to Right Gems in December 2020, according to trade data reviewed by Kharon. Terrorist financing risks of trade in precious metals and stones were the subjects of both the U.S. anti-money launderingcombating the financing of terrorism (AMLCFT) rule for dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels, adopted in 2005, and the 2008 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance on the risk-based approach to AMLCFT for dealers in precious metals and stones. More than a decade later, these terrorist financing risks continue to draw the attention of U.S. and international authorities. Source: KHARON",

        "date": "January 10, 2023 11:38 am",
        "content": "On President Ranil Wickremesinghes instructions to the Cabinet of Ministers, 5 of the estimated expenditure allocated under the proposals of the 2023 Budget to all ministries will be curtailed. This was announced by Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena this a short while ago at the Cabinet briefing held in Colombo. Reasoning that the Treasury is currently facing a severe depletion of funds, worse than what was anticipated, Gunawardena explained that the potential income that may be earned through taxes within the first few months of 2023 has greatly reduced owing to the grave economic crisis that Sri Lanka saw in 2022. Thus, the payment of government employees salaries and other welfare expenses such as the Samurdhi allowances have proved difficult for the months of January, February and March Gunawardena stated, adding that the payment of Samurdhi allowances to all low-income families is likely to be delayed by nearly two weeks. Despite there being a significant decrease in government revenue for the months of January, February and March, there are still essential payments that need to be made. However the Treasury does not have sufficient funds to maintain these day-to-day expenses such as the salaries of government employees, pensions, and interests paid on government loans and other such welfare expenses. Thus, we will be prioritizing the main task we are faced with at the end of each month  the payment of the salaries of public servants and pensions. Owing to this financial crisis, the Cabinet was also informed to slash 5 from all proposals submitted by the ministries, allocated in the 2023 Budget, Gunawardena explained.",

Taking to Twitter, Semasinghe assured that priority is being given to the payment of the salaries of public servants, pensions and other welfare benefit schemes, such as the Samurdhi allowances. There shouldnt be any undue fear about this, the State Minister said, assuring that a required programme to overcome the ongoing crisis is currently underway. Even though the countrys economy is at a stable level we have not yet come out of the crisis completely. Required programme to overcome the crisis is currently underway. All mandatory  essential payments are being done by managing government revenue and expenditure, Semasinghe said in this regard. He also noted that the government is implementing a systematic plan to settle the overdue bills, with the consultation of the relevant ministries. Earlier today (10 Jan.), Cabinet Spokesman warned that owing to Sri Lankas depleting Treasury funds, the payment of government salaries, pensions and welfare schemes has proved difficult. He noted that as the income earned by the government through taxes for the first few months of 2023 will be drastically low due to the economic crisis that grasped the island nation last year, payments of the Samurdhi allowances, too, are likely to be delayed by nearly two weeks. Moreover, 5 of the funds appropriated for proposals submitted by all Ministries in the 2023 Budget will be slashed, as per President Ranil Wickremesinghes instructions, Gunawardena added.",

        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court today (10 Jan.) rejected the petition filed by Adarsha Karadana requesting the court to release her on anticipatory bail. On 03 January, Karadana, who was recently in the spotlight after releasing an alleged video of her estranged partner, former Presidential Advisor Ashu Marasinghe sexually abusing her pet dog, filed a petition with the Colombo Magistrates Court, requesting that she be released on anticipatory bail on account that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is preparing to arrest her. However, Karadanas petition was rejected by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis today, on the grounds that allowing for the petition to proceed would be inappropriate, as investigations into the accusations levelled against Marasinghe and the controversial video in question are currently underway. Despite Karadanas counsel having stated that his client had filed the petition fearing for her safety, Marasinghes legal representative countered this argument, stating that the release of Karadana is likely to hinder the ongoing investigations into the matter. The CID, too, informed the court that allowing for the release of already discourteous Karadana would hinder the investigation, as she is unlikely to aid the ongoing probe in any way if released. On 23 December 2022, Karadana, together with Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Hirunika Premachandra, called for a media briefing, during which they released a video and images of the former Presidential Advisor allegedly sexually abusing the formers pet dog. Marasinghe vehemently denied the allegations and filed a complaint with the CID on 24 December accusing Karadana of having doctored the video herself. He went on to demand Rs. 1.5 billion from the duo on 30 December as compensation for defaming him. Accordingly, notices were issued to both Premachandra and Karadana, demanding Rs. 500 million from the former, and Rs. 1 billion from the latter, over recent claims made by the duo at the aforementioned press conference, while the CID is also preparing to take Karadana into custody over the complaint filed by Marasinghe.",

        "content": "Canada has imposed sanctions on four Sri Lankan state officials, including former Presidents Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over alleged human rights violations during the island nations civil conflict from 1983 to 2009. A statement published by the Canadian foreign ministry on Tuesday (Jan 10) accused the two Rajapaksa brothers, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake and Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi of committing gross and systematic violations of human rights during the period the country was grappling with the armed conflict. The sanctions will effectively freeze any assets that these four Sri Lankans may hold in Canada and render them inadmissible to Canada under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Canadian government said the sanctions send a clear message that it would not accept continued impunity for those that have committed gross human rights violations in Sri Lanka. Canadas foreign minister, Melanie Joly, who spoke on the sanctions, said this decisive action was taken with the aim of ending international impunity against violators of international law. Canada stands ready to support Sri Lankas path to peace, inclusion and prosperity through the advancement of accountability, reconciliation and human rights, including international assistance to address the domestic crisis. In its statement on the sanctions, the Canadian government pointed out that the Sri Lankan government has taken limited meaningful and concrete action to uphold its human rights obligations, despite continued calls from the international community to address accountability, the Canadian government pointed out. This jeopardizes progress on justice for affected populations, and prospects for peace and reconciliation. Canada vowed to continue to collaborate alongside international partners, including through relevant multilateral bodies to advocate for human rights and accountability in Sri Lanka, noting that it is an important step toward securing a safe, peaceful and inclusive future for the country. Canada, as part of the Core Group on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council, said it would continue to advocate for the full implementation of resolution 511 and support efforts towards attaining accountability and peace on the island. In its statement, the Canadian government reassured that it supports efforts towards urgent political and economic reforms to alleviate the hardships faced by the people in Sri Lanka, and encouraged the Sri Lankan government to promote democracy, human rights and maintain the rule of law as it works to address this crisis.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has slammed the officials of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission for failing to launch a website for the commission although it has been more than a year since it was established. COPF chairman MP Harsha de Silva stressed the need for a proper online presence for the Commission, especially in a context where its registrations and submission of applications are expected to be carried out online. Further, the Port City Economic Commissions senior officials were denounced for failing to appear before the COPF without providing a notice of absence beforehand. While emphasizing on the importance of the Port City project for the purpose of generating investments and the work done thus far, the COPF unanimously expressed its dissatisfaction and advised the officials to exercise a better sense of responsibility as professionals handling such project of importance. Accordingly, the Secretary to the Port City Economic Commission was instructed to submit a by way of writing a reasonable explanation as to why senior officials were not present before the COPF when they had been summoned before the committee on December 21, 2022.

        "title": "World Bank warns global economy could tip into recession in 2023",
        "date": "January 11, 2023 08:33 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) -- The World Bank slashed its 2023 growth forecasts on Tuesday to levels teetering on the brink of recession for many countries as the impact of central bank rate hikes intensifies, Russias war in Ukraine continues, and the worlds major economic engines sputter. The development lender said it expected global gross domestic product growth of 1.7 in 2023, the slowest pace outside the 2009 and 2020 recessions since 1993. In its previous Global Economic Prospects report in June 2022, the bank had forecast 2023 global growth at 3.0. It forecast global growth in 2024 to pick up to 2.7 -- below the 2.9 estimate for 2022 -- and said average growth for the 2020-2024 period would be under 2 -- the slowest five-year pace since 1960. The bank said major slowdowns in advanced economies, including sharp cuts to its forecast to 0.5 for both the United States and the eurozone, could foreshadow a new global recession less than three years after the last one. Given fragile economic conditions, any new adverse development -- such as higher-than-expected inflation, abrupt rises in interest rates to contain it, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or escalating geopolitical tensions -- could push the global economy into recession, the bank said in a statement accompanying the report. The bleak outlook will be especially hard on emerging market and developing economies, the World Bank said, as they struggle with heavy debt burdens, weak currencies and income growth, and slowing business investment that is now forecast at a 3.5 annual growth rate over the next two years -- less than half the pace of the past two decades. Weakness in growth and business investment will compound the already devastating reversals in education, health, poverty and infrastructure and the increasing demands from climate change, World Bank President David Malpass said in a statement. Chinas growth in 2022 slumped to 2.7, its second-slowest pace since the mid-1970s after 2020, as zero-COVID restrictions, property market turmoil and drought hit consumption, production and investment, the World Bank report said. It predicted a rebound to 4.3 for 2023, but that is 0.9 percentage point below the June forecast due to the severity of COVID disruptions and weakening external demand. The World Bank noted that some inflationary pressures started to abate as 2022 drew to a close, with lower energy and commodity prices, but warned that risks of new supply disruptions were high, and elevated core inflation may persist. This could cause central banks to respond by raising policy rates by more than currently expected, worsening the global slowdown, it added. The bank called for increased support from the international community to help low-income countries deal with food and energy shocks, people displaced by conflicts, and a growing risk of debt crises. It said new concessional financing and grants are needed along with the leveraging of private capital and domestic resources to help boost investment in climate adaptation, human capital and health, the report said. The report comes as the World Banks board this week is expected to consider a new evolution road map for the institution to vastly expand its lending capacity to address climate change and other global crises. The plan will guide negotiations with shareholders, led by the United States, for the biggest revamp in the banks business model since its creation at the end of World War II. Source: Reuters --Agencies A sharp, long-lasting slowdown is expected to hit developing countries this year. The global economy is projected to grow by just 1.7 in 2023.

        "date": "January 11, 2023 10:35 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas output is estimated to have fallen by 9.2 percent in 2022 as the government ran out of the foreign exchange needed to cover food and fuel imports while the rupee plummeted and imports contracted sharply, and to service external debt, the World Bank says. In its Global Economics Prospects in January 2023, the global financial institution raised concerns about the continuing shortages of food, energy and medical supplies facing Sri Lanka nation while the authorities are implementing a stabilization program. Stating that the crisis and its repercussions have increased poverty and reversed much of the countrys income gains over the past decade, the World Bank went on to note that tourist arrivals, an important source of foreign exchange, continue to be depressed with international arrivals last October about one-third of their 2019 level. The World Bank expects Sri Lankas output to contract again this year by 4.2 percent. The forecast for 2023 growth has been revised down owing to the ongoing foreign currency shortages, the effects of higher inflation and policy measures designed to restore macroeconomic stability. The global financial institution, in its outlook for the South Asia, mentioned that the region continues to be adversely affected by spillovers from the Russias invasion of Ukraine, rising global rates and weakening growth in key trading partners. The regional growth is estimated to have slowed down to 6.1 percent in 2022 and is projected to slow further to 5.5 percent in 2023  below the projections on global spillovers  before picking up to 5.8 percent in 2024. According to the World Bank, some economies in the region such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the deterioration in economic conditions has led to a substantial rise on poverty. Many households are consuming less nutritious food, and rolling electricity blackouts have become common as fuel has been rationed, it added. With regard to the soaring food prices in the South Asian Region, especially in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the World Bank said the situation has increased the incidence of food insecurity in the region. In Sri Lanka, for example, more than, one-third of the population are food insecure, from less than one-tenth in 2019. The World Banks latest Global Economic Prospects report has highlighted that the outlook is particularly devastating for many poorest economies where poverty reduction has already ground to a halt. The report mentions that the World Bank expected global gross domestic product growth of 1.7 in 2023, the slowest pace outside the 2009 and 2020 recessions since 1993. In its previous Global Economic Prospects report in June 2022, the bank had forecast 2023 global growth at 3.0. It forecast global growth in 2024 to pick up to 2.7  below the 2.9 estimate for 2022  and said average growth for the 2020-2024 period would be under 2  the slowest five-year pace since 1960.",

        "date": "January 11, 2023 11:02 am",
        "content": "Steven Spielberg claimed top honors including best drama at the Golden Globes on Tuesday for his deeply personal film The Fabelmans, as Hollywoods A-list stars flocked to the first major awards show of the year despite a series of scandals swirling around its organizers. The other top film award, best comedy or musical, went to The Banshees of Inisherin -- a tragicomedy about a shattered friendship on a remote Irish island that ended the night with the most movie prizes. Spielberg, who also took home the award for best director, thanked his family including his late mother, who he said would be up there kvelling about this right now. The Fabelmans covers the troubled marriage of Spielbergs parents, anti-Semitic bullying, and the directors early efforts making zero-budget movies with his teenage friends. Everybody sees me as a success story, and everybody sees all of us the way they perceive us based on how they get the information, said the 76-year-old filmmaker. But nobody really knows who we are until were courageous enough to tell everyone who we are. Spielberg said films like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind had used elements from his real life, but he had never had the courage to hit this story head on until now. Despite faring poorly at the box office, the film saw off last years two biggest commercial hits -- James Camerons sci-fi film Avatar: The Way of Water, and Top Gun: Maverick -- to win the nights final prize. Inisherin also earned a win for Colin Farrell for best comedy actor, boosting his Oscar hopes, and for writer-director Martin McDonagh for best screenplay. - A-listers attend  The Globes, which kick off the annual film prize-giving season, have not had their usual glitz for the past two years, due to the pandemic and revelations about their organizers lack of diversity and allegations of ethical lapses. In particular, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organizes the awards, was criticized for not having a single Black member, although it has recently expanded its ranks. All eyes were on which A-listers would show up Tuesday, as NBC -- which scrapped its broadcast of the show last year -- brought back the 80th Golden Globe Awards on a one-off basis. As it turned out, many heavy hitters were in attendance, including Spielberg, Rihanna and Brad Pitt. Austin Butler, stepping into Elvis Presleys blue suede shoes for rock-and-roll biopic Elvis, won best actor in a drama. You were an icon and a rebel and I love you so much, said Butler to the legendary singer, in an emotional speech in which he also praised Presleys family for their support. Eddie Murphy accepted a career achievement award at the Beverly Hills gala, while Angela Bassett won best supporting actress for Marvel blockbuster Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. - No shows  But Cate Blanchett, who won best drama actress for Tar, in which she plays a ruthless conductor navigating the cutthroat world of classical music, did not attend the gala. Other prominent winners who didnt show included Kevin Costner (Yellowstone), Zendaya (Euphoria) and Amanda Seyfried (The Dropout). Michelle Yeoh won best comedy actress for the surreal Everything Everywhere All At Once. Her co-star in the multiverse-hopping sci-fi film, Ke Huy Quan -- who shot to fame as a child star in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom almost four decades ago -- won best supporting actor. Action-packed Indian blockbuster RRR, which has become a huge word-of-mouth hit in Hollywood, added momentum to its awards season campaign by winning best song. Guillermo del Toros Pinocchio won best animated feature, while Argentina, 1985 won best non-English language film. On the television side, Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon won best drama, and Abbott Elementary claimed best comedy series. - Edgy host  Success at the Globes is often seen as a potential bellwether for films hoping to win Oscars, which take place this year on March 12. Academy voters will begin casting ballots for Oscar nominations on Thursday, just days after the Globes gala. But recent controversies have muddied the waters. Host Jerrod Carmichael, who struck a daring and edgy tone throughout the night, kicked the gala off with a monologue poking fun at the HFPA. Ill tell you why Im here. Im here because Im Black, said Carmichael. Most of the Globes usual swanky after-parties -- where winners parade their trophies, and losers drown their sorrows with free champagne -- did not take place this year. Nominee Brendan Fraser and Tom Cruise, the star and producer of Top Gun: Maverick, notably did not attend. But despite the controversy surrounding the Globes, Avatar director Cameron told AFP he didnt really think about it that much. Obviously I did my research about what they had gone through, and I made sure that they had been responsive to the protests and complaints and all that, which I believe they have been, he said. I think we should celebrate the fact that an organization does such radical changes. Source  AFP -Agencies",

        "title": "French plan to raise retirement age by two years to 64",
        "date": "January 11, 2023 11:57 am",
        "content": "Frances government has proposed raising the legal retirement age from 62 to 64 by 2030 in a major reform to the pension system. PM Elisabeth Borne said the changes were necessary to prevent a major deficit in the system in the future. Reforming pensions was one of President Emmanuel Macrons main promises when he was first elected in 2017. But the details immediately triggered an angry response from the unions, with plans for strikes on 19 January. Ms Bornes handling of an explosive reform was cautious, as she announced the proposals at a news conference. She was careful to emphasise the gradual, progressive nature of the planned changes, with extra support for those on the lowest pensions. But, as she admitted, the reform will spark fears and questions among the French people. A recent poll suggests 80 of the population is opposed to pushing the retirement age back to 64. Some MPs even blame Mr Macrons policy for losing his party its parliamentary majority last year. Doing nothing about projected deficits for the pension system would be irresponsible, Ms Borne said. It would lead inevitably to a massive increase in taxes, a reduction in pensions and would pose a threat to our pensions system. The retirement age will be raised gradually by three months a year, starting in September, she explained. By 2027 it would reach 63 years and 3 months, and the target age of 64 in 2030. The proposals include: - A full pension from 2027 will require working for 43 years (instead of 42 years currently) - Guaranteed minimum pension income of not less than 85 of the net minimum wage, roughly 1,200 (1,060) per month at current levels, for new retirees - Police officers, prison guards, air traffic controllers and other public workers in jobs deemed physically or mentally arduous will keep the right to retire early - Their retirement age will be increased by the same number of years as the wider labour force - End to so-called special regimes with different retirement ages and benefits for rail workers, electricity and gas workers, among others. Pensions have always been a key part of President Macrons vision for reforming France. But his plans were disrupted - first by widespread protests; then by Covid. Now in his second and final term in office, this is perhaps his last chance to get the job done. Public sector workers, who have been quick to resist Mr Macrons reforms before, are among those with the most to lose. New entrants will not be eligible for the special pension regimes enjoyed by their predecessors. Hard-left political leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the France Unbowed party, described the proposal as amounting to severe social regression, while far-right leader Marine Le Pen said she intended to block an unjust reform. It is not that the French dont see the need for reform - almost half say the system needs to change to secure its future. The government said the reforms would balance the pension budget and represent gross savings of 17.7bn a year by 2030. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the measures would also boost the employment rate among 60-64 year-olds which is low compared with other European countries. But the timing is bad: the cost-of-living crisis is biting hard. And Mr Macron has an image among some here as aloof and out of touch with French people. Polling suggests that a vast majority dont trust the government to be fair or effective in the reforms they choose. The proposed changes are set to be examined early next month in parliament, where the government does not have an absolute majority. Source - BBC - With input from agencies",

We came to know that the Secretary of Public Administration had issued a letter to all District Secretaries. However, he himself has now recalled the said letter within a few hours after issuing it. Nevertheless, we intend to summon him and inquire with regard to that, the Chairman of the commission Nimal Punchihewa told reporters in Colombo today (11). Speaking further regarding the matter, he said that election returning officers are appointed by the Election Commission as per the Constitution of Sri Lanka and that that the gazette issued by the commission is signed by all five members of the Election Commission. He pointed out that after the returning officers are appointed by the commission, no other institution or authority except for the Election Commission or the judiciary has any authority to issue any instructions, orders or advice to them with regard to the election. As per the Constitution, it is the Election Commission that has complete authority to with regard to election related affairs, he emphasized.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, slamming the attempts to defer the election, had called on the government not to play with the peoples right to vote.

        "content": "The government is considering introducing a national cryptocurrency or digital pound, the economic secretary to the Treasury has told MPs. The UK was committed to becoming a world crypto hub, Andrew Griffith said. And the government was a long way down the road... to establish a regime for the wholesale use, for payment purposes, of stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to have a predictable value linked to traditional currencies or assets such as gold. Game-changing technology A public consultation on the attributes of a digital pound would be launched in coming weeks, Mr Griffith told the Treasury Select Committee. I want to see us establish a regime, and this is within the FSMB Financial Services and Markets Bill, currently being debated in Parliament, for the wholesale use for payment purposes of stablecoins, he said. Central banks around the world are developing or exploring digital currencies. And Mr Griffith told the committee: It is right to look to seek to embrace potentially disruptive technologies, particularly when we have such a strong fintech and financial sector. He wanted to allow the opportunity for this potentially disruptive game-changing technology that can challenge but also turbocharge all of those financial industries, he said. Consumer protection The crypto winter, a rapid decline in the value of Bitcoin and other assets and , has intensified concerns about whether any cryptocurrency can ever be considered stable. It also has the potential to raise many public-policy issues. And there will also be a public consultation on Britains first general regulatory approach to crypto assets, a sector where consumer protection has come under scrutiny in recent weeks. But the consultation will form part of a research and exploration phase and will help both the Bank of England and the government develop the plans over the following few years. When it came to regulating crypto, Mr Griffith told the committee, being right was more important than being first, given the UKs strong financial reputation. It will be a long lead-time activity, he said. Right balances The EU has set out the worlds first comprehensive set of rules for regulating crypto markets. They are due to receive final approval in the coming weeks and come into effect in 2024. Mr Griffith said the UK rules could be broader, to include decentralised finance, and everyone would benefit from greater transparency. We want the right regime, operated in the right way, that has the right balances in it, he told the committee. He also committed to hold at least six roundtables with those in the crypto industry, to expose us as regulators and decision makers. Source  BBC -Agencies",

On Tuesday (Jan 10), the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils  Local Government, addressing a letter to all district secretaries, instructed them to suspend the acceptance of deposits placed by the candidates of the local government (LG) election until further notice. He had given the directives pursuant to a decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday. The BASL, raising concerns about the matter, stressed that this move could result in the nomination process to the local authorities being brought to a standstill, thus effectively overturning the decision of the Returning Officers and the Elections Commissions to receive nominations, and thereafter conduct the elections. The association said it is firmly of the view that the Elections Commission should be allowed to exercise its powers mandated under the Constitution and the law without interference, urging the President and the government to refrain from taking any steps which could be constructed as an interference with the independent functions of the election body and with the exercise of the franchise by the people. The BASL called upon the chairman and members of the Elections Commission and all public officers to continue to act according to the Constitution and the law to ensure that the franchise of the people is protected.",

The petitioning party, who highlights that issuance of such a letter is completely against the law, also emphasizes that it violates the right of universal suffrage of the people and the basic human rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

Moreover, he also seeks an order directing all the Returning Officers across the island to refrain from complying with the letter issued by the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration.

Accordingly, Karadana was arrested over a complaint lodged by the former Presidential Advisor, pertaining to a video released by the former in which Marasinghe is allegedly seen sexually abusing her pet dog. On 24 December, Marasinghe had filed a complaint with the CID against Karadana, accusing her of doctoring the video in question, which was widely circulated on social media, and attempting to defame him. The Colombo Magistrates Court yesterday (10 Jan.) rejected a petition filed by Karadana on 03 January, requesting that she be released on anticipatory bail. The petition was rejected on the grounds that allowing for such a petition to proceed would hinder the ongoing investigations into the accusations of beastiality levelled against Marasinghe. Calling a media briefing along with SJB politician Hirunika Premachandra on December 23, Karadana released a video of Marasinghe allegedly sexually abusing her pet dog. Marasinghe subsequently vehemently denied the allegations, and went on to demand Rs. 1 billion from both Premachandra and Karadana for defamation. Accordingly, notices were issued to both Premachandra and Karadana, demanding Rs. 500 million from the former, and Rs. 1 billion from the latter, over recent claims made by the duo at the aforementioned press conference.",

Despite Secretary to the Ministry of Planatation, Janaka Dharamakeerthi having signed the said MoU on 16 December 2022, on behalf of the island nation, it was finalised on 05 January, with KSAPA Managing Director Raphael HARA signing it at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Paris. The focus of this MoU is to ensure the designing and execution of the Rubber Improvement of Value Chain  Embedded Smallholders Resilience (RIVER) Project to implement capacity-building activities in Monaragala, targeting farmer communities that are mainly oriented towards rubber production, the Ministry stated. The RIVER project intends to harness digital technologies and hands-on technical training to improve rural rubber smallholder farmers knowledge, performance, livelihoods, social outlook and environmental impacts, and is expected to strengthen the capacity of nearly 6,000 rubber smallholders within the Monaragala Rubber Development Project region. The project would be mainly funded by the FASEP grant of the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Recovery, while additional funds are to be provided by the Michelin Group of France as a foreign grant. The project will be designed and implemented by KSAPA, a French public liability company possessing the relevant expertise. Camso Loadstar in Sri Lanka, which is a subsidiary of the Michelin Group, will also contribute to the operational activities of the project. As part of the MoU, the French government will fund a 727,000 project to build capacity and strengthen the economy of the smallholders.

Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said the official confirmed death toll was five. Ustad Fareedun, an official at the Taliban-run information ministry, said 20 people were killed. He said the bomber had planned to enter the foreign ministry but failed. A photo of the area, confirmed by official sources, showed at least nine dead or wounded lying outside the ministry. The blast hit at about 4 p.m. (1130 GMT), Zadran said. No group immediately claimed responsibility. The Taliban-run administration has faced an insurgency by Islamic State militants who have targeted foreigners, including the Russian and Pakistani embassies and a hotel catering to Chinese businessmen. The blast took place at a busy time of day in a heavily fortified area surrounded by checkpoints on a street housing several ministries. Some countries, including Turkey and China, have embassies in the area. No country has recognised the Islamist Taliban, who took over Afghanistan in August 2021 with a speed and ease that took the world by surprise, following which President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and his government collapsed.

        "date": "January 12, 2023 07:17 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) bank has urged China and India to agree a write-down of their loans as soon as possible. The crisis-hit Indian Ocean state defaulted on its debt repayments and negotiated a 2.9bn (2.4bn) bailout. But the International Monetary Fund will not release the cash until China and India first agree to reduce Sri Lankas billions of dollars of debt. The governor of Sri Lankas central bank told BBC Newsnight it was in the interest of all parties to act quickly. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said: The sooner they give us finance assurances that would be better for both sides, as a creditor, as a debtor. That will help us to start repaying their obligations, he added. We dont want to be in this kind of situation, not meeting the obligations, for too long. That is not good for the country and for us. Thats not good for investor confidence in Sri Lanka. Though inflation in the country has eased slightly since last year, food prices in Sri Lanka last month were still 65 higher than a year earlier. The World Food Programme estimates that 8 million Sri Lankans - more than a third of the population - are food insecure, with hunger especially concentrated in rural areas. The economic turmoil sparked mass protests last year, which resulted in the former president fleeing the country in July. The World Bank estimates that Sri Lankas economy shrank by 9.2 in 2022 and that it will contract by a further 4.2 this year. Beijings lending to Sri Lanka stands at around 7bn while India is owed around 1bn. The Sri Lankan government had initially hoped to agree a new payment plan with China and India by the end of 2022. Mr Weerasinghe said it was possible an agreement could come later in January but added this all depends on the other parties - our creditors really have to make that decision. He added that Sri Lanka had now provided them with all the information on the countrys borrowings they needed. Independent analysts say China is concerned about what a substantial Sri Lankan debt write down could mean for its extensive lending to other developing countries through its Belt and Road programme. Meanwhile, India is said to be wary of getting inferior terms on debt restructuring to China, its regional rival. The US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said the greater onus to move was on China, as the biggest bilateral lender. We hope that they do not delay because Sri Lanka does not have time to delay. They need these assurances immediately, ambassador Chung told BBC Newsnight. For the sake of the Sri Lankan people, we certainly hope China is not a spoiler as they proceed to attain this IMF agreement. But if India and China do ultimately agree to write down their loans to Sri Lanka another potential problem looms in the form of private creditors, who account for 40 of the countrys external debt stock. In the years after Argentina plunged into economic crisis and default in 2001, some American hedge funds, rather than accepting a restructuring of the sovereign bonds they had bought on the open market, demanded full repayment and took the countrys government to court in the US to achieve it. A large group of international economists on 8 January called for Sri Lankas bonds, to be cancelled, writing: All of Sri Lankas creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis. Asked about Sri Lankas private bondholders, Mr Weerasinghe said: We engage with private creditors in good faith negotiations. And what we are seeing is that they are very positive and they are willing to engage with us. The governor said he expected that once agreement from bilateral creditors has been agreed the IMF funds could be distributed to Sri Lanka within four to six weeks. Source: BBC",

The 31-year-old is charged with four counts of sexually assaulting a woman he met on dating app Tinder in November last year, when he was in Australia to play in the T20 World Cup. Police say he had drinks with her in a bar in Sydneys CBD, before going back to her Rose Bay home in the eastern suburbs. The woman alleges Mr Gunathilaka choked her so forcefully during the assaults, she feared for her life and that despite asking him to wear a condom, she saw it on the floor next to her bed. In Downing Centre Local Court, Magistrate David Price, adjourned the matter until February 23, so a police brief of evidence can be finalised. Mr Gunathilakas solicitor said his defence team had not been served with any brief at all. The cricketer was not in court and has been excused from attending in February if he is represented by his solicitor. His bail, which has strict reporting conditions and a night curfew has been continued. The cricketer is not allowed to contact the woman making the accusations against him and he is not allowed to use social media or dating apps. He has also surrendered his passport and provided 200,000 surety. In November, detectives from the Sex Crimes Squad and Eastern Suburbs police formed Strike Force Veteran to investigate the allegations.

        "date": "January 12, 2023 10:09 am",
        "content": "Jeff Beck, the rock guitarist often regarded among the greatest of all time, has died, according to a statement posted to his official social media accounts. He was 78. On behalf of his family, it is with deep and profound sadness that we share the news of Jeff Becks passing, the statement said. After suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis, he peacefully passed away yesterday. His family ask for privacy while they process this tremendous loss. His representative, Melissa Dragich, confirmed the news to CNN via email. Beck rose to fame in the 60s when he replaced Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds. He left a year later to start his own group The Jeff Beck Group, featuring Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as part of the Yardbirds and inducted again in 2009 as a solo artist. An eight-time Grammy winner, Beck earned his first in 1985 for best rock instrumental performance for Escape. He went on to win five more times in that category. Last year, Beck toured with Johnny Depp, after the pair recorded a cover album together titled 18. Some of Becks most well-regarded songs include Heart Full of Soul, a 1965 single from the Yardbirds, I Aint Superstitious off his debut solo 1968 album with The Jeff Beck Group, Truth, and Freeway Jam from his second album, Blow by Blow in 1975. In reaction to Becks death, Stewart wrote on Twitter that Beck was one of the few guitarists that when playing live would actually listen to me sing and respond. Jeff, you were the greatest, my man, he said. Another of Becks former bandmates, Wood, also honored his memory on Wednesday, writing on Twitter that he was going to dearly miss him. I want to thank him for all our early days together in Jeff Beck Group, conquering America, he wrote. Musically, we were breaking all the rules, it was fantastic, groundbreaking rock n roll! KISS bassist and co-frontman Gene Simmons called Becks passing heartbreaking. No one played guitar like Jeff, Simmons wrote on Twitter. Please get a hold of the first two Jeff Beck Group albums and behold greatness. RIP. Originally from England, Beck is survived by his wife Sandra, according to his representative.

The decision was taken against the increased restrictions recently imposed on womens and girls rights by the Taliban, Cricket Australia (CA) said. Afghanistans Taliban-led administration imposed a ban on women attending universities in December 2022, while girls have been banned from high school since March. They have also been excluded from parks and gyms, foreign media reported. Australia and Afghanistan were scheduled to play three ODIs in the United Arab Emirates but CA scrapped the series after extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the Australian government. This decision follows the recent announcement by the Taliban of further restrictions on womens and girls education and employment opportunities and their ability to access parks and gyms, CA said in a statement. CA is committed to supporting growing the game for women and men around the world, including in Afghanistan, and will continue to engage with the Afghanistan Cricket Board in anticipation of improved conditions for women and girls in the country. We thank the Australian government for its support on this matter. The series formed part of the International Cricket Councils (ICC) Super League, where the top eight teams automatically qualify for the 2023 World Cup. Australia have already qualified for the tournament. Australia were scheduled to play a test match against Afghanistan in November 2021 but the fixture was postponed after the Taliban seized power in August of that year. Afghanistan remain the only ICC full member nation of without a womens team. They have continued to appear at ICC events since the Taliban takeover, however, and faced Australia during last years Twenty20 World Cup. ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice has said Afghanistans lack of commitment to womens cricket is a concern for the sports global governing body and that the matter will be discussed at its next board meeting. Our board has been monitoring progress since the change of regime, Allardice said. It is a concern that progress is not being made in Afghanistan and its something our board will consider at its next meeting in March. As far as we are aware, there isnt activity at the moment.

        "date": "January 12, 2023 01:59 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) board approval for Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is now expected in the second quarter of 2023, Standard Chartereds Global Research report revealed. Accordingly, the prediction was made owing to delays in securing financial assurances from its bilateral creditors, the report read, adding that this could further delay negotiations with commercial creditors, which are also expected to be pushed back to the second half of 2023. As a result, we expect a restructuring deal to be reached only by the end of 2023. Achieving the IMFs qualitative and quantitative targets, including the timely restructuring of commercial debt, could pose challenges and potential disrupt the IMF programme, the report read. Moroever, it was stated that Sri Lankas economy is likely to contract in 2023, while the external sector has improved due to import contraction. Meanwhile, solvency and liquidity risks within the financial-sector are also building, along with the looming domestic debt restructuring, it stated. The report read as follows: IMF approval likely to get pushed back to Q2-2023 IMF board approval for Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme has been delayed as negotiations with bilateral lenders have taken longer than expected. We now expect board approval to happen in Q2-2023 (versus Q1 previously), given delays in securing financing assurances from bilateral creditors. This could further delay negotiations with commercial creditors, which we expect will be pushed back to H2. As a result, we expect a restructuring deal to be reached only by the end of 2023. Achieving the IMFs qualitative and quantitative targets, including the timely restructuring of commercial debt, could pose challenges and potential disrupt the IMF programme. Against this backdrop, we expect Sri Lankas economy to contract a further 1.0 in 2023, following an estimated 7 contraction in 2022. This would make achieving a primary deficit target challenging. We now expect a primary deficit of 2.2 of GDP in 2023, versus the 0.7 target set by the IMF; thereby further pushing our 2023 fiscal deficit forecast to 11.0 from the previously estimated 9.0. The suspension of external debt service and the suppression of imports have helped to balance the external accounts; a gradual recovery in remittances and tourism flows has also helped. However, we are concerned about the liquidity and solvency of the banking sector, given its exposure to a weak economy and sovereign debt. We refresh our debt restructuring model to reflect our latest views on the economy and the restructuring timeline. Based on an exit yield of 11-15, we calculate a recovery value of 22-33 for the Eurobonds. Under our base-case assumption of a 13 exit yield, we estimate a recovery value of 28. Since our fair value estimates are similar to where the SRILAN curve is currently trading, we remain Market weight.",

LHS 475 b is in the constellation Octans and is 41 light-years away, which is relatively nearby. Scientists are still trying to determine if the planet has an atmosphere. Its possible LHS 475 b has no atmosphere or one made completely out of carbon dioxide, but one option can be totally eliminated. There are some terrestrial-type atmospheres that we can rule out, said Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Marylan. It cant have a thick methane-dominated atmosphere, similar to that of Saturns moon Titan. Researchers were scanning the skies using NASAs Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) when they came across the exoplanet, and used the Webbs spectrograph technology to further investigate. Spectrographs transmit light from an object to a spectrum, which can give information about the objects temperature, mass and chemical composition. These first observational results from an Earth-size, rocky planet open the door to many future possibilities for studying rocky planet atmospheres with Webb, said Mark Clampin, astrophysics division director at NASA headquarters in D.C. Webb is bringing us closer and closer to a new understanding of Earth-like worlds outside our solar system, and the mission is only just getting started. Source - NPR -Agencies",

        "title": "Dozens killed in protests against Perus government as unrest continues",
        "date": "January 12, 2023 03:41 pm",
        "content": "Protests against Peruvian President Dina Boluartes government that have left 48 people dead since they began a month ago spread through the south of the Andean country on Wednesday with new clashes reported in the tourist city of Cusco. Health officials in Cusco said 37 civilians and six police officers were injured after protesters tried to take over the citys airport, where many foreign tourists arrive to see sites including the nearby Incan citadel of Machu Picchu. Protests and road blockades against Boluarte and in support of ousted President Pedro Castillo were also seen in 41 provinces, mainly in Perus south. The unrest began in early December following the destitution and arrest of Castillo, Perus first president of humble, rural roots, following his widely condemned attempt to dissolve Congress and head off his own impeachment. The protest, mainly in neglected rural areas of the country still loyal to Castillo, are seeking immediate elections, Boluartes resignation, Castillos release and justice for the protesters killed in clashes with police. Some of the worst protest violence came on Monday when 17 people were killed in clashes with police in the city Juliaca near Lake Titicaca and protesters later attacked and burned a police officer to death. On Wednesday, health officials in Cusco said that a civilian died after being hit by gunfire. Earlier, Perus Ombudsmans Office had said that 39 civilians had been killed in clashes with police and another seven died in traffic accidents related to road blockades, as well as the fallen police officer. Wednesdays death increases the toll to 48. On Tuesday, Perus government announced a three-day curfew from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. in Puno. The National Prosecutors Office said it has requested information from the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and the defense and interior ministries for an investigation it has opened against Boluarte and other officials for the protest deaths. In Juliaca, in Puno province, a crowd marched alongside the coffins of the 17 people killed in Mondays protests. Dina killed me with bullets, said a piece of paper attached to the coffin of Eberth Mamani Arqui, in a reference to Perus current president. This democracy is no longer a democracy, chanted the relatives of the victims. As they passed a police station, which was guarded by dozens of officers, the marchers yelled: Murderers! Meanwhile, a delegation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights began a visit to Peru on to look into the protests and the police response. Boluarte was Castillos former running mate before taking over the presidency. She has said she supports a plan to push up to 2024 elections for president and congress originally scheduled for 2026. Shes also expressed support for judicial investigations into whether security forces acted with excessive force. But such moves have so far failed to quell the unrest, which after a short respite around the Christmas and New Years holidays have resumed with force in some of Perus poorest areas. Castillo, a political novice who lived in a two-story adobe home in the Andean highlands before moving to the presidential palace, eked out a narrow victory in elections in 2021 that rocked Perus political establishment and laid bare the deep divisions between residents of the capital, Lima, and the long-neglected countryside.

        "content": "Adarsha Karadana, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday (11 Jan.), has been released on bail by the Colombo Magistrates Court. Accordingly, Karadana was released on two surety bails of Rs. 500,000 each on the orders of Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis. Karadana was arrested by the Police Computer Crimes Division of the CID yesterday over a complaint filed by the former Presidential Advisor, pertaining to a video released by her in which Marasinghe is allegedly seen sexually abusing her pet dog. On 24 December, Marasinghe had filed a complaint with the CID against Karadana, accusing her of doctoring the video in question, which was widely circulated on social media, and attempting to defame him. On 10 January, the Colombo Magistrates Court rejected a petition filed by Karadana on 03 January, requesting that she be released on anticipatory bail. The petition was rejected on the grounds that allowing for such a petition to proceed would hinder the ongoing investigations into the accusations of beastiality levelled against Marasinghe. Calling a media briefing along with SJB politician Hirunika Premachandra on 23 December, Karadana released a video of Marasinghe allegedly sexually abusing her pet dog. Marasinghe subsequently vehemently denied the allegations, and went on to demand Rs. 1 billion from both Premachandra and Karadana for defamation. Accordingly, notices were issued to both Premachandra and Karadana, demanding Rs. 500 million from the former, and Rs. 1 billion from the latter, over recent claims made by the duo at the aforementioned press conference.",

While acknowledging that Canada has a sovereign right to decide such matters, the former Minister expressed his dissent towards the apparent double standards and hidden agendas adopted by Canada when assessing the facts in this regard. The LTTE recruited child-soldier, indiscriminately killed civillians and govt officials from all ethnicities. LKA endured this atrocity for 3 decades, Rajapaksa tweeted. On 10 January, the Canadian government imposed sanction on former Presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, Staff Sergeant of Sri Lanka Army Sunil Ratnayake and Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi over alleged human rights violations during Sri Lankas civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2009. Accordingly, the government of Canada further notified that the four Sri Lankans including the two former presidents will not be entitled to immigration or refugee protection within Canada. Furthermore, they will not be allowed to engage in any sort of dealings with Canada, or its citizens. The Canadian government also highlighted that any assets that the four Sri Lankans may hold in Canada would be frozen effectively. Yesterday (11 Jan.), Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry summoned the Canadian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Daniel Bood, to officially register Sri Lankas strong protest against the Canadian governments move. The LTTE recruited child-soldiers,indiscriminately killed civilians  govt officials from all ethnicities. LKA endured this atrocity for 3 decades!

The recalibration is to reflect changes in the relative creditworthiness among Sri Lankan issuers following Fitchs downgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CC from CCCUnder Criteria Observation on 1 December 2022. The rating agency said it typically does not assign Outlooks or apply modifiers to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below.

National scales are not comparable with Fitchs international rating scales or with other countries national rating scales. The National Ratings of the Sri Lankan banks consider their creditworthiness relative to other issuers in the country. The recalibration of the Sri Lankan National Rating scale has resulted in downgrades of the National Long-Term Ratings of the following banks: - Bank of Ceylon - Peoples Bank - Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC - Hatton National Bank PLC - Sampath Bank PLC - Cargills Bank Limited - DFCC Bank PLC - National Development Bank PLC - Seylan Bank PLC - Nations Trust Bank PLC Meanwhile, other Sri Lankan banks national ratings, which are not mentioned in this commentary, have not been affected by the recalibration exercise.",
