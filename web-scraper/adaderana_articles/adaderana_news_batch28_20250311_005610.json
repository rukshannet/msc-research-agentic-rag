        "date": "June 1, 2023 01:52 pm",
        "content": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called on his top national security officials to think about worst case scenarios and prepare for stormy seas, as the ruling Communist Party hardens efforts to counter any perceived internal and external threats. The complexity and difficulty of the national security issues we now face have increased significantly, Xi said Tuesday at a meeting of the partys National Security Commission, state news agency Xinhua reported. We must adhere to bottom-line thinking and worst-case-scenario thinking, and get ready to undergo the major tests of high winds and rough waves, and even perilous, stormy seas, he added. The latest stern instructions from Xi, Chinas most powerful leader in decades, comes as Beijing faces a host of challenges, from a struggling economy to what it sees as an increasingly hostile international environment. In face of what he called a complex and grave situation, Xi said China must speed up the modernization of its national security system and capabilities, with a focus on making them more effective in actual combat and practical use. He also called for China to push ahead with the construction of a national security risk monitoring and early warning system, enhance national security education and improve the management of data and artificial intelligence security. Since coming to power a decade ago, Xi has made national security a key paradigm that permeates all aspects of Chinas governance, experts say. He has expanded the concept of national security to cover everything from politics, economy, defense, culture and ecology to cyberspace. It extends from the deep sea and the polar regions to space, as well as big data and artificial intelligence. Under Xis notion of comprehensive national security, China has introduced a raft of legislation to protect itself against perceived threats, including laws on counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity, foreign non-government organizations, national intelligence and data security. Most recently, it broadened the scope of its already sweeping counter-espionage law from covering state secrets and intelligence to any documents, data, materials or items related to national security and interests. Everything in Xis PRC is national security and there is an intensifying focus on better coordinating security and development, with the security side winning out over the economics side it appears, Bill Bishop, a long-time China observer, wrote in the Sinocism newsletter, referring to China with its official name, the Peoples Republic of China. In Hong Kong, a sweeping national security law was imposed by Beijing to stamp out dissent after huge democracy protests roiled the city. The perception that security has replaced economic growth as Beijings top priority is compounded by multiple recent raids on foreign companies, including American consultancy Bain  Company and due diligence firm Mintz Group. The raids have spooked international businesses, at a time when the Chinese government is trying to woo foreign investment to help revive a slowing economy hampered by three years of zero-Covid restrictions. In March, Chinese authorities detained a Japanese employee of Astellas Pharma in Beijing on suspected espionage  the 17th Japanese national to have been detained in China since the counter-espionage law was introduced in 2014. At Tuesdays meeting, Xi said China must proactively shape a secured external environment to better maintain the security of the countrys opening up and promote the deep integration of development and security.

        "content": "Chief of Defence Staff, General Shavendra Silva has sent a letter of demand to MP Wimal Weerawansa alleging the parliamentarian of bringing him into disrepute. General Silva says MP Weerawansa, during a recent book launch, has made defamatory remarks, accusing him being complicit in a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Weerawansa is said to have made the accusations in question during the launch of his book Nine; The Hidden Story in April. The book launch also came under strong criticism by US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, who denounced the parliamentarians claims that the United States was part of a regime change conspiracy during the Aragalaya anti-government protests last year. Chung, expressing her disappointment, said MP Weerawansa had made baseless allegations and spread outright lies in a book that should be labelled fiction. At the book launch, MP Weerawansa had made claims about a conspiracy, purportedly hatched with the complicity of the United States, to topple the government of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in order to form an interim government, and of a suspicious meeting held in India on July 07, 2022, at which General Silva was in attendance. Later, the Defence Ministry issued a clarification, stressing that the gathering was in fact Deputy National Security Advisor Level Meeting of the Colombo Security Conclave  a security conference organized between friendly countries in the South Indian Ocean Region. The ministry said General Silva attended had participated in the meeting as a representative of Sri Lanka, under the directives and approval of the former president.",

        "title": "Scientists expand search for signs of intelligent alien life",
        "date": "June 1, 2023 02:46 pm",
        "content": "Scientists have expanded the search for technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations by monitoring a star-dense region toward the core of our galaxy for a type of signal that could be produced by potential intelligent aliens that until now has been ignored. Efforts to detect alien technological signatures previously have focused on a narrowband radio signal type concentrated in a limited frequency range or on single unusual transmissions. The new initiative, scientists said on Wednesday, focuses on a different signal type that perhaps could enable advanced civilizations to communicate across the vast distances of interstellar space. These wideband pulsating signals for which the scientists are monitoring feature repetitive patterns  a series of pulses repeating every 11 to 100 seconds and spread across a few kilohertz, similar to pulses used in radar transmission. The search involves a frequency range covering a bit less than a tenth the width of an average FM radio station. The signals searched in our work would belong to the category of deliberate we are here type beacons from alien worlds, said Akshay Suresh, a Cornell University graduate student in astronomy and lead author of a scientific paper published in the Astronomical Journal describing the new effort. Aliens may possibly use such beacons for galaxy-wide communications, for which the core of the Milky Way is ideally placed. One may imagine aliens using such transmissions at the speed of light to communicate key events, such as preparations for interstellar migration before the explosive death of a massive star, Suresh added. The effort, called the Breakthrough Listen Investigation for Periodic Spectral Signals (BLIPSS), is a collaboration between Cornell, the SETI Institute research organization and Breakthrough Listen, a 100 million initiative to search for advanced extraterrestrial life. In the realm of searching for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, we embark on a journey to detect signals from technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, said astronomer and study co-author Vishal Gajjar of the SETI Institute and University of California, Berkeley. However, the nature of these signals remains a mystery, leaving us uncertain about their specific characteristics. Hence, it becomes crucial to explore a diverse array of signals that are unlikely to occur naturally in the cosmic environment, Gajjar added. Using a ground-based radio telescope in West Virginia, BLIPSS has focused upon a sliver of the sky less than one-200th of the area covered by the moon, stretching toward the center of the Milky Way roughly 27,000 light years away. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). This area contains about 8 million stars, Suresh said. If extraterrestrial life forms exist, they presumably would populate rocky planets orbiting in what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around a star  not too hot and not too cold. The scientists in the various monitoring efforts passively scan for signals of alien beings and do not actively send their own signals advertising our presence on Earth. In my opinion, transmission of we are here type beacons comes with the danger of potentially inviting aliens with unknown intentions to the Earth, Suresh said. Deliberate transmissions to potential aliens from Earth should be considered only if by global consensus humankind deems it safe and appropriate, Gajjar said. In my personal opinion, as a relatively young species in the grand cosmic scale, it would be prudent for us to focus on listening and investigating before embarking on deliberate transmissions, Gajjar said. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that sending signals on behalf of the entire Earth raises political and ethical considerations. Presently, it would not be appropriate for a single country or entity to make decisions on behalf of the entire planet. No aliens yet have been detected in the monitoring efforts. Thus far, we have not come across any definitive evidence. However, its important to note that our exploration has been limited to a relatively small parameter space, Gajjar said.

        "content": "The licensed commercial banks (LCBs) are expected to bring down the lending rate for businesses now that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has relaxed its monetary policy stance, CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says. Addressing the special press briefing held in Colombo to announce the CBSLs Monetary Policy Review today (June 01), Dr. Weerasinghe said the inflation is now coming towards the target range much earlier than expected, supported by the currency appreciation, the adjustment in the fuel and petroleum prices and global prices. Taking this into account, the Central Bank arrived at the decision to relax monetary conditions and made a strong adjustment of policy rates, Dr. Weerasinghe continued, adding that he is hopeful the LCBs will bring down the lending rates for businesses. The Central Bank today cut the interest rates for the first time in nearly three years, lowering the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) and Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) to 14.00 percent and 13.00 percent, respectively. The decision was taken at the Central Banks Monetary Board meeting on Wednesday (May 31), in a bid to ease monetary conditions in line with the faster-than-expected slowing of inflation, gradual dissipation of inflationary pressures and further anchoring of inflation expectations. Today is the start of the policy easing cycle. We reduced our policy rates significantly by 250 basis points, Dr. Weerasinghe told the reporters. Speaking further, he said the Central Bank has purchased USD 1,671 million from the market on the net basis so far this year, while USD 662 million was purchased in the month of May alone, marking the highest monthly purchase. The Central Bank governor also expressed confidence in bringing down the inflation to a single digit by the end of July. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka expects to settle the USD 200 million borrowed from Bangladesh by August or September this year, Dr. Weerasinghe added.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas economy is gradually recovering from the crisis thanks to the correct policies including the collective efforts of the people, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, delivering a special statement on the governments efforts over the past nine months to revive Sri Lankas economy. The Presidents Media Division (PMD) says the objective of this address is to provide the public with a comprehensive understanding of Sri Lankas national transformation roadmap and to present the proposed strategies for accomplishing the envisioned objectives. In his speech, the Head of State lengthily outlined the forthcoming stages of the countrys social, economic, and political reform agenda which he said would be based on four key pillars: (1) Fiscal and Financial Reforms, (2) Investment Drive, (3) Social Protection and Governance, and (4) Transformation of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). To bring about fiscal and financial reforms, the government aims to implement necessary reforms that will ensure long-term sustainability of public debt and the stability of the economy, he said adding that, the government ultimately wants to rebuild confidence in the Sri Lankan market. In the pursuit of economic stability, Wickremesinghe said the government has implemented various cost reduction and containment measures since May 2022. He noted that the government is taking further steps to minimize unnecessary expenses, by halting unnecessary expenditure, streamlining state activities to reduce costs, designing cost-effective state operations, and leveraging automation and digitalization to reduce costs while delivering quality services. As investments play a crucial role in boosting a countrys economy, Wickremesinghe said the government recognizes the significance of collaboration between the public and private sectors. Our goal is to transform Sri Lanka into an export-oriented economy that is globally recognized, following the successful models of countries like South Korea and Singapore. Further, the government aims to prioritize modern and sustainable efforts such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and digitization, the president continued. He went on to reveal plans to make a special invitation to the private sector to submit their own business proposals that align with the governments vision of modernization and sustainability, promising to ensure transparency and openness by publicizing this call for proposals through mass media in a formal manner. Wickremesinghe, speaking on the importance of fostering an environment conducive for investment, highlighted the need to reform Sri Lankas trade practices, which have been structured under strict protectionist policies. It is time to remove these barriers that have discouraged investors and to promote a more open and welcoming approach. Speaking on social protection and governance, the president promised to address social safety net concerns by engaging various government ministries, departments, agencies, civil society representatives, and subject matter experts in the integration process of social security measures. Wickremesinghe added that a special task force would be formed to combat corruption across all sectors, including regulation, procurement, and political corruption. We are committed to implementing anti-corruption practices through a government mechanism that emphasizes accountability via modern techniques such as digitization. With regards to transformation of SOEs, Wickremesinghe said the government has already initiated the preparation of a restructuring plan for public enterprises. Entities like the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and SriLankan Airlines have incurred significant operating losses, equivalent to 1.6 of the countrys GDP in 2021. Stressing that it is unjust to burden the citizens with this debt, Wickremesinghe said necessary reforms must be undertaken urgently in the SOEs to ensure the turnaround and success of these enterprises. Speaking further, he said Sri Lanka is ready to embark on a journey of growth and prosperity, as the countrys weakened economy is now returning towards stability. Slamming fear-mongering tactics of certain groups spreading false information about the governments reform agenda to mislead the public, the president said it is important to stay committed to economic reforms. He reiterated his commitment to prevent any regression of the country to its previous state, emphasizing his determination to transform Sri Lanka into a fully developed nation by 2048. Outlining the governments efforts to revive the countrys economy, he noted that the economic reforms would decrease cost of living, improve standards of living, provide relief for the poor, create a culture of transparency and generate new opportunities for businesses to grow and thrive. The implementation of our economic reforms serves only to achieve sustainable development and prosperity for our country. Through these reforms, we will accelerate Sri Lankas modernization, expand our market, and encourage greater contributions from the international community toward our development. He applauded the resilience of all Sri Lankans who navigated through challenging times, driven by their love for the country and stated that by persisting a little longer on this trajectory, an economically stable future could be achieved devoid of hardships. Acknowledging that the journey ahead is not easy and that numerous challenges are anticipated, the president said he is determined to overcome these obstacles. Our government is committed to always acting in the best interest of our country.",

The Brazilian prosecutors office accused Collor, 73, of having received around 30 million reais (6 million) in bribes from a subsidiary of state-run oil company Petrobras. The top court convicted the former senator in mid-May, but justices had still to decide on his sentence, which he can appeal. Collor was a dashing, liberalizing politician who became Brazils first democratically elected president in 1989 after a two-decade military dictatorship, but he resigned three years later after the lower house of Congress impeached him. A rakish, dynastic heir with a penchant for expensive sports cars, Collor was one of Brazils original free-marketeers who opposed Brazils entrenched protectionism and sought to privatize state-run firms in his curtailed presidency. He continued in politics and later served 26 years as a conservative senator for the northeastern state of Alagoas, where his well-to-do family was from. He chaired the foreign relations committee He lost his seat in last years elections. Collor himself could not immediately be reached for comment. In a note released by the time of his conviction, his defense lawyers said Collor did not commit any crime and expressed confidence that he would ultimately be exonerated. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 2, 2023 06:47 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan authorities are showing strong commitment to implementing economic reforms, however, the reform momentum must continue amid the challenging economic recovery process, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Deputy Managing Director Kenji Okamura said after concluding his visit to the island nation. Sri Lankas economy is showing tentative signs of improvement, in part due to the implementation of critical policy actions. But the economic recovery remains challenging. Now, more than ever, it is essential to continue the reform momentum under strong ownership by both the authorities and the Sri Lankan people. The IMF-supported economic program aims to achieve macroeconomic stabilization, restore debt sustainability, safeguard financial stability, strengthen governance, and protect the vulnerable. Okamura thanked Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and other senior government officials, parliamentarians and private sector representatives for having constructive discussions with him, which allowed him to deepen my understanding of the challenges Sri Lanka is facing and to reiterate the IMFs commitment to support Sri Lankas efforts to surmount these challenges. During the discussions, the IMF official said he discussed the importance of fiscal measures, in particular revenue measures, for a return to macroeconomic stability. I was encouraged by the authorities commitment to negotiate a debt strategy in a timely and transparent manner. Further, Okamura noted that continued open dialogue with the creditors would help to reach restructuring agreements to restore debt sustainability in line with the program targets. Undoubtably, safeguarding the stability of the financial sector is of utmost importance in this process, he added. The focus of the talks also fell on the importance of strengthening governance  a central pillar of the economic program. Okamura underscored that the hard-won gains of Sri Lankan people who have relentlessly supported the reform effort can only be safeguarded by good governance. During the visit to the dock yard, port terminal, and the Colombo port city, Okamura said he was impressed to see continued economic activity which is a testament to the resiliency of the Sri Lankan economy. He emphasized the importance of decisive implementation of structural reforms which can attract investment and boost growth. As Sri Lanka navigates its way through the economic crisis, it remains imperative to protect the poor and the most vulnerable that have been disproportionately affected by the crisis. I was heartened to see that the authorities have stepped up efforts to increase public spending on social safety nets while improving targeting and coverage for those who need it. Recalling the long-standing relations between Sri Lanka and the IMF, Okamura said he looks forward to continued partnership through the EFF-supported economic program.",

        "title": "U.S. Congress approves debt-limit suspension, averting default",
        "date": "June 2, 2023 08:58 am",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed bipartisan legislation backed by President Joe Biden that lifts the governments 31.4 trillion debt ceiling, averting what would have been a first-ever default. The Senate voted 63-36 to approve the bill that was passed on Wednesday by the House of Representatives, as lawmakers raced against the clock following months of partisan bickering between Democrats and Republicans. The Treasury Department had warned it would be unable to pay all its bills on June 5 if Congress failed to act by then. We are avoiding default tonight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday as he steered the legislation through his 100-member chamber. Biden praised Congress timely action. This bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people, the Democratic president said in a statement, adding that he will sign it into law as soon as possible. He said he would make an additional statement on Friday. Before the final vote, senators tore through nearly a dozen amendments - rejecting all of them during a late-night session in anticipation of Mondays deadline. With this legislation, the statutory limit on federal borrowing will be suspended until Jan. 1, 2025. Unlike most other developed countries, the United States limits the amount of debt the government can borrow, regardless of any spending allocated by the legislature. Schumer and his Republican counterpart Minority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered on their promise to do all they could to speed along the bill negotiated by Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. America can breathe a sigh of relief, Schumer said in remarks to the Senate. TIME IS A LUXURY Republicans had blocked passage of any debt limit increase until they locked in some wide-ranging spending cuts in a move they said would begin addressing a rapidly escalating national debt. Biden instead pushed for tax increases on the wealthy and corporations to help address the growing debt. Republicans refused to consider any sort of tax hikes. Both parties walled off the sprawling Social Security and Medicare retirement and healthcare programs from cuts, and McCarthy refused to consider reducing spending on the military or veterans. That left a somewhat narrow band of domestic discretionary programs to bear the brunt of spending cuts. In the end, Republicans won about 1.5 trillion in reductions over 10 years, which may or may not be fully realized. Their opening bid was for 4.8 trillion in savings over a decade. Treasury technically hit its limit on borrowing in January. Since then it has been using extraordinary measures to patch together the money needed to pay the governments bills. Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and congressional leaders all acknowledged that triggering a debt default for lack of funds would have serious ramifications. Those included sending shock waves through global financial markets, possibly triggering job losses and a recession in the United States and raising families interest rates on everything from home mortgages to credit card debt. Schumer drove that point home even as he steered the bill toward final passage. A default, he said, would almost certainly cause another recession. It would be a nightmare for our economy and millions of American families. It would take years, years to recover from. The Republican-controlled House passed the bill on Wednesday evening in a 314-117 vote. Most of those who voted against the bill were Republicans. Time is a luxury the Senate does not have, Schumer said on Thursday. Any needless delay or any last-minute holdups would be an unnecessary and even dangerous risk. Among the amendments debated were ones to force deeper spending cuts than those contained in the House-passed bill and stopping the speedy final approval of a West Virginia energy pipeline. COBBLED OVER WEEKS Republican Senator Roger Marshall offered an amendment to impose new border controls as high numbers of immigrants arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border. His measure, he said, would put an end to the culture of lawlessness at our southern border. The Senate defeated the amendment, however. Democrats said it would strip away protections for child migrants and rob American farmers of needed workers. Some Republicans also wanted to beef up defense spending beyond the increased levels contained in the House-passed bill. In response, Schumer said the spending caps in this legislation would not constrain Congress in approving additional money for emergencies, including helping Ukraine in its battle against Russia. This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the Senates ability to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia and our other adversaries, and respond to ongoing and growing national security threats, including Russias evil ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine, Schumer said. The bill was cobbled together over weeks of intensive negotiations between senior aides for Biden and McCarthy. The main argument was over spending for the next couple of years on discretionary programs such as housing, environmental protections, education and medical research that Republicans wanted to cut deeply. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would save 1.5 trillion over 10 years. That is below the 3 trillion in deficit reduction, mainly through new taxes, that Biden proposed. The last time the United States came this close to default was in 2011. That standoff hammered financial markets, led to the first-ever downgrade of the governments credit rating and pushed up the nations borrowing costs. There was less drama this time as it became clear last week that Biden and McCarthy would find a deal with enough bipartisan support to get through Congress. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "A joint operation by the Indian Coast Guard, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Customs has foiled an attempt to smuggle gold bars weighing 32.689kg into India, via the sea route from Sri Lanka. Launched on Tuesday 30th May, this operation was carried out based on specific input from DRI regarding the smuggling of contraband from the island nation to India. In anticipation of the smuggling attempt, Indian agencies maintained close surveillance of fishing vessels operating in the Gulf of Mannar and those near the India-Sri Lanka International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). The agencies apprehended two boats  a suspicious boat approaching the Mandapam fishing harbour in Tamil Nadus Ramanathapuram district and another suspicious vessel south of Mandapam. The sea route between northern Sri Lanka and the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, India, is highly porous and has a lot of fishing activity. In a matter of a few hours and a few dozen kilometres, it is possible to cross over the IMBL and reach the waters of the other side. The first boat attempted to evade the agencies and then dumped the consignment overboard before its three-member crew was apprehended by the agencies. Upon interception, the second boat was said to have 21.269 kgs of smuggled gold and its two-member crew was taken into custody. To recover the consignment that was dumped overboard by the first vessel, the Indian Coast Guard launched a diving operation at the site and recovered the gold consignment from the seabed, on Thursday. It contained gold bars weighing 11.6 kg. The entire seized consignment is valued at Rs. 20.20 crore or 2.5 million. The seized contraband and suspects are in DRI custody for legal action.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says efforts are being taken to establish the Climate Change University next year. He revealed this during a briefing held on climate change and green growth at the Presidential Secretariat today (June 02). President Wickremesinghe, expressing his perspective on the International Climate Change University, emphasized that it is a post-graduate institution solely focused on research and does not offer undergraduate courses. Any country or organization that contributes to the university becomes a stakeholder and gains membership on the Board of Governance. The Korean Exim Bank has expressed interest in partnering with the university. President Wickremesinghe urged that all future research in the field of climate change should be conducted at this institution. He added that prestigious institutions like Harvard and MIT have expressed interest in collaboration. The president also requested the consideration of short-term courses for government officials. During the briefing, the five thematic areas established in a previous meeting with President Wickremesinghe were extensively discussed. These areas include the Climate Change Office, Green Finance Facilitation, International Climate Change University, Nature Positive Green Growth, and Innovative Management Support. Specific attention was given to regions lagging behind in these areas, such as marine pollution and electric car mobility. President Wickremesinghe instructed the authorities to address these concerns, while involving the private sector and international organizations in the efforts.",

        "content": "At least 233 people are now known to have been killed and 900 injured in a multiple train collision in Indias eastern Odisha state, officials say. More than 200 ambulances were sent to the scene in Balasore district, says Odishas chief secretary Pradeep Jena. One passenger train is thought to have derailed before being struck by another on the adjacent track late on Friday. It is Indias worst train crash this century. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise further. Indian Railways said the two services involved were the Coromandel Express and the Howrah Superfast Express. A total of 233 bodies had been recovered so far, Mr Jena said. He said earlier that more than 100 additional doctors had been mobilised. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was distressed by the incident and his thoughts were with the bereaved families. Rescue ops are under way at the site of the mishap and all possible assistance is being given to those affected, he tweeted. Meanwhile, Home Minister Amit Shah labelled the incident deeply agonising. One male survivor said that 10 to 15 people fell on me when the accident happened and everything went haywire. I was at the bottom of the pile. I got hurt in my hand and also the back of my neck. When I came out of the train bogie, I saw someone had lost their hand, someone had lost their leg, while someones face was distorted, the survivor told Indias ANI news agency. A day of mourning has been announced in the state. It is believed that several carriages from the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express derailed at about 19:00 local time (13:30 GMT), with some of them ending up on the opposite track. Another train - the Howrah Superfast Express travelling from Yesvantpur to Howrah - is then thought to have hit the overturned carriages. Indian officials said that a goods train - which was stationary at the site - was also involved in the incident. They provided no further details. Some surviving passengers were seen rushing in to help rescue those trapped in the wreckage. Local bus companies were also helping to transport wounded passengers. India has one of the largest train networks in the world and accidents are common, despite successive governments investing hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the infrastructure, says BBC South Asia regional editor Anbarasan Ethirajan. Indias worst train disaster was in 1981, when an overcrowded passenger train was blown off the tracks and into a river during a cyclone in Bihar state, killing at least 800 people.

        "content": "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has arrested three employees of a state bank in Oddamavadi for stealing pawned gold jewellery to the tune of LKR 20 million. Among the arrestees are the deputy manager, the operations manager and the service assistant of the said state bank. The trio is accused of stealing 873g of pawned gold jewellery from the depository of the bank. A CID team initiated probes into the incident after receiving a complaint about several pieces of gold jewellery that had gone missing from the depository of the bank. An individual, upon visiting the bank to retrieve the gold jewellery he had pawned in November last year, had learned that the items were, in fact, missing. After conducting an internal inspection, the banks employees realized that 13 packets of gold jewellery have disappeared from the depository. The banks management subsequently suspended the duties of the deputy manager over the incident. During the interrogations, he had confessed that two other female employees  an operations manager and a service assistant  too were complicit in the theft. They were later placed under arrest by the CID investigators. They have used the depositorys keys, which were in their possession, to steal the gold jewellery on three occasions. After stealing 13 packets of gold jewellery, the trio had sold them to jewellery shops in the area for LKR 13.7 million out of which LKR 5.7 million was retained by the deputy manager to settle a loan. The operations manager, meanwhile, held on to LKR 5 million, which she deposited in a bank for her daughter. The service assistant had purchased a three-wheeler and a piece of land from the LKR 3 million she received. The trio was remanded until June 16 after being produced before the Valachchenai Magistrates Court on Friday (June 02).",

        "content": "Human remains discovered in 45 bags in western Mexico appear to resemble the features of several missing call center employees, state prosecutors said in a statement late on Thursday. The Jalisco Prosecutors Office said the remains found in the municipality of Zapopan were still subject to forensic tests to formally identify the bodies. According to preliminary information, the findings...in Zapopan coincided with the physical characteristics of some of the young people being searched for, the statement said. Authorities made the discovery in a ravine on the outskirts of Jaliscos capital city, Guadalajara, earlier this week as part of a search for seven call center workers in their 20s and 30s who had disappeared. An eighth person, potentially linked to the group, is also missing. On Tuesday, security minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez told reporters that initial investigations showed that the call center workers were carrying out some type of real estate fraud and some type of telephone extortion. Authorities have been working to determine how many individuals the remains in the bags relate to, their identities, and how they died. Local media said the remains belonged to both men and women. The state prosecutors office said in a statement that the discovery came following a tip-off. Prosecutors added that difficult terrain and lack of sunlight had complicated the investigation. According to government data, over 100,000 people are currently missing in Mexico, where organized crime has ravaged parts of the country. Jalisco state, in particular, is a hotbed for major cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), and rivals Nueva Plaza. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (June 03) urged all political parties to unite to resurrect the country from its ongoing economic crisis. He said even if all political parties in the parliament unite, none of them currently have a 50 voter base, and thus emphasized the need for unity among the parties, not solely for the purpose of elections, but to steer the country towards recovery from the ongoing economic crisis. During his address at the 20232024 National Law Conference held at Nuwara Eliya Grand Hotel, Wickremesinghe went on to highlight the loss of faith in elections and politics among the majority of the population, including the youth. The president further emphasized that while the re-establishment of law and order, as well as political and economic stability, is crucial, it does not imply that Sri Lanka has completely overcome the crisis. He emphasized the necessity of making significant commitments in the future to ensure the success of the entire process. Reflecting on the economic challenges faced by the country ten months ago, the President mentioned that it was an unprecedented situation in history. He acknowledged the efforts made by himself and his team to alleviate the crisis during that time. Addressing the event, President Wickremesinghe further said: This is the first time that the National Law Conference focuses on the process of economic restructuring and its development. I believe selecting Nuwara Eliya as our venue is fitting. It was here that Governor Edward Barnes resided, the man who played a significant role in promoting coffee cultivation and laying the foundation for our plantation economy. As we gather here today, it has been 10-11 months since our country faced a state of failure. However, we have managed to establish law and order, political stability, and economic stability in our nation. Yet, we are aware that this stability is only temporary, and we still have a long road ahead to overcome the challenges we face. Just ten months ago, our entire economy was severely tested, a situation unprecedented in our countrys history. Although our focus in the past 10 months has been on restoring law and order, political stability, and economic stability, it does not imply that we have completely overcome the economic crisis. Regrettably, the majority of our people have lost faith in elections and politics. Whether it is the Parliament, the judiciary, the media, private sector trade unions, or professionals, a vast number of citizens lack trust in the entire system that governs our nation.",

The only time the leatherbacks come ashore is to lay eggs, which they do on sandy, undisturbed beaches. After laying eggs, they immediately return to the sea.

So far, close to 200 passengers from the train accident site have been brought in, and the numbers continue to rise. The hospital is the largest in the state of Odisha, but is still three hours drive from the accident site. The hospital staff - from junior doctors to nurses and ward boys - have been lined up and waiting in groups to assist patients as they are brought in. Wards have been expanded to handle the numbers coming in. The constant sounds of whistles and announcements by hospital authorities interrupt the chaos. Family members of the injured are waiting anxiously outside praying for their relatives wellbeing. But many are still looking for their loved ones, not knowing their whereabouts. There is a counter set up to assist people who cannot locate their family members. It is crowded, and the lists run long. Some people met by the BBC ran from the accident site to nearby hospitals before coming to the facility in Cuttack - searching for their families who were on board the trains. An investigation into the cause of the crash has been launched, although Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has blamed technical reasons. Survivors and eyewitnesses have described chaotic scenes and the heroic efforts of people from nearby villages to save trapped passengers. Mukesh Pandit, who was trapped for half an hour before being rescued, told the BBC he heard a thunderous sound shortly before the carriage overturned. Four passengers who were travelling from my village have survived, but a lot of people are injured or still missing. A lot of people died in the coach I was travelling in, he added. Residents of the neighbouring villages were among the first to reach the site of the accident and start the rescue operation. India has one of the largest train networks in the world with millions of passengers using it daily, but a lot of the railway infrastructure needs improving. Trains can get very packed at this time of year, with a growing number of people travelling during school holidays. Both passenger trains involved in the crash were full and had many more people on the waiting list, according to passenger lists on the Indian rail ministry website reviewed by the BBC. Indias worst train disaster was in 1981, when an overcrowded passenger train was blown off the tracks and into a river during a cyclone in Bihar state, killing about 800 people.

        "date": "June 3, 2023 09:57 pm",
        "content": "The Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka (JSASL) has expressed its profound discontent with certain names proposed for the imminent appointments due to be made to the High Court. In a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the JSA raised concerns over the names of Mr. Tikiri Jayathilaka, currently serving as the Deputy Secretary General of the Parliament, and another officer from the Attorney Generals (AGs) Department, being amongst the four names proposed for the High Court appointments. Jayathilaka previously served as a magistrate from 2016 until he resigned to take over his appointment as an Assistant Secretary of the Parliament. JSA deems his exposure to a non-legal institution a disqualification to be re-admitted as a member of the judiciary at any future stage. Pertaining to Jayathilakas candidacy, the JASL noted that a previous request made by him to assign him to the parliamentary staff as a secondment was initially refused by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), thereby making his candidacy a circumvention of the JSCs precedence. The recommendation of the JSC under certain circumstances at this stage despite its previous decision cannot validate or substantiate his re-entering the judiciary, the letter read in this regard. Meanwhile, speaking in relation to the potential appointment of the official from the AGs Department, the JSA raised concerns about the individual in question being a far junior officer compared to the judicial officers who are next in line in judicial seniority. Thus, the JSA requested President Wickremesinghe to refrain from appointing Jayathilaka to the High Court and to consider matters such as seniority with regard to the appointment of an officer from the AGs Department.",

In one of the most devastating train accidents in recent history, two passenger trains and a goods carriage collided on three separate tracks at Bahanaga Bazar Station in Balasore district on Friday evening, leading to the derailment and severe damage to 17 coaches. Mr Vaishnaw, while speaking to news agency ANI, also said that the track is expected to be restored by Sunday, following his review of the restoration work. The root cause of this accident has been identified. PM Modi inspected the site yesterday. We will try to restore the track today. All bodies have been removed. Our target is to finish the restoration work by Wednesday morning so that trains can start running on this track, he said. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has deployed Mi-17 helicopters to aid in the evacuation of the dead and injured, working in coordination with the civil administration and Indian Railways. According to the Eastern Command, these concerted efforts have been crucial in managing the aftermath of this tragic incident. The Railways Ministry has been actively engaged in the restoration work, which has been ongoing at war footing in Balasore. In a tweet, the Ministry said that over 1,000 people, more than seven Poclain Machines, two Accident Relief Trains, and three to four Railway and Road Cranes have been deployed for early restoration.

        "title": "Sri Lankas country assessment on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism due soon",
        "date": "June 4, 2023 02:09 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed that Sri Lankas next country assessment on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism is slated to commence soon. Addressing the National Law Conference yesterday (03 June), President Wickremesinghe noted that the holds immense significance as it directly impacts the countrys ease of doing business rating and its ability to attract foreign investments. This assessment holds significant weight as Sri Lankas compliance in these areas is crucial for enhancing the ease of doing business rating and attracting foreign investments, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. As discussions unfold, it becomes apparent that addressing the identified gaps in the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework is of utmost importance. Failure to rectify these gaps poses a potential risk of Sri Lanka once again being labelled as a country with strategic deficiencies. Such a designation could have severe adverse effects on the countrys economic development. Recognizing the urgency, it is imperative for Sri Lanka to prioritize bridging these gaps, which will also support the governance and anti-corruption framework, ensuring the successful implementation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. During the discussions, various issues have come to light. One major concern is the bureaucratic hurdles and legal complexities faced by the citizens, resulting in frequent court visits. Participants reflect upon the past, where significant infrastructure projects were accomplished within specified timeframes, even amidst an ongoing war. However, the current administrative structure and an excess of legal professionals hinder the timely completion of projects, demanding a comprehensive review. To tackle these challenges effectively, a recommendation is made for all stakeholders, including the bench, the bar, the government, and the parliament, to convene and compile a joint report. This collaborative effort would provide a clear roadmap for addressing the backlog and delays caused by legal proceedings. Additionally, it is emphasized that the formulation of a national policy, determined by parliament rather than the cabinet, is essential to resolve various issues and ensure broad agreement on critical subjects. Following is the speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe: Well, its been a long and fruitful discussion, but I dont think I should keep you all too long because yesterday, I was given 15 minutes, but I nearly took twice that time. As the representative of the government, along with the three panel members, I will address the issues raised. One of the primary complaints has been the bureaucracy, laws, and the increasing frequency of court visits. Reflecting on my 17 years in government, during the first ten years, we successfully constructed seven large reservoirs in the Mahaveli scheme, as well as Samanala Wewa and Lunugam Vehera outside of it. We also built the Left Bank canals, Right Bank canals, and completed all these projects on time. During President Jayawardenas tenure, we established two investment promotion zones and a new capital with a parliament, along with several buildings. During President Pramadasas time, we developed two more investment promotion zones, including 200 garment factories. We managed to stay on schedule, with no major overruns, despite the on-going war at that time. However, the current circumstances make it challenging to achieve similar results. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the entire administrative structure. Regarding the issue of backlog and law delays, which Justice Priyantha Gunawardane emphasized, I propose that all stakeholders, including the bench, bar, government, and parliament, come together to produce a unified report. This would facilitate parliamentary action and allow input from opposition lawyers. We can all convene and work out the necessary steps within a short period of time. As a representative of the government, I will ensure the involvement of the Secretary and the treasury, depending on the available resources. Adequate funding is essential. Additionally, I recommend that the unofficial bar, official bar, and bench provide a report on other raised concerns. The lack of a national policy contributes to some of these problems. While most governments have neglected the formulation of national policies, our constitution places the responsibility on parliament rather than the cabinet. Therefore, we aim to implement this system and have already established a committee on national policy. Though agreement among all may not be guaranteed, striving for the broadest possible consensus on various subjects is our objective, ensuring their enactment. Now, addressing the energy issue, we must first focus on unbundling the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Unbundling was advised by the Asian Development Bank in 2003, but later, due to union influence, the government reversed the decision. The unions now insist on unbundling. Had we done it in 2004, we would have avoided the current problem. The second issue pertains to renewable energy. We have a renewable energy authority under the 13th Amendment and its under the Provincial Councils and the other is hydroelectricity. As for the national grid, its definition remains incomplete, allowing for the possibility of parallel grids. Consequently, an energy regulator, specifically an electricity regulator, is necessary to balance the powers of the CEB and the Provincial Councils. We are currently exploring the appropriate regulatory framework and seeking resolutions for the raised concerns, including tariffs. Furthermore, we have initiated a committee on Digital Transformation to drive digitalization in the government. During my tenure as Minister of Industries and Technology, we discussed digitalization in customs, but even after 30 years, progress has been insufficient. The presence of numerous lawyers leads to further complications, with court stays being sought amid on-going processes. To address this problem, we are introducing a new system inspired by the Malaysian model the Lab methodology. This system involves bringing all stakeholders together to discuss and provide a report within six weeks, which the government will then implement. In the Sinhalese language, we refer to this approach as Sanghayana where everyone participates, discusses, and returns with recommendations. This methodology aims to resolve government-related issues and streamline procedures in collaboration with the private sector. Lastly, regarding the local firms, we will provide assistance to competitive companies to improve their competitiveness. However, non-competitive local firms cannot expect special treatment. In the past, we focused heavily on the construction sector, providing BOI proposals and tax incentives. Our economy became overly reliant on concrete-related activities. While we support the growth of our construction and real estate firms, we also encourage other companies to come if they meet our standards. A level playing field is essential for development. By looking beyond our borders and adopting a unified policy, we can overcome the challenges we face. I wont take any more of your time as you have other sessions and a lunch break. I extend my gratitude to all of you, and lets follow up on these matters. Finally, I want to emphasize that we are preparing for the upcoming country assessment on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. Sri Lanka recognizes the importance of addressing the identified gaps, strengthening our governance framework, and ensuring compliance. With the support and cooperation of all stakeholders, we strive for sustainable economic development and international cooperation. Meanwhile, Mr. Kaushalya Navaratne, President, Bar Association of Sri Lanka addressing the gathering said, The aim of this conference is to initiate a dialogue between the legal fraternity, policymakers, bureaucrats, and the business community. Recognizing the significance of both entrepreneurship and the rule of law, it is crucial for these sectors to understand each others importance for the nations prosperity. To ensure a fruitful discussion, it is essential to involve the political leadership, and we appreciate the dedication of President Wickremesinghe in joining us for this event. The presence of senior judicial officers, policymakers, bureaucrats, lawyers, and corporate leaders will contribute to candid and open discussions. The focus of the conversation should be on real problems and realities, aiming to find long-lasting solutions. With this in mind, let us commence the conversation and work towards a productive outcome. Addressing the gathering, Mr Faiszer Mustapha PC, Chairman NLC said, Reflecting on the past 75 years since our independence, we acknowledge the initial optimism for Sri Lankas growth. However, the devastating impact of war and economic mismanagement has hindered our progress and led us to our current challenges. It is now our duty to rectify past mistakes and confront these obstacles. We must begin by addressing our debt and engaging in debt restructuring to regain control of our economy. Business as usual is no longer an option; we must forge a new path towards efficient economic growth and sustainable development. This requires a deep understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the legal fraternity, judiciary, entrepreneurs, and guardians of the rule of law. The business community plays a crucial role in job creation, wealth generation, and innovation. Without a thriving business sector, our nations advancement will be compromised. It is essential for the legal fraternity and judiciary to foster trust and collaboration with the business community, while businesses must uphold the rule of law and consider their social responsibilities beyond individual targets. Supreme Court Justice Priyantha Jayawardena PC said, The significance of this conference cannot be understated, particularly in light of the unprecedented economic and financial challenges our nation is currently facing. It is our collective responsibility to strive for the betterment of our country and overcome this situation. The fact that we have gathered here today is a testament to the shared interest we all have in this conference. Throughout the event, we will be focusing on important topics such as improving the ease of doing business, enhancing contract enforcement within a favourable legal framework, and related subjects. It is crucial to note that Sri Lankas current rankings by the World Bank place us at 29th in the ease of doing business index and 164th in enforcing contracts. These rankings significantly influence investment decisions, making it imperative for us to address these parameters for the economic revival of our nation. Mr. M. Rajaram, PartnerChairman, KL Gates Straits Law LLC (Singapore); Investors perceive Sri Lanka as an increasingly attractive destination for investments, as acknowledged in discussions held in Singapore, India, the UK, and the US. However, investors seek certain assurances and a level of comfort when considering investment opportunities. When disputes arise, investors prioritize two key factors: certainty of outcome and a fast resolution. Drawing from Singapores experience, specialized judges and a case management system have been established to address different types of issues, aiming to resolve cases within 15 months in most instances. Additionally, modernization efforts, such as paperless filings and electronic hearings, have been implemented in Singaporean courts. Despite being a small nation with limited natural resources and a smaller population compared to Sri Lanka, Singapore has successfully embraced these measures. Therefore, the suggestion is made to consider modernizing Sri Lankas court system using artificial intelligence (AI) and implementing strict case management controls. Presidents Counsel Dr. K Kanag-Isvaran, Presidents Counsel Dr. Faizer Mustapha, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena, Presidents Senior Adviser on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.

Accordingly, a luxury salon in Rajagriya with a high-profile clientele of actresses and other elite members of society was raided by Ukussa today, after information of another Glutathione racket was received. Upon inspection of the premises, the Ukussa team, together with the Food and Drug Inspectors who were also involved in the crackdown seized a stock of vials of Glutathione, both used and unused, valued at around Rs. 5 million. It was revealed that 15 different kinds of the banned drug in question were found at the salon. Glutathione injections were banned in Sri Lanka nearly two years ago by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), albeit the molecule being commonly used to treat side effects suffered by cancer patients, as the drug itself had severely concerning after effects on its users. On 25 April, Ukussa uncovered another such racket in Kottawa, where a doctor was found guilty of administering the injection as part of an unsafe skin-whitening treatment.",

        "content": "Gunmen in Nigeria have killed dozens of people and kidnapped a number of children in separate attacks in two northern states, police and residents said on Sunday, the latest incidents in a region dogged by armed violence. Armed gangs on motorbikes frequently take advantage of thinly stretched security forces in the region to kidnap villagers, motorists and students for ransom. Residents said armed men had attacked Janbako and Sakkida villages in northwestern Zamfara state on Saturday, killing 24 people. The gunmen also abducted several children who were collecting firewood in a forest in neighbouring Gora village. Hussaini Ahmadu and Abubakar Maradun, local residents in Janbako and Sakkida, told Reuters by phone that the gangs had earlier in the week demanded villagers pay a fee to enable them to farm their fields, but villagers did not do so. Zamfara police spokesman Yazid Abubakar confirmed the attacks but said only 13 people had been reported killed and nine young boys and girls kidnapped. In north central Benue state, gunmen killed 25 people and set their houses on fire during an attack on Saturday on the Imande Mbakange community, two residents said. The motive of the attack was not known. Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "Saudi Arabia to cut oil output by 1 million barrels per day to boost slumping prices",
        "date": "June 5, 2023 08:00 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Saudi Arabia will reduce how much oil it sends to the global economy, taking a unilateral step to prop up the sagging price of crude after two previous cuts to supply by major producing countries in the OPEC alliance failed to push oil higher. The Saudi cut of 1 million barrels per day, to start in July, comes as the other OPEC producers agreed in a meeting in Vienna to extend earlier production cuts through next year. Calling the reduction a lollipop, Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a news conference that we wanted to ice the cake. He said the cut could be extended and that the group will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market. The new cut would likely push up oil prices in the short term, but the impact after that would depend on whether Saudi Arabia decides to extend it, said Jorge Leon, senior vice president of oil markets research at Rystad Energy. The move provides a price floor because the Saudis can play with the voluntary cut as much as they like, he said. The slump in oil prices has helped U.S. drivers fill their tanks more cheaply and gave consumers worldwide some relief from inflation. Gas is not going to become cheaper, Leon said. If anything, it will become marginally more expensive. That the Saudis felt another cut was necessary underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuel in the months ahead. There are concerns about economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe, while Chinas rebound from COVID-19 restrictions has been less robust than many had hoped. Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer in the OPEC oil cartel, was one of several members that agreed on a surprise cut of 1.6 million barrels per day in April. The kingdoms share was 500,000. That followed OPEC announcing in October that it would slash 2 million barrels per day, angering U.S. President Joe Biden by threatening higher gasoline prices a month before the midterm elections. All told, OPEC has now dropped production on paper by 4.6 million barrels a day. But some countries cant produce their quotas, so the actual reduction is around 3.5 million barrels per day, or over 3 of global supply. The previous cuts gave little lasting boost to oil prices. International benchmark Brent crude climbed as high as 87 per barrel but has given up its post-cut gains and been loitering below 75 per barrel in recent days. U.S. crude has recently dipped below 70. That has helped U.S. drivers kicking off the summer travel season, with prices at the pump averaging 3.55, down 1.02 from a year ago, according to auto club AAA. Falling energy prices also helped inflation in the 20 European countries that use the euro drop to the lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine. The Saudis need sustained high oil revenue to fund ambitious development projects aimed at diversifying the countrys economy. The International Monetary Fund estimates the kingdom needs 80.90 per barrel to meet its envisioned spending commitments, which include a planned 500 billion futuristic desert city project called Neom. The U.S. recently replenished its Strategic Petroleum Reserve  after Biden announced the largest release from the national reserve in American history last year  in an indicator that U.S. officials may be less worried about OPEC cuts than in months past. While oil producers like Saudi Arabia need revenue to fund their state budgets, they also have to take into account the impact of higher prices on oil-consuming countries. Oil prices that go too high can fuel inflation, sapping consumer purchasing power and pushing central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve toward further interest rate hikes that can slow economic growth. The Saudi production cut and any increase to oil prices could add to the profits that are helping Russia pay for its war against Ukraine. Russia has found new oil customers in India, China and Turkey amid Western sanctions designed to limit Moscows crucial energy income. However, higher crude prices risk complicating trade by the worlds No. 3 oil producer if they exceed the 60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven major democracies. Russia has found ways to evade the price cap through dark fleet tankers, which tamper with location data or transfer oil from ship to ship to disguise its origin. But those efforts add costs. Under the OPEC deal, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow will extend its voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels a day through next year, according to Russian state news agency Tass. But Russia might not be following through on its promises. Moscows total exports of oil and refined products such as diesel fuel rose in April to a post-invasion high of 8.3 million barrels per day, the International Energy Agency said in its April oil market report.

        "content": "World Environment Day, observed annually on June 05, is marked today with the aim of encouraging awareness and action for the protection of the environment. This year, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has declared the theme for World Environment Day under the campaign BeatPlasticPollution, Ecosystem Restoration. World Environment Day 2023 is a reminder that peoples actions on plastic pollution matters, the UNEP said, adding that the steps governments and businesses are taking to tackle plastic pollution are the consequence of this action. It is time to accelerate this action and transition to a circular economy. It is time to BeatPlasticPollution. It added. More than 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced every year worldwide, half of which is designed to be used only once. Of that, less than 10 per cent is recycled. An estimated 19-23 million tonnes end up in lakes, rivers and seas annually. That is approximately the weight of 2,200 Eiffel Towers all together, according to the UNEP. With available science and solutions to tackle the problem, governments, companies and other stakeholders must scale up and speed actions to solve this crisis, it added, highlighting that this underscores the importance of this World Environment Day in mobilizing transformative action from every corner of the world. Meanwhile, Chairman of the Central Environment Authority of Sri Lanka, Supun H. Pathirage emphasized that this years theme for the World Environment Day is a current topic, pointing out that several programmes have been implemented across the island under this theme. Accordingly, the Central Environmental Authority will conduct awareness programs throughout Sri Lanka to aware public of the wise use of plastic and regulate establishments that bring polythene and plastic into Sri Lanka. The Central Environmental Authority will also ban 4 types of single-use plastics, according to Mr. Pathirage. The main event for the celebration of World Environment Day in Sri Lanka is being held in Pettah, Colombo. You can access more information, the actions you can carry out to contribute, as well as a large number of materials to promote the movement through social media by joining the BeatPlasticPollution movement through the official website of World Environment Day 2023.",

        "date": "June 5, 2023 11:38 am",
        "content": "An Australian woman who spent 20 years in prison was pardoned and released Monday based on new scientific evidence that her four children died by natural causes as she had insisted. The pardon was seen as the quickest way of getting Kathleen Folbigg out of prison, and a final report from the second inquiry into her guilt could recommend the state Court of Appeals quash her convictions. Folbigg, now 55, was released from a prison in Grafton, New South Wales state, following an unconditional pardon by Gov. Margaret Beazley. Australian state governors are figureheads who act on instructions of governments. New South Wales Attorney-General Michael Daley said former justice Tom Bathurst had advised him last week there was reasonable doubt about Folbiggs guilt based on new scientific evidence that the deaths could have been from natural causes. There is a reasonable doubt as to Ms. Folbiggs guilt of the manslaughter of her child Caleb, the infliction of grievous bodily harm on her child Patrick and the murder of her children Patrick, Sarah and Laura, Daley told reporters. I have reached a view that there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Ms. Folbigg of those offenses, Daley added. Bathurst has conducted the second inquiry into Folbiggs guilt, initiated by a petition that said it was based on significant positive evidence of natural causes of death and signed by 90 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals. Prosecutors acknowledged to his inquiry in April that there was reasonable doubt about her guilt. Folbigg was serving a 30-year prison sentence that was to expire in 2033. She would have become eligible for parole in 2028. The children died separately over a decade, at between 19 days and 19 months old. Her first child, Caleb, was born in 1989 and died 19 days later in what a jury determined to be the lesser crime of manslaughter. Her second child, Patrick, was 8 months old when he died in 1991. Two years later, Sarah died at 10 months. In 1999, Folbiggs fourth child, Laura, died at 19 months. Evidence discovered in 2018 that both daughters carried a rare CALM2 genetic variant was one of the reasons that the inquiry was called. Lawyer Sophie Callan said expert evidence in the fields of cardiology and genetics indicated that the CALM2-G114R genetic variant is a reasonably possible cause of the daughters sudden deaths. Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, was also a reasonably possible cause of Lauras death, Callan said. For Patrick, Callan said there was persuasive expert evidence that as a matter of reasonable possibility, an underlying neurogenetic disorder caused his sudden death. The scientific evidence created doubt that Folbigg killed the three children and undermined the argument made in Calebs case that four child deaths were an improbable coincidence, Callan said. Prosecutors had told the jury at her trial that the similarities among the deaths made coincidence an unlikely explanation. Folbigg was the only one at home or awake when the young children died. She said she discovered three of the deaths during trips to the bathroom and one while checking on a childs wellbeing. Prosecutors also had told the jury that Folbiggs diaries contained admissions of guilt. Her former husband, Craig Folbigg, said in submissions to the inquiry that the implausibility that four children in one family would die of natural causes before the age of 2 was compelling grounds to continue treating the diary entries as admissions of his former wifes guilt. But Callan said psychologists and psychiatrists gave evidence that it would be unreliable to interpret the entries in this way. Folbigg had been suffering a major depressive disorder and maternal grief when she made the entries, Callan said. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

Meanwhile, the court has also granted permission for the request filed by Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero and several others to intervene in the petition and present facts. The self-styled prophet, in the FR petition filed through his attorneys on May 26, had sought an order preventing the CID from arresting him, while the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the petition. In the meantime, a group including Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero filed an interlocutory application before the Supreme Court on Thursday (June 01), seeking to dismiss the petition filed by Pastor Fernando without taking it up for hearing. Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of a recent sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. On May 15, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony, while several other parties had also lodged complaints with the CID regarding the matter. However, on May 14, Pastor Jerome flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court issued a foreign travel ban on him. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island nation. While in Singapore, Pastor Fernando apologized to Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim devotees if his words by any means hurt them emotionally, albeit saying that he has done nothing wrong.",

Issuing a special statement today (05), he said that the executive council of the opposition led by the SJB unanimously decided to oppose and defeat the Broadcasting Authority Bill, which he claims is being brought forth by the incumbent government with the aim of destroying the remaining part of the countrys democracy. He stated that they decided to take the maximum possible measures to defeat it inside and outside the parliament as well as through the courts. The Opposition Leader said that the fourth pillar in the democratic system is the free media and the entire world accepts the free media as the fourth check and balance when the legislature, the executive and the judiciary strengthen the democratic system through checks and balances. However, the current government is ready to destroy the free media through such broadcasting authority bills, Premadasa charged, adding that when the then-government presented a similar bill in 1997, Supreme Court Judge A. R. B. Amarasinghe on May 5, 1997 said that the Act is against the Constitution. The Opposition Leader said that this bill that has been presented today is completely contrary to the countrys constitution, and also that it is harsh, anti-democratic, democracy corrupting, cancelles the peoples freedom and that all the media should come together to defeat this bill. He said that this authoritarian, obnoxious and idiotic Broadcasting Authority Cill should be completely defeated and the free media should be victorious and be protected and that the death blows to the democratic system in this country should be defeated. Premadasa alleged that the executive has held various banquets and made the judges very uncomfortable and holding such banquets at the moment when a very important judicial proceeding is underway is an act of insolence. The opposition leader added that there is no place for anti-democratic things like dictatorship and dictatorship in this country and that they are ready to do everything possible to safeguard democracy.",

        "content": "The Association of Health Professionals has revealed that the automatic vaccination machine of the PET Scan machine worth Rs. 200 million at the Cancer Hospital in Maharagama, is not in use for over a period of one year, due to the non-availability of FDG chemical and connection tubes. When inquired by Ada Derana regarding the matter, Director of the Maharagama Cancer Hospital Dr. Aruna Jayasekara pointed out that apart from the automatic vaccinations with the PET Scan machine, other relevant tests are being carried out as usual through the machine. The PET Scan machine is used to accurately identify the location of the cancer cells and treat it once an individual is diagnosed with cancer in a certain internal organ. This machine was acquired by the Maharagama Cancer Hospital in 2018, with the assistance of Manusath Derana after collecting Rs. 200 million in funds together with the hospital and with the contributions of donors. Later on, the hospital had purchased an automatic vaccination machine to inject the FDG chemical into the patients for the PET scans. Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) says that it will take at least two weeks to restore this machine and recommence its activities.",

        "date": "June 6, 2023 01:48 am",
        "content": "The maiden international cruise vessel between Chennai and Sri Lanka MV Empress was formally flagged off by the Indias Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal in Chennai on Monday. The occasion also marked the inauguration of an international cruise tourism terminal, set up at a cost of INR 172.1 million at the Chennai Port. The facility spread across 2,880 square metres would be able to host 3,000 passengers. The launch of the cruise service comes in the backdrop of the memorandum of understanding signed between Chennai Port and Waterways Leisure Tourism for domestic and international cruise service at the Incredible India International Cruise Conference in 2022. With our rich heritage and culture around our coastal region, the potential of cruise tourism in India is immense. Today, as we launch the maiden cruise service between Chennai and Sri Lanka, it has ushered a new chapter in the cruise tourism sector in the country, Sonowal was quoted as saying in a PIB release. As the affordability and access to world-class cruise services become a reality, people can enjoy and relish luxurious amenities, entertainment and breathtaking views, he said. The newly-launched cruise service would sail to three ports - Hambantota, Trincomalee and Kankesanturai in Sri Lanka. Sonowal said three new international cruise terminals were expected to become operational by 2024. As more and more people are likely to experience cruise tourism in the near future, the government remains deeply committed to developing world-class infrastructure to support and enable the growth of cruise tourism and maritime trade, he said. I am happy to share that three new international cruise terminals are likely to be completed and become operational by 2024. We expect that the volume of cruise ships will increase from 208 in 2023 to 500 in 2030 and up to 1,100 by 2047, he said. Following this, the number of passengers availing cruise services was also expected to rise from 9.50 lakh in 2030 to 45 lakh in 2047, he said. Plans are afoot to develop new cruise tourism terminals in Andamans, Puducherry and Lakshadweep circuits. We are also studying the feasibility of developing ferry circuits across India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar, he said. The Ministry was also working on rolling out pilgrimage tours in Gujarat, cultural and scenic tours and ayurveda wellness tourism and heritage tourism to boost demand for cruise services in the western, southern and eastern coasts of the country, he said. Commemorating World Environment Day, Sonowal also launched an initiative to plant 2,500 tree saplings at the Chennai Port, the release said. Source: PTI --Agencies",
