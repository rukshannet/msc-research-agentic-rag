        "title": "Trump becomes first former U.S. president to be convicted of felony crimes",
        "date": "May 31, 2024 06:21 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Donald Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouses 15th floor where the decision was revealed after more than nine hours of deliberations. This was a rigged, disgraceful trial, an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here. Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee. The verdict is a stunning legal reckoning for Trump and exposes him to potential prison time in the city where his manipulations of the tabloid press helped catapult him from a real estate tycoon to reality television star and ultimately president. As he seeks to reclaim the White House in this years election, the judgment presents voters with another test of their willingness to accept Trumps boundary-breaking behavior. Trump is expected to appeal the verdict and will face an awkward dynamic as he returns to the campaign trail tagged with felony convictions. There are no campaign rallies on the calendar for now, though hes expected to appear Friday at Trump Tower and to hold fundraisers next week. The falsifying business records charges carry up to four years behind bars, though Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg would not say Thursday if prosecutors intend to seek imprisonment, and it is not clear whether the judge  who earlier in the trial warned of jail time for gag order violations  would impose that punishment even if asked. The conviction, and even imprisonment, will not bar Trump from continuing his White House pursuit. Trump faces three other felony indictments, but the New York case may be the only one to reach a conclusion before the November election, adding to the significance of the outcome. Though the legal and historical implications of the verdict are readily apparent, the political consequences are less so given its potential to reinforce rather than reshape already hardened opinions about Trump. For another candidate in another time, a criminal conviction might doom a presidential run, but Trumps political career has endured through two impeachments, allegations of sexual abuse, investigations into everything from potential ties to Russia to plotting to overturn an election, and personally salacious storylines, including the emergence of a recording in which he boasted about grabbing womens genitals. The cases general allegations have also been known to voters for years and, while tawdry, are widely seen as less grievous than the allegations he faces in three other cases that charge him with subverting American democracy and mishandling national security secrets. Ahead of the verdict, Trumps campaign had argued that, no matter the jurys decision, the outcome was unlikely to sway voters and that the election would be decided by issues such as inflation. Even so, the verdict is likely to give President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats space to sharpen arguments that Trump is unfit for office, though for now the White House offered only a muted statement that it respected the rule of law. Conversely, the decision will provide fodder for the presumptive Republican nominee to advance his unsupported claims that he is victimized by a criminal justice system he insists is politically motivated against him. Trump maintained throughout the trial that he had done nothing wrong and that the case should never have been brought, railing against the proceedings from inside the courthouse  where he was joined by a parade of high-profile Republican allies  and racking up fines for violating a gag order with inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses. Republicans showed no sign of loosening their embrace of the party leader, with House Speaker Mike Johnson lamenting what he called a shameful day in American history. He called the case a purely political exercise, not a legal one. The first criminal trial of a former American president always presented a unique test of the court system, not only because of Trumps prominence but also because of his relentless broadsides on the foundation of the case and its participants. But the verdict from the 12-person jury marked a repudiation of Trumps efforts to undermine confidence in the proceedings or to potentially impress the panel with a show of GOP support. While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today in this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors, by following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor, Bragg said after the verdict. The trial involved charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, the porn actor who said she had sex with the married Trump in 2006. The 130,000 payment came from Trumps former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen to buy Daniels silence during the final weeks of the 2016 race in what prosecutors allege was an effort to interfere in the election. When Cohen was reimbursed, the payments were recorded as legal expenses, which prosecutors said was an unlawful attempt to mask the true purpose of the transaction. Trumps lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for legal services. He denied the sexual encounter, and his lawyers argued at trial that his celebrity status made him an extortion target. Defense lawyers also said hush money deals to bury negative stories about Trump were motivated by personal considerations such as the impact on his family and brand as a businessman, not political ones. They also sought to undermine the credibility of Cohen, the star prosecution witness who pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to the payments, by suggesting he was driven by personal animus toward Trump and fame and money. The trial featured weeks of occasionally riveting testimony that revisited an already well-documented chapter from Trumps past, when his 2016 campaign was threatened by the disclosure of an Access Hollywood recording that captured him talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission and the prospect of other stories about Trump and sex surfacing that would be harmful to his candidacy. Trump did not testify, but jurors heard his voice through a secret recording of a conversation with Cohen in which he and the lawyer discussed a 150,000 hush money deal involving a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who has said she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies that affair. Daniels herself testified, offering a vivid recounting of the sexual encounter she says they had in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. The former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, testified about how he worked to keep stories harmful to the Trump campaign from becoming public at all, including by having his company buy McDougals story. Jurors also heard from Keith Davidson, the lawyer who negotiated the hush money payments on behalf of Daniels and McDougal. He detailed the tense negotiations to get both women compensated for their silence but also faced aggressive questioning from a Trump attorney who noted Davidson had helped broker similar hush money deals in cases involving other prominent figures. The most pivotal witness, by far, was Cohen, who during days of testimony gave jurors an insiders view of the hush money scheme and what he said was Trumps detailed knowledge of it. Just take care of it, he quoted Trump as saying at one point. He offered jurors the most direct link between Trump and the heart of the charges, recounting a meeting in which a plan to have Cohen reimbursed in monthly installments for legal services was discussed. And he emotionally described his dramatic break with Trump in 2018, when he decided to cooperate with prosecutors after a decade-long career as the then-presidents personal fixer. To keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family, Cohen said. The case, though criticized by some legal experts who called it the weakest of the prosecutions against Trump, took on added importance not only because it proceeded to trial first but also because it could be the only only one to reach a jury before the election. The other three  local and federal cases in Atlanta and Washington alleging that he conspired to undo the 2020 election, as well as a federal indictment in Florida charging him with illegally hoarding top-secret records  are bogged down by delays or appeals. ____ Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The consequences of these climate change episodes not only threaten the lives of children in the immediate term but also have long term consequences on their opportunities to grow and develop, said Mr. Skoog. The agreement we have signed today further strengthens the mobilization of young people to take centre stage in all aspects of the climate crisis in Sri Lanka, from defining the impact on their lives to contributing solutions that are relevant to the different contexts. Pasindu Guneratne, Chairperson of NYSC, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, stating, we are dedicated to mobilizing youth to catalyze positive community transformation. Through our collaboration with UNICEF, we aim to empower young leaders with the expertise and capabilities required to address climate change proactively and make a lasting impact. Under the agreement, UNICEF and NYSC commit to collaborate on a series of structured activitiesevents focusing on raising critical awareness and development of skills on climate change and environment conservation across Sri Lanka, and improving the collaboration between the government, civil society, academia, in the field of climate change and environment conservation, the statement added. UNICEFs work on climate change for children is grounded in the Sri Lanka Childrens Declaration on Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction, a long history, experience, and deep understanding of the needs of children in the country and the expertise in fulfilling the rights of children through programmes, advocacy, and an extensive network of partners, including government, non- profit, and community organizations. NYSC brings to the partnership an infrastructure and human resources for the support of innovative activities, the network of startup community, especially the youth and support resources from their island-wide youth clubs network, according to the UNICEF.",

        "content": "The Vehicle Importers Association has raised doubts regarding the governments repeated claims of easing existing restrictions and allowing vehicle imports. President of the Sri Lanka Vehicle Importers Association Prasad Manage highlighted the uncertainty and potential impacts on the vehicle prices once imports are permitted. We have been waiting for four years to import vehicles. They say it will happen soon, but no specific date is given. The Central Bank Governor said the restrictions can be relaxed gradually. Vehicles are assembled locally, but none have been exported as of yet. The government imposes taxes of around 200 when we import vehicles, Manage alleged. He added that discussions with State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya indicated that buses and lorries would be prioritized in allowing vehicle imports, followed by three-wheelers and motorcycles, with cars and vans being considered last. We suspect that the promise of vehicle imports is a ploy. It seems intended to facilitate the MP and ministers requests for vehicles, as they have asked the Speaker for new vehicles, Manage noted. Current vehicle prices are driven by demand and supply. Even if imports recommence, significant price reductions are unlikely. In fact, theres a concern that prices might increase in the interim, he added.",

        "content": "Thousands of patients will be able to access ground-breaking cancer vaccines, as part of an NHS trial. A match-making service called the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad (CVLP), which can match patients with suitable trials, is set to be launched. The Southampton Clinical Trials Unit (SCTU), based at the University of Southampton, has been chosen to run the project. The new NHS England programme aims to accelerate research into personalised cancer vaccines. It is a type of immunotherapy treatment that boosts the bodys own immune system to help it find and destroy cancer. SCTU clinical director, prof Simon Crabb said the new scheme would bring together different academic and industry partners who are developing cancer vaccines and allow patients across England to access trials of treatments that may not have previously been an option for them. Ali Richards, 63, took part in a previous cancer vaccine trial run by the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit after after her head and neck cancer returned following initial treatment. Traditional treatments are not kind by their nature, and anything that can make treatment more simple, more effective, less invasive, has got to be a good thing, Ms Richards, from Poole in Dorset, said. The vaccines are created by analysing a patients tumour and using that information to create a vaccine tailored to that individual. Prof Gareth Griffiths, director of the Cancer Research UK SCTU, said: Cancer vaccines have the potential to improve the way we treat the disease, particularly for those cancers where treatment options are currently limited or very demanding on patients bodies. Personalised vaccines aim to create an immune memory that can prevent a cancer from returning after surgery or chemotherapy. The first trial will be testing a vaccine under development by biotech company BioNTech SE. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months",
        "date": "May 31, 2024 07:26 pm",
        "content": "Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records. This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at 12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated. Spot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand, said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE. While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said. Parts of South and Southeast Asia saw extreme heat and record temperatures in April and May, increasing electricity consumption for cooling and straining power supplies. In India on Thursday, at least 15 people died of suspected heatstroke in the eastern states of Bihar and Odisha. South Asian LNG imports rose nearly 20 from a year earlier to 3.8 million metric tons in May, according to analytics firm Kpler. India saw its highest import levels ever for May at 2.4 million tons, while Bangladesh LNG volumes hit an all-time monthly record at 0.6 million tons, according to Kpler data. New importers the Philippines and Vietnam, which started taking LNG shipments last year, have also bumped up their purchases. Vietnam received three cargoes in April and May for power generation, while buyers in the Philippines shipped nine cargoes so far this year versus 11 for all of last year. Rising demand for cooling is set to continue as Northeast Asia enters its summer. Japans meteorological agency forecast likely higher-than-average temperatures from June to August, and Chinas energy regulator warned power supply will be tight in some regions the next few months amid growing consumption. Various weather forecasts suggest Northeast Asia may experience hotter-than-normal weather from May, said Energy Aspects analyst Min Na in a note, adding that restocking demand for LNG in Asia will be higher year-on-year this summer. We forecast a total restocking demand of 2.4 million tons this summer across Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, up by 2.3 million tons year-on-year and 0.1 million tons above the five-year average. Japan government data showed LNG stockpiles by utilities at 2.06 million tons as of May 26, below the five-year average for the period, as Tokyo is already experiencing hot weather. South Korean power generation company Korea Midland Power Co, Thailand state-energy firm PTT, Philippines power producer First Gen (FGEN.PS) and Bangladeshs state-owned Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co Ltd (RPGCL) have all also issued tenders seeking LNG for delivery in July.

        "date": "May 31, 2024 08:03 pm",
        "content": "The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) is expected to meet next week for further discussions pertaining to the formal authorization and implementation of the Starlink service in Sri Lanka, the State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath says. Speaking to Ada Derana, the State Minister who stated that no company of this nature operates in Sri Lanka so far, also highlighted that steps are being taken to explore the regulations and the legal framework required to facilitate its operations. The State Minister further said: We will be looking at the nature of the license that will be granted to Starlink. The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission will be meeting next week. The commissions final decision will be presented to the president, he added. Speaking regarding the matter last week, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the initiative of integrating the global Starlink network with Sri Lanka aims to address the Wi-Fi connectivity issues, particularly in areas outside Colombo. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe revealed that the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has been tasked with assessing the Starlink network, with most of the preliminary work already completed. President Wickremesinghe met with billionaire investor Elon Musk on the sidelines of the 10th World Water Forum High-Level Meeting being held in Indonesia on May 19, during which they have discussed the implementation of Starlink in Sri Lanka. Musk was in Indonesias resort island of Bali to launch Starlink satellite internet service in the worlds largest archipelago nation. The billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of social platform X had launched the service alongside Indonesian President Joko Widodo in a ceremony at a public health clinic in Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali. Unlike traditional telecommunications providers, which prioritise the most populated urban areas, Starlink aims to provide global coverage, extending internet connectivity to even the most remote corners of the planet. Starlink can provide internet access to virtually any location on Earth with a constellation of LEO satellites that can be re-positioned at any point, and according to experts, reliable internet access is possible, whether the user operates in the Congo, the Arctic, or on an oil rig located hundreds of miles offshore. So far, Starlink has more than 02 million active customers and is available on all seven continents and in over 60 countries.",

        "content": "A man stabbed several members of a group that describes itself as opposing political Islam on a central square in the German city of Mannheim on Friday, authorities said. Six people were wounded, including a police officer who intervened. Police quickly put an end to the attack by shooting the assailant, who also was wounded. The attack happened shortly after 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) on the Marktplatz, a downtown square in the southwestern city of Mannheim. The assailant stabbed participants in an event organized by the Pax Europa group, wounding five members of the organization, police and prosecutors said in a statement. The police officer was stabbed several times from behind in the head, they added. Another officer fired a shot at the assailant, bringing an end to the attack. The wounded were taken to various hospitals, where some of them underwent operations. Several hours later, authorities said they couldnt yet give information on the severity of the injuries. They also said the assailants identity hadnt yet been established. Pax Europa describes itself as an organization that informs the public about the dangers posed by the increasing spread and influence of political Islam. It said that Michael Stürzenberger, an anti-Islam activist who is one of its leading figures and has spoken at its events, was among those wounded. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that its up to the investigation to determine a motive. She said in a statement that if the investigation shows an Islamist motive, that would be another confirmation of the great danger from Islamist acts of violence that we have warned of. Thomas Strobl, Faesers regional counterpart in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Mannheim is located, said that we cant say anything yet about the perpetrators motive. Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted on X that the pictures from Mannheim are terrible and that violence is absolutely unacceptable in our democracy.

        "content": "AK-47 and M-16 rifles from Pakistan, minor sharpshooters and an escape plan to Sri Lanka - Indian police have uncovered chilling details of an assassination plot to kill Bollywood actor Salman Khan. The Lawrence Bishnoi gang had allegedly conspired to strike Mr Khans car in Maharashtras Panvel, armed with weapons sourced from a Pakistani arms supplier. The intricate plan, allegedly hatched by the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, involved a sophisticated network of operatives and a cache of high-powered weapons. According to Navi Mumbai police sources, the gang enlisted the help of 60 to 70 individuals, each assigned specific roles in the execution of the diabolical plot. Central to the scheme was the use of minors as shooters. The plan aimed to strike at Mr Khans vehicle in Panvel or target his secluded farmhouse. Among those arrested in connection with this are Dhananjay Tapesingh alias Ajay Kashyap, Gaurav Bhatia alias Nahvi, Vapsi Khan alias Waseem Chikna, and Rizwan Khan, each believed to have played a key role in the plot. Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently in jail, his cousin Anmol Bishnoi, and associate Goldie Brar, allegedly facilitated the acquisition of the deadly weapons from the Pakistani dealer known only as Dogar. Kashyap, a key member of the Bishnoi gang, lived in Navi Mumbais Kalamboli. He was in touch with a person identified as Sukha Shooter, who has Bishnois photo as his profile picture. Kashyap and his cohorts held clandestine meetings in strategic locations such as the Panvel bus stand and railway station, plotting to execute their plans, including reconnaissance of Salman Khans properties. Their footprint extends across multiple states and borders, with Kashyaps trail leading to illegal arms depots in Kashmir, Ganganagar, and even the Pakistan border. Following the execution of the attack, the attackers were instructed to flee to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, where they would be ferried by sea to Sri Lanka. From there, arrangements were in place for their safe passage to another country, facilitated by Anmol Bishnoi, based in Canada. Further investigations uncovered the gangs collaboration with other criminal outfits, notably with the organisation formerly led by gangster Anand Pal, now overseen by his daughter Chinu. On April 14, when two bike-borne men opened fire outside Mr Khans residence in Mumbais Bandra. After the incident, police arrested four suspects: Vicky Gupta and Sagar Pal, who were apprehended in Gujarat, while Anuj Thapan and another individual were detained in Punjab on April 26. In total, six arrests have been made, although Anuj Thapan died in police custody. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Police on Friday arrested the alleged handler of four Sri Lankan suspected ISIS terrorists, who were taken into custody in Gujarats Ahmedabad Airport. The 46-year-old suspect, Osman Pushparaja Gerard, was arrested following a joint operation by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) in Colombo. After the arrests of four suspects by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) for having links with terrorist outfit ISIS, Sri Lanka launched a high-level investigation with the participation of two main intelligence branches of the police, the CID and the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) and other military intelligence services. In the hunt for Osman or the coordinator of four ISIS suspects, earlier Sri Lanka Police offered a cash reward of Rs. 02 million to any informant. However, he was subsequently arrested last night (May 31) based on information received that the suspect was in hiding in Colombo. It was in a joint operation carried out by the Terrorist Investigation Division and the Criminal Investigation Department under the direct supervision of the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the CID Rohan Premaratne. Police said that the suspect is currently being detained and questioned. Sri Lanka Police had so far arrested six suspects, including the handler who was linked with the four arrested in India. Among those others arrested in Sri Lanka are: a suspect who had prepared a flag with an ISIS logo before which the suspects had taken an oath, two other oath takers who originally planned to go to India but later refused (making two newcomers to join the four arrested at Ahmadabad) and another suspect who handled the financial transactions. On May 19, the ATS had arrested four terror suspects who had arrived on an Indigo flight from Colombo to Chennai. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat, 35, who was involved in selling imported telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai had a criminal history. In September 2020 he had been arrested in Colombo for keeping heroin in his possession while the other suspect 27-year-old Mohammad Nafran, had been running a business of importing clothing material and chocolates from India and Dubai. In 2017, Nafran was arrested by the Sri Lanka Police under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act. He was also the son of Mohamed Niyas Naufer alias Potta Naufer, a notorious underworld drug-lord who was sentenced to death for the killing of a High Court judge in Colombo. The other two suspects are Mohammad Faris, 35, and Mohammad Rashdeen, 43, both from Colombo who had made their first visit to India. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "title": "Constitution mandates that any govt should accord priority to Buddhism  President",
        "date": "June 1, 2024 10:33 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored that according to the constitution, prioritizing Buddhism is imperative. He emphasized that the responsibility of upholding this principle is vested in the executive, legislature and judiciary. Emphasizing the indisputability of this matter, the President further stated that if anyone seeks to alter this principle, they should endeavour to amend the constitution accordingly. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks today (01) during his participation in the inauguration ceremony of the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre, constructed in Kiriwatthuduwa, Homagama. The President emphasized the need for acknowledgment that the executive, the constitution and the judiciary, as the three branches of government, should prioritize the Buddhist doctrine within the country. He emphasized that failure to support this principle constitutes a violation of the constitution, emphasizing the obligation of all Members of Parliament to protect it. The President highlighted that the constitution of this country outlines peoples sovereignty, prioritization of Buddhism and preservation of territorial integrity as its core principles. He stressed the importance of consistently advancing while safeguarding these principles, emphasizing that any opposition to them constitutes a breach of the constitution. Additionally, the President shared that he was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the treatment of a critically ill patient. He noted that the patient, who was on the brink of death, is now showing gradual signs of recovery. The President conveyed his heartfelt appreciation in advance for the invaluable guidance and support provided by the Maha Sangha throughout this endeavour. As per the suggestion of the late Chief Registrar of Sri Lanka Ramanya Maha Nikaya, and the Chief incumbent of Sri Dhathumaluwa Viharaya Kohuwala, Venerable Mapalagama Siri Somissara Nayaka Thero, and upon the recommendation of current Chief incumbent of Sri Dhathumaluwa Viharaya Kohuwala Venerable Pitigala Sonuttara Nayaka Thero, the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre has been established to cater to the needs of monks locally and internationally. The Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre comprises a five-story building and a three-story building, facilitating simultaneous treatment for fifty monks. Its amenities include 20 rooms, a ward yard, an alms hall, medicine stores, emergency treatment units, office rooms and hostel for doctors, ensuring comprehensive care and accommodation for those in need. Under the supervision of qualified medical professionals, facilities have been established to provide treatment for sick monks. Additionally, a conducive environment has been created to accommodate five hundred monks for meditation practice. The construction of this Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre has been accomplished through the labour contributions of the Sri Lanka Army, supported by both local and international donors. Venerable Bhikkuni Neunghaeng, the Chief of the Buddhist hospital in Ulsan, South Korea, and SinDaw, a Bhikkuni Kaushon from the Long Fong Monastery in Taiwan, have generously contributed to the medical equipment of this facility. Their contributions were made in response to an invitation extended by Venerable Katuwana Wijithawansa, Sri Lankaramadhipathi, Hethu, South Korea. The President, after unveiling the plaque and inaugurating the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre, proceeded to conduct an inspection tour of the facility. During the ceremony, homage was paid to the current Chief incumbent of Sri Dhathumaluwa Viharaya Kohuwala Venerable Pitigala Sonuttara Nayaka Thero, for his national and religious service. Furthermore, acknowledgment was extended to him for his dedication to establishing the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre, catering to monks both domestically and internationally. This gesture served as an expression of gratitude from the Sri Lankan Ramayana Maha Nikaya. Following the conferral of the Sri Sannath Patra honorary title, the President presented the vijinipata to him. The President also bestowed a commemorative gift upon Venerable Neunghaeng, the head of the Buddhist hospital in Ulsan, South Korea, who generously provided the essential medical equipment for this monk hospital centre. Additionally, a commemorative gift was presented to Mrs. Sandhya Kantilatha, who graciously donated the land for the construction of this Bhikshu Hospital. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: This marks the establishment of the first dedicated hospital for monks in Sri Lanka. While our countrys hospitals have traditionally accommodated monk wards, this facility is distinctively reserved solely for the care of sick monks. The government extends its gratitude to all contributors, particularly the efforts led by Bhikkuni Neunghaeng of South Korea. I wish to emphasize that we have sought on-going support from the Ministry of Health  Indigenous Medicine section to sustain this endeavour, and I assure you that such assistance will be forthcoming. The government is also committed to providing resources for the continued development and enhancement of this hospital. Moreover, situated in a stunning natural setting, it is imperative that we prioritize the protection of this environment as we progress forward with this project. An argument has emerged advocating for the separation of government and Buddhism. However, considering the legal framework, every citizen in our country has the right to practice the religion of their choice, or to hold no religious beliefs at all. Moreover, our constitution mandates that any government should accord priority to Buddhism. This responsibility is not solely vested in the government but extends to the state as a whole. Therefore, the support of all three branches of the statethe executive led by the President, the Parliament led by the Speaker and the Judiciary led by the Chief Justiceis essential to uphold this principle. Failure to provide this support goes against the Constitution. As Members of Parliament, we have all taken an oath to uphold the constitution and it is incumbent upon us to adhere to its principles. Despite the conflicts experienced in our country, such a request has never before been raised or discussed. It is essential to recognize that the three branches of government, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary should prioritize the Buddhist doctrine within our nation. While debate may arise regarding the specifics of implementation, the fundamental principle remains indisputable. As a government, it is imperative that we adhere to it. If there is a desire to amend this principle, it must be done through constitutional amendments. The constitution of our country underscores three fundamental principles: peoples sovereignty, prioritizing Buddhism and maintaining territorial integrity. It is imperative that we uphold these principles as the basis for our actions. Any opposition to these principles is deemed a violation of the constitution. At present, our hospital is caring for numerous patients, and I have been entrusted with the responsibility of treating one particular patient. We are making gradual progress in treating this critically ill individual, engaging in on-going discussions to ensure the best possible outcome. Healing a patient is not an instantaneous process; it requires time and dedication. It is estimated that it will take another three to four years to fully treat this patient. However, we are grateful for the opportunity to undertake this important work. I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the venerable Maha Sangha for their invaluable support in this endeavour. --PMD",

        "content": "South Africas African National Congress party will not consider any demands from possible coalition partners that President Cyril Ramaphosa step down, a top official said Sunday, as the ANC attempted to present a united front after a stinging election result ended its 30-year majority. As South Africa heads for a series of complex talks to form a national coalition government for the first time and establish stability, ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said Ramaphosa would remain as party leader and any demands from others that he resign for talks to go ahead was a no-go area. President Ramaphosa is the president of the ANC, Mbalula said in the ANC leaderships first public comments since the landmark election results. And if you come to us with that demand that Ramaphosa is going to step down as the president, that is not going to happen. Mbalula said the ANC was open to talks with every other political party in an effort to form a government, but no political party will dictate terms to us, the ANC. They will not ... You come to us with that demand, forget (it). Mbalula conceded the ANC, which has dominated South African politics since the end of apartheid in 1994, suffered heavily in the election but said it was not booted out. The ANC received just over 40 of votes, falling well short of the majority it has held for all of South Africas young democracy. It will still be the biggest party by some way. But it needs to talk with others to form a government and to reelect Ramaphosa for a second and final term. South Africas president is elected by Parliament after national elections. The results send a clear message to the ANC, Mbalula said. We wish to send a message to the people of South Africa: We have heard them. He said the ANC was committed to forming a government that reflects the will of the people and is stable. The new MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma, which won 14 in the election in a surprise showing that makes it the third biggest in parliament, has said Ramaphosa must go as leader of the ANC and the country for it to enter any coalition talks with the ANC. The ANC has many options for coalition partners among South Africas other parties, including one with the main opposition Democratic Alliance, which won 21 of votes. Well talk to everybody, Mbalula said. We are talking to everybody because the election did not give us outright majority. Talks about talks are in full swing. We are engaged and we are open to engagement. We need stability in this country. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Irans hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run for president in the countrys June 28 election, organized after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month, Irans state television reported on Sunday. However he could be barred from the race: the countrys cleric-led Guardian Council will vet candidates, and publish the list of qualified ones on June 11. Ahmadinejad, a former member of Irans elite Revolutionary Guards, was first elected as Irans president in 2005 and stepped down because of term limits in 2013. He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was not in his interest and that of the country. A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khameneis ultimate authority. In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for free elections. Khamenei had backed Ahmadinejad after his 2009 re-election triggered protests in which dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested, rattling the ruling theocracy, before security forces led by the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) stamped out the unrest.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that with the stabilization of the countrys economy; there should be no inclination towards traditional politics. He underscored that the country can only be moved forward through a structured plan. Hence, the President urged everyone to endorse the governments program without resorting to criticism. He remarked that while criticizing is effortless, finding solutions is challenging. Addressing the gathering at the distribution of appointment letters for United National Party (UNP) seat organizers held at Sirikotha party headquarters today (02), he highlighted that no political party currently possesses a viable plan for bringing the country forward. Consequently, he encouraged anyone with such a plan to present it, and if not, to endorse the Economic Transformation Bill for the future of the country. The President remarked that while criticisms come easily, finding solutions is challenging. He emphasized that no one should make hollow statements for political gain, especially during a period when efforts are underway to assume governance and propel the nation forward. President Wickremesinghe further said: Four years ago, we entered an election driven by a singular issue: the dire state of our countrys economy. The repercussions of the Budget 2020 tax cuts were clear to us: a loss of revenue, a drain on foreign exchange. We emphasized the urgent need for a USD 03 billion reserve, but our message was met with scepticism. Some of ours departed to establish the SJB, without fully understanding our messages. While the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) mocked and criticized us. The United National Party (UNP) stood alone. However, we did not falter. Our party is committed to truth, no matter how difficult it may be to convey. If we had found that money together back then, we would not be suffering like this today. Our economy would not be on the verge of collapse. When we faced trouble and sought help from other countries, India came to our aid with only USD 3.5 billion. That was only USD 500 million more than what we initially anticipated. It is no surprise that the value increased after two years. In 2020, it was only USD 03 billion. With that USD 3.5 billion, we managed to keep the economy afloat for one and a half years. If the United National Party had been elected to receive that USD 03 billion in 2020, our country would not be in such dire straits. There was no food, no fertilizer, no fuel, no factories, and no sources of income. The impact was widespread. Thats when the struggle began, directed against the government of SLPP. However, on May 09, when they reached Galle Face, Opposition Leader and MP Anura Dissanayake were ousted. Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa proposed to Mr. Sajith Premadasa to assume the role of Prime Minister after the resignation of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, he declined the offer. If Mr. R. Premadasa or Mr. J.R. Jayawardena were in charge, this opportunity would not have been missed. That is the essence of the true United National Party. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna also faltered. None of them had a viable solution. Their adherence to old politics and deceit left them without answers. I fearlessly embraced the role of Prime Minister because I have a solution with me. I acted decisively, knowing that our countrys economy could be revitalized if we secured the promised USD 03 billion. From that point on, I dedicated myself to advancing the countrys economy. The impact of these efforts was evident in the joyful celebrations of Christmas 2023, the last Sinhala Tamil New Year, and Vesak. Today, farmers are reaping the rewards of a bountiful harvest. However, our journey out of this crisis is not yet complete. It is only through this approach that we can gradually restore normalcy to day to day life. The Aswasuma program has provided threefold benefit to our people than Samurdhi. Additionally, rice subsidies have been extended to low-income individuals and the Urumaya program grants free land rights. In the upcoming month, 50,000 low-income residents living in Colombo flats will receive rightful ownership of their homes. When considering the state of our country today, by the end of 2023, our debt had soared to USD 83 billion, which equates to Rs. 28,000 billion. This figure surpasses our total Gross Domestic Product. Its challenging to escape such debt when it surpasses our annual income. To tackle this, we must forge ahead by generating new sources of revenue. We have entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) outlining how we can achieve economic stability over the next five years. It is crucial that we adhere to this agreement; otherwise, we risk losing their support in the future. We have been requested to allocate time between 2027 and 2042 for the repayment of our foreign debt. Consequently, we must strategize on advancing our economy. This involves not only settling the current loan but also addressing the on-going need for foreign borrowing due to our reliance on imports. Subsequently, the existing USD 83 billion loan will escalate further, leading to another economic crisis within the next five years. Therefore, our primary concern should be on finding ways to progress. This stands as our main challenge presently. To address this challenge, we are introducing new legislation. I urge all parties not to evade this issue; it is detrimental for both opposition and ruling parties to ignore it. Similarly, the media should not turn a blind eye to this problem. Its essential for everyone to acknowledge and address this issue. As the United National Party, we played a crucial role in rescuing the country from this crisis along with all other MPs. Now, it is imperative that we continue to move forward. Despite this, none of the parties have yet presented their programs, indicating a lack of readiness. However, as a government, we are actively working to formalize and enact the agreements made with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other friendly nations by submitting them to parliament for legal approval. These proposed laws aim to transform our economy from one reliant on imports to one focused on exports. Only by adhering to these objectives can our nation progress. Hence, it is essential that we address the debt, which currently exceeds 100 of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and reduce it to 95 by 2032. This is a critical milestone that everyone should be aware of; as it represents the next challenge we must tackle. Furthermore, our Gross Domestic Product should achieve a growth rate of 5 by 2027. To facilitate rapid development, this growth rate must be sustained at 8 for a minimum of 10 years. Concurrently, unemployment should be reduced to 5 by 2025. Transforming into an export-oriented economy, our export revenue should comprise 25 of the Gross Domestic Product by 2025, escalating to 40 by 2030, and ultimately reaching 60 by 2040. This trajectory aligns with our goal of establishing our country as an export-oriented economy by 2040. Achieving this goal necessitates attracting foreign investment. By 2030, foreign investment should constitute at least 5 of our economy. Simultaneously, these foreign investments should be directed towards fostering our export economy. With adherence to these objectives, we possess the capacity to advance as a country. I invite everyone to voice their agreement or dissent regarding these goals. I urge all to endorse the economic transformation law, or alternatively, propose any other viable program. Relying solely on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is our only feasible option for acquiring funds. Merely discussing alternatives without a tangible solution is futile. Some suggest renegotiating with the IMF, likening it to asking a moneylender for an extension, but this analogy oversimplifies the complexity of the situation. It took us two years to deliberate on this matter. Hence, instead of disseminating misinformation, I implore those with a formal program to either present it or endorse the current one. Back in 2020, when we first proposed this, it was met with rejection from all sides, leading us to our current predicament. Therefore, rejecting the current program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would only exacerbate our situation. Its imperative that we devise a plan to revive the economy. Given the absence of such a plan from any party, I appeal to all to unite and support the economic transformation law of our country. Criticism may be easy, but providing viable solutions is far more challenging. Hence, I urge everyone to contribute constructive solutions instead of merely criticizing. --PMD",

It has further been reported that 5 persons are still missing and 20 persons are injured due to the multiple incidents caused by the bad weather. It is also mentioned that persons from 177 Divisional Secretariat divisions in 20 districts are affected by the adverse weather. Accordingly, the Disaster Management Centre reported that a total of 36,504 persons belonging to 9,764 families have been affected by the inclement weather and 5,174 persons have been sent to the 38 safe shelters. Furthermore, 28 complete property damages and 4,119 partial damages to houses, have been reported.

The Department of Meteorology further stated that many areas in the country may receive more than 150 mm of rain showers today. Meanwhile, the Irrigation Department stated that as per the announcement issued early today (03), the flood situation in several low-lying areas of the Nilwala River basin may continue. The floodwaters are gradually receding in Pasgoda, Kotapola, Pitabeddara, and Akurassa areas, which are the low-lying areas connected to the Nilwala River basin. However, flooding may continue until the end of today in the low-lying areas of Athuraliya, Malimbada, Kamburupitiya, Thihagoda, Devinuwara, and Matara Divisional Secretariat Divisions. As the water level of the river continues to rise in the downstream areas, there is a high possibility of a slight overflow of the BR5 embankment known as Galbund within approximately two hours. Despite this, the Irrigation Department stated that there is no significant flood risks due to the overflow, as the areas protected by the Nilwala flood protection dykes currently do not contain a substantial amount of water.",

        "content": "Australias independent wage-setting body on Monday raised the national minimum wage by 3.75, largely in line with inflation, as families tackle soaring living costs. The minimum rate will rise to A24.10 (16.05) per hour from July 1, resulting in an extra A33 per week for about a fifth of the Australian workforce or about 2.6 million employees. In its annual review, the Fair Work Commission said cost-of-living pressures have hit low-income employees the most, though inflation is considerably lower now than it was at this time last year, when it awarded an increase of 5.75. But the report said it was not appropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago. Australian consumer price inflation rose at an annual pace of 3.6 in April, the highest level in five months, adding to risks the next move in interest rates might be upward.

        "date": "June 3, 2024 10:57 am",
        "content": "Roughly a day since joining TikTok, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had attracted 3 million followers on the short video social media platform that he tried to ban as president on national security grounds. The decision to join the platform on Saturday could help the former president reach younger voters in his third bid for the White House. He is in a close race with Democratic incumbent Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election. Bidens election campaign is already on TikTok, with over 340,000 followers, although Biden has signed a bill that would ban the app, which is used by 170 million Americans, if its Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest it. Trump posted a launch video on his account, which has the address realdonaldtrump, on Saturday night. The video, which has more than 56 million views, showed Trump greeting fans at an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in Newark, New Jersey. Trump said a statement he would use every tool available to speak directly with the American people... ByteDance is challenging in courts the law that requires it to sell TikTok by next January or face a ban. The White House says it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds. TikTok has argued it will not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and that it has taken substantial measures to protect the privacy of its users. Trumps attempt to ban TikTok in 2020 when he was president was blocked by the courts. He said in March that the platform was a national security threat but also that a ban on it would hurt some young people and only strengthen Meta Platforms Facebook, which he has strongly criticized. Trump already has an active social media presence with more than 87 million followers on X and over 7 million followers on his own platform, Truth Social, where he posts almost daily. A U.S. appeals court last week set a fast-track schedule to consider the legal challenges to the new law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the case set for oral arguments in September after TikTok, ByteDance and a group of TikTok content creators joined with the Justice Department earlier this month in asking the court for a quick schedule.

        "date": "June 3, 2024 11:10 am",
        "content": "A Chinese spacecraft landed on the far side of the moon Sunday to collect soil and rock samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side. The landing module touched down at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time in a huge crater known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the China National Space Administration said. The mission is the sixth in the Change moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Change 5, which did so from the near side in 2020. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.  still the leader in space exploration  and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there. The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again  for the first time in more than 50 years  though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. U.S. efforts to use private-sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned launch of Boeings first astronaut flight Saturday. Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon. In Chinas current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of surface and underground material over about two days. An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of Chinas Inner Mongolia region about June 25. Missions to the moons far side are more difficult because it doesnt face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land. The South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago, is 13 kilometers (8 miles) deep and has a diameter of 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles), according to a report by Chinas Xinhua News Agency. It is the oldest and largest of such craters on the moon, so may provide the earliest information about it, Xinhua said, adding that the huge impact may have ejected materials from deep below the surface.

        "date": "June 3, 2024 11:43 am",
        "content": "Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch has married for a fifth time in a ceremony at his Californian vineyard. Mr Murdoch, 93, tied the knot on Saturday with his new wife Elena Zhukova, 67, a retired Russian biologist. He was rumoured to be dating Ms Zhukova soon after his engagement to ex-police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith was abruptly called off in April 2023. Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who has six children, is chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times. He stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp last year, leaving his son Lachlan to head both companies. Mr Murdoch and Ms Zhukova are said to have met at a party hosted by one of his ex-wives, Chinese-born entrepreneur Wendi Deng. His other former spouses are Australian flight attendant Patricia Booker, Scottish-born journalist Anna Mann, and US model and actress Jerry Hall. Ms Zhukova was previously married to Russian oil billionaire Alexander Zhukov, while their daughter Dasha - a socialite and businesswoman - was married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich until 2017. Rupert Murdoch began his career in Australia in the 1950s - eventually buying the News of the World and the Sun newspapers in the UK in 1969. He later purchased a number of US publications including the New York Post and Wall Street Journal. In 1996, he launched Fox News - now the most-watched TV news channel in the US. Through News Corp, which was founded in 2013, Mr Murdoch remains the owner of hundreds of local, national and international media outlets. His career has not been without controversy. One of his most damaging moments was the notorious UK phone-hacking scandal that erupted after it emerged that the News of the World had listened to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowlers voicemails. Last September, Mr Murdoch announced he was stepping back from the leading role in his media empire - handing the reins to his son Lachlan and later taking on the role of Chairman Emeritus of both Fox and News Corp.

        "title": "Mexico elects Claudia Sheinbaum as its first woman president",
        "date": "June 3, 2024 02:01 pm",
        "content": "Mexicos projected presidential winner Claudia Sheinbaum will become the first woman president in the countrys 200-year history. I will become the first woman president of Mexico, Sheinbaum said with a smile, speaking at a downtown hotel shortly after electoral authorities announced a statistical sample showed she held an irreversible lead. I dont make it alone. Weve all made it, with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our mothers, our daughters and our granddaughters. We have demonstrated that Mexico is a democratic country with peaceful elections, she said. The National Electoral Institutes president said Sheinbaum had between 58.3 and 60.7 of the vote, according to a statistical sample. Opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez had between 26.6 and 28.6 of the vote and Jorge Álvarez Máynez had between 9.9 and 10.8 of the vote. Sheinbaums Morena party was also projected to hold majorities in both chambers of Congress. The climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor said that her two competitors had called her and conceded her victory. The official preliminary count put Sheinbaum 28 points ahead of Gálvez with nearly 50 of polling places reporting. The fact that the two leading candidates were women had left little doubt that Mexico would make history Sunday. Sheinbaum will also be the first person from a Jewish background to lead the overwhelmingly Catholic country. She will start her six-year term Oct. 1. Mexicos constitution does not allow reelection. The leftist has said she believes the government has a strong role to play in addressing economic inequality and providing a sturdy social safety net, much like her political mentor President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Sheinbaums her victory suggests that the political movement López Obrador created will live on after his presidency. His anointed successor, the 61-year-old Sheinbaum led the campaign wire-to-wire despite a spirited challenge from Gálvez. This was the first time in Mexico that the two main opponents were women. Of course, I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum with all my respect who ended up the winner by a wide margin, López Obrador said shortly after the electoral authorities announcement. She is going to be Mexicos first (woman) president in 200 years. If the margin holds it would approach his landslide victory in 2018. López Obrador won the presidency after two unsuccessful tries with 53.2 of the votes, in a three-way race where National Action took 22.3 and the Institutional Revolutionary Party took 16.5. Still, Sheinbaum is unlikely to enjoy the kind of unquestioning devotion that López Obrador has enjoyed. In Mexico Citys colonial-era main plaza, the Zocalo, Sheinbaums win did not draw the kind of cheering, jubilant crowds that greeted López Obradors victory in 2018. Those present were enthusiastic, but comparatively few in number. I promise that I am not going to let you down, Sheinbaum said, once she arrived in the plaza. Sara Ríos, 76, a retired literature professor at Mexicos National Autonomous University, celebrated after hearing that Gálvez had conceded. The only way that we move forward is by working together, Ríos said. She is going to work to bring peace to the country, and is going to manage to advance, but it is a slow process. Fernando Fernández, a chef, 28, acknowledged challenges ahead while waiting to hear the results in the square. You vote for Claudia out of conviction, for AMLO, Fernández said, referring to López Obrador by his initials. But his highest hope is that Sheinbaum can improve what AMLO couldnt do, the price of gasoline, crime and drug trafficking, which he didnt combat even though he had the power. The main opposition candidate, Gálvez, a tech entrepreneur and former senator, had promised to take a more aggressive approach toward organized crime. In her concession speech, she said I want to stress that my recognition (of Sheinbaums victory) comes with a firm demand for results and solutions to the countrys serious problems. Nearly 100 million people were registered to vote and turnout appeared to be about 60, similar to earlier elections. Voters were also electing governors in nine of the countrys 32 states, and choosing candidates for both houses of Congress, thousands of mayorships and other local posts, in the biggest elections the nation has seen and ones that have been marked by violence. The elections were widely seen as a referendum on López Obrador, a populist who has expanded social programs but largely failed to reduce cartel violence in Mexico. His Morena party currently holds 23 of the 32 governorships and a simple majority of seats in both houses of Congress. Sheinbaum promised to continue all of López Obradors policies, including a universal pension for the elderly and a program that pays youths to apprentice. The persistent cartel violence and Mexicos middling economic performance were the main issues on voters minds. Julio García, a Mexico City office worker, said he was voting for the opposition in Mexico Citys central San Rafael neighborhood. Theyve robbed me twice at gunpoint. You have to change direction, change leadership, the 34-year-old said. Continuing the same way, were going to become Venezuela. On the fringes of Mexico City in the neighborhood of San Andres Totoltepec, electoral officials filed past 34-year-old homemaker Stephania Navarrete, who watched dozens of cameramen and electoral officials gathering where frontrunner Claudia Sheinbaum was set to vote. Navarrete said she planned to vote for Sheinbaum despite her own doubts about López Obrador and his party. Having a woman president, for me as a Mexican woman, its going to be like before when for the simple fact that you say you are a woman youre limited to certain professions. Not anymore. She said the social programs of Sheinbaums mentor were crucial, but added that deterioration of cartel violence in the past few years was her primary concern in this election. That is something that they have to focus more on, she said. For me security is the major challenge. They said they were going to lower the levels of crime, but no, it was the opposite, they shot up. Obviously, I dont completely blame the president, but it is in a certain way his responsibility. López Obrador claims to have reduced historically high homicide levels by 20 since he took office in December 2018. But thats largely a claim based on a questionable reading of statistics. The real homicide rate appears to have declined by only about 4 in six years. Just as the upcoming November rematch between U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump has underscored deep divisions in the U.S., Sundays election revealed how severely polarized public opinion is in Mexico over the direction of the country, including its security strategy and how to grow the economy.

They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. Meanwhile, the court also ordered the release of the fourth suspect of the case under a monetary bail of Rs. 100,000 and two surety bails of each worth Rs. 500,000. This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court today (03). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Accordingly, the former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana had been released on bail.",

        "title": "India begins counting votes in marathon election expected to bring Prime Minister Modi a third term",
        "date": "June 4, 2024 10:25 am",
        "content": "India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the worlds largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. The six-week election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the countrys first prime minister. Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results. Nearly 970 million people, more than 10 of the worlds population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66 on average across the seven phases, according to official data. The tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed. Extreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. We should have completed the election at least one month before, he said. We shouldnt have let it continue into so much heat. On Tuesday, BJP workers outside the partys office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the partys campaign face. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed Indias political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his partys, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modis enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election, said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved Indias standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the worlds fifth-largest. But a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modis critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the countrys minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14 of the population. Indias economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom. The countrys democracy, Modis critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on Modis guarantees, highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, India will become a developed nation by 2047, Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. His opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed theyve been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. Another victory would cement Modi as one of the countrys most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has informed that several clauses of the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

The hearing of the petitions challenging the bill commenced on the 9th of May before a three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Shiran Gunaratne, and Arjuna Obeysekera. Additional Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena, representing the Attorney General, emphasized that the bill aims to improve the efficiency of electricity generation, distribution, and sale while providing a convenient service to consumers.

The Supreme Court has concluded its hearing of the petitions and announced that it will inform its determination to the Speaker of Parliament confidentially on May 13.",
