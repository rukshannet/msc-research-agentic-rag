Premajayantha pointed out that as a result of appointing retired individuals to the independent commissions, these institutions have become ineffective. We have been trying for 06 months now. I also remind commission of the matter every week. The Public Service Commission has not given approval to issue the gazette to recruit principals, the minister mentioned.

        "content": "Protesting farmers who were attempting to reach the capital New Delhi clashed with security forces for a second day on Wednesday, with drones being used to drop tear gas shells, television visuals showed. Hundreds of farmers, travelling on trucks and trolleys loaded with food, bedding and other supplies, began marching towards Delhi on Tuesday morning after talks between their unions and the government failed to yield a commitment regarding minimum prices for a range of crops. The protesters were stopped by security forces at the Shambhu border that divides Punjab and Haryana - the northern states to which most of the protesters belong - almost 200km (125 miles) from their destination. We want the prime minister to come forward and speak to the farmers, Sarwan Singh Pandher, general secretary of the Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, told Indian news agency ANI. Farmers say the government has failed to fulfil its 2021 promise of paying more for crops. ANI visuals showed tight security arrangements in other areas bordering the national capital as well, with rows of barricades and cement blocks topped with wire meshing, and empty containers lying ready for use as physical barriers. Images also showed security forces in anti-riot gear standing ready to be deployed. A year-long protest in 2021 by farmers, a powerful voting bloc, had pushed the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to repeal some farm laws and promise to find ways to ensure support prices for all farm produce. The latest protests come with the country months away from a national election where Modi will seek a third term. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2024 12:26 pm",
        "content": "Russia has listed Estonias Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, a staunch backer of Ukraine, as a wanted person. According to the Russian Interior Ministrys database, Kallas is now wanted in connection with criminal charges, along with Estonian State Secretary Taimar Peterkop and Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys. The Interior Ministry did not initially specify which charges they faced. But later, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Kallas and the other two Baltic ministers had been designated as wanted due to alleged desecration of historical memory. The charges specifically relate to the destroying monuments of Soviet soldiers, according to a source cited by the Russian state-owned TASS agency. Kallas called Russia move nothing surprising. This is yet more proof that I am doing the right thing - the EUs strong support to Ukraine is a success and it hurts Russia, she wrote on X on Tuesday. The Kremlin now hopes this move will help to silence me and others  but it wont, Kallas added. The opposite. I will continue my strong support to Ukraine. I will continue to stand for increasing Europes defense. Putting Estonias leader on the wanted list marks a further escalation in tensions between Russia and the West. Kallas is considered one of Ukraines staunchest allies in the 27-country EU bloc. She has consistently called for scaling up military support to Ukraine and suffocating Russia with further sanctions. Turmoil hit Kallas in August 2023 after it was revealed her husbands company was continuing to operate in Russia. Spains Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez took to social media to tell Kallas that the Spanish people and Europe stood behind her. Putins move is another proof of your courage and Estonias leadership in defending democracy and freedom, Sánchez said. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, also shared a message of solidarity. Kaja Kallas, you can wear this listing on Russias wanted list as a badge of honour for your relentless defense of the values and principles on which the European Union was founded, he said on X. We will not be intimidated by the Kremlins warmongering. And we stand with you in solidarity, Michel continued. During a summit of EU leaders in February, Kallas called on countries to do more to provide Kyiv with the ammunition it needs to withstand Russias offensive. She said that the EUs failure to hit its target of providing Ukraine with one million rounds of artillery within a year was a wake up call to do more. Just months after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kallas announced her government would remove up to 400 Soviet monuments from public spaces. In August, Estonia removed a Soviet tank from the city of Narva, near the Russian border. Source: Euronews -Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2024 01:57 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that he had to beg the other countries for help, against his will, for the sake of the children of the country and their future. Accordingly, the Head of State acknowledged that, while no one would be willing to regress to the daunting setbacks Sri Lanka experienced during the height of its economic crisis in 202223, it was a time where he, as the President, had to appeal to the world so as to provide a future for the countrys children. During that period, we had to beg other countries for money. Despite it being against my will, I went ahead and begged, in order to give you a future, he said. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at the National School Textbooks Distribution Ceremony at St. Anthonys Convent, Kollupitiya, emphasising the necessity of implementing a new education system to steer the country towards economic transformation, one that aligns with global standards and can cultivate professionals suited for the competitive world market. He stressed the importance of reducing exam pressures and integrating English and technology subjects into the curriculum to prepare students for the workforce. Additionally, plans are underway to establish new vocational colleges and universities of technology, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The distribution program extends to providing textbooks and official uniforms to student monks and nuns across 10,126 schools and 822 pirivans throughout the island. Symbolically, the President himself distributed uniforms and school books to both student monks and students. Speaking further, the President said that he intends on building a strong economy in Sri Lanka that would not leave any room for recurrence of such events. I am working towards building a strong economy, so that such things will not happen again, in your future. So that you wont have to go finding fuel, or lose your jobs when youre older, President Wickremesinghe said in this regard. Expressing his ideas further, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, I live near five schools, namely my school Royal College, Thurston College, Ladies College, Mahanama College, and St. Anthonys Girls College. This background has instilled in me a deep concern for education. During President J.R. Jayawardenas tenure, we prioritized the development of these educational institutions. In 2022, the country faced a severe economic crisis that impacted every sector, including education. The inability to provide school textbooks and uniforms was a stark reality. Amidst the crisis, with no leader stepping forward, I embraced the challenge to initiate economic recovery programs. Through concerted efforts, the country has now achieved some economic stability. Consequently, timely provision of school uniforms and textbooks became feasible, with over Rs. 14 billion allocated for this purpose. I firmly advocate for education reforms and the creation of a new educational paradigm in our country. Our focus should be on nurturing professionals who can thrive in the global arena. To drive economic transformation, our education system must align with international standards, equipping students to compete effectively. By alleviating exam pressures and incorporating English and technology subjects, we aim to groom a workforce ready for the demands of the modern world. Plans are also underway to establish vocational colleges and technical universities to further this objective. None of us wish to regress to the dire state our country was in 2022, marked by long queues for gas, fuel, and food. Our collective aspiration is for a society free from such hardships. We are steadfastly committed to building a resilient economy, ensuring we never experience such turbulent times. The program to fortify Sri Lankas economy is currently underway, driven by our unwavering determination.",

        "content": "Japans space agency says its new flagship H3 rocket will have a second test flight on Saturday, two days later than an initially planned liftoff that was postponed due to a bad weather forecast at the launch site in southwestern Japan. The liftoff was originally scheduled for Thursday but was postponed due to thunder and strong wind forecasted at the Tanegashima Space Center. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said Wednesday that its H3 rocket will attempt a test flight on Saturday with an alternative launch window through the end of March. JAXA has been developing H3 for more than a decade as a successor to its current mainstay, H-2A, which has just two more flights planned before its retirement. The upcoming launch is being closely watched as a test for Japans space development after H3 failed in its debut flight last March, when the rocket had to be destroyed along with its payload, the advanced land observation satellite, or ALOS-3. This time, the rocket will carry a mockup of the ALOS satellite, called VEP-4. JAXA says the missions primary goal for the second test flight is to put the rocket into the intended trajectory. The agency also wants to place two observation microsatellites into orbit. H3 is designed to carry larger payloads than H-2A at much lower costs to be globally competitive. Expectations are high following a recent steak of successes. JAXA made a historic precision moon landing last month of its spacecraft that had been launched from the H-2A rocket, days after the 48th H-2A rocket successfully placed a spy satellite into its planned orbit.

        "content": "An Indian-origin family from Kerala was found dead at their home in California, US, in an apparent case of murder-suicide. The family have been identified as Anand Sujith Henry, 42, his wife Alice Priyanka, 40, and their 4-year-old twin children Noah and Neithan. Cops found the bodies after one of the familys relatives sought a welfare check as nobody in the house was attending the call. The Indian-American couple, Anand and Alice, were found dead with gunshot wounds inside a bathroom. The twin children were discovered dead in a bedroom, with the cause of their death still under investigation. After arriving officers were met with no response, they searched the perimeter of the home and did not see any signs of forced entry into the house. Finding an unlocked window, officers entered the home and located four people dead; 1 adult male, 1 adult female, and two children, police said. A 9mm pistol and a loaded magazine were recovered from the bathroom. The couple had purchased the house in 2020 for 2.1 million, records show. An initial assessment by the police suggests a possible murder-suicide scenario, though they have not ruled out other possibilities. Based on the information we have at this time, this appears to be an isolated incident with no danger to the public as we are confident the person responsible was located within the home, the San Mateo police department said in a statement. The family, originally from Kerala, had been living in the United States for the past nine years. Anand, a software engineer, and Alice, a senior analyst, had relocated from New Jersey to San Mateo County two years ago. Described as friendly, hardworking, and devoted parents, the couple was well-liked by both neighbors and colleagues. According to court records, Anand had filed for divorce in December 2016, but the separation did not go through in court. San Mateo Countys Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) has taken over the case, working alongside the San Mateo County Crime Lab to collect evidence. The bodies have been taken into the custody of the San Mateo County Coroner, who is working to positively identify each individual and notify next of kin. The case bears an eerie resemblance to a recent case where a wealthy Indian-origin couple and their teenage daughter were found dead in their 5 million mansion in Massachusetts. In the last month, at least seven Indian-origin people have been found dead in the US. US envoy to India Eric Garcetti reassured that the US is committed to making sure it remains a safe destination for Indian students. Source: NDTV -Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "Unofficial tallies in Indonesias presidential election on Wednesday showed Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto taking a commanding lead that could see him win in a single round if sustained. Prabowo had about 58 of votes according to four pollsters, based on ballots counted in a sample of voting stations nationwide. The number of votes they had tallied ranged from about 52 to 67 as of 0912 GMT. Rivals Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo had about 25 and 17 respectively, according to the independent pollsters that were conducting quick counts at the close of voting. Counts by reputable outlets have proven to be accurate in previous elections. An official result is not expected until several weeks after the vote. The pattern could signal a first round win for Prabowo. To win in a single round, a candidate needs more than 50 of votes cast and 20 of the ballot in half of the countrys provinces. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held in June. The contest pits popular former governors Ganjar and Anies against the pre-election frontrunner Prabowo, a former special forces commander feared in the 1990s as a top lieutenant of Indonesias late strongman ruler Suharto. Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), we hope the election can go in one round, said Nusron Wahid, secretary of Prabowos campaigning team, commenting on the latest quick counts. The worlds biggest single-day election has included nearly 259,000 candidates vying for 20,600 posts across the archipelago of 17,000 islands, but the focus has been firmly on the race to replace President Joko Widodo, opens new tab, whose influence could determine who takes the helm of the worlds third-largest democracy. The early lead will be a big boost for Prabowo, who has undergone an image rebrand and is contesting his third successive election after twice losing out to the hugely popular Widodo, who cannot run again because of term limits. Jokowi, as the incumbent is known, is tacitly backing and betting on his former rival as a continuity candidate to preserve his legacy, including a role for his son Gibran Rakabuming Raka as Prabowos running mate. Two surveys issued last week gave Prabowo just over 50 support, with Anies and Ganjar 27 and 31 points adrift, respectively, though the quick counts point to a stronger lead. This is an emphatic result that diminishes prospects for legal challenges and will also provide the Widodo-Prabowo alliance with an element of affirmation from the public for decision-making in the months ahead, said political analyst Kevin ORourke. Nonetheless, he added concerns exist about the prospect of further incursions on democratic norms. HONEST AND FAIR Former Jakarta governor Anies and ex-Central Java governor Ganjar had been trying to woo undecided voters to try to force a runoff in June. I want to underline that we want honest and fair elections so that it becomes peaceful, Anies said at a polling station. Deadly riots broke out after the 2019 election, when Prabowo had initially contested Jokowis victory. Some 200,000 security personnel are on guard. So far, the situation is safe, under control, said National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo. Anies has campaigned on promises of change and preventing a backsliding in the democratic reforms achieved in the 25 years since the end of Suhartos authoritarian, kleptocratic rule. Ganjar hails from the Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle, of which Jokowi is ostensibly a member, and has campaigned largely on continuing the presidents policies, but crucially lacks his endorsement. Before voting, he also called for a clean election so that candidates could accept the result. Hasto Kristiyanto, a senior politician in his campaign team said there had been many reports of alleged cheating in Central Java and East Java and some intimidation. Prabowo said on Wednesday he hoped the voting process goes well In later comments, made as he was treading water in a swimming pool in his private residence near Jakarta, the wealthy 72-year-old businessman told reporters he wanted to defend truth, eliminate corruption and ensure no one in Indonesia went hungry. I want there to be no 70-year-old people still driving rickshaws. Thats my wish, he said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

And its since become the most-watched trailer of all time, overtaking another Marvel fan favorite. Prepare to end up on the edge of your seat. Directed by Shawn Levy and written by Rhett Reese, Deadpool  Wolverine - or Wolverine  Ahole as Hugh Jackman calls it - stars Ryan Reynolds and Jackman in the titular roles squeezing back into their tight red and yellow suits and joining together for a movie set to take the franchise in a completely different direction, Reynolds has previously said. Reynolds and Jackman have been teasing their frenemy partnership in the third instalment for over a year. Back in July, Reynolds shared a still image of Deadpool and Wolverine, with one part of Jackmans costume causing quite the stir online. And despite production for the movie being shut down indefinitely later on because of the SAG-AFTRA strikes, Jackmans Instagram picture of his superhero-decorated Crocs indicated the show was very much back on the road. And clearly all the duos teasing has worked because as soon as the trailer dropped, Marvel fans leapt online to watch it and the excitement shows in the statistics. According to The Walt Disney Company, in the first 24 hours of being released, the trailer obtained an eye-watering 365 million views. This means the trailer has officially beaten the first trailer released for Spider-Man: No Way Home. The 2021 star studded spidery release saw not just Tom Holland and Zendaya, but also Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield take to the screen and it achieved 355.5 million views in the first 24 hours of release.

        "date": "February 14, 2024 06:50 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has summoned the Director General of the Fiscal Policy Department of the Finance Ministry to inquire into the delays in establishing a gaming regulator. The inaugural COPF meeting of the 5th session of the 9th Parliament was held on Tuesday (Feb.13), chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, who was re-appointed to the position. Despite the agreed-upon deadline of December 31, 2023 for the regulators establishment, it remains unresolved, the COPF observed during the meeting. It was also revealed that the committee has received no responses to its follow-up inquiries. Stressing the vital role of a gaming regulator in both attracting investment and recouping billions of lost revenue, COPF members emphasized the urgency of this legislation. They highlighted that inadequate regulations result in substantial losses for the government. Consequently, the MOF representative indicated a need for additional expertise to construct a robust revenue model similar to Singapores. As such, the Fiscal Policy Departments Director-General was instructed to provide details on physical and online casinos, including tax amounts, and requested a proposed plan to recover outstanding taxes. COPF granted a two-week extension for this while expecting completion of the legislation by March 31, as agreed. The COPF also approved the Secured Transaction Bill, paving the way for the implementation of the Secured Transactions Act of 2023 in Sri Lanka, which establishes clear rules for securing transactions involving movable property, ensuring that creditors rights are protected and prioritized. The Act mandates the creation of the Secured Transactions Registration Authority to oversee registration and maintenance of security rights, aiming to streamline the process and provide SMEs with better access to credit for growth. In essence, this legislation enables individuals to use movable assets, like household appliances or business equipment, as collateral to secure loans for business development, while fostering increased credit availability for SMEs and ensuring the integrity of transactions through the registry authority, guarding against fraudulent activities. The Committee also took into consideration Order under Subsection (4) of Section 3 under Strategic Development Projects Act No. 14 of 2008 and the Regulations under the Imports and Exports Control Act, No. 1 of 1969. Following consideration, the Committee approved the said Order and Regulation.",

        "date": "February 14, 2024 09:12 pm",
        "content": "Measures are afoot to initiate the Odapana loan scheme to support small- and medium-scale rice industry, Rajith Keerthi Thennakoon, the President Director General (Community Affairs) announced during a meeting held at the Presidents Office today (14). This loan scheme, implemented in response to President Ranil Wickremesinghes directives, aims to address the financial challenges encountered by small- and medium-scale rice mill owners, rice storekeepers and rice hoarders, particularly exacerbated by the economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Thennakoon highlighted the pressing issues faced by small- and medium-scale rice producers, attributing their difficulties to the economic downturn and pandemic-related disruptions. Central to the discussion was the objective of ensuring a stable market for rice and alleviating financial burdens within the industry. The primary goal of the loan scheme is to stabilize rice prices for consumers while providing fair price to farmers. Loans, initiated at the commencement of the Maha season, will offer rates of Rs. 105 per kilogram for Nadu rice, Rs. 120 per kilogram for Samba rice, and Rs. 130 per kilogram for Keeri Samba rice, it added. Approval for the said loan scheme was secured through a Cabinet memorandum submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policy, on January 24, 2024. A budget of Rs. 9 billion has been allocated, with a maximum loan amount of Rs. 50 million for rice mill owners and Rs. 25 million for rice warehouse owners and hoarders. Loan terms include a repayment period of 180 days, with an annual interest rate of 15, 4 of which will be subsidized by the Treasury. This arrangement results in a reduced annual interest rate of 11 for borrowers, the PMD mentioned. Eligibility criteria for the loan scheme extend to rice hoarders with valid contracts with small and medium paddy mill owners, provided their daily rice harvesting capacity does not exceed 25MT, or warehouse owners with sufficient storage capabilities. Thennakoon urged the All Ceylon Small- and Medium-Scale Rice Mill Owners Association to promptly disseminate information about the scheme to its members and encourage applications through relevant banking channels. Bank representatives present at the meeting were also called upon to facilitate the process. Key stakeholders, including officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from related agencies, and members of the All Ceylon Small and Medium Scale Rice Mill Owners Association, along with representatives from Peoples Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and Regional Development Bank, participated in the discussion, underscoring a collaborative effort to address industry challenges, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "February 15, 2024 06:15 am",
        "content": "Criminal gang member Piyum Hasthika alias Piyuma, who was in hiding in Dubai, UAE, was repatriated to Sri Lanka in the early hours of Thursday (Feb.15). He is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu, who is also currently in the custody of the CID. According to the Public Security Ministry, Piyuma was brought back to the island by a special team of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The CID sleuths and the deportee reached the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake around 4.50 a.m. via a SriLankan Airlines flight. Three hours later, Piyuma was escorted to the CID headquarters for onward interrogations. According to Sri Lanka Police, Piyuma was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months. He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was listed as the 8th suspect after he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that Piyuma had fled to Dubai to evade arrest. In June 2022, Piyuma was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of Kudu Salindu for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa. He was later named as the 5th suspect in this double murder. On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend Piyuma and repatriate him to the island. Meanwhile, on 11 March 2023, a team of CID officers left for Madagascar to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshitha Gunaratne, alias Kudu Salindu, who were arrested while on a visit to the island off the southeastern coast of Africa. The CID officers later returned to Sri Lanka with the notorious drug dealers on 15 March, and obtained an order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain the duo for 90 days. Based on the information divulged by the criminal duo during interrogations, the investigating officers have seized one T-56 firearm, three 9mm pistol and three revolvers.",

        "date": "February 15, 2024 06:43 am",
        "content": "One person was killed and multiple children were among 21 injured after a mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory rally on Wednesday triggered panic among huge crowds of fans. Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, which takes patients up to the age of 17, said it was treating 12 people -- 11 of them children, nine for gunshot wounds -- after the shooting, which unfolded just moments after Chiefs players had addressed a vast crowd of cheering supporters gathered nearby. Police said three people had been taken into custody after the incident, but the motive and circumstances behind the shooting were still under investigation. Kansas City fire department chief Ross Grundyson told a press conference that many of the victims had sustained life-threatening injuries. We had eight what we considered immediately life-threatening patients, we had seven with life-threatening injuries, and had six that had minor injuries, Grundyson said. After shots rang out, shocked fans scrambled to flee to safety as police worked to clear Union Station in a tragic end to what had been a joyous morning of celebration to salute the NFL champions. Paul Contreras, who was at the rally with his three daughters, said he tackled and disarmed one of the suspected shooters before the police arrived. I got the right angle on him and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve, Contreras said on CNN. I take him down, and Im putting all my body weight on him. And then another good Samaritan comes over and is helping me. Victims were treated lying on the ground before being carried away on stretchers as crowds streamed past. Im angry at what happened today, Kansas City Police chief Stacey Graves said. The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment, the police chief added. Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas was among VIPs at the event who were sent running for cover after shots rang out. This is a day that a lot of people look forward to. Something they remember for a lifetime. And what they shouldnt have to remember is the threat of gun violence, Lucas said. The Chiefs meanwhile condemned the shooting as senseless. We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of todays parade and rally, the franchise said in a statement. Praying for Kansas City, City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wrote on social media. - Huge crowds - Just moments before the shooting, Mahomes and his teammates had been soaking up the adulation from a sea of red-shirted fans. There had been no hint of trouble as hundreds of thousands of partying supporters feted Chiefs players along a two-mile (three-kilometer) route in a procession of double-decker buses, enveloped by a blizzard of red and gold confetti. Local officials said more than one million people were expected for the parade, which was held in unseasonably sunny, warm conditions in downtown Kansas City. Gun violence is not uncommon at large-scale sporting victory celebrations in North America. Last year, 10 people were wounded after a shooting which erupted in Denver amid fans celebrating the Denver Nuggets NBA championship victory. In 2019, four people were injured after gunfire broke out near a parade to honor the Toronto Raptors NBA Finals victory in Toronto. Mass shootings are also common in the United States, where there are more guns than people and about a third of adults own a firearm. The Chiefs were celebrating their third Super Bowl title in five seasons after beating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime in Las Vegas on Sunday to cement the teams dynasty status. The teams most famous fan -- music superstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs icon Travis Kelce -- was not part of the celebrations. The singer, whose relationship with Kelce became a cultural phenomenon, rushed back to the United States on Saturday from the latest leg of her money-spinning world tour to attend Sundays Super Bowl. As Kelce and the Chiefs celebrated on Wednesday, Swift was reportedly en route to Australia where she is due to perform in Melbourne on Friday. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Putin said in televised comments that we have come very close to the creation of so-called cancer vaccines and immunomodulatory drugs of a new generation. I hope that soon they will be effectively used as methods of individual therapy, he added, speaking at a Moscow forum on future technologies. Putin did not specify which types of cancer the proposed vaccines would target, nor how. A number of countries and companies are working on cancer vaccines. Last year the UK government signed an agreement with Germany-based BioNTech to launch clinical trials providing personalised cancer treatments, aiming to reach 10,000 patients by 2030. Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Merck  Co are developing an experimental cancer vaccine that a mid-stage study showed cut the chance of recurrence or death from melanoma - the most deadly skin cancer - by half after three years of treatment. There are currently six licensed vaccines against human papillomaviruses (HPV) that cause many cancers, including cervical cancer, according to the World Health Organization, as well as vaccines against hepatitis B (HBV), which can lead to liver cancer. During the coronavirus pandemic, Russia developed its own Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 and sold it to a number of countries, although domestically it ran up against widespread public reluctance to get vaccinated. Putin himself said he had taken Sputnik, in a bid to assure people of its efficacy and safety. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

In addition, complaints were also received with regard to child exploitation, trafficking, domestic abuse, neglect, and kidnapping. Mr. Amarasinghe said these complaints have been forwarded to respective authorities for onward legal action. Meanwhile, discussions are in progress to amend certain existing laws to crack down on child abuse, NCPA chairman emphasized.",

        "content": "The Government of Maldives has deported 186 foreign nationals including 25 Sri Lankans accusing them of committing crimes such as visa violations and drug offences. Among the deportees, the highest number of individuals were from Bangladesh (83), followed by India (43), Sri Lanka (25) and Nepal (08). However, the date of the deportation of these foreigners is still unknown, as per sources. The news of the deportation comes amid diplomatic an ongoing India-Maldives diplomatic row, after the Maldivian home ministry said they have undertaken efforts to shut down businesses operating illegally in the country with earnings deposited to bank accounts held by foreigners. The Maldives homeland security minister Ali Ihusan said his office is working with the finance ministry operating against illegal businesses operating under various names. He said businesses operated by a foreigner instead of the registered owner also comes under the ambit of the so-called illegal businesses. The Home Ministry was working on shutting down such businesses and deporting the foreigners who operate them, Ihusan said. If the registrar believes, based on sufficient evidence, that a business is operated with a foreigner earning profits either directly or indirectly, the registration of such businesses will be terminated pursuant to a law enacted in December 2021. Immigration Controller Shamaan Waheed said 186 foreigners found to have committed crimes have been deported from the Maldives. The Maldives Immigration detained several people in multiple operations conducted to find foreign workers who committed criminal offences, out of whom those with valid documents and passports were deported, he said. Immigration and police have been serially conducting raid operations two or three times a week, Shanahan said. The operations do not target any specific group, he added. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "February 15, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "A former general linked to past human rights abuses claimed victory Wednesday in Indonesias presidential election, a result that would raise questions about the commitment to democratic values in the sprawling island nation that is the worlds third-largest democracy. Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, 72, presented himself as an heir to immensely popular sitting President Joko Widodo, whose son was his running mate. Citing unofficial results, Subianto told thousands of supporters in the capital, Jakarta, that his victory was the victory of all Indonesians. There was no declaration by election officials, and the two former provincial governors who also competed in the balloting did not concede defeat. Subianto, who was once banned from entering the United States for two decades because of his human rights record, was an army general during the brutal period of the Suharto dictatorship, which ended just over 25 years ago in the archipelago between the Pacific and Indian oceans. He served as a special forces commander in a unit linked to torture and disappearances, allegations that he vehemently denies. According to unofficial tallies conducted by Indonesian polling agencies, Subianto had 57 to 59 of votes, with more than 80 of the vote counted in polling places that were sampled. The quick counts are based on actual votes at a sample of polling stations across Indonesia. The laborious official count may not be finished for up to a month, but quick counts have provided an accurate picture of the results of all four presidential elections held in Indonesia since it began direct voting in 2004. We should not be arrogant. We should not be proud. We should not be euphoric. We still have to be humble. This victory must be a victory for all Indonesian people, Subianto said in a speech broadcast on national television from a sports stadium. To avoid a runoff against his two rivals, Subianto needs more than 50 of all votes cast and at least 20 in each of the countrys provinces. Widodos successor will inherit an economy with impressive growth and ambitious infrastructure projects, including the ongoing transfer of the nations capital from congested Jakarta to the frontier island of Borneo at a cost of more than 30 billion. The election also carries high stakes for the United States and China, since Indonesia has a huge domestic market, natural resources including nickel and palm oil, and diplomatic influence with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Widodos rise from a riverside slum to the presidency has shown the vibrancy of Indonesias democracy in a region rife with authoritarian regimes. But with his links to a former dictator and Widodos son on the ballot, some observers fear that democratic values are eroding. The logistics of the vote were daunting, involving balloting across 17,000 islands inhabited by 270 million people. Ballots and ballot boxes were transported by boat, motorcycle, horse and on foot in some far-flung locations. Aside from the presidency, some 20,000 national, provincial and district parliamentary posts were contested by tens of thousands of candidates in one of the worlds largest elections. About 10,000 aspirants from 18 political parties eyed the national parliaments 580 seats alone. Voters interviewed by The Associated Press expressed hope their next leader would help them achieve greater prosperity in a country where nearly a tenth of the population lives in poverty. I hope Indonesia can progress better and that I did not vote for the wrong person, said Indra Nurohim, a 17-year-old high school student and first-time voter. I hope we will have a better government. Subianto, the oldest presidential candidate, lost in two previous runs to Widodo but was the front-runner in independent surveys. His running mate, Widodos eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, was allowed to run when the Constitutional Court made an exception to the minimum age requirement of 40. The court was then headed by Widodos brother-in-law, who was removed by an ethics panel for not recusing himself, and Widodo was accused of nepotism. Critics have accused Widodo of trying to build a political dynasty despite his status as the first president to emerge from outside the political and military elite since the 1998 end of Suhartos dictatorial rule, which was characterized by widespread human rights violations, plunder and political unrest. Subianto, a former lieutenant general who married one of Suhartos daughters, was a longtime commander in the army special forces, called Kopassus. He was dishonorably discharged in 1998 after Kopassus forces kidnapped and tortured political opponents of Suharto. At least 22 activists were kidnapped that year, and 13 are still missing. Their families protest weekly outside the presidential palace demanding that their loved ones be accounted for. Subianto never faced a trial and denied any involvement, although several of his men were tried and convicted. During the campaign period that concluded last weekend, Subianto and his strategists used AI and social media platforms such as TikTok to soften his image by portraying him as a cuddly grandfather to his youthful running mate. Rejected by human rights activists, he danced on the campaign stage and promised to generate nearly 20 million jobs in his first term. Anies Baswedan, one of the other presidential candidates, is the former head of an Islamic university and served as governor of Jakarta until last year. A former Fulbright scholar, Baswedan was education and culture minister from 2014 to 2016, when Widodo removed him from the Cabinet after accusing him of failing to address problems related to thousands of students affected by forest fires. Baswedan opposes Widodos plan to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to Nusantara on Borneo island, which involves constructing government buildings and residential enclaves by clearing lush tropical rainforests. In an interview with the AP last month, he said democracy in Indonesia is under threat, given Subiantos choice of the presidents son as running mate. This means that there is a decline in trust. It means that our democracy is experiencing a decline in quality. It means that many legal rules are being bent, he said. Ganjar Pranowo is the governing party candidate but does not have Widodos support. He was a national legislator for the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle for 10 years before being elected in 2013 for the first of two terms as governor of the vote-rich Central Java region. Under Widodo, Indonesia saw a period of remarkable growth averaging 5 annually, except in 2020, when the economy contracted due to the coronavirus pandemic. His economic roadmap, called Golden Indonesia 2045, projects that Indonesia will become one of the worlds top five economies, with GDP of up to 9 trillion, exactly a century after it won independence from Dutch colonizers.

        "date": "February 15, 2024 01:24 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Feb.15) emphasized the necessity of unity for national development, stating that political divisions hinder progress. Furthermore, he has extended an invitation to all parties to collaborate, not for their respective political affiliations, but to enhance the quality of life for the people of the nation, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). He made these remarks during the inauguration of the initial phase of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project on Thursday morning. The Head of State underscored that the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project is designed to safeguard agriculture in the region, addressing concerns during the inauguration of its inaugural phase. He assured farmers that the project not only caters to drinking water needs but also supports agricultural activities, urging them to dismiss any unfounded apprehensions. This endeavour, executed at a cost of Rs. 11,515 million, was spearheaded by the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, with financial backing from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The project aims to address the long-standing issue of kidney disease-afflicted regions such as Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Kebithigollewa, Horowpathana, and Kahatagasdigiliya, by ensuring access to clean drinking water. The first phase, cantered around the Anuradhapura Maha Kanadarawa Lake, has already begun serving approximately 25,000 families across 75 village service areas within the Rambewa and Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariat Divisions. President Wickremesinghe assured that this initiative would not compromise local agriculture. He underscored the dual purpose of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project, which not only caters to drinking water needs but also supports agricultural activities. Furthermore, he mentioned plans for the impending Malwatu Oya Reservoir project from the previous administration, indicating the governments commitment to advancing the North Central Province as a hub for renewable energy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing the event further said; Minister Jeevan Thondaman has assumed the significant responsibility of ensuring water access to these regions, with more households across the country still in need of such provisions. Additionally, it is imperative to equip the Tamil communities residing in the upcountry regions with essential infrastructure, as development in these areas lags behind. Urgent measures are required to address these issues, a task Mr. Jeevan Thondaman is actively pursuing today. The Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project commenced in 2013, aiming to alleviate the plight of those afflicted by kidney disease in these regions by providing clean drinking water. Simultaneously, provisions for water crucial to agricultural activities are also being prioritized. Concerns have been raised regarding potential water loss for agricultural use during project implementation, but assurances have been given that such outcomes will be avoided. Mitigation strategies are in place to safeguard against any adverse effects. The demand for water is twofold: for agricultural cultivation and residential needs. The challenges faced by individuals, including having to justify their actions to their families after engaging in public campaigns, underscore the pervasive nature of this issue. I assure you that this project will effectively address both concerns by providing water for agricultural purposes and ensuring access to clean drinking water. Despite the challenges posed by the recent economic downturn, we persevered to complete this project by securing the necessary funds, a significant obstacle in itself. Taking office in 2022 due to a lack of alternative candidates, we, with the support of various parties, initiated a national reconstruction program amidst challenging circumstances. Facing scepticism and practical obstacles, such as fertilizer shortages and fuel scarcities, we prioritized resolving these pressing issues before contemplating elections. While substantial progress has been made in revitalizing the economy, our debt burden remains, necessitating a sustained focus on economic revitalization to avoid further borrowing. Upon assuming leadership, our immediate concern was addressing the populaces basic needs, including food and fuel shortages. In times of crisis, it is paramount for any government to prioritize meeting these fundamental requirements, as emphasized by Mr. Lenin during the Russian Revolution of 1917, who advocated for Peace, Land, Bread before espousing communist ideals. Initially, our foremost priority was establishing peace and stability throughout the country, a goal that has been realized today. The prevailing environment ensures the rule of law and permits freedom of expression and assembly, allowing citizens to voice criticism and engage in peaceful demonstrations. Subsequently, our focus shifted to addressing food insecurity by facilitating agricultural activities. Through collaboration with the United States, we acquired fertilizer to boost paddy cultivation, resulting in successful harvests in 2022 and 2023. Additionally, essential food items such as rice and flour were distributed to the populace. Another critical initiative was the allocation of land, realized through the Urumaya program, alongside endeavours to grant ownership of flats in Colombo to eligible individuals. To foster a robust economy, we embarked on an agricultural modernization program aimed at improving water management and introducing new crops. Historical precedence demonstrates the potential for rice cultivation not only to sustain domestic needs but also to serve as an export commodity, akin to the countrys role as an oriental granary during ancient times. Had such initiatives been enacted earlier, our nation would not be reliant on external assistance today. Furthermore, efforts have been directed towards attracting new industries and bolstering tourism, recognizing that merely providing food is insufficient. Generating employment opportunities for the youth is imperative, especially considering the lack of job creation in recent years. To expedite economic progress, foreign investments are crucial, necessitating the formulation of new legislation to facilitate this endeavour. Let us unite in advancing this transformative agenda and collectively propel our nation towards prosperity. During elections, its natural for political factions to diverge, but post-election, there should be avenues for reconciliation and collaboration. We ought to institute a system that allows for such flexibility. The residents of our villages gain nothing from division; hence, I urge everyone to unite for a common cause. Lets work together, not for any particular political agenda, but for the betterment of our people. Collective efforts will expedite progress significantly. Its important to recognize the significance of the water supply project in the North Central region. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding the Malwatu Oya project. In tandem with these water initiatives, were actively exploring the establishment of power plants in the north-central area, leveraging both thermal and wind energy resources. Transforming this province into a major renewable energy hub holds immense potential. Furthermore, proposals for power plants utilizing lake resources are being discussed, promising substantial economic gains. I appeal to all for their support in forging a new economic landscape and securing a prosperous future for our citizens.",

        "title": "Japan slips into a recession and loses its spot as the worlds third-largest economy",
        "date": "February 15, 2024 03:58 pm",
        "content": "Japans economy is now the worlds fourth-largest after it contracted in the last quarter of 2023 and fell behind Germany. The government reported the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.4 in October to December, according to Cabinet Office data on real GDP released Thursday, though it grew 1.9 for all of 2023. It contracted 2.9 in July-September. Two straight quarters of contraction are considered an indicator an economy is in a technical recession. Japans economy was the second largest until 2010, when it was overtaken by Chinas. Japans nominal GDP totaled 4.2 trillion last year, while Germanys was 4.4 trillion, or 4.5 trillion, depending on the currency conversion. A weaker Japanese yen was a key factor in the drop to fourth place, since comparisons of nominal GDP are in dollar terms. But Japans relative weakness also reflects a decline in its population and lagging productivity and competitiveness, economists say. Real gross domestic product is a measure of the value of a nations products and services. The annual rate measures what would have happened if the quarterly rate lasted a year. Japan was historically touted as an economic miracle, rising from the ashes of World War II to become the second largest economy after the U.S.. It kept that going through the 1970s and 1980s. But for most of the past 30 years the economy has grown only moderately at times, mainly remaining in the doldrums after the collapse of its financial bubble began in 1990. Both the Japanese and German economies are powered by strong small and medium-size businesses with solid productivity. Like Japan in the 1960s-1980s, for most of this century, Germany roared ahead, dominating global markets for high-end products like luxury cars and industrial machinery, selling so much to the rest of the world that half its economy ran on exports. But its economy, one of the worlds worst performing last year, also contracted in the last quarter, by 0.3. Britains likewise contracted late last year. Britain reported Thursday that its economy entered a technical recession in October-December, shrinking 0.3 from the previous quarter. The quarterly decline followed a 0.1 fall in the previous three-month period. As an island nation with relatively few foreign residents, Japans population has been shrinking and aging for years, while Germanys has grown to nearly 85 million, as immigration helped to make up for a low birth rate. The latest data reflect the realities of a weakening Japan and will likely result in Japans commanding a lesser presence in the world, said Tetsuji Okazaki, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Several years ago, Japan boasted a powerful auto sector, for instance. But with the advent of electric vehicles, even that advantage is shaken, he said. Many factors have yet to play out, But when looking ahead to the next couple of decades, the outlook for Japan is dim. The gap between developed countries and emerging nations is shrinking, with India likely to overtake Japan in nominal GDP in a few years. The U.S. remains the worlds largest economy by far, with GDP at 27.94 trillion in 2023, while Chinas was 17.5 trillion. Indias is about 3.7 trillion but growing at a sizzling rate of around 7. Immigration is one option for solving Japans labor shortage problem, but the country has been relatively unaccepting of foreign labor, except for temporary stays, prompting criticism about discrimination and a lack of diversity. Robotics, another option, are gradually being deployed but not to the extent they can fully make up for the lack of workers. Another key factor behind Japans sluggish growth is stagnating wages that have left households reluctant to spend. At the same time, businesses have been invested heavily in faster growing economies overseas instead of in the aging and shrinking home market. Private consumption fell for three straight quarters last year and growth is set to remain sluggish this year as the household savings rate has turned negative, Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary. Our forecast is that GDP growth will slow from 1.9 in 2023 to around 0.5 this year. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas spike in inflation is expected to be short-lived and will return to the targeted 5 in the medium term, a monetary policy report released by the central bank said on Thursday as the island nations economy stabilises from a crippling financial crisis. Sri Lankas economy is seeing glimmers of recovery, helped by a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, after it went into freefall in 2022 due to a severe foreign exchange shortage. At the start of 2024, Sri Lanka raised its value added tax (VAT) to 18 from 15 to meet revenue targets under the IMF programme, sparking a renewed rise in its key inflation rate, which rose to 6.4 at the end of last month from 4 in December. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which committed to maintaining inflation at 5 under a new law introduced last year, said price increases from the tax hike in January were unlikely to persist due to subdued demand and the economy operating below its full capacity. The central bank slashed interest rates by 650 basis points last year to help Sri Lankas economy recover from soaring inflation, currency depreciation, and low reserves. The World Bank expects Sri Lankas economy to grow by 1.7 this year after contracting 3.8 in 2023. However, reforms mandated under the IMF programme would need to be speeded up to keep the recovery on track, the report said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 16, 2024 06:34 am",
        "content": "Greeces parliament approved a bill allowing same-sex civil marriage on Thursday, a landmark victory for supporters of LGBT rights that was greeted with cheers by onlookers in parliament and dozens gathered on the streets of Athens. The law gives same-sex couples the right to wed and adopt children and comes after decades of campaigning by the LGBT community for marriage equality in the socially conservative country. Greece is one of the first Orthodox Christian countries to allow such unions. This is a historic moment, Stella Belia, the head of same-sex parents group Rainbow Families, told Reuters. This is a day of joy. The bill was approved by 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament and will become law when its published in the official government gazette. Although members of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis centre-right New Democracy party abstained or voted against the bill, it gained enough support from the leftist opposition in a rare show of cross-party unity despite a tense debate. Its a very important step for human rights, a very important step for equality, and a very important step for Greek society, said 40-year-old Nikos Nikolaidis, a historian who joined a rally in favour of the bill ahead of the vote. Recent opinion polls show Greeks are split on the issue. The powerful Orthodox Church, which believes homosexuality is a sin, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage, while many in the LGBT community believe the bill does not go far enough. It does not overturn obstacles for LGBT couples in using assisted reproduction methods. Surrogate pregnancies will also not be extended to LGBT individuals, though the bill recognises children already born through that method abroad. Elliniki Lysi, one of the three far-right parties represented in parliament, called the bill anti-Christian and said it hurts national interests. Former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, a New Democracy lawmaker, said: Of course I will vote against it. The marriage of same-sex couples... is not a human right. PROUD TO BE GREEK LGBT groups rallied outside parliament. A banner read: Not a step back from real equality. Im very proud as a Greek citizen because Greece is actually - now - one of the most progressive countries, said Ermina Papadima, a member of the Greek Transgender Support Association. I think the mindset is going to change... We have to wait, but I think the laws are going to help with that. Campaigners have been pushing for change for decades, often against the tide of the Church and right wing politicians. In 2008, a lesbian and a gay couple defied the law and married on the tiny island of Tilos, but their weddings were later annulled by a top court. But there have been some steps in recent years. In 2015, Greece allowed civil partnership among same-sex couples, and in 2017 it gave legal recognition to gender identity. Two years ago it banned conversion therapy for minors aimed at suppressing a persons sexual orientation. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas annual economic growth is expected to remain positive in 2024 and gradually reach its potential over the medium term, the Central Bank said in its latest monetary policy report. The document, published on Thursday (Feb.15), provides forward-looking insights about the economy, particularly in terms of inflation and economic growth. It also aims to provide an assessment of risks to the projections on inflation and economic growth, considering the ongoing and expected developments on domestic and global fronts. The country successfully reduced its inflation rate to single-digit levels in 2023 and restored price stability, after containing the historically highest inflation observed in 2022, the Central Bank said, adding that inflation is projected to stabilise around the targeted level of 5 (year-on-year) over the medium term. Although inflation may deviate from the target in the near term, mainly due to the recent amendments to Value-Added Tax (VAT) and supply-side disruptions, the Central Bank said such an impact is likely to be short-lived. In the outset of 2024, the government increased VAT from 15 to 18 to meet revenue targets under the IMF programme. Sri Lanka is seeing traces of economic recovery, owing to the International Monetary Funds bailout package of USD 2.9 billion after it grappled with the worst financial crisis since independence in 1948.

        "content": "Russian families must produce at least two children for the sake of the nations ethnic survival, and three or more if it is to develop and thrive, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. Russia has suffered heavy but undisclosed casualties since launching its war in Ukraine nearly two years ago, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country out of opposition to the conflict or fear of being called up to fight. Putin told employees at a tank factory in the Urals region that two children per family was the minimum number if the peoples of Russia were to preserve their identities. If we want to survive as an ethnic group - well, or as ethnic groups inhabiting Russia - there must be at least two children, he said. If each family had just one child, the population would shrink, he said. And in order to expand and develop, you need at least three children. Putin declares himself a supporter of traditional values based on family, nation and the Orthodox Christian faith. In the course of his 24 years in power, the country has severely restricted expressions of sexual orientation and gender identity and banned the LGBT movement as extremist. Russia suffered two decades of gradual population decline following the collapse of the Soviet Union, exacerbated by chronic problems such as alcoholism.

        "date": "February 16, 2024 11:38 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has heard the petition challenging the decisions and recommendations made against the current Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to investigate alleged incidents of political victimisation. A group of individuals including the then-Prime Ministers Secretary and current Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake had filed the petition requesting to invalidate the decisions and recommendations made against him by the PCoI headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne. The petition was taken up for hearing before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Vengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekara, Ada Derana reporter said. Appearing for Saman Ekanayake, Presidents Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma stated before the courts that the commission had accused his client of illegally utilizing state funds to the tune of Rs. 33 million for the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat, which the PCoI referred to as a non-governmental organization that had not been established by law. He pointed out that accordingly, the relevant commission had recommended that Ekanayakes civil rights be revoked and criminal charges be filed against him over misappropriation of government funds. Furthermore, the Presidents Counsel mentioned that the Anti-corruption Committee Secretariat in question is not a non-governmental organization, but an institution which was legally established under the Cabinet approval, and stated that Ekanayake has performed his tasks as the Prime Ministers Secretary in full compliance with the law. Later, the Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing of the petition, according to Ada Derana reporter.",

        "content": "The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has secured detentions orders against criminal gang member Piyum Hasthika alias Piyuma, who was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE last morning (Feb. 15). Thus, the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court has issued a 72-hour detention order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to interrogate the suspect, after the CID reported facts to the courts regarding the repatriation of Piyuma. However, the Colombo Fort Magistrate has also ordered that the 72 hours be counted retrospectively from Feb.15, the day he was brought back to the island. Piyuma is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu, who is also currently in the custody of the CID. According to the Public Security Ministry, the criminal suspect was brought back to the island by a special team of the CID. As per police records, Piyuma was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months. He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that Piyuma had fled to Dubai to evade arrest. In June 2022, Piyuma was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of Kudu Salindu for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa. On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend and repatriate Piyuma to Sri Lanka.",

Addressing a press conference, Congress treasurer Ajay Maken said the accounts have been frozen ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. You will be surprised to know that democracy has completely ended in India. The Congress received information the day before yesterday that the partys bank cheques issued were not being honoured, Maken said. When we started probing this matter, we were told that all the bank accounts of the party were frozen, Maken said, adding that not just bank accounts (of Congress) were frozen but the countrys democracy has also been frozen. He pointed out that the Youth Congress bank accounts have also been frozen. Just a few weeks are left for the announcement of the election dates and the bank accounts of the main opposition party have been frozen. What does the central government want to prove? the party treasurer further said. Why have the bank accounts been frozen? According to the Congress, the accounts were frozen on an Income Tax demand of 25.28 million (Rs 210 crore) for 2018-19. Maken told reporters on Friday that Congress already appealed to the Income Tax appellate authority. Maken also said that the party doesnt have any money to spend, to pay electricity bills, to pay salaries to our employees. He highlighted that all political parties of the Congress will be impacted. A deep assault on Indias democracy Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge lashed out at the Modi government over the freezing of bank accounts. In a post on X, Kharge said, Power drunk Modi Govt has frozen the accounts of the countrys largest Opposition party - the Indian National Congress - just before the Lok Sabha elections. This is a deep assault on Indias Democracy! The UNCONSTITUTIONAL money collected by the BJP would be utilised by them for elections, but the money collected by us through CROWDFUNDING shall be sealed! Kharge added.

        "date": "February 16, 2024 01:20 pm",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI introduced a new AI model called Sora which it claims can create realistic and imaginative 60-second videos from quick text prompts. In a blog post on Wednesday, the company said Sora is capable of generating videos up to 60 seconds in length from text instructions, with the ability to serve up scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and detailed background details. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world, the blog post said. OpenAI said it intends to train the AI models so it can help people solve problems that require real-world interaction. This is the latest effort from the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, which continues to push the generative AI movement forward. Although multi-modal models are not new and text-to-video models already exist, what sets this apart is the length and accuracy that OpenAI claims Sora to have, according to Reece Hayden, a senior analyst at market research firm ABI Research. Hayden said these types of AI models could have a big impact on digital entertainment markets with new personalized content being streamed across channels. One obvious use case is within TV; creating short scenes to support narratives, Hayden said. The model is still limited though, but it shows the direction of the market. At the same time, OpenAI said Sora is still a work in progress with clear weaknesses, particularly when it comes to spatial details of a prompt  mixing up left and right  and cause and effect. It gave the example of creating a video of someone taking a bite out of a cookie but it not having a bite mark right after. For now, OpenAIs messaging remains focused on safety. The company said it plans to work with a team of experts to test the latest model and look closely at various areas including misinformation, hateful content and bias. The company said it is also building tools to help detect misleading information. Sora will first be made available to cybersecurity professors, called red teamers, who can assess the product for harms or risks. It is also granting access to a number of visual artists, designers and filmmakers to collect feedback on how creative professionals could use it. The latest update comes as OpenAI continues to advance ChatGPT. Earlier this week, the company said it is testing a feature in which users can control ChatGPTs memory, allowing them to ask the platform to remember chats to make future conversations more personalized or tell it to forget what was previously discussed.

        "content": "The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Excise Department to exchange information related to investigations and prosecutions of money laundering, terrorist financing and other related crimes. The agreement was inked last month in terms of the provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), the Central Bank said in a press release published on Friday (Feb.16). J. M. S. N. Jayasinghe, Commissioner General of Excise and E. H.

As money laundering and terrorist financing are financial crimes with a global presence, which could threaten the stability of national and global economic and financial systems, the Central Bank said this MoU would enable both institutions to exchange information which is vital for prevention, detection and prosecution of such offences. Since 2008, the FIU has entered into 44 MoUs with foreign counterparts as well as 11 MoUs with domestic government agencies including Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Immigration and Emigration, Inland Revenue Department, Department for Registration of Persons, Sri Lanka Police, etc., in order to share information to strengthen the AMLCFT framework of the country.",

The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers have engaged in strikes over the past few months demanding an allowance hike. The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers approval of President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Against this backdrop, a special gazette notification was published on February 13, declaring the provision of healthcare as an essential public service.",

        "title": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny dies in prison",
        "date": "February 16, 2024 05:27 pm",
        "content": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died in prison, the countrys state media reported Friday, ending a yearslong fight against corruption and the Kremlin that saw him survive several poisoning attempts. He was 47. A prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny spent his final months behind bars as the Russian leader reshaped the country to rally behind his war in Ukraine. On February 16, 2024, in penal colony No. 3, convict A.A. Navalny felt unwell after a walk, almost immediately losing consciousness, news agency Interfax reported, citing the countrys orison service. The facilitys medical workers immediately arrived at the scene and an emergency medical team was called in. All necessary resuscitation measures have been carried out, but they did not yield positive results. Emergency medics confirmed the death of the convict, it added. His death leaves Russias opposition, hampered by years of harassment and prosecution, without a clear figurehead. All of Putins most high-profile critics are now either dead, jailed or in exile. But Navalny was, undoubtedly, the biggest thorn in the Kremlins side. For over a decade, he led nationwide protests against the authorities, ran for office to challenge members of the Russian establishment and set up a network of campaign offices across the country that have since been dismantled. Born in 1976 in the tiny town of Bytyn, near Moscow, Navalny was educated as a lawyer and economist, but entered politics in 2008, starting his anti-corruption fund, FBK, three years later. He was known for his oratory skills as well as his use of the online space to promote the results of his investigations and spread his ideal of what he called the wonderful Russia of tomorrow. His digital savvy made him particularly popular among Russias more democratically minded teens and youth. Navalny rose to prominence as Russias most outspoken Kremlin critic after leading a series of anti-corruption investigations into top members of the Russian elite. His 2017 exposure of the lavish lifestyle of Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and prime minister, led to mass protests. And an investigation into a luxurious secret palace on Russias Black Sea coast, purportedly owned by Putin, resulted in a wave of indignation across Russia in 2021. Navalny tried to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from entering the race due to a 2014 embezzlement conviction, which he categorically denied as fabricated to keep him out of politics. Russian officials made a point of not referring to Navalny by name to avoid raising his profile in public. While on a business trip in Russia in August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a military nerve agent in an attempt on his life that he blamed directly on Putin. Navalny survived the ordeal thanks to the insistence of his family that he be airlifted to Germany, where he underwent treatment and a long rehabilitation process. The Kremlin denied any involvement in his poisoning, which was condemned by Western governments and led to a further straining of relations with Russia. Navalny nonetheless decided to return to Russia in early 2021 and was arrested upon landing on charges stemming from the 2014 embezzlement case. He was sentenced to 2 ½ years in prison for a parole violation linked to that conviction. The decision came days after more than 5,000 people were detained across Russia in rallies supporting Navalny. His allies have also been persecuted, and his anti-corruption fund was declared an extremist organization a few months after his sentencing, forcing it to shut down and most of the top staff to flee abroad. He was tried on new charges of fraud and contempt of court and was sentenced to nine more years in jail. Then in August, he was sentenced to a further 19 years in a maximum security penal colony on charges of extremism, in what his allies and the international community called a Kremlin campaign to keep him incarcerated forever. Navalny has denied all charges against him as politically motivated. His supporters have raised concerns about his treatment in custody and detention conditions, including access to proper medical care and frequent isolation in a tiny punishment cell. In an interview with NBC News in 2021, Putin said he could not guarantee Navalny would get out of prison alive. But even in jail, Navalny continued to challenge Putin. In his signature defiant but sarcastic style, Navalny detailed the realities of the Russian penitentiary system and promoted new anti-corruption investigations his team had been working on in exile. He issued anti-Kremlin statements through his lawyers and spoke openly against the Russian governments actions in Ukraine. He was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in 2021, with the U.S. and other governments calling for his release. A film about his life won an Oscar for best documentary feature last year. But the win caused controversy in Ukraine, where some critics painted Navalny as a Russian nationalist and pointed to comments in 2014 in which he said he sees no difference between Ukrainians and Russians  a sentiment Putin used as one of the arguments behind his war eight years later. Navalny, however, criticized the Russian-backed insurgency in east Ukraine and later described the full-scale invasion as both unjust and self-defeating. Navalny leaves behind his wife, Yulia, daughter Daria and son Zahar. Source: NBC News --Agencies",

        "date": "February 16, 2024 07:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is back in the geopolitical spotlight ahead of elections slated for later this year, and former President Maithripala Sirisena says Washington should be paying attention. Outside powers  specifically China  are exerting influence amid what Mr. Sirisena says is a moment of great instability for his country, a teardrop-shaped island just off Indias southeastern coast that has become entangled in great power politics between Washington and Beijing in recent years. Mr. Sirisena, who was president from 2015 to 2019, emphasized during a meeting with The Washington Times that his countrys citizens are enduring abject poverty trying to recover from a crippling foreign debt crisis, soaring inflation, a contracting economy and shortages of food, fuel and other basics. The former president said his goal in visiting Washington this week  a trip that included a meeting with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Afreen Akhter  was to inspire deeper bilateral cooperation and spur greater U.S. support for Sri Lanka. The main objective of this visit is to convince the State Department to save Sri Lanka from that situation and work together, Mr. Sirisena said. The Biden administration has announced roughly 300 million in aid for Sri Lanka, including loans for small businesses, since the severe economic downturn that began in 2022. But the geopolitics surrounding the aid are complex in a country of 22 million still recovering from a brutal quarter-century civil war that only ended in 2009. U.S. officials point to Sri Lanka as a case study in the debt trap that can come with participating in Chinas massive Belt and Road global infrastructure program, launched in 2017. That was the year Sri Lanka was pressured into effectively selling control of its port of Hambantota to a Chinese state-owned company after falling behind on 1.5 billion in Belt and Road financing. Sri Lankan officials have also battled with their Chinese counterparts over Beijings desire to send submarines and other military ships through Hambantota  seen as a critical location to challenge rival India in and around the Indian Ocean. The U.S.-China friction of recent years has also been felt in Sri Lanka as well. Sri Lanka has emerged as a key counterterrorism partner for the United States since a group of Sri Lankans inspired by the Islamic State terror group killed 269 people with six near-simultaneous suicide bombings in Christian churches and tourist hotels on Easter Sunday in 2019. There is a lot of cooperation between the current government in Sri Lanka and the U.S. in terms of counterterrorism, Mr. Sirisena told The Times, who said he hopes the relationship will lead to greater economic engagement from Washington. The plea comes just months ahead of Sri Lankas presidential election, which is likely to occur in November. The Associated Press has reported that incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe could run again, seeking a mandate for his tough economic stabilization program designed to bring down inflation and restore economic growth. Mr. Wickremesinghe was elected through a Parliament vote after his predecessor resigned and has faced political headwinds because of his austerity measures. Opposition figures such as Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake are likely to be the serious candidates. The election will be the first held since the economic crisis took hold. Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy and the deep economic contraction that followed triggered protests that caused then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and resign. An IMF recovery program kicked in last year, but opposition members have criticized the program because of the heavy taxes and privatization plans it demands. Thus, the polls will likely be seen as a referendum on Mr. Wickremesinghe, a career politician who has sought to be the face of a recovering Sri Lanka. The U.S., China and India  New Delhi has also provided assistance and loans to Sri Lanka  will all be watching for what the election brings. Source: The Washington Times --Agencies",

        "title": "Climate change fuelling domestic violence against women in Sri Lanka - report",
        "date": "February 16, 2024 08:54 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka, like many other island nations, continues to suffer from the devastation that is climate change. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, the nations farmers are struggling to cope with crop failures and lost income. Unfortunately for the women in the country, this tragedy is increasingly turning them into the victims of domestic violence at the hands of their own frustrated families, a Reuters report reveals. The feature elaborates on the miseries of female Sri Lankan farmers such as Renuka Karunarathna. Years of scant rainfall and extreme droughts have led to failed harvests, pushing her family into extreme poverty. Renukas husband, like many other partners discontented by their economic hardships, takes his anger out on his wife, often in the form of physical abuse. Studies have pointed to a clear link between climate change and domestic violence. When basic needs like food and water become scarce, tensions within families rise. Men, often burdened by the traditional role of breadwinner, may resort to violence to express their frustrations. This is further exacerbated by social norms that normalise violence against women in some countries. While detailed data on the direct link between climate change and domestic violence is scarce, Sri Lankas 2023 national policy on climate change paints a grim picture. The report reveals a 22-fold increase in climate-induced hazards compared to 1973-1983. Additionally, the nations 2019 Womens Wellbeing Survey found that nearly 40 of Sri Lankan women have experienced physical, sexual, emotional or economic abuse from their partners, the report reads. Considering a third of Sri Lankan farmers comprise women, there is some form of self-reliance among them. However, floods, droughts, deforestation and drying water sources have decimated traditional farming practices, inevitably leaving even these self-sufficient women more reliant on their husbands. This reliance often leaves them more vulnerable to their husbands frustrations and violence. The report outlines that many women are often denied permission to visit their parents and siblings, and are beaten up if they forcefully try to leave. And as the independence of these women diminishes, so does their dignity and ability to leave such abusive situations. Further, social stigma prevents many such women from disclosing the violence at home, surveys found. Combating climate change and its impact on women requires a multi-pronged approach. Addressing the root causes of violence, such as economic hardship and social norms, is crucial. Additionally, investing in climate-resilient agriculture and empowering women through income generation and education are vital steps towards a safer and more equitable future.

        "title": "Trump ordered to pay 354mn in New York civil fraud case",
        "date": "February 17, 2024 07:05 am",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump must pay nearly 355 million (281 million) to New York state for lying about the values of his properties, a judge has ruled. Judge Arthur Engoron also banned him from serving as a company director or taking out loans from banks in the state for three years. The New York real estate mogul escaped having some of his companies dissolved, which could have meant bankruptcy. Speaking from his Florida estate, Mr Trump said he would appeal the ruling. A crooked New York state judge just ruled I have to pay a fine for 350 million for having built a perfect company, the former president said from Mar-a-Lago on Friday, calling the ruling a political witch hunt. Its a very sad day for - in my opinion - the country. In the ruling on Friday, Judge Engoron referred to previous allegations of wrongdoing in justifying the large amounts he ordered the defendants to pay, writing that they are likely to continue their fraudulent ways unless he imposed a significant penalty. He made specific reference to the Trump Organizations conviction in a criminal tax fraud case in 2022, where a jury found it had enriched its top executives with off-the books benefits for more than a decade. Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological, Judge Engoron wrote in an at times scathing 92-page decision. Later he said: The frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience. Still, Mr Trumps empire was spared from one of the worst potential outcomes - the cancellation of its business licenses, known as the corporate death penalty. Instead, the judge ordered two tiers of oversight - an independent monitor to report to the court for up to three years and a separate independent director of compliance to be installed. The judge is also requiring Mr Trump pay interest on the profits he made by committing the fraud (known as prejudgment interest), which could bring the final amount penalty total to around 450 million. Along with what Mr Trump has been ordered to pay, his two adult sons and co-defendants, Donald Jr and Eric, must each pay 4 million. They are barred for two years from doing business in New York, while another co-defendant, Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has been ordered to pay 1 million. Additionally, Mr Trump, his company, and its affiliates cannot apply for loans in New York for three years. Both of Mr Trumps sons denounced the ruling on social media, with Donald Jr claiming the judgment was politically motivated and Eric calling the judge a cruel man. In her civil case, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had accused all four defendants and the wider Trump Organization of massively inflating property values and lying on financial statements so they could borrow large sums of money at favourable interest rates. She had asked for a fine of 370 million. Speaking on Friday, she said: There cannot be different rules for different people in this country, and former presidents are no exception. Donald Trump may have authored the art of the deal, but he perfected the art of the steal, she told a news conference. In September, Judge Engoron ruled Mr Trump was liable for business fraud, finding he had misrepresented his wealth by hundreds of millions of dollars. In one instance, the judge found Mr Trumps financial statements had wrongly claimed that his Trump Tower penthouse was almost three times its actual size. The subsequent 43-day trial that took place late last year and included testimony from 40 witnesses, focused mostly on determining penalties against Mr Trump. Judge Ergorons ruling lays out in detail his reasoning, often diving deep into finance and accounting practices and directly addressing testimony from experts and witnesses. In order to borrow more and at lower rates, defendants submitted blatantly false financial data to the accountants, resulting in fraudulent financial statements, he wrote. When confronted at trial with the statements, defendants fact and expert witnesses simply denied reality, and defendants failed to accept responsibility. Judge Engoron may have made a thorough record expecting that Mr Trump would appeal, legal experts told the BBC. Mr Trump vehemently denied wrongdoing throughout the trial. In a six-minute speech during closing arguments in January, Mr Trump declared himself an innocent man and called the case a fraud on me. And the former president said repeatedly that he paid his lenders, which meant there was no crime. While in his ruling Judge Engoron acknowledged that no banks were hurt, he added that the next group of lenders to receive bogus statements might not be so lucky. The latest penalty comes on top of the 83.3 million Mr Trump owes writer E Jean Carroll in a separate defamation case. But while the amount is high, it is not expected to bankrupt a man whose total net worth has been estimated at 2.6 million. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 17, 2024 10:37 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for Alexei Navalnys death and warned there could be consequences, saying he was not surprised but outraged by the opposition leaders passing. We dont know exactly what happened, but there is no doubt that the death of Nalvany was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did, Biden said at the White House after Russian prison officials announced that Navalny had died. Russian authorities are going to tell their own story, Biden said. But make no mistake. Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalnys death. He also said he was contemplating additional steps to punish Russia in the aftermath of Navalnys death, paying tribute to the opposition leader for bravely standing up to Putins governments corruption and violence. Were contemplating what else can be done, Biden said in response to questions from reporters. Were looking at a whole number of options, thats all Ill say right now. Biden also told reporters that there was no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment, even as Russia considered deploying anti-satellite technology in space. Russia has previously denied the claim. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what possible steps against Russia were being evaluated. U.S. officials were still seeking more information about Navalnys death at a Russian penal colony north of the Arctic Circle, where he was dispatched less than two months ago. But the development, and Bidens reaction, has put a further chill into already bitter U.S.-Russian relations. The 47-year-old Navalny had been a leading critic of Putin, and Biden had said after meeting Putin in Geneva in June 2021 that Nalvanys death would risk devastating consequences for Putin. Biden and Putin remain deeply at odds over Russias invasion of Ukraine two years ago, over which Russia has been sanctioned by the United States and other Western nations, and Biden is urging Republican hardliners in the U.S. Congress to support additional funding to pay for more weaponry for Ukraines military. Russia has figured prominently on the campaign trail as Biden seeks reelection in November. His expected Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, triggered bipartisan outrage last week by saying he would do nothing to defend NATO allies from Russia unless they paid a greater share for the common defenses. The top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, has not put a Senate bill including 95.34 billion in security assistance for Ukraine and Israel, international humanitarian aid and resources to help allies in the Indo-Pacific up to a vote. After Navalnys death, Johnson said the U.S. and its allies should use every means available to cut off Putins ability to fund his unprovoked war in Ukraine and aggression against the Baltic states. Historys watching the House of Representatives. The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten, Biden said. In Munich for a major security conference, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed that the U.S. would never retreat from its NATO alliance obligations put in place after World War Two, contrasting Bidens approach to global engagement with presidential election hopeful Trumps isolationist views. She also met with Alexei Navalnys wife Yulia on the margins of the conference and expressed her sorrow and outrage over reports of her husbands death, a White House official said. Bidens presidential reelection campaign on Friday released a new minute-long advertisement blasting Trump for abandoning NATO. They planned to target the ad to 2.5 million American voters in the closely contested election states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania who trace their ancestry to the NATO states bordering Russia.

        "date": "February 17, 2024 11:08 am",
        "content": "In a major relief to the fishing community in Tamil Nadu, 20 fishermen from Rameswaram were released, while two boatmen and a fisherman were directed to undergo a jail term of six months and one year respectively, for repeating the offence of poaching, a court in Sri Lanka has ruled. According to fishermen leader Jesu Raja, 42 fishermen were arrested, in two incidents: one of 23 arrests and the second of 19 arrests, on charges of poaching by the Sri Lankan Navy earlier this month, while they were engaged in fishing along the Palk Bay. Two boats were also impounded. After the fishermen staged agitation and stayed away from venturing into the sea for a day, political parties in Tamil Nadu condemned the arrest and urged the Union government to intervene in the issue immediately. T.N. CM M.K. Stalin also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to make diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the Tamil Nadu fishermen. Subsequently, a Sri Lankan court has released 20 fishermen, and at the same time ordered a six-month jail term for two boatmen and one year of imprisonment for one other fisherman. It is said that the court had given this sentence after the three were found to have repeated the offence of poaching. The fishermen leader said that fishers went into the sea to earn a livelihood, and the Sri Lankan governments arrests were badly affecting them. The Union government must bring about a safer environment for the fisherfolks survival, he noted. The families of the fishermen have appealed to the Union and the Tamil Nadu government to help them by having the remaining fishermen released as well. The sentence given to the three people should also be withdrawn in the larger interest of their livelihoods, they said. A Fisheries Department official said that the released fishermen would be handed over to the Indian High Commission officials and after due procedures, they would be flown to Chennai and later taken to their homes.

In December 2023, the Kaduwela police had seized five luxury buses, a luxury car and a motorcycle owned by the sister of Malalage Sudath Kithsiri alias Welivita Sudda, who is said to be a drug trafficker, and handed them over to the CID.",

        "title": "Two teenagers charged over shooting at Kansas City Super Bowl parade",
        "date": "February 17, 2024 01:12 pm",
        "content": "Two teenagers have been charged over a shooting at a Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City that left one person dead and 22 others injured. The two suspects, both aged under 18, are being held on gun and resisting arrest charges, a court statement said. Police earlier said the shooting was the result of an argument and was not connected to terrorism. A third person who was detained after the shooting has been released. A statement from the Jackson County Family Court on Friday said that additional charges were expected in the future as the investigation by the Kansas City Police Department continues. The names of the juvenile suspects have not been released. Juvenile court cases are kept private under Missouri law, and hearings are not open to the public. Kansas City Police have continued to appeal for information about the shooting, which occurred near the citys Union Station just after a parade and rally for the Super Bowl champions. On Thursday, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said the injured victims ranged in age from eight to 47 years old and that at least half were under 16. The deceased victim was identified as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, 43, a local DJ. Ms Lopez-Galvan hosted Taste of Tejano, a Tex-Mex music show, on community radio station KKFI. Her son was shot in the leg but has been discharged from hospital. Two other family members were also injured in the shooting, according to the radio station. Ms Lopez-Galvan was hailed as a community leader who used her media profile to fundraise for Latino community events and organisations, toy drives for children with cancer and college scholarships. An online fundraiser in support of the DJs family raised more than 230,000 (180,000) - including 100,000 from Taylor Swift. Further details have also emerged about the reaction of the crowd and the Kansas City Chiefs players, who were celebrating their second straight NFL championship. The parents of a 13-year-old who got separated from his father during chaos following the shooting praised a player who helped shelter their son. Zach Cotton got separated from his father inside Union Station and found himself behind the station, near where buses were waiting to pick up players after the victory rally. Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire and other members of the team sheltered the teenager before he was reunited with his family. Responding to a thank you note posted by Zachs mother on Facebook, Mr Edwards-Helaire wrote: Sorry the family and all of Chiefs Kingdom had to experience this. Just wanted to thank Zach for trusting me and knowing Ill protect him. Another teenager, Gabe Wallace, told the Kansas City Star that he and others were comforted by the Chiefs head coach in the panic after the shots rang out. Andy Reid was trying to comfort me, which was nice, Gabe said. He was kind of hugging me, just like, Are you OK, man? Are you OK? Just please breathe. He was being real nice and everything.

        "title": "NHSL junior staff to continue protests until Dr. Bellana is removed",
        "date": "February 17, 2024 01:45 pm",
        "content": "The junior staff of the Colombo National Hospital stress that they will continue the protests until the hospitals Deputy Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana is removed from his position. They resorted to this move against the criticisms made by Dr. Bellana regarding the junior staffers involvement in the recent strike launched by health trade unions over disparities in allowances. On Friday (Feb. 16), Dr. Bellana was forcibly held inside his office by the junior staff of the hospital. Later, a tense situation arose in front of the hospital as the staff members commenced a demonstration. Thus, police anti-riot squads were also deployed to beef up the security of the hospital premises. A collective of 72 health sector trade unions recently carried out an island-wide strike action over disparities in allowances, which was heavily criticized by Dr. Bellana. However on Wednesday (14), the health trade unions decided to call off their strike after Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana had agreed to a discussion with them. The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, public health inspectors, and entomology officers have engaged in strikes over the past few months demanding an allowance hike. The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers approval of President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Against this backdrop, a special gazette notification was published on February 13, declaring the provision of healthcare as an essential public service. CORRECTION: Dental surgeons have been omitted from the names of health sector professionals who had engaged in the strike action.",

        "title": "France signs security pact with Ukraine, pledges up to 3 billion in additional military aid",
        "date": "February 17, 2024 04:13 pm",
        "content": "The agreement includes a French aid pledge for up to 3 billion for 2024, after 1.7 billion in 2022 and 2.1 billion last year. Both deals are part of Zelenskys drive to shore up help for his forces who are struggling to hold off Russian attacks on the frontline city of Avdiivka. After touching down at Orly airport south of the French capital, Zelensky travelled on to the Elysee palace where he met with President Emmanuel Macron to sign the accord. The French presidency said ahead of the meeting that the pact would run for 10 years, and include precise commitments from the French side, including financial pledges. It would strengthen cooperation in the area of artillery, the presidency said, without providing details. The deal is also to help pave the way towards Ukraines future integration into the European Union and NATO, officials said. With the Ukraine war about to enter its third year, Zelensky was to make further pleas for sustained help with financing and armaments at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, where leaders like US Vice President Kamala Harris have gathered. Zelenskys European tour comes at a critical time with Ukraine facing mounting pressure on the eastern front because of ammunition shortages and fresh Russian attacks. Fierce fighting raged around the beleaguered frontline town of Avdiivka, which has become a main Russian target ahead of the February 24 invasion anniversary. The long-term future of billions of dollars of Western aid is meanwhile in doubt, with the biggest contributor, the United States, in the throes of an election year. A possible 60-billion package of military aid has been held up in Washington since last year because of wrangling in Congress. The EU has also admitted that it will only be able to make good on half of the one million artillery shells it promised to send by March. But Scholz underlined that the security pact inked in Berlin on Friday illustrates that Germany will not let up in supporting Ukraine. He also announced a new package of immediate military support worth 1.1 billion euros (1.2 billion). For as long as it takes This document ... shows that Germany will continue to help Ukraine with its defence against Russias attacks. I have often said: for as long as it takes, said Scholz, who also called the signing of the deal a historic step. The agreement lays out support for a post-war Ukraine to build up a modern army that can repel further attacks from Russia in the future. Our security agreement is a truly unprecedented bilateral document, said Zelensky. G7 nations flagged plans to provide Ukraine with long-term defence support on the sidelines of the NATO summit last July. Alliance leaders failed, however, to set a timetable for Ukraine to join the bloc. A first agreement had been signed with Britain in January, during Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks visit to Kyiv. Zelensky is seeking to shake off any war fatigue besetting his allies. Addressing the conference in Munich, Harris said President Joe Bidens administration will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. Abandoning Kyiv would be a gift to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin, she said, on the eve of bilateral talks with Zelensky. Ukraine was once the main conflict on the minds of world leaders but Israels war with Hamas and the ensuing escalating crisis in the Middle East now also require urgent attention. Zelenskys European tour was meanwhile overshadowed by the announcement Friday of the death in a Russian prison of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that sparked worldwide reactions. Obviously he was killed by Putin, Zelensky said in Berlin. Like thousands of others who have been tortured. He said this demonstrated why Putin must be made to lose everything and held accountable for his actions. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "All individuals implicated in the deceptive act of switching license plates on two buses at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Bus Depot in Ampara have been interdicted, as announced by Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena. The scandal unfolded during the second phase of the project aimed at renovating 200 out-of-service buses and reintegrating them into passenger transport services. This initiative, held on February 9, 2024, was graced by the presence of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Minister Gunawardena. The government had reportedly allocated a substantial sum of Rs. 270 million for the renovation, with the Ampara SLTB Bus Depot receiving Rs. 2 million for its refurbishment activities. However, it has come to light that officials at the Ampara SLTB Bus Depot deceptively switched the license plates of a bus designated for renovation. The altered license plate had been then affixed to another operational bus, misleadingly incorporating it into the event showcasing the launch of renovated buses for passenger transport services. The SLTB has initiated investigation into the matter.",
