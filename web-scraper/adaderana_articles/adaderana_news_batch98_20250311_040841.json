        "date": "March 14, 2024 04:56 pm",
        "content": "Large-scale drug trafficker Mohommed Shiran Basik was acquitted from a drug case against him on orders of the Colombo High Court on Thursday (14 March). Colombo High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne ordered the defendants acquittal citing significant contradictions in the testimonies provided by officers of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB). According to the complaint, Basik was apprehended on 11 January 2011, near the Edmonton housing scheme in Kirulapana with 4.53 grams of heroin. Initially, it was reported that he was arrested alone, but later police officials claimed he was with his child at the time of arrest. Moreover, despite a police officers assertion that the raid was prompted by a tip-off received by the police from a certain phone number, evidence presented by the defense revealed that the phone number in question had been disconnected approximately one and a half years prior. Given these inconsistencies, the judge deemed it inappropriate to convict the accused. The trial proceeded in the absence of Basik, who has fled to Dubai. In a separate development, authorities had recently initiated the demolition of a hotel situated near the beachfront in the Dehiwala area, reportedly owned by the accused.",

        "title": "Australian billionaire revives dream to set sail on Titanic II",
        "date": "March 14, 2024 05:41 pm",
        "content": "For more than a decade, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer has been the driving force behind plans to build Titanic II  a replica of the ill-fated ship that sank in 1912 with more than 2,200 people on board. Only about 700 survived, creating history as the worlds most disastrous voyage  and the light bulb of an idea for a billionaire with an interest in cruising and cash to burn. Palmer first launched plans for Titanic II in 2012, and again in 2018. Six years later, hes done it again, relaunching the project on Wednesday during a press briefing at Sydney Opera House against the backdrop of the citys famed harbor. Once again, the question is why? Its a lot more fun to do the Titanic than it is to sit at home and count my money, Palmer reportedly told local media with the blunt honesty of man who earns almost half a billion dollars in mining royalties every year. For Palmer the question is not how to earn money, but where to spend it. When he first floated his dream of building a more buoyant version of the Titanic more than a decade ago, the popular view was that he was rich and eccentric enough to do it. But headwinds of the pandemic hit, and the multimillion-dollar project was put on hold as ports closed and passengers reassessed their risk appetite for being quarantined at sea. Palmer, chairman of the Blue Star Line company behind the Titanic project, also had other issues on his agenda. In recent years hes launched multiple court cases against state and federal governments. He took on the Western Australian state government over its decision to shut its borders during in the pandemic. Another High Court loss came when he sought billions of dollars in damages from the same state government over its decision to block his access to compensation over an iron ore project. Hes now taking that to an international tribunal, seeking almost 200 billion in damages from the federal government. Then theres his bids for political office, as the founder of the United Australia Party, registered in 2018, whose policies included an Australian Bill of Rights and bans on Covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates. He famously spent millions of dollars on advertising for very little electoral return, and the party was deregistered in 2022. Now the pandemic has passed, and cruise ships are once again at sea, Palmer said the time is right to revive his Titanic dream. We are very pleased to announce that after unforeseen global delays, we have reengaged with partners to bring the dream of Titanic ll to life. Let the journey begin, Palmer said in a press release. The plans are very similar to previous iterations, checked to ensure they comply with current regulations. Tenders are being sought, with plans to confirm a ship builder by the end of the year, to begin work in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, Palmer expects the winning bidders to be based in Europe. He doesnt believe Chinese standards are up to the task, he told reporters. At the relaunch, his team distributed an eight-minute video thats been around for several years, showing the layout of the ship and how each room will look, complete with actors dressed in period costume. Passengers will be encouraged to dress for the 1900s, but its not mandatory, a spokesperson said. The ship itself will be 269 meters (833 feet) long and 32.2 meters (105 feet) wide  slightly wider than the original. Capacity will be 2,345 passengers spread across nine decks with 835 cabins. Almost half of those will be reserved for first class passengers. Third class passengers will be treated to stew and mash at long tables in a communal dining room  as they were on the original boat  though a spokesperson said other meals will also be available for those who want a less authentic experience. More than a century after the Titanic went down, researchers and historians remain captivated by its story. The tragedy inspired James Camerons Oscar-winning 1997 blockbuster Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and has fascinated amateur explorers drawn to the wreck. One such mission ended in tragedy in June last year when all five passengers aboard the Titan submersible were killed when the vessel suffered a catastrophic implosion en route to the wreckage. Palmer wants to replicate the Titanic  without the tragic ending  and he also wants world peace. We all know how to make war. We get armies and we fund wars. People know about that. But it is a lot harder to make peace. To make peace you have got to stick with it every day. You progress inch by inch, he said in the press release. Titanic ll is something that can provide peace. It can be a ship of peace between all countries of the world. Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic ll will be the ship where those dreams come true, Palmer said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "US ban on TikTok would rob Biden, Democrats of 2024 election tool",
        "date": "March 14, 2024 05:51 pm",
        "content": "If President Joe Biden keeps his promise to sign a ban on TikTok over its ties to the Chinese government, the 81-year-old may rob his reelection campaign of a platform that he and fellow Democrats rely on to reach younger voters. Bidens campaign got thousands of likes on Tuesday for a TikTok video skewering Republican rival Donald Trump about cutting Social Security spending. But the comments were focused on another issue altogether: the proposed ban. Good thing we saw this on TikTok, said one. How are you going to use this to campaign if you ban it? asked another. House Republicans voted Wednesday to force TikToks Chinese owner ByteDance to divest its 170 million user U.S. business, or face a ban. If the Senate passes the bill, as the White House urges, Biden has pledged to sign it. But the 2024 campaign is shaping up to be close, and Democratic-leaning U.S. political discourse online has shifted to TikTok in recent years, political strategists say. They note that X, formerly Twitter, has cut back on harassment curbs under owner Elon Musk while Facebook moved away, opens new tab from political content while the short-form video site is the platform of choice for a new generation of politically engaged Americans. TikToks users belong disproportionately to groups that vote reliably for Democrats, which Biden needs to woo. Trumps campaign does not have an official TikTok account. Roughly 60 of TikToks regular U.S. news consumers are Democrats or Democrat-leaning, according to a 2023 study from the Pew Research Center. Nineteen percent of TikToks news consumers are Black, and 30 are Hispanic, versus about 14 and 19 of the general U.S. population, respectively. About 44 of news consumers on TikTok are between ages 18 and 29. Banning TikTok risks displacing a large part of the electorate from the ability to communicatemeaningfully about politics at a time when a highly contentious election is about to occur, said Samuel Woolley, journalism professor and director of the University of Texas at Austins propaganda research lab. We voted Joe Biden in through social media, through the power of TikTok, said NaomiHearts, a self-described Chicana trans woman with 1.1 million followers on TikTok, noting that youth voter participation hit a record in 2020. Why just TikTok? A ban would take away young voters favorite social media app where they get their news, where they follow their favorite people where they get entertainment, where theyre allowed to basically escape, said Dr. Anthony Youn, a plastic surgeon with 8.4 million TikTok followers. The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to artificial intelligence to cranes at U.S. ports. This is a critical national security issue, No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said on social media platform X. TikTok denies sharing any user data with China and says the ban would deprive Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. SEPARATE TIKTOK PHONES Bidens reelection campaign joined TikTok in February, using the NFLs Super Bowl to kick off its new account to reach young voters ahead of the presidential election in November. The campaigns account, BidenHQ had 237,500 followers as of March 13, while thedemocrats had over half a million. The White House briefed over 70 influencers and content creators on TikTok and other social media platforms with a combined audience of over 100 million followers, on topics like student debt and economic issues ahead of the presidents State of the Union address to amplify his message. We are not concerned about the impact of a ban on Bidens reelection chances, said a top White House official. There are lots of twists and turns before anything ends up happening here, because Trump is opposed to the bill, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not committed to bringing it on the floor. A second White House official said: National security concerns outweigh how anyone is feeling. The president is not thinking of national security based on reviews from users on whether they are happy or not on TikTok or any other platform, the official said. Federal employees are banned from having TikTok on their phones, so Biden administration staff are not allowed to have the app on their work phones. Bidens campaign staff workers are not employed by the government and do not deal with national security issues, so they are allowed to have TikTok on their phones, said one source briefed on the issue. But most campaign staffers in frequent contact with the White House have two phones. Just one engages with TikTok in order to isolate using the app from other workstreams and communications, including emails, the source said. The White House has previously cited concerns about TikToks preservation of data and potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors. Were taking the security precautions necessary to make sure no data is getting into the wrong hands, the source said. The campaign is trying to reach people where they are, the source added. Well see what happens in the Senate, and were far away from any decision on this. Its wait-and-see mode for everybody. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "March 14, 2024 07:27 pm",
        "content": "Anuradha Jayaratne, the State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs, hinted at the potential submission of 107 newly revised bills to Parliament between 2022 and 2023. Moreover, the Minister pointed out that in 2023, the agriculture and industry sectors together produced earnings worth 116 million rupees, thanks to the labour contributions of inmates. These statements were made by the State Minister during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (14), focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne; In 2022, Parliament successfully submitted 29 new bills, followed by an impressive 78 new bills in 2023, resulting in a total of 107 bills. This milestone marks the largest number of bills to be amended in the history of the Ministry of Justice, reflecting a significant legislative effort and commitment to addressing various legal matters and reforms. Furthermore, there has been a notable initiative to empower inmates within prisons by providing them with employment opportunities. Through collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors, initiatives have been launched to integrate inmates into the workforce from within the prisons. This initiative is particularly evident in prisons such as Welikada, Mahara, and Agunakolapalassa, where activities like manufacturing shoes, coils, and food have been established, showcasing a positive step towards rehabilitation and skill development among the incarcerated population. Furthermore, there has been a focus on exploring the house arrest concept as an alternative to traditional punishment periods. A committee, led by Justice of the Supreme Courts Mr. Yasanta Kodagoda has submitted a report on this matter. Minister of Justice, Wijedasa Rajapakshe has obtained cabinet approval for this initiative, which is now in the process of being translated into law. It is anticipated that this legislation could be enacted in 2024. This approach is seen as a potential solution to address issues such as prison overcrowding and resource allocation for inmates. Currently, the annual cost for housing inmates is Rs. 04 billion. The prison population stands at 30,793 individuals, far exceeding the capacity designed for 12,000 inmates. To address this issue, amendments to acts such as the Bail Act are being considered. Furthermore, in 2023, the agriculture and industry sectors generated earnings of 116 million rupees, primarily due to the labour contributions of women. The projected profit for 2024 is estimated to be Rs. 92,572,967.00. Moreover, inmates with drug addiction issues should receive skills training and be directed towards effective rehabilitation methods. Efforts have been made to enhance the existing community reform system, resulting in 14,026 individuals being referred to relevant programs in 2023. This number is anticipated to rise to 15,000 in 2024. Additionally, 22 buildings and 22 acres of land owned by the Kantale Sugar Factory have been acquired to facilitate the rehabilitation of inmates sent to prison for drug-related offenses. Furthermore, 6 acres of land in the Vavuniya area have been designated for the establishment of an integrated rehabilitation centre specifically for women. In an effort to strengthen relationships between the judiciary and the public, reconciliation committees have been established in various rural service sectors. Additionally, plans are underway to establish Ecumenical Advisory Boards that will oversee each district, further enhancing community engagement and support. Furthermore, collaborative initiatives have been launched with the Ministry of Health. As a result, the Ministry of Health has consented to transferring Mantiv Island, Batticaloa, previously designated for communicable diseases to the prison department. It is expected to be used for rehabilitation and agricultural purposes.",

        "title": "Hundreds rescued from love scam centre in the Philippines",
        "date": "March 14, 2024 07:35 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of people have been rescued from a scam centre in the Philippines that made them pose as lovers online. Police said they raided the centre on Thursday and rescued 383 Filipinos, 202 Chinese and 73 other foreign nationals. The centre, which is about 100km north of Manila, was masquerading as an online gambling firm, they said. South East Asia has become a hub for scam centres where the scammers themselves are often entrapped and forced into criminal activity. Young and tech-savvy victims are often lured into running these illegal operations, which range from money laundering and crypto fraud to so-called love scams. The latter are also known as pig butchering scams, named after the farming practice of fattening pigs before slaughtering them. These typically start with the scammer adopting a fake identity to gain their victims affection and trust - and then using the illusion of a romantic or intimate relationship to manipulate or steal from the victim. This often happens by persuading them to invest in fake schemes or businesses. Thursdays raid near Manila was sparked by a tip-off from a Vietnamese man who managed to flee the scam centre last month, police said. The man, who in his 30s, arrived in the Philippines in January this year, after being offered what he was told would be a chefs job, said Winston Casio, spokesman for the presidential commission against organised crime. But the man soon realised that he, like hundreds of others, had fallen prey to human traffickers running love and cryptocurrency scams. Those trapped in the Bamban centre were forced to send sweet nothings to their victims, many of whom were Chinese, Mr Casio said - they would check in on their recipients with questions about their day and if and what they had eaten for their last meal. They would also send photos of themselves to cultivate the relationship. Mr Casio said those running the scam centres trapped good looking men and women to lure victims. On 28 February, the Vietnamese man escaped the facility by climbing up a wall, crossing a river, and seeking refuge at a farm. The farm owner then reported it to the police. There were signs of torture on the man, including scars and marks from electrocution, said Mr Casio, whose team visited the man early this month. Mr Casio added that several others have tried to escape but were always caught. Police also seized three shotguns, a 9mm pistol, two .38 calibre revolvers, and 42 rounds of live ammunition from the centre. Authorities are still in the initial stages of the investigation as most of those rescued from Thursdays raid are still shaken, he said. In May last year, Philippine authorities rescued more than 1,000 people who were held captive and forced to run online scams inside a freeport zone in Clark, a city also north of Manila - in what remains its biggest bust to date. A UN report last August estimated that hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have been trafficked to Southeast Asia to run online scams. The BBC has previously spoken to people who have fallen victim to these criminal networks. Many have said they travelled to South East Asian countries such as Cambodia and Myanmar in response to job ads and promises of perks. They are trapped once they arrive, and threatened if they refuse to participate in the scams. Escapees and survivors have alleged torture and inhuman treatment. Governments across Asia, from Indonesia to Taiwan, have expressed alarm at the rise in these scam centres. Foreign embassies in countries like Cambodia and Thailand, for example, have issued warnings to their citizens to beware of being lured into scam centres. China issued public rewards for warlords who were running scam centres across the border in Myanmar - these centres were run by Chinese mafia families and targeted Chinese nationals. Many of those arrested have been handed over to China in recent months. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 14, 2024 09:20 pm",
        "content": "As many as 60 people are feared to have drowned on a vessel carrying migrants across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy or Malta, the operators of a charity rescue group said on Thursday. SOS Mediterranee said it rescued 25 people in a very weak condition in coordination with the Italian Coast Guard on Wednesday and that two unconscious people were flown to Sicily by helicopter. The central Mediterranean is one of the worlds deadliest migration routes. According to the U.N. migration agency (IOM), almost 2,500 migrants died or went missing attempting the crossing last year, and 226 since the start of 2024. The survivors departed from Zawiya, Libya, seven days before they were rescued, SOS Mediterranee posted on the social media platform X. Their engine broke after three days, leaving their boat lost (and) adrift without water and food for days. Survivors report that at least 60 people perished on the way, including women and at least one child, it added. There was no immediate comment from the Italian Coastguard. The IOM said it was deeply troubled by the report. Urgent action is needed to strengthen maritime patrols and prevent further tragedies, it said on X. In a post on X on Wednesday, the SOS Mediterranee said its Ocean Viking vessel had evacuated 25 people spotted using binoculars who were on a rubber boat drifting in the Libyan search and rescue area. The charity said it picked up a further 113 people, including two children, from a wooden boat and 88 from a packed rubber dingy, in rescue operations on Wednesday and Thursday. It said it had been instructed to sail to the Italian Adriatic port of Ancona, about 1,500 km (930 miles) away, but had asked for a closer disembarkation port given the poor condition of the migrants, some of whom are on oxygen masks. Charity groups like SOS Mediterranee and others complain that Italys right-wing government is obstructing their rescue activities, forcing them to travel to distant ports to disembark migrants and often temporarily impounding their ships. Italy and other European Union governments are trying to curb the number of sea migrants making the crossing from North Africa, and have offered money or equipment to Libya and Tunisia to stop departures from their shores. Data from the Italian Interior Ministry record that 5,968 migrants have arrived by sea so far this year, down from 19,937 at the same stage in 2023. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "March 15, 2024 10:56 am",
        "content": "Febrio De-Zoysa, the teenager accused in the brutal killing of six Sri Lankans in Ottawa, is now held in protective custody, his lawyer Ewan Lyttle has said. I can comment that hes in protective custody. Hes doing OK, Lyttle was quoted as saying by Canadian media reports. Inmates are often held in protective custody to shield them from other prisoners. Lyttles comments came after De-Zoysa made a brief court appearance that took place by phone on Thursday (March 14). De-Zoysas matter was adjourned until March 28, to give Lyttle time to receive and begin reviewing disclosure from the Crown, a process he suggested would span months. According to Ottawa Police, De-Zoysa had come to Canada as an international student and had been living with the victims, who were also newcomers from Sri Lanka. Six people  a mother, her 4 young children and a family acquaintance  were knifed to death inside a townhouse the family was renting on Berrigan Drive near Palmadeo Drive in Ottawas southern suburb of Barrhaven in the late hours of last Wednesday (March 06). The victims were identified as Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake (35 years), Inaka (7 years), Ashwini (4 years), Rinyana (2 years), Kelly (24 weeks) and Gamini Amarakoon (40 years). Meanwhile, Ekanayakes husband Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, who was hospitalized with critical injuries sustained in the attack, is now in a stable condition. The 19-year-old was arrested at the scene on March 06 and is charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. The killers motive still remain unknown. The following day, Algonquin College president Claude Brulé released a statement confirming that De-Zoysa was a student at the institution and that his last semester of attendance was Winter 2023. During Thursdays appearance before Justice of Peace Karen Baum, the Crown entered new information to correct the spellings of some of the victims names that had been entered at De-Zoysas first court appearance last week. The charges remained unchanged. Waiving his rights to arraignment made it necessary for the full list of charges against De-Zoysa to be read into the court record again. After registering his clients language of choice as English, Lyttle has requested an adjournment until March 28. According to foreign media, the entire matter has taken less than four minutes. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Lyttle has not commented when asked if his client might use mental health as a defence or if he understood what had happened. Lyttle has met with De-Zoysa both by video and in person at the Innes Road jail. Hes in protective custody. Hes doing OK, he said. Lyttle said he had also been in contact with De-Zoysas family, but would not say where they were, only that they were not in Sri Lanka. Theyre obviously very upset, he added. Against this backdrop, Google has taken steps to terminate the YouTube channel associated with the 19-year-old to which he reportedly had posted videos of the Minecraft video game. The tech giant said if a users off-platform behavior harms the YouTube community, they may take action in accordance with YouTubes creator responsibility guidelines. The suspect is facing a lengthy legal battle, according to criminal law experts who said the case could take two to three years to work its way through the court system. Daphne Gilbert, a professor of criminal law at the University of Ottawa told MSN news agency that the accused will likely go through extensive psychiatric evaluations to determine whether or not hes fit to stand trial. --with inputs from agencies",

        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, has submitted a bail application to the Colombo High Court. The new development comes after the Maligakanda Magistrates Court rejected bail for Rambukwella, former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case on Thursday (March 14). Furthermore, the magistrate had ordered them to be remanded in custody until the conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on March 28. In his bail application filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrates decision to reject bail for him is unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition. Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody following their arrest in connection with the case. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Rambukwella on February 02 in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. On February 29, Rambukwellas attorneys also filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition challenging his arrest by the CID and demanding Rs. 100 million in compensation. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. Meanwhile on Wednesday (March 13), the CID arrested Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, the Deputy Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, after he surrendered to the CID based on summons, following his arrival in Sri Lanka from overseas. In the meantime, Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Ratnayake had recently made a 4-hour-long confidential statement to the Maligakanda Magistrate regarding the procurement of substandard IVIG. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

        "date": "March 15, 2024 03:00 pm",
        "content": "At least 29 Palestinians were killed while awaiting aid in two separate Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, Gazas health ministry said. In the first incident, Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-ruled strip said eight people were killed in an airstrike on an aid distribution centre in Al-Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. Later, at least 21 people were killed and more than 150 wounded by Israeli gunfire at a crowd awaiting aid trucks at a northern Gaza roundabout, Gazas health ministry said. In a statement, Israels military denied attacking aid centres, describing the reports as false. As the IDF assesses the incident with the thoroughness that it deserves, we urge the media to do the same and only rely on credible information, the statement said. The Gaza conflict has displaced most of the enclaves 2.3 million population. Chaotic scenes and deadly incidents have taken place during aid distributions as desperately hungry people scrambled for food. On Feb. 29, Palestinian health authorities said Israeli forces shot dead more than 100 Palestinians as they waited for an aid delivery near Gaza City. Israel blamed the deaths on crowds that surrounded aid trucks, saying victims had been trampled or run over. In Deir Al-Balah, also in central Gaza, an Israeli missile hit a house on Thursday, killing nine people, Palestinian medics said. Residents said Israeli aerial and ground bombardments persisted overnight across the enclave, including in Rafah in the south, where over a million displaced people are sheltering. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli towns on Oct. 7 that left 1,200 people killed and 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israels air, sea and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 31,000 people and wounded over 71,500, according to Gaza health authorities. Efforts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and the Islamist militant Hamas have so far failed. While Israel said it sought a deal that would secure the release of hostages in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinians held by Israel, Hamas insists an agreement should end the war. Late on Thursday, Hamas said it presented to mediators a comprehensive vision of a truce deal based on stopping what it calls Israeli aggression against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, providing relief and aid, the return of displaced Gazans to their homes, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the new Hamas position was based on unrealistic demands. With the war now in its sixth month, the U.N. has warned that at least 576,000 people in Gaza  one quarter of the population  are on the brink of famine and global pressure has been growing on Israel to allow more access. Israel denies obstructing aid deliveries into Gaza. It has blamed failures by aid agencies for delays and accuses Hamas of diverting aid. Hamas denies this and says Israel uses hunger as a weapon in its military offensive. A ship carrying aid was approaching Gaza where the U.S. military plans to set up a dock to enable distribution of up to two million meals a day. While welcoming aid ships, Palestinian and U.N. officials say maritime deliveries are not a substitute for sending aid through land crossings. Hamas on Thursday called for an escalation of protests and attacks against Israel in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem on Friday, the first day of Friday prayers in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. In a restaurant at a southern Israel junction, a soldier was stabbed on Thursday, Israeli police said. It said the suspected attacker, a 22-year-old from the nearby Bedouin city of Rahat, was shot and neutralised. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

He urged the finance ministry to intervene without delay to address these issues. The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals  including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers  have been engaging in strikes time and time again over the past few months urging the government to provide them with an allowance similar to that of the DAT (Disturbance, Availability and Transport) allowance given to doctors. The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers approval of a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. The sporadic strikes were temporarily called off last month pending discussions with the Health Minister.",

        "date": "March 15, 2024 04:48 pm",
        "content": "Hamas has presented a Gaza ceasefire proposal to mediators and the U.S. that includes the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for freedom for Palestinian prisoners, 100 of whom are serving life sentences, according to a proposal seen by Reuters. Hamas said the initial release of Israelis would include women, children, elderly and ill hostages in return for the release of 700-1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, according to the proposal. The release of Israeli female recruits is included. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said on Thursday a new Gaza truce proposal presented by Hamas to mediators was still based on unrealistic demands. His office said an update on the issue would be handed to the war cabinet and extended security cabinet on Friday. Egypt and Qatar have been trying to narrow differences between Israel and Hamas over what a ceasefire should look like as a deepening humanitarian crisis has one quarter of the population in the battered Gaza Strip facing famine. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Egypt is seeking to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, ramp up aid deliveries to the Strip and allow for displaced Palestinians in the south and centre of the enclave to move to the north, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday. We are talking about reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, meaning a truce, providing the biggest quantity of aid, he told Egypts police academy. Sisi also warned against the dangers of an Israeli incursion into Rafah, on the border with Egypt. POSSIBLE ASSAULT ON RAFAH Five months into the war, Netanyahus office said in February it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there. A possible assault on Rafah, where most of the displaced have sought shelter, prompted international concern for its dire consequences. Hamas said ceasefire negotiations had faltered over the past few weeks due to Netanyahus rejection of its demands, which include a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal from the Strip, the return of the displaced in the south of the enclave to the centre and the north, and stepping up aid without restrictions. In February, Hamas received a draft proposal from Gaza truce talks in Paris that included a 40-day pause in all military operations and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one - a similar ratio to the new ceasefire proposal. RELEASE OF ALL DETAINEES Israel had rejected in February a draft proposal for a truce from Hamas, citing its long-held goal of not ending the war until it has destroyed the Islamist group that has run Gaza since 2006. Hamas insists an agreement should end the war. According to the latest proposal, Hamas said a date for a permanent ceasefire would be agreed upon after the initial exchange of hostages and prisoners, as well as a deadline for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group said all detainees from both sides would be released in a second stage of the plan. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli towns on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israels air, sea and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 31,000 people and wounded over 71,500, according to Gaza health authorities. The conflict has spread to other parts of the already volatile Middle East. Lebanons Iran-backed Hezbollah has frequently exchanged fire with Israel along the border. Pro-Iranian armed groups in Iraq have attacked U.S. forces in the country and Yemens Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked ships in and around the Red Sea to show their solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war. Late on Thursday, Hamas said it presented to mediators a comprehensive vision of a truce based on stopping what it calls Israeli aggression against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, providing relief and aid, the return of displaced Gazans to their homes and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.

        "title": "Boosting Indo-Sri Lankan trade relations crucial for mutual gains  President",
        "date": "March 15, 2024 04:56 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the critical importance of fortifying the extensive trade and economic ties between Sri Lanka and India promptly to ensure mutual advantages for both nations. He expressed these views during his presence at a special commemoration ceremony organized by the Sri Lanka India Society in Colombo yesterday (14). This event was arranged to mark the 76th Independence Day of Sri Lanka and the 75th Republic Day of India, signifying the historical and diplomatic significance of the occasion. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Professor Maithree Wickramasinghe were the chief guests at this event. Their attendance was complemented by the presence of Mr. Santosh Jha, the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, who graced the event as a special guest, underscoring the warm relations between the two neighbouring nations. This gathering of notable personalities served as a symbolic representation of the shared values and concerted endeavours dedicated to enhancing the bond between Sri Lanka and India, reflecting a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect. Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; There is a profound religious and cultural bond between Sri Lanka and India, and we share a common heritage. One of the notable aspects of this years 75th anniversary is the Joint Vision statement that was signed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and me. Throughout our discussions, we have consistently focused on the cultural and religious ties between our two countries, as well as the fact that we are both democracies with a shared British legal system. However, we have unfortunately overlooked the trade and economic relationship between Sri Lanka and India. Its important to remember that our relationship extends beyond cultural connections. Historical evidence suggests that even during the time of the Mohenjodaro civilization, ships sailed from India to Sri Lanka. Particularly in South India and Sri Lanka, the four kingdoms of Anuradhapura, Thanjavur, Madurai, and Kanchipuram either formed alliances or were embroiled in conflicts based on their economic interests. The Trincomalee harbour played a crucial role as a major harbour for three Indian kingdoms to access eastern countries around the world on numerous occasions. The discovery of a substantial number of coins in shrines like the Munneswaram temple, Ketheeswaram temple, Mantai, Naguleswaram temple (constructed for people from Jaffna, known as Dambakolapatuna), Koneswaram temple, and Trincomalee vividly illustrates the extensive trade relationship and activities between India and Sri Lanka. Moreover, coins issued by South Indian trade organizations have been unearthed in certain areas during excavations of ancient villages in Anuradhapura. This archaeological evidence indicates that well before the agreement on the use of the Sri Lankan Rupee and the Indian Rupee was signed, people in the past utilized a common currency for conducting trade transactions. Therefore, our immediate focus should be on enhancing these relations. We aim to foster comprehensive ties between our two nations, particularly in the realms of transportation and energy. Furthermore, we must strategically leverage Sri Lankas advantageous position to benefit South India. Our efforts are concentrated on revitalizing Trincomalee, especially as Southeast Asia and the Bay of Bengal regions experience growth. The increasing strategic importance of the Bay of Bengal area has led to improvements in the utilization of the Colombo Port. Our objective is to secure advantages for Sri Lanka and provide additional renewable energy resources for South India. In terms of the tourism industry, its noteworthy that we see a significant influx of tourists from India visiting Sri Lanka, while many Sri Lankans frequently travel to India. Notably, a considerable number of Sri Lankan tourists visit destinations like Thirupathi, Ayodhya, and Guruvayur, mirroring the interest of Indian tourists who visit Sri Lanka. If we collaborate effectively, our country will prosper alongside the development of the Indian Ocean. Our goal is to achieve economic integration, as there is no alternative path forward. We must learn from the mistakes made by Britain during its time in the European Union, which ultimately led to their decision to leave. Despite this, Britain is currently seeking a free trade agreement with India, although the outcome remains uncertain. Nonetheless, we must recognize the opportunities before us and strategize on how to progress together with India. It is important to note that this process can be relatively straightforward. For instance, a person from Bangalore can easily plan a vacation in Sri Lanka compared to traveling to Rajasthan. The proximity and accessibility are evident, with a one-hour flight to Sri Lanka compared to a two-hour flight to Rajasthan. Additionally, there are prospects for establishing supply chains across various sectors, including industrial activities, amidst the growing development of the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean region is experiencing significant growth, with countries like India, Indonesia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia rapidly advancing in various aspects. The Indian Ocean region is poised to become a significant economic hub in the next 50 to 60 years, especially as the African region undergoes development. It is imperative that we initiate this endeavour now. Given the existing political relations between our two countries and our proximity in various sectors, it is crucial that we collaborate and progress together. Such cooperation will yield benefits for both nations. I extend my gratitude to the Sri Lanka-India Society for their efforts in strengthening the relations between our countries through last years program. I am optimistic that the Joint Vision statement we have unveiled will be effectively implemented moving forward. Ministers Manusha Nanayakkara and Vidura Wickramanayake, along with State Ministers Aravind Kumar, Shehan Semasinghe, and Suren Raghavan, as well as Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya and diplomatic officers were among the dignitaries present at this event. Additionally, the official board of the Sri Lanka India Club and its members, along with representatives from the business communities of both countries, were also in attendance on this occasion.",

        "date": "March 15, 2024 11:27 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (March 15) urged all local government officials to wholeheartedly commit themselves to ensuring that the benefits provided to the people through government funding for development activities are effectively utilized. By responsibly managing these resources, officials can contribute significantly to bolstering the national economy, he added. The President further requested active participation from all local government officials in supporting the success of programs such as Aswesuma, Urumaya, and Agricultural Modernization initiatives, alongside the Kadurarata Dashakaya program. He emphasized that the collective benefits derived from these endeavours will significantly contribute to the enhancement of the national economy. Wickremesinghe conveyed these directives during a discussion held on Friday morning at the Foundation Institute in Colombo with all District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, focusing on the progress of government-implemented development programs, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). During this meeting, which was organized under the theme Precursor to a strong future - 2024, extensive discussions were held regarding the development programs initiated by the government, as well as the challenges encountered during their implementation. Under the Aswesuma program, benefits will be extended to 2 million families initially, with plans to increase this number to 2.4 million. An allocation of LKR 183 billion has been earmarked for this initiative. Furthermore, 2 million families are set to receive freehold land deeds through the Urumaya program, with a budget allocation of LKR 02 billion. The decentralized budget program across all 25 districts is allocated LKR 11,250 million to ensure effective implementation. For the Kandurata Dashakaya program spanning 11 districts, 93 divisional secretariat divisions, and 4,401 Grama Niladhari divisions, a budget of LKR 10 billion has been allocated. In addition, LKR 2,500 million has been designated for the initial phase of the Agricultural Modernization program, covering 26 divisional secretariats, with plans for the second phase to encompass 75 divisional secretariats. The President also underscored the significance of allocating these funds carefully to attain the targeted development objectives. President Ranil Wickremesinghe additionally highlighted the intention to establish a Modern Agricultural Economy in every Divisional Secretariat, emphasizing the importance of enhancing womens participation in the workforce. The full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is as follows: In the aftermath of our nations economic downturn, we anticipate resurgence in economic growth in the year 2024. The year 2019 witnessed a deceleration in economic growth following the tragic events of the Easter Sunday bombings. Subsequently, the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the situation, resulting in a precipitous decline in economic growth by the year 2022. Following this, we anticipate achieving a 2 economic growth in the year 2024. Despite this, it may take approximately two to three years to return to the economic conditions of 2019. Nevertheless, my objective is to achieve this goal by 2027, if not sooner. Upon assuming office in 2022, I was confronted with a nation whose economy had reached a state of collapse. My primary focus at that time was to ensure the success of the Yala season. Despite the financial constraints we faced, concerted efforts were made to ensure the seasons prosperity. America provided us with 36,000 metric tons of fertilizer through the World Food Organization, while India supplied 40,000 metric tons of urea. Additionally, we received 135,000 metric tons of fertilizer from the World Bank. These contributions significantly contributed to our success in both the Yala and Maha seasons. Now, its time to progress further. Our objective is to reduce the number of low-income earners in the country over the next 10-15 years. However, we have also taken immediate steps to provide relief to those in need. Consequently, we have augmented the amount of financial aid provided through Aswesuma and expanded the number of beneficiaries. While this program may encounter some challenges, we are committed to addressing any shortcomings and moving forward with adjustments this year. All the financial support provided to low-income individuals circulates back into the countrys economy as they spend it on essential goods and services. Consequently, this year, the infusion of these funds will bolster the nations economy. Furthermore, as a result of the governments wage increase, has triggered wage hikes not only in the public sector but also in the private sector and even in plantation industries. This broadening of wage increases across various sectors contributes positively to the economy, enhancing overall economic stability and growth. Furthermore, the implementation of the decentralized budget was stalled last season, leading to financial losses for contractors and suppliers. However, this year, these funds will flow back into the economy, revitalizing economic activity. Additionally, the initiation of Kandurata Dashakaya program aims to address the lack of development in upcountry regions. Adequate funding has been allocated for this purpose, and when expended, it will further stimulate the countrys economy. Hence, I urge for the careful utilization of all government funds, ensuring they are directed towards relevant areas. By doing so, we can ensure that these funds contribute to the growth of our nations economy. Additionally, the implementation of the Urumaya program, which grants freehold land deeds to the people, addresses a longstanding issue faced by our citizens. In the initial phase, preparations for providing land deeds to 01 million individuals have been completed. Where challenges arise, efforts are underway to resolve them and proceed with the implementation of the program. Furthermore, measures have been initiated to grant ownership of residential flats to their occupants, further promoting stability and empowerment within our communities. We find ourselves at a critical juncture in our economic trajectory, and its evident that we cannot sustain the current economic framework. The government is diligently working towards liberating our nation from the brink of bankruptcy. Efforts are underway to negotiate a grace period for our outstanding debts. Its crucial to acknowledge that our imports surpass our exports, necessitating annual borrowing to bridge this gap. Hence, we must operate under a structured plan. The repercussions of the last economic crisis were felt by all, and should we revert to a similar state, the commitments weve made will yield no results. Therefore, its imperative for each of us to pledge our dedication towards fortifying the countrys economy. We have initiated a program centred around revitalizing the tourism sector, with the anticipation of welcoming a substantial influx of tourists by December. Given the challenges facing the Western economy, reliance on the garment industry may not be feasible. In light of this, it is imperative to shift our focus towards agriculture. Our nation has a rich agricultural heritage, dating back from the time of the Sinhalese kings to the conclusion of British rule. During this period, our agricultural export industry thrived. It is essential that we strive to reclaim this prominent position in agriculture once again. We are fully committed to the modernization of agriculture, a vital step in our nations economic development. To this end, we have identified 26 Divisional secretariats where Agrarian Service centres will be transformed into Agriculture Modernization Offices. This consolidation will streamline agricultural operations and foster efficiency. Furthermore, we have undertaken measures to centralize all agricultural sectors under a single ministry, facilitating cohesive planning and implementation strategies. Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance yields in paddy cultivation, and initiatives have been launched for the cultivation of new crops and the expansion of cinnamon cultivation. Looking ahead, our vision is to extend the agricultural modernization program to encompass all areas. Out of the 341 divisional secretariats in Sri Lanka, we aim to identify those from which we can generate foreign exchange. This strategic approach will guide our efforts to establish a modern agricultural economy in each divisional secretariat, thereby promoting sustainable growth and prosperity across the nation. Additionally, we are moving forward with formalizing vocational training by consolidating all vocational training centers into vocational colleges. This strategic approach aims to streamline vocational education and ensure comprehensive skill development among our workforce. Primarily, our focus remains on advancing tourism and agricultural development programs. Following the debt restructuring program, our next step involves creating new investment zones by attracting foreign investments. To achieve this, we have identified several key areas such as Trincomalee, Hambantota, Ingiriya, Kandy, and Jaffna. Efforts are underway to promote tourism in the southern and eastern provinces, as well as in upcountry regions. Furthermore, our objective is to transition towards a digital and green economy. Through these endeavours, we aim to lay the foundation for a new economy characterized by sustainability and innovation. Moreover, we have enacted new legislation to empower women and promote gender equality. Efforts are underway to safeguard womens rights and enhance their participation in the workforce. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for the unwavering support you have all provided during the challenging programs implemented over the past two years. I urge all of us to continue moving forward vigorously in advancing these initiatives for the betterment of our people. Together, we can forge a brighter future for our nation. --PMD",

        "date": "March 16, 2024 11:01 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday (March 15) fixed a fundamental rights (FR) petition filed against the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon to be taken up for consideration on April 02. The petition had been filed by Prof. Savitri Gunasekara earlier this month. When the petition was called before a 3-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the petitioning party was ordered to send notices to the respondents. Subsequently, the petition was fixed for consideration on April 02. The petitioner has sought a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the appointment of the police chief. The Speaker of Parliament, the members of the Constitutional Council (CC), IGP Tennakoon and several others have been named as the respondents of the petition. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena found himself in hot water for unconstitutionally and unlawfully using his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided on a tie on the matter. It was reported that four CC members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment. Earlier this month, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Young Journalists Association, the Centre for Policy Alternatives, Niroshan Padukka of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) also put forward FR petitions, challenging the appointment of IGP Tennakoon. The petitioners claim that Tennakoon had neglected his duties during his tenure as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Western Province when the 2019 Easter attacks happened, and a pre-mediated attack was launched on the GotaGoGama protest site at the Galle Face Green where several protesters were brutally beaten. The petitioners have emphasized that the post of the police chief, who is responsible for the implementation of the law in the country, should be given to an individual who has humane qualities, as opposed to someone who acted contrary to his assigned duties and in violation of basic human rights. Against this backdrop, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volter Turk also raised concerns about the recent appointment of IGP Tennakoon, despite the Supreme Courts finding that he was implicated in the torture of an individual in 2010.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas economy expanded for a second straight quarter as industrial activity picked up pace, buoyed by an International Monetary Fund bailout and lower interest rates. Gross domestic product rose 4.5 in the three months to December from a year ago, the Statistics Department said Friday. Thats higher than the median forecast of 3.7 growth in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and compares with a print of 1.6 in the July-September period. For the year, the economy clocked a contraction of 2.3. The expansion comes as the South Asian nation seeks to win an initial approval for the next tranche of a 3 billion IMF loan program. Authorities are aiming to complete restructuring the nations debt by June, a key condition to keep funds from the bailout flowing. Negotiations with dollar bondholders over the terms of recast are underway. Industrial production expanded 7.9 from a year ago, while services sector rose 2.8, the data showed. Lower borrowing costs aided the nations recovery. Sri Lankas central bank reduced its benchmark rates by a total of 650 basis points in 2023. The monetary authority held rates for the first time in five months in January as inflation started to pick up with the economys rebound. While price gains are expected to peak in the coming months, the central bank sees no threat to its 5 target. Increased inflows from tourism and remittances have also helped Sri Lankas turnaround. The nations leisure sector is seeing a revival to pre-Covid levels, with earnings from visitor arrivals posting the highest value in four years in January. Its local rupee is at the strongest level since June, gaining 6 against the dollar this year. Source: Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has unveiled plans to provide concessions to those who engaged in the gems and jewellery sector. This initiative comes in response to the challenges faced by the industry, with the President emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to support those involved in the field, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. By offering solutions to the problems within the industry, relief will be extended to its stakeholders, ensuring their continued growth and prosperity. The President, clarifying that immediate changes to the tax policy are not feasible, noted that efforts, however, would be made to devise an effective system to enhance the gem and jewellery industry. Wickremesinghe directed officials to develop a viable system aimed at bolstering the gem and jewellery industry. He instructed them to collaborate with both the public and private sectors to draft a proposal addressing these issues within two weeks. The Head of State made this statement during a discussion held on Friday afternoon (March 15) at the Presidential Secretariats with stakeholders from the gems and jewellery industry. Extensive discussions were held regarding the challenges arising from the governments new tax policies, which have had repercussions on the gem and jewellery industry, along with other pertinent issues concerning the sector. Wickremesinghe further emphasized the need to focus on boosting exports within the gem industry in Sri Lanka, along with enhancing value-added processes. Additionally, the President highlighted plans to initiate mining operations in the Sabaragamuwa province and Nuwara-Eliya District in the future. Consequently, Sri Lankan gem businessmen will have ample opportunities to venture into mining activities in these regions. The President also announced that a survey will be conducted to explore the feasibility of establishing gem and mining enterprises in other regions of Sri Lanka. Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation and Minister of Irrigation Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, speaking at the event, expressed gratitude towards President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his leadership during challenging times. She emphasized that without the Presidents guidance, discussing such important matters would not have been possible.

        "date": "March 16, 2024 06:25 pm",
        "content": "One in three children under age 2 in northern Gaza is now acutely malnourished and famine is looming, the main U.N. agency operating in the Palestinian enclave said on Saturday. Childrens malnutrition is spreading fast and reaching unprecedented levels in Gaza, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a social media post. More than five months into Israels air and ground campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas attack on Oct. 7, much of the enclave is in ruins with most of its 2.3 million population displaced and facing a major humanitarian crisis. Hospitals in Gaza have reported some children dying of malnutrition and dehydration. The international food insecurity watchdog, the IPC, is expected to report soon on the extent of the hunger crisis in Gaza after saying in December there was a risk of famine in the projection period through May. For the IPC to declare famine, at least 20 of the population must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease. Western countries have called on Israel to do more to allow in aid, with the U.N. saying it faced overwhelming obstacles including crossing closures, onerous vetting, restrictions on movement and unrest inside Gaza. Israel says it puts no limit on humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and blames slow aid delivery on incapacity or inefficiency among U.N. agencies. Air and sea relief deliveries into Gaza have started, but aid agencies say these are no substitute for bringing in supplies by land. A first delivery into Gaza by the World Central Kitchen, pioneering a new sea route via Cyprus, arrived on Thursday and was off-loaded, the charity said. Israel has accused UNRWA of complicity with Hamas, saying some staff members took part in the Oct. 7 attack and calling for the agency to be dismantled. Several major donors have paused funding over the allegations. UNRWA denies complicity with Hamas and said in February that it had dismissed 12 of its 13,000 staff in Gaza shortly after Israel accused them of involvement. The U.N. oversight body and UNRWA itself have launched investigations that have yet to report. European Union humanitarian chief Janez Lenarcic said on Thursday he had seen no evidence from Israel yet to back up its accusations. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 16, 2024 07:34 pm",
        "content": "India will hold a seven-phase general election starting on April 19, with the results to be declared on June 4. The Election Commission of India announced the schedule of the six-week marathon vote during a news conference in New Delhi on Saturday. Nearly 970 million voters  more than the entire population of the United States, the European Union and Russia combined  are eligible to cast their ballot, according to the poll panels data, making the election the largest democratic exercise in the world. We will take democracy to every corner of the country, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar said as he announced the voting dates. It is our promise to deliver a national election in a manner that we  remain a beacon for democracy around the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a third straight term in the vote, has set a target of 370 seats for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 400-plus for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) the BJP heads in the 543-member lower house of parliament. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats  the most ever for the Hindu nationalist party that was formed in 1980. Modi will be challenged by an alliance of two dozen opposition parties, called INDIA or the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, led by the Indian National Congress. The alliance formed last year has, however, been struggling to stay united and share seats amicably to be able to put up a one-to-one fight against the BJP. A victory would make Modi, 73, only the second prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indias independence hero and its first prime minister, to win a third straight term. Modi and his BJP have been in campaign mode for months before the dates for the vote were announced. The prime minister has been flying around the country almost every day, inaugurating new projects, making announcements, taking part in religious events and addressing public and private meetings. The first phase of the parliamentary election will be held on April 19, second on April 26, third on May 7, the fourth phase on May 13, the fifth on May 20, the sixth on May 25 and the seventh phase on June 1. In four states  Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim  the parliamentary and legislative assembly elections will be held simultaneously, with their results to be also declared on June 4. Bypolls for 26 assembly constituencies across the country will be also be held during the six-week vote. There will be more than a million polling stations in operation staffed by 15 million poll workers, according to the election commission. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "date": "March 16, 2024 08:44 pm",
        "content": "A Los Angeles mansion belonging to British model and actress Cara Delevingne has been devastated by fire. The 31-year-old was not there at the time, as she is currently starring in a stage performance on Londons West End. Pictures show huge flames bellowing from the roof of the luxury home, and later, the blackened, smouldering ruins. My heart is broken, Delevigne wrote on Instagram when she thought her two pet cats had died in the blaze. Life can change in the blink of an eye. So cherish what you have, she said. However, she later updated her 42 million followers with the good news that the cats had survived the blaze: They are alive! Thank you to the firefighters, she wrote. Two people were injured in the fire, which engulfed the two-storey property in the hills of Studio City, north-west of Hollywood. A firefighter was taken to hospital in a stable condition, and a resident suffered minor smoke inhalation, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) said. Firefighters were called to the scene after a 911 call was made at approximately 04:00 local time (11:00GMT) on Friday. According to an incident report, the blaze started at the back of the 1970s house and rapidly spread to the attic, causing the roof to collapse. It took 94 firefighters more than two hours to bring the flames under control. Residents in the area were evacuated as fire crews worked to contain the flames and stop the fire spreading to other homes, the BBCs US partner CBS News reported. Fire chiefs said an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the blaze. Delevingne thanked from the bottom of my heart... all the firefighters and people that showed up to help. The actress, who made her stage debut this week as Sally Bowles in Cabaret at Londons Kit Kat Club, reportedly bought the house in 2019. In a home tour for Architectural Digest in 2021, she described it as one of my favourite places to be, likening it to an adult playhouse and citing Hugh Hefner as an inspiration behind her choice of decoration. Inside, she had a David Bowie shrine, a ball pit and a collection of Japanese puzzle boxes. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 17, 2024 01:39 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) -The main U.N. aid agency operating in Gaza said on Saturday that acute malnutrition was accelerating in the north of the Palestinian enclave as Israel prepared to send a delegation to Qatar for new ceasefire talks on a hostage deal with Hamas. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said one in three children under the age of two in northern Gaza is now acutely malnourished, putting more pressure on Israel over the looming famine. On Friday, Israel said it would send a delegation to Qatar for more talks with mediators after its enemy Hamas presented a new proposal for a ceasefire with an exchange of hostages and prisoners. The delegation will be led by the head of Israels Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea, a source familiar with the talks said, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking to convene the security cabinet to discuss the proposal before the talks start. Netanyahus office has said the Hamas offer was still based on unrealistic demands. Efforts failed repeatedly to secure a temporary ceasefire before Islams holy month of Ramadan started a week ago, with Israel saying it plans to launch a new offensive in Rafah, the last relatively safe city in tiny, crowded Gaza after five months of war. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, starting a two-day visit to the region, voiced concern about an assault on Rafah, saying there was a danger it would result in many terrible civilian casualties. On Friday, Netanyahus office said he had approved an attack plan on Rafah, where more than half of Gazas 2.3 million residents are sheltering, and that the civilian population would be evacuated. It gave no time frame and there was no immediate evidence of extra preparations on the ground. The Hamas offer, reviewed by Reuters, foresees dozens of Israeli hostages freed in return for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, during a weeks-long ceasefire that would let more aid into Gaza. Hamas also called for talks in a later stage on ending the war, but Israel has said it is only willing to negotiate a temporary truce. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Arabic broadcaster Al Jazeera the groups proposal is so realistic that no one can object to it and claimed that mediators had reacted positively. He said it consists of two stages, with a complete cessation of aggression at the start of the second one - something Israel has rejected, vowing to resume its goal of destroying Hamas once any temporary truce expires. Families of Israeli hostages and their supporters again gathered in Tel Aviv, urging a deal for their release. At the same time, anti-government protesters, estimated by Israeli media at a few thousand, called for new elections and blocked streets in Tel Aviv. HUMANITARIAN CRISIS The war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas sent fighters into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels ground and air campaign has killed more than 31,500 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Israel says it has killed at least 13,000 Hamas members in the Gaza fighting. The assault has also devastated the enclave, forcing nearly all the inhabitants from their homes, leaving much of the territory in rubble and triggering a massive hunger crisis. Childrens malnutrition is spreading fast and reaching unprecedented levels in Gaza, UNRWA said in a social media post. Hospitals in Gaza have reported some children dying of malnutrition and dehydration. Western countries have called on Israel to do more to allow in aid, with the U.N. saying it faced overwhelming obstacles including crossing closures, onerous vetting, restrictions on movement and unrest inside Gaza. Israel says it puts no limit on humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and blames slow aid delivery on incapacity or inefficiency among U.N. agencies. Air and sea relief deliveries into Gaza have started. A first delivery into Gaza by the World Central Kitchen, pioneering a new sea route via Cyprus, arrived on Friday and was off-loaded, the charity said. On Saturday, a second cargo of food aid was ready to depart by sea from Cyprus, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said, while the U.S. and Jordan said they carried out an air drop of humanitarian aid. Queen Rania of Jordan, in a CNN interview, called the airdrops literally just drops in the ocean of unmet needs and accused Israel of cutting off everything that is required to sustain a human life: food, fuel, medicine, water.

        "content": "Twenty-one people were killed and 38 injured on Sunday in southern Afghanistans Helmand province when a bus collided with an oil tanker and a motorbike, provincial officials said. Deadly traffic accidents are common in the country, due in part to poor roads, dangerous driving on highways and a lack of regulation. On Sunday morning, 21 people were killed and 38 people were injured due to a collision between a tanker, a motorcycle and a passenger bus, the provincial information department said in a post on X. The accident took place on the Herat-Kandahar highway in Grishk district of Helmand province, it added. The collision caused the vehicles to ignite, Helmand governor spokesman Mohammad Qasim Riyaz told AFP. Images shared by the information department on social media showed charred, twisted metal scattered across the highway and the crushed cabin of the tanker. Clean up crews were on site removing the debris, according to officials. Of the injured, 11 were seriously hurt and 27 had minor injuries. The passenger bus was travelling from Herat city to the capital Kabul when it first collided with a motorbike carrying two people, killing both riders, Helmand traffic management officials said, according to the information department. The bus driver lost control and crashed with an oil tanker travelling in the opposite direction from the southern city of Kandahar to Herat, sparking a fire. The accident killed three people on the tanker and 16 bus passengers. Another serious accident involving an oil tanker took place in December 2022, when the vehicle overturned and caught fire in Afghanistans high-altitude Salang pass, killing 31 people and leaving dozens more with burn injuries.

        "date": "March 17, 2024 09:59 pm",
        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Sunday accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of uttering a lie on the Katchatheevu issue to target the DMK and blamed him for staying silent over projects for the state. In a post on social media platform X, Stalin alleged that the Indian Prime Minister had blatantly lied in his rally at Kanyakumari on March 15 that Tamil Nadu fishermen are facing trouble from Sri Lanka only due to the past sin of the DMK. The Tamil Nadu people know the true history pretty well; that the Katchatheevu island was ceded (1974, 1976 agreements) to Sri Lanka despite the stiff opposition of the DMK government. Is the Prime Minister naive to the extent of believing that a state government can give away a portion of the country to another country, Stalin said in the post. Late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1969 to 1976. The Chief Minister also sought to know the steps taken by the BJP regime at the Centre during the past 10 years to retrieve the Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka. Stalin wondered if Tamil Nadu fishermen were not considered Indians and why the Centre has not stopped their arrest and harassment at the hands of the island nation. Why didnt the Indian government openly condemn Sri Lanka for announcing confiscation and nationalisation of boats of Indian fishermen, the chief minister said. Stalin also alleged that only during the BJP regimes tenure did the Lankan courts start the practice of awarding prison sentences to fishermen arrested for the second time. What action did you take to stop this, he questioned Prime Minister Modi. The usual lies echoed in the Prime Ministers rally at Kanyakumari, the chief minister alleged, adding that there was no answer to peoples question on the special projects implemented for Tamil Nadu. Why does the PM remain a Mouna guru (silent guru) who is taking pride that he is the Vishwa guru (guru for the world), Stalin asked, taunting the Prime Minister over the fishermen issue. BJP state chief K Annamalai hit back at Stalin and alleged that it was the DMK which was silent for 50 years on the Katchatheevu issue and that it was time for Stalin to introspect. In a post on X, Annamalai retorted saying that it was the DMK which was in power in 1974 and only then had the Congress-led Centre ceded Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka. Referring to the DMK-Congress alliance, the BJP leader said the DMK was also part of the government at the Centre several times, but had stayed silent on the Katchatheevu issue for 50 years. Similarly, the DMK stayed silent when over 80 fishermen were killed by the Sri Lankan Navy during the rule of DMK-Congress alliance, Annamalai said. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "content": "The acceptance of applications for the Presidential Scholarship Program 202425 has been extended and a new deadline set for April 01, the Presidents Media Division said. This program, initiated by the Presidents Fund under the advice of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and guided by Presidents Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake, aims to benefit students who are studying despite facing various economic difficulties, the statement said. The extension of the acceptance period for applications for the Presidential Scholarship Program 202425 has been implemented in response to numerous requests, it said. Zonal education directors have informed about the program to principals, divisional secretaries, and Grama Niladhari Officers. The Presidents Fund has encouraged parents to inquire about the program and submit the application form to the school principal accordingly. Additionally, as per the directives issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, the allocation of scholarships to each school based on the number of students will be determined by the Regional Director of Education. These scholarships will then be distributed to the respective school principals within their regions. In line with this, all school principals are required to form a selection committee and, starting from April 1, 2024, choose the scholarship recipients based on the allocated scholarships for their school. Furthermore, according to the instructions already given by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, the number of scholarships that can be given to that school according to the number of students in each school will be decided by the Regional Director of Education and will be given to the principals of their region. Therefore, all school principals are advised to form a selection committee, which will be responsible for selecting scholarship recipients based on the available scholarships allocated to their respective schools. This selection process is scheduled to take place after April 01, 2024. Following the submission of lists, applications and details of eligible scholarship recipients selected by schools to the Presidents Fund by the Ministry of Education, scholarships will be distributed over the course of the next 12 months, beginning in April 2024. The program targets supporting 100,000 students from Grade 01 to Grade 11 studying in all 10,126 schools across Sri Lanka. An allocation of Rs. 3600 million from the Presidents Fund has been designated for the entire scholarship program. Selected scholarship recipients have been notified to open joint bank accounts at Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank, or National Savings Bank branches, in collaboration with their parents or guardians. These respective banks have also agreed to deposit the related initial deposit amount in the scholarship recipients account by the banks itself as required. Following the selection of scholarship recipients, the school principal will enter the recipients information and send a letter to the bank manager. The scholarship recipent, accompanied by their parentguardian, will then meet with the managers of the respective bank branches to open a bank account as per instructions. Then, they must provide the bank account details to the principal. For more details, you can visit the official Facebook page of the Presidents Fund at www.facebook.compresident.fund. --PMD",

        "title": "India navy recaptures ship from Somali pirates and rescues crew",
        "date": "March 17, 2024 10:29 pm",
        "content": "Indias navy recaptured a ship from Somali pirates off the Indian coast on Saturday, the South Asian countrys military said, rescuing the crew and ending a three-month takeover of the Maltese-flagged bulk carrier MV Ruen. The December hijacking of the ship was the first time since 2017 that any cargo vessel had been successfully boarded by Somali pirates. IndianNavy thwarts designs of Somali pirates to hijack ships plying through the region by intercepting ex-MV Ruen, the navy posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday night. The Indian warship Kolkata, in the last 40 hours, through concerted actions, successfully cornered and coerced all 35 Pirates to surrender  ensured the safe evacuation of 17 crew members, it added. Indian forces first intercepted the MV Ruen on Friday, the navy said. The vessel opened fire on the warship, which is taking actions (in accordance with) international law, in self-defense  to counter piracy, with minimal force necessary to neutralize the pirates threat to shipping and seafarers, they said. None of the rescued crew members were injured in the multiday operation, which was carried out in conjunction with several naval vessels, along with helicopters and other aircraft, they added. Bulgarian owner Navibulgar hailed the Ruens release as a major success not only for us, but for the entire global maritime community. The resolution of this case proves that the security of commercial shipping will not be compromised, it said in a statement. Bulgarias Foreign Ministry said it was seeking the speedy return of seven rescued Bulgarian crew members. The other crew were nine Myanmar and one Angolan. The pirated ship was recaptured nearly 1,400 nautical miles, or 2,600 kilometers, from the Indian coast, the military said. The Indian navy has kept tabs on the MV Ruen since it was seized by Somali pirates 380 nmi east of the Yemeni island of Socotra in December. The pirates, who at the time released one injured Bulgarian sailor into the care of the Indian navy, had taken the MV Ruen and its remaining 17 crew members to Somalias semiautonomous state of Puntland, where the Indian navy said it was moored off the city of Bosaso. Maritime assaults The Indian military has stepped up anti-piracy efforts in recent months following an uptick in maritime assaults, including in the Arabian Sea and by Yemens Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Pirate attacks off the Somali coast peaked in 2011  with gunmen launching attacks as far as 3,655 km (2,271 mi) from the said coast in the Indian Ocean  before falling off sharply in recent years. But Decembers attack followed a spike in armed seaborne attacks around the Horn of Africa not seen in years. Analysts caution that Somali piracy poses nowhere near the threat it did in 2011, when navies around the world had to deploy warships to beat back the scourge. But this recent upswing in pirate activity has raised further concerns about marine security and shipping at a time when crucial trade corridors off Yemen have come under siege. Somali pirates have traditionally sought to capture a mother ship  a motorized dhow or fishing trawler  capable of sailing greater distances where they can target larger vessels. Since the Houthi attacks, many cargo ships have slowed down far out at sea to await instructions on whether to proceed to the Red Sea, which experts say can make them vulnerable to attack.

        "title": "Putin wins Russia election in landslide with no serious competition",
        "date": "March 18, 2024 05:43 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin won a record post-Soviet landslide in Russias election on Sunday, cementing his already tight grip on power in a victory he said showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine. Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999, made it clear that the result should send a message to the West that its leaders will have to reckon with an emboldened Russia, whether in war or in peace, for many more years to come. The outcome means Putin, 71, is set to embark on a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become Russias longest-serving leader for more than 200 years if he completes it. Putin won 87.8 of the vote, the highest ever result in Russias post-Soviet history, according to an exit poll by pollster the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM). The Russian Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) put Putin on 87. First official results indicated the polls were accurate. The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and other nations have said the vote was neither free nor fair due to the imprisonment of political opponents and censorship. Communist candidate Nikolai Kharitonov finished second with just under 4, newcomer Vladislav Davankov third, and ultra-nationalist Leonid Slutsky fourth, partial results suggested. Putin told supporters in a victory speech in Moscow that he would prioritise resolving tasks associated with what he called Russias special military operation in Ukraine and would strengthen the Russian military. We have many tasks ahead. But when we are consolidated - no matter who wants to intimidate us, suppress us - nobody has ever succeeded in history, they have not succeeded now, and they will not succeed ever in the future, said Putin. Supporters chanted Putin, Putin, Putin when he appeared on stage and Russia, Russia, Russia after he had delivered his acceptance speech. Inspired by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, thousands of opponents protested at noon against Putin at polling stations inside Russia and abroad. Putin told reporters he regarded Russias election as democratic and said the Navalny-inspired protest against him had had no effect on the elections outcome. In his first comments on his death, he also said that Navalnys passing had been a sad event and confirmed that he had been ready to do a prisoner swap involving the opposition politician. When asked by a NBC, a U.S. TV network, whether his re-election was democratic, Putin criticised the U.S. political and judicial systems. The whole world is laughing at what is happening (in the United States), he said. This is just a disaster, not a democracy. ...Is it democratic to use administrative resources to attack one of the candidates for the presidency of the United States, using the judiciary among other things? he asked, making an apparent reference to four criminal cases against Republican candidate Donald Trump. The Russian election comes just over two years since Putin triggered the deadliest European conflict since World War Two by ordering the invasion of Ukraine. War has hung over the three-day election: Ukraine has repeatedly attacked oil refineries in Russia, shelled Russian regions and sought to pierce Russian borders with proxy forces - a move Putin said would not be left unpunished. Putin said Russia might need to create a buffer zone inside Ukraine to prevent such attacks in future. While Putins re-election was not in doubt given his control over Russia and the absence of any real challengers, the former KGB spy had wanted to show he had the overwhelming support of Russians. Nationwide turnout was 74.22 at 1800 GMT when polls closed, election officials said, surpassing 2018 levels of 67.5. There was no independent tally of how many of Russias 114 million voters took part in the opposition demonstrations, amid tight security involving tens of thousands of police and security officials. Reuters journalists saw an increase in the flow of voters, especially younger people, at noon at polling stations in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, with queues of several hundred people and even thousands. Some said they were protesting, though there were few outward signs to distinguish them from ordinary voters. At least 74 people were arrested on Sunday across Russia, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors crackdowns on dissent. Over the previous two days, there were scattered incidents of protest as some Russians set fire to voting booths or poured green dye into ballot boxes. Opponents posted some pictures of ballots spoiled with slogans insulting Putin. But Navalnys death has left the opposition deprived of its most formidable leader, and other major opposition figures are abroad, in jail or dead. The West casts Putin as an autocrat and a killer. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Putin wanted to rule forever and that the vote had been illegitimate. Putin portrays the war as part of a centuries-old battle with a declining West that he says humiliated Russia after the Cold War by encroaching on Moscows sphere of influence. Russias election comes at what Western spy chiefs say is a crossroads for the Ukraine war and the wider West. Support for Ukraine is tangled in U.S. domestic politics ahead of the November presidential election. Though Kyiv recaptured territory after the invasion in 2022, Russian forces have made gains after a failed Ukrainian counter-offensive last year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 18, 2024 08:07 am",
        "content": "More than a hundred mourners offered tearful prayers and calls for solidarity and compassion on Sunday at the funeral for a Sri Lankan family slain in one of the worst mass killings in Ottawas history. Dozens gathered at the Infinity Convention Centre for a multi-faith service to remember the six people, including four children, who were found dead on March 6 inside a townhouse in Ottawas south-end Barrhaven suburb. Ajahn Viradhammo, a monk who spoke at the funeral, asked those grieving around the world to focus on supporting each other instead of leaning into despair or anger. We in the Ottawa area are in the eye of this storm, but we recognize that its impact is felt all over the world, he said. It is in these dark moments that we must derive strength from compassion and wisdom that lie at the heart of faith. We come together bound by our shared humanity and our unwavering commitment to compassion. The victims included 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake and her four children, who ranged in age from two months to seven years old, as well as a family friend. Her husband and the kids father, Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, was taken to hospital with injuries to his hands and face. Wickramasinghe was seen crying at the ceremony, his hands clasped in prayer with one finger bandaged. He was surrounded by family members, including a man sobbing into a handkerchief. Funeral organizers said on Friday that he has requested privacy to mourn the loss of his family, but is thankful for the outpouring of public support since his relatives died. Five coffins sat at the front of the room, including three smaller white ones and two larger wooden caskets, one of which had framed photos of both Ekanayake and her baby. The ceremony included audio recordings from the wife and daughter of Gamini Amarakoon Amarakoon Mudiyanselage, a family friend who was also killed. His loved ones in Sri Lanka were unable to travel to Canada for the suneral. The service included a Buddhist ritual as well as reflections from preachers from various religions, who prayed for surviving relatives to have strength. Dignitaries from multiple levels of government urged unity in comments during and after the funeral. We have to continue to put our arms around these two families, Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe told reporters. They will have so many difficult days ahead of them and so many challenges. The Wickramasinghe family members were Sri Lankan newcomers to Canada, and the youngest was born in this country. Police arrested a 19-year-old Sri Lankan man on the evening of the attack and charged him with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.

        "date": "March 18, 2024 10:08 am",
        "content": "The ballot boxes for Maldives upcoming parliamentary elections will be placed in India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, after around 11,000 Maldivians submitted re-registration requests to relocate their polling stations, the countrys election commission announced on Sunday. The six-day window for people to relocate their voting stations for the April 21 parliamentary elections expired on Saturday, media reports said, citing an Elections Commission notification. The top electoral body said that ballot boxes for the island nations elections will also be placed in Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram), the capital of Kerala, Sri Lankas Colombo and Malaysias Kuala Lumpur after at least 150 people re-register to vote in each of the three countries. As previously, enough people registered in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. And since 150 people had registered in Trivandrum, India, we have decided to set up a ballot box there, web portal adadhu.com quoted ECs secretary-general Hassan Zakariyya as saying. The top polls body received 11,169 application forms requesting re-registration at different voting stations during this period. It rejected 1,141 forms, taking the total re-registrations to 10,028, the edition.mv news portal reported. Pointing out that the number of people who re-registered this year is low compared to past elections, Zakariyya said that voting will not be held in the UK, UAE and Thailand. The parliamentary elections in the island nation were to take place on Sunday, however, the official polls date was postponed after an amendment to an Act to refrain from conducting elections during the month of Ramzan. The parliamentary elections are now scheduled to be held on April 21. A total of 389 candidates are contesting for 93 parliamentary seats in Maldives elections, the sun.mv news portal said. The highest number of candidates are from the pro-India main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) - which is contesting 90 seats, followed by the main ruling coalition of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) and the Peoples National Congress (PNC), which is contesting 89 seats. Maldives pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu, who belongs to the PNC, rode to power last year on an anti-India stance. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a 100 million loan to provide small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka more access to finance and build their resilience to external shocks, such as the economic crisis and climate change. SMEs play a critical role in Sri Lankas economy, contributing 52 to the countrys gross domestic product and employ 45 of the population, said ADB Senior Financial Sector Specialist Manohari Gunawardhena. It is therefore important to provide SMEs, particularly women-led enterprises, with the necessary support to sustain and grow the sectors contribution to the economy. This project will provide working capital and improve SMEs access to finance, helping them expand operations and prepare for the changing environment. ADB, through participating financial institutions, will open a 50 million line of credit for underserviced SMEs in the export, tourism, technology, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. It will establish a 500,000 special facility to cover guarantee subsidies for women-led SMEs. A gender gap assessment will be conducted with a view to improving womens access to finance. The project will build on the governments equity contribution through the National Credit Guarantee Institution Limited (NCGI), which provides partial credit guarantees on loans to SMEs. ADB will help the NCGI adopt procedures to effectively support SMEs including underwriting guarantees, risk management and risk-based pricing, and guarantee recovery operations. The project will incorporate green finance elements through climate adaptation and mitigation measures for SMEs. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne has resigned from his position as a member of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE). Speaking at a press conference this morning (18), Wickramaratne stated that he has handed over the resignation letter to the Speaker of the Parliament. In his resignation letter, the SJB MP mentions that the duty of the Committee is to report to Parliament on accounts examined, budgets and estimates, financial procedures, performance and management of Corporations and other Government Business Undertakings. Even though reports to Parliament have been submitted by COPE from time to time, no credible action has been followed against those who have engaged in corrupt practices or mismanaged. Government has not permitted amendments to Standing Orders allowing COPE to refer matters for investigation and be judicially pursued by direct reference to the relevant authorities including the police, CIABOC and the Attorney General. The public are dismayed at the inefficiencies of COPE, he added. He further claims that the previous government adopted a practice of appointing a COPE Chairman who was a member of the Opposition to strengthen the principle that the legislature must be a check and balance on the executive arm of government. The present government has not upheld that principle by appointing a member of the opposition as Chairman, also contributing to the loss of confidence in Parliament. Additionally, Wickramaratne highlighted that it is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions and that this also contributes to the citizens loss of confidence in Parliament. The MP said that therefore he is resigning from membership of COPE with immediate effect.",

        "content": "The UN childrens agency said on Sunday over 13,000 children have been killed in Gaza in Israels offensive, adding many kids were suffering from severe malnutrition and did not even have the energy to cry. Thousands more have been injured or we cant even determine where they are. They may be stuck under rubble ... We havent seen that rate of death among children in almost any other conflict in the world, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell told CBS News Face the Nation program on Sunday. Ive been in wards of children who are suffering from severe anemia malnutrition, the whole ward is absolutely quiet. Because the children, the babies ... dont even have the energy to cry. Russell said there were very great bureaucratic challenges moving trucks into Gaza for aid and assistance. International criticism has mounted on Israel due to the death count of the war, the starvation crisis in Gaza, and allegations of blocking aid deliveries into the enclave. A UN expert said earlier this month that Israel was destroying Gazas food system as part of a broader starvation campaign. Israel rejected the accusation. Israels military assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has displaced nearly its entire 2.3 million-person population, caused a starvation crisis, flattened most of the enclave, and killed over 31,000 people, according to Gazas health ministry. It has also led to accusations of genocide being probed in the World Court. Israel denies the genocide charges and says it is acting in self defense after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel from Hamas that killed some 1,200, according to Israeli tallies, and took scores of hostages. One in three children under age 2 in northern Gaza is now acutely malnourished and famine is looming, the main UN agency operating in the Palestinian enclave said on Saturday.

        "date": "March 18, 2024 04:16 pm",
        "content": "Five foreign students of Gujarat University including a Sri Lankan were injured, when a group of 20-25 people barged into their hostel and assaulted them for offering prayers during Ramadan in the hostel building on Saturday (17) night, Indian media reported. According to the police, the two foreign students who had to be hospitalised are from Sri Lanka and Turkmenistan. While one of them is still in hospital, the other has been discharged, they said. Of the other students who sustained injuries, two are from African nations and one from Afghanistan. Police have registered a case under IPC provisions relating to unlawful assembly, rioting, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal trespass. The two arrested persons have been identified as Hitesh Mevada and Bharat Patel, both residents of Ahmedabad. As videos of the incident started circulating on social media, showing some people vandalising the hostel rooms and damaging vehicles, Ahmedabad Police Commissioner G S Malik and Gujarat University Vice Chancellor Neerja Gupta reached the hostel Sunday morning. Malik told reporters that around 10.30 pm Saturday, when some foreign students were offering prayers, 20-25 people entered the universitys Block A hostel building and asked why they were offering prayers there and told them to do so at a mosque. This led to a scuffle followed by stone pelting and vandalism. Somebody informed the police control room at 10.51 pm and a PCR van reached the spot at 10.56 pm, Malik said. We have taken serious note of the incident and strict action will be taken. The five students who were injured are pursuing different courses under Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarships. ICCR Gujarat in-charge Surendra Kumar told The Indian Express, The police and state government are looking into the incident. As soon as we get an update from the university authorities we will inform our headquarters. There are around 300 foreign students under ICCR scholarship in Gujarat University and around 1,100 students across the state. A student from Afghanistan who was among those injured said: I was in my room when I heard slogans of Jai Sri Ram from outside around 10.30 pm. When I came out I saw some three-four persons, one of them wearing an orange scarf, stopping the students from praying. A verbal spat led to slapping  thats when the security personnel intervened and took them away. Soon, those who attacked called others and in no time a mob had reached the hostel. They attacked the students and started pelting stones at the rooms, the student said. Around 75 foreign students stay in the Block A hostel, the ground plus two-storey building with 50 rooms. Eyewitnesses said the mob chased the foreign students to their rooms. One of the students was attacked with a knife while another injured his leg when a stone broke the window glass and hit him. The attackers were shouting and looking for two boys who clashed with them outside, said a hostel inmate. Out of fear, some students jumped from the first floor and ran, while many left the hostel and stayed in a hotel last night, said another student. Vice Chancellor Gupta told The Indian Express: We have removed the coordinator of Study Abroad Programme (SAP) and within three days not only foreign students but others too will be moved to new hostels for better security and facilities. A Foreign Student Advisory Committee has also been constituted that includes the SAP coordinator, legal cell assistant registrar and Gujarat University Lokpal. Following the violence, the university on Sunday allocated G9 block to local students and the NRI hostel with 90 rooms to the foreign students. Briefing reporters earlier in the day, the Vice Chancellor said there was already some tension between the foreign students and those who attacked them. As per the information available with me, this (namaz) is not the main issue. There were already some differences between the two groups. This is a matter of investigation. The issue cannot take such a major form in one day and from one incident. She also said that the university will arrange for cultural orientation for foreign students. They are foreign students and when they go to foreign countries there is a need to be culturally sensitive. From this incident it has emerged that there is still a need for cultural orientation. We will sit with them (foreign students) and try to understand what they feel and what can be done and how to strengthen their security. While Prof Neelam J Panchal has replaced Rakesh Raval as the new SAP coordinator, Parth Panchal has been appointed as the assistant. Also, Ashokbhai Chavda has been appointed as the NRI hostel warden and Kapil Kumar as the coordinator. On the change of guard, Vice Chancellor Gupta later told The Indian Express, I was informed that there were already some representations from local students submitted to the SAP staff but there was no action. These were primarily on the cultural issues and also objections against some religious leaders visiting the hostel premises. There should be no public display of religious activities. There are not only Muslims but Christians, Buddhists and students from other religions too who are staying in the hostel. Even as videos of the incident went viral, Indias Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement Sunday evening. An incidence of violence took place at Gujarat University in Ahmedabad yesterday. State government is taking strict action against the perpetrators. Two foreign students were injured in the clash. One of them has been discharged from hospital after receiving medical attention. MEA is in touch with Gujarat government, official MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X. Ahmedabad Crime Branch meanwhile arrested two accused and handed them over to Gujarat University Police Station. Deputy Commissioner of Police Tarun Duggal said, Nine teams were formed to arrest those accused. Two of them have been arrested. Investigations are on to arrest the other accused. When asked about the background of the two arrested, Duggal said, Their interrogation is still on. We can speak about their background, their intention, and how they did it after the interrogation is over. The ABVP and Gujarat Youth Congress demanded strict action against those involved in the violence. State ABVP secretary Samarth Bhatt said, The incident of assault and vandalism against students in the hostel premises exposes the hostel and university administration. It is also necessary to investigate the role of Congress and religious elements who instigated the students. ABVP demands strictest action from Gujarat government and police administration against those accused of instigating students and assault and vandalism. In a letter to the Governor, Chief Minister, Home Minister and Education Minister, Gujarat state Youth Congress leader Subhan Sayyed raised security lapses in university hostels and demanded strict action against anti-social elements. Two of the assailants were arrested Sunday (17) while three others were apprehended today (18), police said, adding that an FIR has been lodged and investigations were on to identify the rest. According to Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) officers, the arrested men have been identified as Kshitij Kamlesh Pandey, 22, a resident of Ambika Apartment in Naranpura; Jitendra Ghanshyam Patel, 31, from Municipal Karmacharinagar in Ghatlodia; and Sahil Arunbhai Dudhtiuva, 21, who lives in Memnagar. According to a press release, Pandey, who works and lives in a paying guest accommodation in Ahmedabad, is from Gandhidham, and Jitendra Patel is an AC repairman from Kalol in Gandhinagar. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "How rising dengue burden is costing India and Sri Lanka billions",
        "date": "March 18, 2024 06:06 pm",
        "content": "The increasing incidence of dengue in India and Sri Lanka is not just a significant health concern but also exacts a hefty economic toll on these South Asian countries, say experts who estimate the annual losses to be in billions. Researchers highlight the dire economic consequences of this affliction caused by a virus spread through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito species, reinforcing the benefits that the region would realise if the neglected tropical disease was substantially controlled. As the sweltering heat swept across Colombo in June, Seetha, a 60-year-old daily wager found herself in the grips of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe and sometimes fatal form of the disease. I had a fever, body aches, and a relentless headache for four days before being admitted to the hospital. I was catheterised and not even allowed to go to the toilet, she told PTI. Seethas work involved providing care to a 5-year-old child until the mother returned from work. The onset of dengue, however, disrupted her livelihood. I was bedridden for seven days in the hospital, unable to move, and the impact on my work was severe. It took me almost a month to recover, she recalls. As the sole breadwinner following her husbands death, Seetha faced a financial quandary during her illness. My children were not working and there was no money. My brother and another relative had to step in and provide us with financial support for survival, the woman explained. Seethas narrative underscores the broader economic challenges faced by South Asian countries that grapple with the relentless onslaught of dengue every year. In 2023, India officially recorded nearly 95,000 cases and 91 deaths by September 17. In 2022, the figure was 2.33 lakh with 303 deaths. Sri Lanka had reported more than 80,000 dengue cases by the first week of December last year and 47 deaths, according to the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU). Dr Nayani P Weeerasinghe, a consultant microbiologist and senior lecturer at the University of Ruhuna in Galle, Sri Lanka, noted the economic burden of dengue in the two countries is substantial, with significant strains on healthcare systems and families, especially those reliant on daily wages. Both agricultural and industrial sectors suffer due to the disabling nature of dengue and absenteeism from work, particularly in labour-intensive industries, adversely affecting productivity, Weeerasinghe told PTI. Echoing Weerasinghe, epidemiologist and economist Ramanan Laxminarayan noted that although dengue rarely kills, it causes significant health burdens and costs. When hospitalisation is required, it drives many families into poverty. I recently had a coworker in India suffering from dengue. Fortunately, he survived but the hospital bills were over Rs 14 lakh, Laxminarayan, founder and director of One Health Trust, told PTI. Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and get better in up to two weeks. Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle and joint pains, swollen glands, and rash. However, severe symptoms such as shooting abdominal pain, bleeding gums or nose, and blood in vomit or stool, often come after the fever has gone, and can be fatal. What makes matters worse is that there are no effective drugs to treat the disease. The economic impact of dengue is multifaceted. A cost analysis study in southern Sri Lanka estimated direct medical costs per hospitalised dengue patient at USD 233.76 (around INR 20,000) in 2017-18. For complications requiring intensive care arise, the cost soars to USD 733.46 (over INR 61,000). The burden extends beyond direct medical expenses to indirect costs, with households bearing 77.29 per cent of the monthly income on average, the expert said. Weeerasinghe also highlighted variations across South Asian countries, citing a systemic analysis in India which indicates a cost of USD 5.71 billion from 2013 to 2016, substantially higher than in Sri Lanka. The direct costs were for seeking medical care for the illness -- channeling fees, costs of laboratory investigations, medications, travel expenses for seeking medical care and for visiting the admitted family members, among others. Direct household cost per patient was 16.29 USD, almost 4 per cent of a persons average monthly income in the island nation. Indirect costs for the families affected by dengue resulted in absenteeism from work, thereby leading to loss of family income. People with informal employment and daily wage jobs are more likely to be affected by this, the experts said. A considerable proportion of families in the South Asian region have only one member working. An average of 22 days of absenteeism from work has been reported due to dengue in the countries here, according to a 2019 study published in the journal International Journal of Infectious Diseases. When we add both direct and indirect costs to the household, it accounts for 77.29 per cent, which is almost three-fourths of the monthly household income in Sri Lanka, Weeerasinghe said. In Thailand, another South Asian country with high dengue prevalence, the economic impact of the disease is 600 million Baht (over Rs 138 crore) per year for just treatment, noted Darin Areechokchai, from the Bureau of Vector-Borne Diseases, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. The epidemiology of the disease has changed and is now equal in both children and adults, so the economic impact in South Asia will be higher in the future than in the past, Areechokchai told PTI. Weerasinghe warned of long-term consequences of dengue, especially in the case of pediatric infections leading to school absenteeism, potentially impacting future earnings. If people develop severe dengue, hospitalisation becomes unavoidable -- and thats where the expenses add up both for the individual and the healthcare system, said Neelika Malavige, DNDis Head of Dengue Global Programme and Scientific Affairs, South Asia. However, the costs are huge even when patients are not hospitalised, as they have to visit their doctor daily if they are suspected to have dengue, as we dont have a test to find out who will develop plasma leakage leading to severe dengue and who will have mild symptoms, she told PTI. As global changes in urbanisation, mobility, and climate contribute to the spread of dengue, Laxminarayan foresees an increased incidence of cases. Climate change increases the range for the main vector for dengue  Aedes aegypti. The expansion of water tanks and storage containers where this mosquito usually breeds is likely to increase dengue cases in coming years, expand the season during which the disease is transmitted, and cost us even more money, he explained. To reduce the economic impact of dengue, experts say it is necessary to control the number of such cases, educate the general public, and implement policies for disease control. Weeerasinghe stressed the importance of preventive measures, including health education programmes and legal actions for environmental cleanliness. International collaboration is deemed crucial for sharing knowledge and resources to address the economic burden effectively. Studies are being conducted in South Asian countries on dengue, with the research teams providing information for the policymakers on effective control and effective management measures for the disease, Weerasinghe said. For instance, the US, Australia, and even countries in Southeast Asian regions like Singapore have used Aedes mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria to successfully reduce the number of mosquitoes in regions with dengue epidemics. Certain strains of Wolbachia can reduce the capacity of mosquito species to transmit diseases like dengue fever, either by directly inhibiting the pathogen or by shortening the mosquitos lifespan. Unfortunately, currently theres no drug that can prevent dengue from spiralling into a severe state. This is a gaping hole in research and development that we urgently need to fill, Neelika added. As Seetha reflects on her harrowing experience, she admits, I am very scared of getting dengue again. I cant imagine going through that again. It was terrible for the whole family, she added.

        "title": "US Supreme Court eyes government contacts with social media platforms",
        "date": "March 18, 2024 07:45 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday marches back into the battle over social media content moderation in a challenge on free speech grounds to how President Joe Bidens administration encouraged platforms to remove posts that federal officials deemed misinformation, including about elections and COVID-19. The justices are set to hear arguments in the administrations appeal of a lower courts preliminary injunction constraining how White House and certain other federal officials communicate with social media platforms. The Republican-led states of Missouri and Louisiana, along with five individual social media users, sued the administration. They argued that the governments actions violated the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment free speech rights of users whose posts were removed from platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, now called X. The case tests whether the administration crossed the line from mere communication and persuasion to strong arming or coercing platforms - sometimes called jawboning - to unlawfully censor disfavored speech, as lower courts found. Bidens administration has argued that officials sought to mitigate the hazards of online misinformation, including false information about vaccines during the pandemic that they said was causing preventable deaths, by alerting social media companies to content that violated the platforms own policies. The justices in February heard arguments in another social media case over whether to uphold laws passed in Texas and Florida that would restrict the content moderation practices of platforms. The Republican backers of those laws have voiced concern over what they portray as bias against conservative voices on these platforms. Many researchers, as well as liberals and Democrats, have warned of the dangers of social media platforms amplifying misinformation and disinformation about public health, vaccines and election fraud. In the case being argued on Monday, the plaintiffs have argued that platforms suppressed conservative-leaning speech, which they attribute to government coercion, a form of state action barred by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court in October put the lower courts injunction on hold pending the review of the case by the justices. The Justice Department said that government officials, including presidents, long have used the bully pulpit to express views and to inform on matters of public concern. It also said that private entities that make decisions on that information are not state actors as long as they are not threatened with adverse consequences. The department also said that an injunction limiting the administrations actions could chill vital government communications, including to protect national security. The plaintiffs sued officials and agencies across the federal government, including in the White House, FBI, surgeon generals office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Louisiana-based U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty issued a preliminary injunction in July 2023. Doughty concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the government helped suppress disfavored conservative speech on mask-wearing, lockdowns and vaccines intended as public health measures during the pandemic, or that questioned the validity of the 2020 election in which Biden, a Democrat, defeated Donald Trump, a Republican. The injunction barred an array of government officials from communicating with platforms regarding content moderation, such as urging the deletion of certain posts. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently narrowed that order. The Supreme Courts ruling is expected by the end of June. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 18, 2024 09:12 pm",
        "content": "The administration of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has commenced discussions with the employees regarding the possible reduction of their increased salaries by a certain percentage, according to sources. However, joining a press conference held today (18), MP Nalaka Godahewa claimed that the CBSL trade unions have protested the relevant decision. Recent media reports revealed that the CBSL had increased the salaries of its employees by 70 and the move was heavily criticized by parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition, following which the CBSL officials were summoned before the Cabinet, party leaders meeting and the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) to question the move. On 25 February, the CBSL requested the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, for an opportunity to apprise the Members of Parliament, through an appropriate Parliamentary Committee, of the recent salary increment which came under fire. The request was made in writing by CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. Issuing a release in this regard, the CBSL had explained that the latest revision of remuneration of its employees had been approved by the Governing Board under the triennial Collective Agreement entered into with the Trade Unions covering the period 2024 - 2026. When summoned before the meeting of party leaders and Committee on Public Finance (COPF) held 05 March, CBSL governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe defended the move, saying that the salaries need to be increased as the country recovers from the economic crisis. Drawing criticism from the MPs about the unethical aspect and the insensitivity of the move, however, the CBSL Governor said the expenses for the salary increase would be drawn from the Central Bank Fund, and not from the consolidated fund. However, the MPs pointed out that the approval of the Parliament which is responsible for public finances is required for such salary hikes, adding that an additional Rs. 232 million will have to be spent monthly on this. The Central Bank officials were thus urged to revise the move.",

        "date": "March 18, 2024 10:10 pm",
        "content": "Gunmen in Nigeria have kidnapped at least 87 people, including women and children in Kaduna state, residents and police said on Monday, in a fresh attack after an armed gang seized 286 students and staff from a school in early March. Kidnappings by criminal gangs demanding ransom payments have become an almost daily occurrence in Nigeria, especially in the north, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them. Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan confirmed the incident in Kajuru Station village on Sunday night but could not give a figure of those missing. He said security agents had been deployed to try to rescue the villagers. Tanko Wada Sarkin, a village head, said 87 people were taken. We have so far recorded the return of five people back home who fled through the bush. This attack makes it five times that these bandits are attacking this community, he told Reuters by phone. Residents said armed men dressed in army uniform arrived in the village undetected because they had parked their motorbikes away from the village. Aruwa Yau, another resident, said he was captured but later released by the gunmen because he struggled to walk due to poor health. He was receiving treatment at a local government clinic, he said. Gunmen are known to force-march their victims deep into the bush, keeping them for up to months while awaiting ransom payments. We were outside our homes chatting around 10:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) and suddenly bandits appeared, beating and shooting, said Haruna Atiku. His wife and two daughters were among those missing. The village is about 10 km (6 miles) from Buda community, where gunmen seized 61 people on March 12. Kidnappings at schools in Nigeria were first carried out by jihadist group Boko Haram, who seized more than 200 students from a girls school in Chibok in Borno state a decade ago. But the tactic has since been adopted by criminal gangs without any ideological affiliation seeking ransom payments. The kidnappings are tearing apart families and communities who have to pool their savings to pay the ransoms, often forcing them to sell prized possessions like land, cattle and grain to secure the release of captured loved ones.

        "date": "March 19, 2024 10:21 am",
        "content": "A contentious situation ensued in parliament on Tuesday morning (March 19) as MPs of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) staged a protest while holding placards. They were protesting against the recent arrest of eight civilians who were conducting a pooja in view of the Maha Shivaratri Day on March 08 at a Hindu temple in Vavuniya. The parliament, chaired by the Deputy Speaker, convened at 9.30 a.m. for the debate on the no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. However, the protest staged by the TNA MPs disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for a few good minutes. The protest was called off after Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe asserted an impartial, comprehensive investigation into the incident. The eight civilians including the chief priest of the Hindu temple at the Vedukkunarimalai archaeological site in Nedunkerny had been arrested for allegedly trespassing into the premises, disregarding a court order previously issued rejecting a request to do so. On 04 March, the Vavuniya Magistrates Court delivered a judgment stating that permission cannot be granted to conduct a special religious ceremony, despite a group of people, including the arrested chief priest, having filed a motion requesting to do so for a special Maha Shivaratri ritual. Subsequently, upon consideration of a request made by the Acting Director of Archaeology from the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) in charge of the Northern Province, a team of police officers were deployed to the Vedukkunarimalai archaeological site on 08 March. Despite these measures, however, police stated that nearly 500 people had visited the site and performed religious ceremonies during the daytime on 08 March, while a group of 40 persons, including the chief priest, had arrived later that night and taken steps to conduct a special Maha Shivaratri ritual, and had set up bonfire and improvised hearths. Police stated that despite being informed by the police officers on duty not to do so, the eight arrestees had proceeded without taking heed of such instructions.",

        "date": "March 19, 2024 11:55 am",
        "content": "Hamas leader Marwan Issa died in an Israeli air strike, White House official Jake Sullivan has said. As deputy military commander, Mr Issa would be Hamass most senior leader to die since the war began on 7 October. The Palestinian group, which controls Gaza, has not officially commented on reports of his death. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East this week on his sixth visit to the region since the conflict in Gaza erupted. He will hold meetings in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to discuss international efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all remaining hostages. Negotiations have been continuing this week in Qatar despite Israel announcing plans to move more than a million people from the city of Rafah before launching an offensive. In their first conversation in a month, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this would be a mistake. Israeli media sources have reported that Mr Issa was killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza a week ago. The deputy commander of Hamass military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was considered one of Israels most-wanted men. The European Union, which placed the Hamas leader on its terrorist blacklist, linked him directly to the 7 October attack led by the group which killed approximately 1,200 people and sparked the war. He had been jailed by Israel for five years during the First Palestinian Intifada and detained by the Palestinian Authority in 1997 until the start of the Second Intifada in 2000. The Israeli military has killed a number of Hamass senior leaders since 7 October. Hamas political leader Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beiruts southern suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack. Mr Sullivan, the White Houses national security adviser, said other Hamas leaders were believed to be in hiding, likely deep in the Hamas tunnel network in Gaza. He pledged that the US would aid Israeli in its continued hunt for top Hamas leaders, adding, Justice will come for them, too. But while he noted Israels numerous military successes against Hamas since the start of the war, he also emphasised President Biden had expressed his growing alarm over the rising number of civilian deaths in his call to Mr Netanyahu. The president told the prime minister again today that we share the goal of defeating Hamas, but we just believe you need a coherent and sustainable strategy to make that happen, he said. Mr Biden was able to get the Israeli leader to agree to sending a senior interagency team composed of military, intelligence and humanitarian officials to Washington in the coming days to discuss US concerns over an invasion of Rafah. The expectation is that Israel will delay its assault until that meeting is held, Mr Sullivan said. Mr Netanyahu confirmed the call on X, formerly Twitter, and said the two had discussed the latest developments in the war as well as Israels goals in the conflict. The Israeli prime minister said those objectives included: Eliminating Hamas, freeing all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never gain constitutes a threat to Israel - while providing the necessary humanitarian aid that will assist in achieving these goals. Prior to Mr Bidens call, senior Democrats in the US had grown more vocally critical of Mr Netanyahu. On Thursday, Chuck Schumer - the top Democrat in the Senate - called for new elections in Israel, saying that Mr Netanyahu was prioritising his political survival over the countrys needs. Mr Netanyahus Likud party pushed back, saying Israel was not a banana republic and that the prime ministers policies were supported by a large majority. Mr Biden told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he knew Mr Schumers remarks were coming. The president said, however, that the Senate leader had expressed serious concern shared not only by him, but many Americans. Source: BBC -Agencies",

Minister Wijesekera, in a post on his X handle (formerly Twitter) said the government is also exploring the option of relocating the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to Trincomalee in the future with upgraded modern facilities and the development of the Tank Farm. The facility, which is the only oil refinery in Sri Lanka, was established in 1969 and fulfils approximately 25 of the countrys demand for refined petroleum products.",
