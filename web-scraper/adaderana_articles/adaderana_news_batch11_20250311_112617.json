Ukraine has been one of the worlds top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria. Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday. We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program Grain from Ukraine, Zelenskiy wrote on X. I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help. Ukraines exports were buffeted by Russias full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The All Ceylon Egg Traders Association has announced a significant reduction in egg prices for the upcoming festive season, with retail prices now set between Rs. 30 and 35. The President of the association, Anton Appuhami explained that accordingly, regular eggs weighing less than 50 grams will be available for prices ranging from Rs. 30 to 32. For larger eggs, weighing over 55 grams, the price will be between Rs. 33 and 35. We have decided to sell eggs at a retail price of between Rs. 30 and 35 during the festive season. Therefore, we request that every retail shop ensure eggs are sold at prices not exceeding Rs. 35 from today, Appuhami said. This move comes after a period of high egg prices, with a single egg costing between Rs. 65 and 70 during the 2023 festive season. However, Appuhami noted that egg production has increased, leading to a surplus in the market and helping to stabilize prices. Egg production has risen significantly, and today, the price has stabilized in the market, he said, noting, There is now a surplus of eggs from all farmers, ensuring enough supply to meet demand. Appuhami further emphasized that consumers should be cautious and avoid purchasing eggs above the specified prices.",

        "date": "December 15, 2024 10:24 pm",
        "content": "At least 11 people were killed after a cyclone slammed into Mayotte, the most intense storm to hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago north of Madagascar in nearly a century, French weather forecasters and authorities said on Sunday. Cyclone Chido swept through Mayotte overnight, Meteo-France said, bringing winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph) and damaging makeshift housing, government buildings and a hospital. It was the strongest storm in more than 90 years to hit the islands, the forecaster said. It was difficult to ascertain the precise death toll after the cyclone, which also raised concerns about access to food, water and sanitation, authorities said. For the toll, its going to be complicated, because Mayotte is a Muslim land where the dead are buried within 24 hours, a French interior ministry official said. Located nearly 8,000 km (4,970 miles) from Paris and a four-day trip by sea, Mayotte is significantly poorer than the rest of France and has grappled with gang violence and social unrest for decades.

        "date": "December 16, 2024 08:40 am",
        "content": "A senior official said Sunday that the death toll from cyclone Chidos passage across Mayotte would be in the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, as France rushed in rescue workers and supplies. Their efforts will be hindered by the damage to airports and electricity distribution in the French Indian Ocean territory. Even before the cyclones passage, clean drinking water was already subject to chronic shortages. I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand deaths, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere. It would be very difficult to reach a final count given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc. Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of cyclone Chido through Mayotte, she posted on X. We are ready to provide support in the days to come. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also offered support, writing on X that his organisation stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care. PIROI, the Red Cross organisation in the region, said on X that it was ready to intervene. - Hospitals, schools hit - Earlier Sunday, the mayor of Mayottes capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP nine were in a critical condition in hospital, with another 246 more seriously injured. The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated, he said. The storm had spared nothing, he added. Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that Frances interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte. Some of them did not dare to venture out and seek assistance, fearing it would be a trap designed to remove them from Mayotte, said Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse. Many had stayed put until the last minute when it proved to late to escape the cyclone, she added. The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelagos shantytown, Frances Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late Saturday. Mayottes 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown Saturday as cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres (310 miles) east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour. Electricity poles were hurled to the ground, trees uprooted and sheet-metal roofs and walls torn off the shantytown housing inhabited by at least one-third of the population. One local resident, Ibrahim, told AFP of apocalyptic scenes as he made his way through the main island, having to clear blocked roads for himself. Retailleau will travel to Mayotte on Monday, his office said, with 160 soldiers and firefighters to reinforce the 110 already deployed to the islands. Pope Francis, visiting French Mediterranean island Corsica on Sunday, urged people to pray for Mayottes residents. French President Macron promised they would act to help the people there. - Storm hits Mozambique - Already Sunday, medical personnel and equipment were delivered Sunday by air and sea. The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte. It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow. A navy patrol ship was also to depart La Reunion with personnel and equipment including for electricity supplier EDF. Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage. Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said. The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials. UNICEF said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm. Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with the government to ensure continuity of essential basic services, it said in a statement. Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts. The exceptional cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told AFP. The UNs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that some 1.7 million people were in danger, and said the remnants of the cyclone could also dump significant rainfall on neighbouring Malawi through Monday, potentially triggering flash floods. Zimbabwe and Zambia could also expect heavy rains, it added. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "Indian Tabla maestro Zakir Hussain passes away",
        "date": "December 16, 2024 08:45 am",
        "content": "His fingers flew, fluttered and floated in quicksilver changes of raga and rhythm, drumming up music and magic. Zakir Hussain was the maestro of tabla, percussionist, composer and even actor a legend who was Indias very own and yet belonged to the world. Hussain died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease, in a San Francisco hospital early Monday. He was 73. The artiste, a marquee name in India and abroad, leaves behind more than 60 years of music. He played on the stage alongside some of the greatest Indian and international musicians in a fusion of Indian classical and world music, giving the tabla a whole new identity. The great percussionist created music across genres and styles, including in his repertoire jazz and concertos, naturally developing an all-inclusive musical creativity after learning and playing under the tutelage of his father and renowned tabla player, Alla Rakha. The mindset as I was growing up tuned itself to the idea that music is music, its not Indian music or that music, so when I actually started working with musicians who were non-Indian it seemed like a natural handshake, Hussain told PTI almost a year ago ahead of a performance in Goa. As the son of Alla Rakha, one of the greatest tabla players of all time, Hussain was to the music born. He started early. The child prodigy performed his first concert at the age of seven and began touring at 12. After completing his education in Mumbai, where he was born, he moved to the United States in 1970. The borders melted away when it came to his music. In February, Hussain became the first musician from India to receive three Grammys at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in February for Best Global Music Album, Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. I am overwhelmed and humbled by the outpouring of love, affection, and blessings for my multiple Grammy wins. It is impossible for me to individually respond to all of you but be assured that you are all in my heart and Im bowing to each and every one of you in thanks. It was a great day for India at the Grammys and Im proud to be carrying the national flag, he wrote on Instagram at the time. At the 2024 Grammys, Hussain earned his first honour for best global music album for This Moment as part of the fusion music group Shakti, which includes founding member British guitarist John McLaughlin, as well as vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan and percussionist Selvaganesh Vinayakram. He later won two other awards for the best global music performance for Pashto and best contemporary instrumental album for As We Speak, along with flautist Rakesh Chaurasia, American banjo player Bela Fleck and American bassist Edgar Meyer. In January last year, the Shakti quintet reunited for a world tour in India to much excitement from fans. Other than Shakti, Hussain also contributed to many groundbreaking collaborations, including Masters of Percussion, Planet Drum and Global Drum Project with Mickey Hart, Tabla Beat Science, Sangam with Charles Lloyd and Eric Harland, CrossCurrents with Dave Holland and Chris Potter, in trio with Bla Fleck and Edgar Meyer, and, most recently, with Herbie Hancock. Hussain composed three concertos. His third, the first-ever concerto for tabla and orchestra, was premiered in India in September 2015, by the Symphony Orchestra of India, in Europe and the UK in 2016, and in the US in April, 2017. The composer who travelled and performed all across the globe had reservations against performing at private gatherings and disliked latecomers. He was also very vocal in his views. In a conversation with author Nasreen Munni Kabir as written in her book Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music, Hussain said a private gathering, corporate events or weddings are not places where music should be heard. Those are places where people come to socialize, to drink and perhaps have a meal. Thats not the way music should be heard. For me, its the concert hall or the theatre-people take their seats, the hall darkens and we musicians take our place, he said. Hussain would ask the organisers to close the doors once the performance begins and not allow latecomers. Then there was the man himself. His broad smile, boyish good looks and curly locks keeping rhythm with his fingers gave him a distinctive star persona that sometimes went beyond his music. The percussionist was once voted the sexiest man by women readers of the Indian magazine Gentleman in 1994 in a competition against the likes of Amitabh Bachchan. The magazine team came to see me and wanted me to wear all these suits and jackets and Western clothes and feature on their cover. I think they were equally shocked and surprised that I won the greatest number of votes because they had assumed the winner would be Amitabh Bachchan, Hussain is quoted as saying by Kabir. Besides his work as a tabla player, Hussain also composed music for many movies, including Manto and Mr and Mrs Iyer. He also acted in the Merchant Ivory film production Heat and Dust, The Perfect Murder and Saaz, opposite Shabana Azmi. In 1988, Hussain became a household name as the face of the Taj Mahal Tea brand. In a 33-second TV commercial, the ustad was shown immersed in his tabla riyaaz, only to later sip on a cup of Taj tea. The voiceover, by the famous Harish Bhimani, would then compliment Hussains skills saying Wah Ustad, wah!. To which, the percussionist would reply: Arre huzoor, wah Taj boliye! That Wah Taj became an oft used buzzword for many an occasion, and still remembered all these years later. The same year, Hussain also shared screen space with his father Allah Rakha in the iconic national integration song Mile Sur Mera Tumhara which premiered on Doordarshan. He is survived by his wife Antonia Minnecola and two daughters, Anisa Qureshi and Isabella Qureshi. Apart from four Grammys, Hussain was the recipient of countless awards and honours, including Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the USAs National Heritage Fellowship and Officier in Frances Order of Arts and Letters. As his countless fans bid farewell to the artiste who transcended boundaries, of music and of geography, and went too soon, many could only say Wah Ustad. Source: PTI --Agencies",

Tharindu Dilshan Sendanayake Wins First Prize Sri Lankas Tharindu Dilshan Sendanayake claimed the coveted first prize with his breathtaking photograph titled Primal Fury, taken at Yala National Park. The image vividly captures a dramatic life-or-death struggle between a dominant Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) and a wild pig (Sus scrofa affinis), creating a masterpiece reminiscent of a Renaissance painting. The intense scene unfolds as the leopard, startled mid-mating, defends itself against the charging wild pig. This extraordinary depiction of the wild earned Tharindu a grand prize of INR 150,000. Asela Karunaratne Earns Honourable Mention Asela Karunaratnes drone shot Angels in the Sand garnered an Honourable Mention. Captured at Mannar Beach, the photograph showcases a flock of Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) gracefully scavenging for bycatch left behind by fishermen. This stunning birds-eye view celebrates the intricate relationship between wildlife and human activity along Sri Lankas vibrant coastline. Lakshitha Karunarathna Takes Editors Choice Lakshitha Karunarathnas poignant image A Dangerous Addiction was awarded Editors Choice for its sobering portrayal of a Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) scavenging for food at a waste site in Ampara. The photograph highlights the tragic consequences of human negligence, as these majestic creatures are forced to consume harmful refuse.

        "content": "Minister of Justice and National Integration, Attorney-at-Law Harshana Nanayakkara lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today (16) regarding the publication of incorrect information on the official website of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Speaking to the media, the Minister expressed concerns that someone may have deliberately entered false data to tarnish his reputation or erode public trust in his political career. This controversy began when the Parliament website mistakenly listed the Ministers name as Dr. Harshana Nanayakkara, and later corrected it by removing the Dr. title following a complaint made by the Minister. The Minister of Justice also stated that the Parliamentary Secretariat had subsequently sent him a letter stating that there had been an error in uploading the names. Minister Nanayakkara emphasized that, as a lawyer with 25 years of experience, he has never used the title Dr, either publicly or on his business cards, and had clearly indicated in his CV that he holds no such title. There was no title of Doctor. Where does this come from? When you look at everything as a whole, anyone would have a reasonable suspicion that false data was entered to discredit me or to undermine the trust in my politics, he added. Meanwhile, issuing a clarification regarding the matter on Friday (16), the Director of Legislative Services and Director of Communications (Acting) of Parliament, Jayalath Perera, had emphasised that Minister of Justice and National Integration Harshana Nanayakkara has not indicated holding a doctoral degree in the information provided to Parliament and the appearance of the title Dr. before the Ministers name was a result of an error in entering the relevant data. Perera noted that steps have been taken to rectify this mistake accordingly and also expressed deepest regret for the inconvenience caused to the Minister of Justice and National Integration, Attorney-at-Law, Harshana Nanayakkara, in this regard. Jayalath Perera further stated that the process of re-checking and updating the information of all Members of Parliament on the parliament website is currently underway.",

        "date": "December 16, 2024 04:14 pm",
        "content": "The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2 of Gazas entire prewar population of about 2.3 million. Among the dead reported in the overall toll were 10 people, including a family of four, who were killed in an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza Citys eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministrys emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. Israel claims Hamas is responsible for the civilian death toll because it operates from within civilian areas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel has failed to take sufficient precautions to avoid civilian deaths. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel responded by heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. A separate strike on a school on Sunday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least 13 people, including six children and two women, according to Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital initially reported the strike had killed 16 people, but it later revised the death toll as the three other bodies had been from a separate strike that hit a house. The Israeli military said it had conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center embedded within a compound that had served as a school in Khan Younis. It did not provide evidence. In central Gazas Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners gathered for the funeral of a Palestinian journalist working for the Qatari-based Al Jazeera TV network who was killed Sunday in a strike on a point for Gazas civil defense agency. They carried his body through the street from the hospital, his blue bulletproof vest resting atop. The strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gazas main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Al Jazeera said Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. The International Federation of Journalists said last week that 104 journalists and media workers have been killed so far in 2024, with more than half of them perishing during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The group said that since the Oct. 7, 2023, start of the war, at least 138 had been killed, including 55 Palestinian media professionals in the calendar year. The Israeli military said its strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the Civil Defense organization in Nuseirat. It accused the journalist of having been a member of Islamic Jihad, an accusation his colleagues in Gaza denied. Gazas civil defense also rejected the claims that militants had been operating from the site. We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement, Mahmoud al-Lawh, the journalists cousin, told The Associated Press. These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime.

        "date": "December 16, 2024 06:13 pm",
        "content": "Bitcoin hit a record high above 106,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve, stoking the enthusiasm of crypto bulls. Bitcoin , the worlds biggest and best known cryptocurrency, hit a high of 106,533 and last traded up 2.6 at 103,917 at 1215 GMT. Smaller crypto ether was up 0.4 at 3,918. Were in blue sky territory here, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. The next figure the market will be looking for is 110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didnt happen, because now weve got this news. Investor sentiment also got a lift from the inclusion of MicroStrategy, into the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index that will likely lead to more inflows for the software firm turned bitcoin buyer. Bitcoin and crypto have been catapulted into the spotlight as investors wager the incoming Trump administration will usher in a friendlier regulatory environment, boosting sentiment around the alternate currency. Bitcoin is up 192 for the year. Were gonna do something great with crypto because we dont want China or anybody else - not just China but others are embracing it - and we want to be the head, Trump told CNBC, late last week. When asked if he plans to build a crypto reserve similar to oil reserves, Trump said: Yeah, I think so. Governments around the world held 2.2 of bitcoins total supply as of July, according to data provider CoinGecko , with the United States possessing nearly 200,000 bitcoins valued at more than 20 billion at current levels. China, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador are the other countries with significant amount of bitcoins, data site BitcoinTreasuries, showed. Other countries have also been considering cryptocurrency strategic reserves. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month said the current U.S. administration was undermining the role of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency in the global economy by using it for political purposes, forcing many countries to turn to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. For example, bitcoin, who can prohibit it? No one, Putin said. Were in blue sky territory here, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. The next figure the market will be looking for is 110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didnt happen, because now weve got this news. Investor sentiment also got a lift from the inclusion of MicroStrategy into the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index that will likely lead to more inflows for the software firm turned bitcoin buyer. There are skeptics though, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likening bitcoin to gold earlier this month. Analysts also point out that any such move will take time to implement. I think we still need to be cautious on a BTC strategic reserve, and at least consider that this is not likely to happen anytime soon, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. Of course, any comment from Trump that offers an increased degree of hope that plans for a strategic reserve is evolving are an obvious a tailwind, but this would come with consequences which would need to be carefully considered and well telegraphed to market players. Crypto Boost Bitcoin has surged more than 50 since the Nov. 5 election that saw Trump elected along with many other pro-crypto candidates. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over 3.8 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Trump - who once labelled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet. Trump this month named a White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, former PayPal executive David Sacks, a close friend of Trump adviser and megadonor Elon Musk. Trump also said he would nominate pro-crypto Washington attorney Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Friday, exchange operator Nasdaq said MicroStrategy will be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, with the change coming into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23 MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the worlds largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost 94 billion. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Pepperstones Weston said the market was front running the idea that Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy CEO) will capitalize on the likely rally in the MicroStrategy share price, given the impending passive flows from its inclusion into the NAS100 - where hell presumably sell shares and purchase more bitcoin.

        "date": "December 17, 2024 08:48 am",
        "content": "A teenage student opened fire with a handgun Monday at a Christian school in Wisconsin, killing a teacher and another teenager during the final week before Christmas break. The shooter also died, police said. The shooting occurred in a study hall and was reported to police by a second grader, police said at a Monday night press conference. Wisconsin police identified the shooter as a 15-year-old female student. The shooter also wounded six others at Abundant Life Christian School, including two students who were in critical condition, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. A teacher and three students had been taken to a hospital with less serious injuries, and two of them had been released by Monday evening. Every child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a victim forever. ... We need to figure out and try to piece together what exactly happened, Barnes said. Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for Abundant Life Christian School, said students handled themselves magnificently. She said when the school practices safety routines, which it had done just before the school year, leaders always announce that it is a drill. That didnt happen Monday. When they heard, Lockdown, lockdown, they knew it was real, she said. Police said the shooter, identified as Natalie Rupnow, was dead by apparent suicide when officers arrived. Barnes declined to give details about the shooter, partly out of respect for the family. He also warned people against sharing unconfirmed reports on social media about the shooters identity. What that does is it helps erode the trust in this process, he said. Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school  prekindergarten through high school  with approximately 420 students in Madison, the state capital. Wiers said the school does not have metal detectors but uses other security measures including cameras. Children and families were reunited at a medical building about a mile away. Parents pressed children against their chests while others squeezed hands and shoulders as they walked side by side. One girl was comforted with an adult-size coat around her shoulders as she moved to a parking lot teeming with police vehicles. A motive for the shooting was not immediately known, but Barnes said police were talking with the parents of the suspected shooter and they were cooperating. He also said he didnt know if the people shot had been targeted. I dont know why, and I feel like if we did know why, we could stop these things from happening, he told reporters. A search warrant had been issued Monday to a Madison home, he said. Someone from the school called 911 to report an active shooter shortly before 11 a.m. First responders who were in training just 3 miles (5 kilometers) away dashed to the school for an actual emergency, Barnes said. They arrived 3 minutes after the initial call and went into the building immediately. Classes had been taking place when the shooting happened, Barnes said. He declined to say where exactly in the school it happened. Investigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law enforcement official told the AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Police blocked off roads around the school, and federal agents were at the scene to assist local law enforcement. No shots were fired by police. Abundant Life asked for prayers in a brief Facebook post. Wiers said the schools goal is to have staff get together early in the week and have community opportunities for students to reconnect before the winter break, but its still to be decided whether they will resume classes this week. Bethany Highman, the mother of a student, rushed to the school and learned over FaceTime that her daughter was OK. As soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute. Nothing else matters, Highman said. Theres nobody around you. You just bolt for the door and try to do everything you can as a parent to be with your kids. In a statement, President Joe Biden cited the tragedy in calling on Congress to pass universal background checks, a national red flag law and certain gun restrictions. We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart, Biden said. He spoke with Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway and offered his support. Evers said its unthinkable that a child or teacher would go to school and never return home. The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. Firearms were the leading cause of death among children in 2020 and 2021, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. Rhodes-Conway said the country needs to do more to prevent gun violence. I hoped that this day would never come to Madison, she said. Source: AP --Agencies",

Final results showed holders representing 97.86 of the outstanding principal on the existing bonds voted in favour of the plan, which will swap Sri Lankas defaulted bonds for a series of new fixed income instruments, the government said in a statement dated Dec. 16. Sri Lanka, which defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in May 2022 due to its high debt burden and dwindling foreign exchange reserves, had said on Friday that initial results showed holders representing 96 of the outstanding principal on the existing bonds voted in favour of the restructuring plan. The South Asian island nations new instruments include a governance-linked bond, which offers a 75-basis-point reduction in the interest rate payable if Sri Lanka meets certain governance targets, and several bonds linked to economic performance. With the finalising of the bond exchange, Sri Lanka will become the fourth country to conclude a restructuring of its bonds this year, following in the footsteps of Ghana, Ukraine and Zambia.

        "title": "Sri Lankas ambitious governance and macro-linked bonds explained",
        "date": "December 17, 2024 11:13 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas restructuring of 12.55 billion in international bond debt is set to lead to the launch of a series of new, as-yet-untested instruments linked to economic growth and governance. Observers say it is one of the most complex set of instruments ever arranged in a restructuring. The bonds aim to give the country additional debt relief if the economy falters and to encourage it to improve its governance. Below are some aspects of the new bonds. HOW DO SRI LANKAS GOVERNANCE-LINKED BONDS WORK? The governance-linked bond (GLB) is the first of its kind and is designed to reward Sri Lanka for transparency and effective economic management by reducing the interest on its debt. To earn that reduction, Sri Lanka must meet targets, or key performance indicators (KPIs), seen as indicating better governance. The first KPI demands that Sri Lanka exceed a baseline ratio set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for total revenue to GDP in both 2026 and 2027, which the Fund has projected at 15.3 and 15.4 respectively. The second target requires the finance ministry to prepare and publish a Fiscal Strategy Statement on its website in both 2026 and 2027. If Sri Lanka meets both targets, the bond coupon will be reduced by 75 basis points from late 2028. This would reduce its interest payments by 80 million over the remaining life of the instrument, which matures in 2035. HOW DO SRI LANKAS MACRO-LINKED BONDS WORK? Fixed income instruments with payouts linked to economic performance have been used by countries from Argentina to Greece and Ukraine. However, this is the first time in recent history that a bond includes a provision to adjust payouts not only to the upside, in case of better-than-expected growth, but also to the downside if the economy falls short of forecasts. Sri Lankas adjustment would come in 2028. The upside scenario would mean an increase in both capital and interest payments, while the downside scenario could reduce the principal of the bond owed to creditors - a new concept. IMF data serves as the baseline for the measurements. The countrys 2025-2027 average nominal GDP in U.S. dollars will determine whether it triggers the upside or downside scenario, but there is an additional control variable measuring cumulative real GDP growth from 2024 to 2027. This ensures that Sri Lanka will not pay more in debt servicing if its economic strengthening - as measured in dollars - is driven by an appreciation in the Sri Lankan rupee. This aims to ensure it only pays more if there is better growth in real terms. Rothschild, advisers to some bondholders, have calculated that the downside scenario, if triggered, would provide 2.1 billion in additional debt relief. HOW WILL THESE BONDS FIT INTO THE MARKET? New bonds, in order to be widely held, must be rated by the Big Three agencies - Moodys, Fitch and SP - and also be eligible for key bond indexes. Moodys has given both bond structures the nod, and the other agencies are expected to follow suit. The macro-linked bonds are also index-eligible, according to adviser Rothschild. JPMorgan, which runs the main index for emerging market hard currency sovereign bonds, declined to comment. If bonds are not rated or index eligible, major institutional investors are less likely to hold them, which makes them less liquid and ultimately can make debt more expensive for the country issuing them. WILL THESE BONDS BE A BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER ISSUERS? In short, only if they function well. Investors are watching to see if the instruments trade easily - and how difficult it is to determine a fair price for them given their complexities. Debt restructurings often serve as an incubator for experimental fixed income instruments that aim to address specific issues a government has faced and to help prevent a repeat. However, experience shows this does not necessarily mean they will become established in regular bond sales thereafter. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The tri-forces personnel assigned to provide security to former presidents will be withdrawn from next week and only police security will continue to be provided, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala said. Speaking during todays (17) parliamentary session, the Minister highlighted that the police protection will be provided to each former President in accordance with the outcomes of the security assessment conducted every 06 months. Accordingly, the security for former heads of state would now be based on biannual security assessments. This decision comes as part of the governments efforts to reassess and reduce public spending, particularly in the face of ongoing economic challenges, according to Minister Wijepala. Commenting further regarding the matter, Minister Wijepala highlighted the substantial financial burden that the government has shouldered in the form of security expenses for former presidents. He detailed the financial expenditure on security for each former president so far during this year, which includes contributions from the Tri-Forces, Sri Lanka Police, and the Presidential Secretariat: 1. Mahinda Rajapaksa Tri-Forces: Rs. 328 million Police: Rs. 327 million Presidential Secretariat: Rs. 55 million Total: Rs. 710 million 2. Maithripala Sirisena Tri-Forces: Rs. 6 million Police: Rs. 185 million Presidential Secretariat: Rs. 16 million Total: Rs. 207 million 3.

        "date": "December 17, 2024 01:20 pm",
        "content": "TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it. Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the laws Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikToks more than 170 million users in the U.S. A modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter  before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed, lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court. President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to save TikTok, said his administration would take a look at the situation. As you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters. Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elects plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue. The case could attract the courts interest because it pits free speech rights against the governments stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms. The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nations capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices. On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court. The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights. Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines. It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trumps Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the laws most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect. The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19. On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled. With that last prospect in mind, the companies lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because theyd need the time to coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States. The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "(Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck Vanuatus capital Port Vila on Tuesday, with the United Nations reporting six unconfirmed deaths and that two reservoirs and a hospital had been damaged. State broadcaster VBTC showed footage of vehicles crushed under the debris of collapsed buildings and boulders strewn across a highway. Drone footage showed landslips near a shipping terminal. Communications networks on the Pacific archipelago were down, New Zealand said. Australias Foreign Minister Penny Wong said there was significant damage and Australia was preparing to deploy assistance including urban search and rescue and emergency medical teams on Wednesday. Port Vilas international airport was closed, Vanuatus High Commission in Canberra said. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated 116,000 people had been affected by the earthquake. It said there were six unconfirmed deaths and damage to the two main water reservoirs. The structure of the hospital in Port Vila was affected, with the operating theatre not functioning and triage tents set up outside to manage the influx of patients, it said in a statement. Authorities were unable to communicate with the National Disaster Management Office until Tuesday evening, when Starlink satellite services were provided, it said. Dan McGarry, a journalist with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project based in Vanuatu, earlier told Reuters that police had said at least one person had been killed and injured people had been taken to hospital. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the casualty figures, with communications outages making it hard to reach Vanuatu authorities for comment. DEVASTATED FAMILIES Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said on Facebook he was saddened by the news of the earthquake which has claimed lives and devastated families in Vanuatu, his comments also suggesting the death toll might be higher. Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland said on X many people had been injured and infrastructure had been destroyed. It was the most violent earthquake Ive experienced in my 21 years living in Vanuatu and in the Pacific Islands. Ive seen a lot of large earthquakes, never one like this, McGarry said. Security camera footage from the moment the quake struck showed people scattering in panic in a garage and cars rocking on the ground. Footage posted on social media showed buckled windows and collapsed concrete pillars on a building hosting foreign missions in the capital, including the U.S., British, French and New Zealand embassies. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Papua New Guinea said its embassy in Port Vila had sustained considerable damage. All personnel who were in the U.S. Embassy building were able to safely evacuate, the spokesperson added. New Zealands High Commission building, which is co-located with the U.S., French and British missions, had sustained significant damage, a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement. There were communications outages across the country, the New Zealand statement added, while the Australian High Commission in Vanuatu said its communication systems had also been affected. Vanuatus government is in caretaker mode ahead of a national election, after the president dissolved parliament last month. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was at a depth of 10 km (6 miles). Half a dozen aftershocks hit Vanuatu following the initial quake, USGS data showed. Several were heavy enough to be felt in Port Vila, McGarry said. The U.S. Tsunami Warning System cancelled an initial tsunami warning for Vanuatu. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "An international war crimes prosecutor said on Tuesday that evidence emerging from mass grave sites in Syria has exposed a state-run machinery of death under toppled leader Bashar al-Assad in which he estimated more than 100,000 people were tortured and murdered since 2013. Speaking after visiting two mass grave sites in the towns of Qutayfah and Najha near Damascus, former U.S. war crimes ambassador at large Stephen Rapp told Reuters: We certainly have more than 100,000 people that were disappeared into and tortured to death in this machine. I dont have much doubt about those kinds of numbers given what weve seen in these mass graves. We really havent seen anything quite like this since the Nazis, said Rapp, who led prosecutions at the Rwanda and Sierra Leone war crimes tribunals and is working with Syrian civil society to document war crimes evidence and is helping to prepare for any eventual trials. From the secret police who disappeared people from their streets and homes, to the jailers and interrogators who starved and tortured them to death, to the truck drivers and bulldozer drivers who hid their bodies, thousands of people were working in this system of killing, Rapp said. We are talking about a system of state terror, which became a machinery of death. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians are estimated to have been killed since 2011, when Assads crackdown on protests against him spiralled into a full-scale war. Both Assad and his father Hafez, who preceded him as president and died in 2000, have long been accused by rights groups and governments of widespread extrajudicial killings, including mass executions within the countrys prison system and using chemical weapons against the Syrian people. Assad, who fled to Moscow, had repeatedly denied that his government committed human rights violations and painted his detractors as extremists. The head of U.S.-based Syrian advocacy organisation the Syrian Emergency Task Force, Mouaz Moustafa, who also visited Qutayfah, 25 miles (40 km) north of Damascus, has estimated at least 100,000 bodies were buried there alone. Place of Horrors The International Commission on Missing Persons in The Hague separately said it had received data indicating there may be as many as 66, as yet unverified, mass grave sites in Syria. More than 157,000 people have been reported missing to the commission. Commission head Kathryne Bomberger told Reuters its portal for reporting the missing was now exploding with new contacts from families. By comparison, roughly 40,000 people went missing during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. For the families, the search for the truth in Syria could be long and difficult. A DNA match will require at least three relatives providing DNA reference samples and taking a DNA sample from each one of these skeletal remains found in the graves, Bomberger said. The commission called for sites to be protected so that evidence was preserved for potential trials, but the mass grave sites were easily accessible on Tuesday. The United States is engaged with a number of U.N. bodies to ensure the Syrian people get answers and accountability, the State Department said on Tuesday. Syrian residents living near Qutayfah, a former military base where one of the sites was located, and a cemetery in Najha used to hide bodies from detention sites described seeing a steady stream of refrigeration trucks delivering bodies which were dumped into long trenches dug with bulldozers. The graves were prepared in an organised manner - the truck would come, unload the cargo it had, and leave. There were security vehicles with them, and no one was allowed to approach, anyone who got close used to go down with them, Abb Khalid, who works as a farmer next to Najha cemetery, said. In Qutayfah, residents declined to speak on camera or use their names for fear of the retribution, saying they were not yet sure the area was safe after Assads fall. This is the place of horrors, one said on Tuesday. Inside a site enclosed with cement walls, three children played near a Russian-made military satellite vehicle. The soil was flat and levelled, with straight long marks where the bodies were believed buried. Satellite Imagery Satellite imagery analysed by Reuters showed large-scale digging began at the location between 2012 and 2014 and continued up until 2022. Multiple satellite images taken by Maxar during that time showed a digger and large trenches visible at the site, along with three or four large trucks. Omar Hujeirati, a former anti-Assad protest leader who lives near the Najha cemetery, which was used until the larger Qutayfah site was created because it was full, said he suspected several of his missing family members may be in the grave. He believes at least some of those taken, including two sons and four brothers, were detained for protesting against Assads government. That was my sin, what made them take my family, he said, a long, exposed trench behind him where the bodies were apparently buried. Details of Syrias mass graves first emerged during German court hearings and U.S. congressional testimony in 2021 and 2023. A man identified only as the grave digger testified repeatedly as a witness about his work at the Najha and Qutayfah sites during the German trial of Syrian government officials. While working in cemeteries around Damascus at the end of 2011, two intelligence officers showed up at his office and ordered him and his colleagues to transport and bury corpses. He testified that he rode in a van adorned with pictures of Assad and drove to the sites several times a week between 2011 and 2018, followed by large refrigeration trucks filled with bodies. The trucks carried several hundred corpses from Tishreen, Mezzeh and Harasta military hospitals to Najha and Qutayfah, he said in the trial. At the sites deep trenches were already dug and the grave digger and his colleagues would unload the corpses into the trenches, which would be covered with dirt by excavators as soon as a section of the trench was full, he said. Every week, twice a week, three trailer trucks arrived, packed with 300 to 600 bodies of victims of torture, starvation, and execution from military hospitals and intelligence branches around Damascus, he told Congress in a written statement. The grave digger escaped from Syria to Europe in 2018 and has repeatedly testified about the mass graves, but always with his identity shielded from the public and the media.

        "content": "Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said his government is not concerned with Adani Groups dealings with other countries, but is instead focused only on what the conglomerate does in Sri Lanka. He said his stable government intends to pave the way for more Indian investments. We dont have any concerns over how they (Adani) work with other countries. What is important for us is how they work with us, Dissanayake told ET in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. We are basically concerned about our investments, our development. We will be looking at how they have worked in our country. If they have worked in a manner that suits us, fits our initiatives, we dont mind working with Adani Group. The business house, which has important investments in Sri Lanka, is under the scanner in the US and contesting an indictment by the FBI. While the Sri Lankan President was clear his government would not be looking at the group through the same prism, he did flag some ecological worries over a project. They (Adani) are completing the west terminal of Colombo port. They are also looking at investments in the energy sector. There are so many investments they have looked at but unfortunately, a case has been filed by people who have environmental concerns, said Dissanayake. We will be weighing the pros and cons of the case that is pending in the court, (as well as) the consensus of the people, and then see what is best. Environmental concerns are as important as investment for Sri Lanka, he said. On Adani Groups decision to withdraw its request for a 553-million financing arrangement with the US International Development Finance Corporation, Dissanayake said, I learnt that they have dropped it, but it seems they have their own sources of revenue or income for that.

India and Sri Lanka issued the joint statement after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Disanayaka held comprehensive and fruitful discussions in New Delhi on Monday. In a statement here, Wickremesinghe welcomed the development, saying it further deepens Indo-Lanka cooperation. I also commend President Anura Kumara Disanayaka for going ahead with the economic and technical cooperation agreement (ETCA) and the development of Trincomalee as a regional energy and industrial hub, he said. Disanayaka visited Delhi as his first visit overseas since being elected president in mid-September. His Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has historically adopted an anti-Indian stance, always questioning the Indian involvement in Sri Lanka. Wickremesinghe pioneered the ETCA with India amidst opposition from the JVP. The joint statement said the two countries agreed to energy connectivity, the establishment of a high-capacity power grid interconnection and a multi-product pipeline for the supply of affordable and reliable energy. They also agreed to explore the possibility of concluding a framework Agreement on Defence Cooperation. Source: Indian Express --Agencies",

        "date": "December 18, 2024 11:34 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit a comprehensive report on the ongoing investigation into the leaking of three questions from the first question paper of the recent Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. The court instructed the CID to submit the detailed report by 9.00 a.m. tomorrow (19). The directive was issued during a hearing this morning, where four fundamental rights petitions, filed by a group of students who sat for the examination and their parents, seeking an order to re-conduct the examination due to the early release of the questions, were taken up today. A bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, Kumudini Wickremasinghe, and Arjuna Obeysekera issued the order and began deliberations on the matter. The hearing of the petitions is set to continue today. On December 2, the Attorney General (AG) informed the Supreme Court that the Cabinet of Ministers had recommended awarding free marks to all students for the three disputed questions. Appearing on behalf of the AG, Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne stated that the Cabinet of Ministers stance was that it is not necessary to re-conduct the examination for this question paper, considering the potential stress it could cause to the students. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. On October 14, the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. However in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the release of results of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.",

Delivering a special statement in Parliament today (18), the Head of State informed the House that following discussions with the IMF on the third review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka, it was agreed to increase the income tax threshold (tax-free) from a monthly income of Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000. When the third review began, our proposals were on the income tax imposed on professionals. We resumed discussions. The tax threshold was over Rs. 100,000. We were able to increase it to Rs. 150,000, President Dissanayake said. He went on to explain the new income tax revisions, adding: We were also able to get the first bracket of personal income tax revised from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 1 million, subject to a tax rate of 6. Accordingly, someone earning a salary of Rs. 150,000 per month is 100 tax exempt. A person earning Rs. 200,000 is exempt from tax by 71. A person earning Rs. 250,000 is exempt from tax by 61. A person earning Rs. 300,000 is exempt from tax by 47. A person earning Rs. 350,000 is exempt from tax by 25.5.

        "content": "A plot to assassinate Pope Francis during a trip to Iraq was stopped following a tip-off from British intelligence, according to his upcoming autobiography. The Pope writes that, after landing in Baghdad in March 2021, he was told an event at which he was set to appear was being targeted by two suicide bombers. Both attackers were subsequently intercepted and killed, he said in excerpts published by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The visit, which took place over three days during the coronavirus pandemic, was the first ever to Iraq by a pope and saw an intense security operation. The years before had seen increased sectarian violence in Iraq, with fighting between Shia and Sunni Muslims as well as the persecution of religious minorities. The countrys Christian community had shrunk dramatically, having been targeted in particular by the Islamic State group and other Sunni extremists. In excerpts of his autobiography, the Pope says almost everyone advised me against the visit but he felt he had to do it. He says the plot was uncovered by British intelligence, who warned Iraqi police, and they in turn told his security detail once he had touched down. A woman packed with explosives, a young suicide bomber, was heading towards Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit, he says. And a van had also set off at great speed with the same intention. The Pope adds that he asked a security official the following day what had happened to the would-be attackers. The official replied laconically: They are no more. The Iraqi police had intercepted them and blown them up, he wrote. The book, entitled Hope, is due to be published on 14 January. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to Reuters news agency. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Speaking in Parliament today (18), he said that the government agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce tax on services exports from the existing 30 to 15. He said that an agreement was also reached to increase the Withholding Tax from 5 to 10. Usually, elderly people, pensioners, deposit a certain amount of money in banks and live off the interest they earn. Usually, they are subject to tax if they earn Rs. 150,000 per month in interest. But what can happen through withholding tax is that even if it is less than Rs. 150,000, it can be subjected to withholding tax, he said. The President also noted that the government will open a new division in the Inland Revenue Department to address concerns regarding the tax. Any citizen who thinks their bank account should not be subjected to this tax can go to the Inland Revenue Department, present their tax status, and avoid being included for that tax. He explained that pensioners and others with income below the Rs. 150,000 tax threshold and those paying income tax below the 10 tax rate will be able to apply for lower withholding tax rates and to be free from the tax, through the Inland Revenue Department. Additionally, the President stated that the government had agreed, as part of the third review, to remove the Value-Added Tax (VAT) on local fresh milk and yogurt products to improve childrens nutrition. The President said, The previous government had agreed to a 30 percent tax on service exports. We have agreed to reduce it to 15 percent.",

However, none of the occupants in the house were injured in the shooting, although two bullets had hit the wall and a window of the house. Nugegoda Scene of Crime officers, who arrived at the scene, began preliminary investigations, while Meegoda Police are conducting further investigations into the incident.",

        "date": "December 18, 2024 03:26 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court announced that the verdict on the fundamental rights petitions filed seeking an order to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, will be delivered on December 31, 2024. This was announced by the Supreme Court after concluding the hearing related to the petitions, which have been filed by filed by a group of students who sat for the examination and their parents. The petitions were heard before a judge bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, Kumudini Wickremasinghe, and Arjuna Obeysekera over a period of three full days. Accordingly, the presenting of oral submissions of all the attorneys for the petitioning and respondent parties were concluded this evening (18). Thereafter, it was ordered that if there are any written submission, they be submitted before 9.00 a.m. tomorrow (19). Accordingly, it was announced that the verdict related to the peitions will be delivered on December 31. Earlier today, the Supreme Court directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit a comprehensive report on the ongoing investigation into the leaking of three questions from the first question paper of the recent Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. The court instructed the CID to submit the detailed report by 9.00 a.m. tomorrow (19). The directive was issued during the hearing this morning, where four fundamental rights petitions, filed by a group of students who sat for the examination and their parents, seeking an order to re-conduct the examination due to the early release of the questions, were taken up for hearing. On December 2, the Attorney General (AG) informed the Supreme Court that the Cabinet of Ministers had recommended awarding free marks to all students for the three disputed questions. Appearing on behalf of the AG, Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne stated that the Cabinet of Ministers stance was that it is not necessary to re-conduct the examination for this question paper, considering the potential stress it could cause to the students. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. On October 14, the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. However in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the release of results of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.",

Speaking at the India Foundation Program, Herath stated, We too had such a big tourism before the Easter Sunday attack, 2018. We got (the) highest amounts of tourists. And at that time, according to my memory, we earned four billion (dollars). Herath pointed out the compounding challenges Sri Lanka faced due to these crises: After the Easter Sunday attack, there was a COVID-19 situation. After that, the economic crisis was there. Because of those three factors, we faced so many difficulties. The first one was the Easter Sunday attack. The second one was COVID-19. The third one was the economic crisis. Now, all those factors are not there, he explained, adding that these barriers are no longer present. Looking forward, the Minister expressed hope for boosting tourism, particularly from India: We can increase our tourism industry. And we hope to open our hands to India. And we hope the Indian tourists will come. A key part of the strategy to boost tourism involves a policy change set for January 2024. Herath revealed, At the beginning of next January, we will pass some cassette notification in the parliament. In that cassette notification, we will give free visas to 39 countries. This move is expected to make it easier for tourists, including those from India, to visit Sri Lanka. Additionally, Herath made an appeal regarding travel facilities for Sri Lankans to India, stating, Then the most of the Indians, not only Indians but also so 39 other countries, tourists can visit us easily. And apart from that, I feel from your country, you asked also for that facility. India has not given that facility yet. Therefore, please inform your government to give that facility to Sri Lankans.

Dinush Kurera, 47, blinked and looked straight ahead as Victorian Supreme Court Justice Amanda Fox handed down his sentence today. He will be eligible for parole after 30 years. Kurera claimed he was acting in self-defence when he repeatedly stabbed his wife Nelomie Perera with an axe and knife at her Melbourne home on December 3, 2022. But a jury rejected his story and in August found him guilty of murder after only three hours of deliberations. Justice Fox described the fatal attack as brutal and horrific, saying Kurera had clearly been in a rage. You were motivated by anger and saw everything of the prism of entitlement and ownership, she said in her sentence. In your mind, Nelomie deserved to be killed for leaving you, excluding you from your house and seeing other men. Kureras teenage children witnessed the attack and his 16-year-old daughter even tried to stop him as he grabbed a knife. Both children gave evidence at trial and described in victim impact statements how distressing the court process was. Source: AAP --Agencies",
