        "content": "Some of the worlds most influential people have arrived in Indias Gujarat state to attend a wedding party thrown by Asias richest man. Mark Zuckerberg, Rihanna and Bill Gates are among the guests at the pre-wedding gala hosted by Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani for his son. Anant Ambani, 28, is set to marry Radhika Merchant in July. Bollywood stars including Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan are also at the three-day event in Jamnagar city. Mukesh Ambani, 66, is currently the worlds 10th richest man with a net worth of 115bn, according to Forbes. Reliance Industries, founded by his father in 1966, is a massive conglomerate that operates in sectors ranging from refining and retail to financial services and telecom. Anant Ambani is the youngest of his three children, all of whom are on the board of Reliance Industries. The 28-year-old is involved in Reliances energy businesses and is on the board of Reliance Foundation. The extravagant pre-wedding event is in keeping with the Ambani familys record of hosting lavish wedding parties. In 2018, pop sensation Beyoncé performed at Mr Ambanis daughter Isha Ambanis pre-wedding festivities held in Udaipur city. Former US Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among the guests at the event. A Bloomberg report at the time cited sources who put the cost of Ishas wedding at 100m - this was denied by a person close to the family who said the bill was around 15m. The current festivities kicked off earlier this week with an event where the Ambani family served food to the local people in Jamnagar. Some 1,200 guests are attending the pre-wedding party, which is being held in a township in Jamnagar near Reliances main oil refinery. Reuters reported that the guest list includes Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla. Disney CEO Bob Iger is also expected to be at the party, which comes days after his company announced a merger of its India assets with that of Reliance. Zuckerberg, who is on a busy Asia trip, reached Jamnagar on Thursday. Bill Gates, who arrived in India a couple of days ago, had earlier posted a video of himself having tea made by a local vendor - it later went viral. Others spotted arriving on Friday include cricketers Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dwayne Bravo, and BP CEO Murray Auchincloss. Other guests expected at the Ambani event include BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai, former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, former Australian PM Kevin Rudd and Ivanka Trump. The guest list appears to have more RSVPs from global corporate titans than the weddings of Mr Ambanis two older children in 2018 and 2019, underscoring Reliances growing clout and role as a conduit to the Indian economy for global tech, media and energy giants, Bloomberg wrote. Among the entertainment on offer are performances by Rihanna and illusionist David Blaine. Guests are also expected to visit a rescue centre in Jamnagar, which is reportedly home to more than 2,000 animals. According to a planning document seen by Reuters, the dress code for this visit is jungle fever. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 1, 2024 06:24 pm",
        "content": "The state-run Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) on Thursday cut power supplies to the parliament over a debt of 23m Ghanaian cedi (1.8m; 1.4m). The outage interrupted a debate on the presidents State of the Nation speech. A video shared by local media showed MPs in the dimly lit chamber chanting: Dumsor, dumsor, which means power outage in the local Akan language. Local media reported that a back-up power generator restored power to the chamber a few minutes later. But other parts of the parliament building remained without power for most of the day before supplies were restored. MPs and parliamentary staff who were using the elevator when the abrupt blackout hit were stuck, Ghanas TV3 channel reported. The power companys communications director William Boateng told Reuters news agency it had resorted to disconnecting power because of parliaments refusal to honour demand notices to pay up. Electricity was restored later in the day after parliament paid 13m cedi and made a pledge to settle the remaining debt within a week, Mr Boateng added. Parliamentary finance official Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror denied that parliament owed the amount quoted by the power company. He said that the companys system failed to record recent payments made by parliament and insisted that the outstanding power bill was about 950,000. Ghanas electricity company, which is facing crippling financial difficulties, frequently disconnects power from indebted clients. Disconnections are for everybody; anyone who doesnt pay and fails to make arrangements, the team will disconnect, Mr Boateng told Reuters. In recent years, power shortages have worsened as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis in a decade, and these have become even more frequent in the past few months. Private electricity suppliers are owed 1.6bn by the state power company, according to Elikplim Kwabla Apetogbor, the head of the organisation representing them. Last July, they threatened to shut down operations over the arrears. Opposition MPs have urged the government to invest in the power sector to prevent it from collapsing. They have attributed the current challenges to a lack of funds to purchase fuel for the countrys thermal generation plants. Source: BBC --Agencies",

As such, 7 suspects former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand. They were produced before the court on Thursday (Feb.29) and further remanded until March 14 on the orders of the Maligakanda Magistrate. The CID arrested Rambukwella on February 02 in connection with the substandard medicines procurement scandal, where he arrived at the premises to record a statement. His arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Reportedly, funds to the tune of Rs. 144 million have been misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG. After the scandal came to light, Rambukwella was given the portfolio of Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October last year. Accordingly, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries. Soon after Rambukwellas arrest, a special gazette notification was published, confirming his resignation as the Environment Minister.",

        "title": "Ensuring Red Sea security vital to protect Sri Lankas port economics - President",
        "date": "March 1, 2024 09:10 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says Sri Lanka Navy is entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding Sri Lankas oceanic territories, including the Indian Ocean region. He underscored that the nations economic initiatives will not be permitted to suffer any harm in the Indian Ocean. Additionally, the President highlighted the historical context of the closure of the Suez Canal for a decade during the 1967 Israeli-Arab war and its effects on the Colombo ports operations. He emphasized the imperative of ensuring the security of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea to safeguard the economic interests of the countrys ports. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while delivering a speech at the Presidential Fleet Review of the Sri Lanka Navy held this morning (March 01) at the Trincomalee Harbour. As Commander-in-Chief, President Ranil Wickremesinghe was warmly welcomed with a guard of honour by the Sri Lanka Navy upon his arrival at the Trincomalee Naval Base. During the ceremony, the President awarded President Colours to the Sri Lanka Navys Special Boat Squadron for their dedicated efforts in advancing the countrys maritime aspirations and ensuring the security of Sri Lankas oceanic territories. The event was further enhanced by a naval display performed by the navys special boat squadron and other warships. Meanwhile, the President, onboard a Dora vessel, participated in observing the fleet of warships engaged in operations, which were anchored at sea and docked in the harbour. The Commander-in-Chief, President Wickremesinghe, formally inspected the warships SLNS Gajabahu, SLNS Samudura, SLNS Parakramabahu, SLNS Sagara, SLNS Udara, SLNS Shakthi, SLNS Nandimithra and SLNS Sayurala during this observation. Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera presented a memento to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Meanwhile, the President also recorded his remarks in the logbook at the Naval Base. The event was attended by State Minister for Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayaka, Eastern Province Governor, Senthil Thondaman, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence General Kamal Gunaratne (retired), Chief of Defence Staff, General Shavendra Silva, Commander of the Eastern Naval Area Rear Admiral Suresh De Silva, Commanding Officer of the Special Boat Squadron Captain Dharmasiri Herath, along with a officers and members of the SL Navy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further remarked: Today is a momentous day for the Navys Special Boat Squadron. President awards were bestowed upon this squadron today. It has been 30 years since the establishment of this squadron, back in 1993. The decision to create such a division within the navy was made following the existence of two special service divisions within our army. This initiative was a result of prolonged discussions among navy commanders within the National Security Council. This squadron has played a pivotal role in the navys strategic efforts against LTTE terrorists. Hence, while it may not be necessary to enumerate the specific contributions made by this squadron, it is important to convey my heartfelt gratitude for their service. Furthermore, this squadron has earned reverence and acknowledgment as a vital component of the Sri Lanka Navy. Hence, I implore all of you to uphold the esteemed reputation of this squadron by executing your duties with even greater excellence, even after receiving the presidential colours. Furthermore, during the recent conflict, the Sri Lanka Navy rendered invaluable service to the nation. The sacrifices made by all the Navy personnel, as well as the resources lost, are etched in history. Since its inception, our Navy has been dedicated to safeguarding not only the territorial waters of Sri Lanka but also the wider Indian Ocean region. We have pledged our commitment to the agreement of the United Nations in this matter. It is imperative that we prevent any harm to our economic endeavours in the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, we have made arrangements to deploy our navy for the security of the Red Sea. Recalling the adverse effects of the closure of the Suez Canal during the 1967 Israeli-Arab war, which halted operations at the Colombo port for a decade, underscores the necessity of safeguarding the Indian Ocean. It is imperative for us to ensure the security of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea to protect the economic value of our ports. I am confident that our navy will effectively undertake this responsibility in the future. Todays event holds historical significance as it takes place at the Trincomalee Harbour, which is not only esteemed in Sri Lanka but also worldwide. Dating back to the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras, this port has been recognized as a crucial maritime hub. This harbour played a pivotal role in the victory of the British in the Asian region during the Second World War. It is imperative that we safeguard this harbour, which is a crucial asset of our nation. We must exercise prudence and vigilance in its protection. Today, as Commander-in-Chief, I had the privilege to inspect the naval fleet. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to them and the entire Navy for their dedicated service to our country. --PMD",

        "title": "Alexei Navalny buried in Moscow as thousands chant his name",
        "date": "March 1, 2024 09:20 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of Russians chanted Alexei Navalnys name and said they would not forgive the authorities for his death as the opposition leader was laid to rest in Moscow on Friday. In video streamed from the Borisovskyoe cemetery, Navalnys mother Lyudmila and father Anatoly stooped over his open coffin to kiss him for the last time as a small group of musicians played. Crossing themselves, mourners stepped forward to caress his face before a priest gently placed a white shroud over him and the coffin was closed. Navalny, President Vladimir Putins fiercest critic inside Russia, died at the age of 47 in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16., sparking accusations from his supporters that he had been murdered. The Kremlin has denied any state involvement in his death. The authorities have outlawed his movement as extremist and cast his supporters as U.S.-backed troublemakers out to foment revolution. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had nothing to say to Navalnys family. Many thousands of people turned out to pay their respects at the cemetery and outside the Soothe My Sorrows church in southeast Moscow where Orthodox priests held a short funeral service before the body was taken to the cemetery. Among the large crowd, many people clutched bunches of flowers and some joined in chants - Russia will be free, No to war, Russia without Putin, We wont forgive and Putin is a murderer. Police were present in large numbers but did not intervene. Since the start of the war in Ukraine two years ago, Russia has tightened its laws to introduce long prison sentences for anyone found guilty of discrediting the armed forces. Putins leading critics are either in prison or have fled abroad. I came here to say goodbye to Navalny. What does that mean for me? I dont even know how to explain it, said a 25-year-old man who gave his name as Kirill. Its very sad for the future of Russia...We wont give up, we will believe in something better. A young woman, Kamila, said: There are more than 10,000 people here, and no one is afraid...We came here in order to honour the memory of a man who also wasnt afraid, who wasnt afraid of anything. Inside the church, Navalnys mother Lyudmila sat holding a candle as priests in white robes stood over the coffin. Navalnys top aides, all based outside Russia, struggled to contain their emotions as they broadcast live video of the farewell to their leader. This is a photograph that is very hard to look at, said one of them, Ruslan Shaveddinov. State media gave scant coverage to the funeral. The RIA news agency reported the fact of Navalnys burial, noting the presence of foreign envoys including the U.S., French and German ambassadors, and recalled that he had been jailed on a host of charges including fraud, contempt of court and extremism. Navalny denied all those charges, saying they had been trumped up by the authorities to silence his criticism of Putin. KREMLIN WARNING More than a quarter of a million people watched the farewell to Navalny on his YouTube channel, which is blocked inside Russia. Messages, mostly expressing sadness but some also defiance, streamed down beside the video. Allies of Navalny outside Russia have called on people who want to honour his memory but could not attend his funeral service to instead go to memorials to Soviet-era repression in their own towns on Friday evening at 7 p.m. local time. The Kremlin said any unsanctioned gatherings in support of Navalny would violate the law. Just a reminder that we have a law that must be followed. Any unauthorised gatherings will be in violation of the law, and those who participate in them will be held accountable - again, in line with the current law, Peskov said. Navalnys wife Yulia and two children, who are living outside Russia, did not attend the funeral. Yulia Navalnaya, who has pledged to continue her husbands work, thanked him for 26 years of absolute happiness. She posted on X: I dont know how to live without you, but I will try my best to make you up there happy for me and proud of me. I dont know if Ill manage it or not, but I will try. Navalny was a Christian who condemned Putins decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine as a crazy enterprise built on lies. The church that hosted his funeral has donated to the Russian army and enthusiastically advertised its backing for the war. In the run-up to the ceremony, his allies accused the authorities of blocking their plans to hold a bigger civil memorial service. The Kremlin has said it has nothing to do with Navalnys funeral arrangements. Navalnys allies have accused Putin of having him murdered because the Russian leader could allegedly not tolerate the thought of Navalny being freed in a potential prisoner swap. They have not published proof to back up that accusation, but have promised to set out how he was murdered and by whom. The Kremlin has denied state involvement in his death and has said it is unaware of any agreement to free Navalny. His death certificate - according to allies - said he died of natural causes. Navalny, a former lawyer, mounted the most determined political challenge against Putin since the Russian leader came to power at the end of 1999, organising street protests and publishing high-profile investigations into the alleged corruption of some in the ruling elite. Navalny decided to return to Russia from Germany in 2021 after being treated for what Western doctors said was poisoning with a nerve agent only to be immediately taken into custody. Putin has yet to comment on Navalnys death and has for years avoided mentioning him by name. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 1, 2024 10:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas earnings from tourism were estimated at USD 342 million in January 2024, the Central Banks latest report on external sector performance revealed. This is the highest monthly value the country has witnessed since January 2020. According to the document, published on Thursday (Feb.29), Sri Lankas tourism earnings in January 2024 marked a substantial improvement compared to USD 269 million in December 2023 and USD 154 million in January 2023. The country also attracted as many as 208,253 tourists in January this year, as opposed to 102,545 arrivals recorded during the corresponding period in 2023. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka also recorded an improvement with respect to workers remittances in January 2024, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Workers remittances amounted to USD 488 million in January 2024, in comparison to USD 437 million in January 2023 and USD 570 million in December 2023. Workers remittances continued to record a broad-based increasing trend, despite intermittent seasonal fluctuations, since recording a notable recovery in 2022, the Central Bank said further. According to the Central Bank, the countrys earnings from merchandise exports have recorded a marginal decline of 0.8 to USD 971 million in January 2024 compared to USD 978 million in January 2023. However, expenditure on merchandise imports went up by 6.2 to USD 1,512 million in January 2024 compared to USD 1,423 million in January 2023. The increase in expenditure on consumer goods and investment goods partly driven by the relaxation of import restrictions has contributed to this increase. The report also revealed that the gross official reserves (GOR) continued to improve to USD 4.5 billion by the end of January 2024. This included the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC), equivalent to around USD 1.4 billion, which is subject to conditionalities on usability. The increase in the GOR is attributed to the substantial net purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic market by the Central Bank. Overall, the Central Bank purchased USD 245 million, on net basis, during the month of January 2024.",

        "date": "March 2, 2024 08:24 am",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera has announced that the government-owned fertilizer companies will offer high-quality tea fertilizer to growers at a discounted rate compared to the market price. Additionally, he revealed that the Agri Tech-24 Agricultural Technology Vision exhibition will commence today (March 02) at the Agri-Tech Park in Bataatha, Hambantota, in conjunction with the 37th Asia-Pacific Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Addressing a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (March 01), the lawmaker elaborated that the current hot weather conditions prevailing across the island have led to an overflow of water springs. Considering this situation, farmers are urged to complete the cultivation of their entire paddy fields within a single day. Expanding on his thoughts, the minister further said: Furthermore, our aim is to integrate modern agricultural technology. We intend to implement innovative techniques such as the parachute method for planting seedlings. Farmer organizations bear a distinct responsibility in facilitating this transition. Additionally, we advocate for the utilization of Disk Plough and Mould Board Plough in ploughing operations. It is crucial to highlight that farmers who have already adopted these methods are effectively attaining their harvest objectives. Due to the declining availability of water, there has been a heightened focus on cultivating additional crops. Assistance is being offered to those involved in growing grains such as maize and green gram. Moreover, there has been a recent increase in the prices of fertilizers like T-200, T-750, U-709, U 834, and T 65, commonly used for tea cultivation. However, efforts have been made to mitigate this rise, with plans underway to further reduce these prices. Consequently, both government-owned companies, Commercial Fertilizer Company and Ceylon Fertilizer Company, have initiated measures to manufacture all required tea fertilizers. Our objective is to supply high-quality tea fertilizer manufactured by the two government-owned fertilizer companies to tea growers. This fertilizer is being offered to growers at a discounted rate, set at least Rs. 2000 below the market price. We believe that adhering to the governments plan of providing fertilizers at subsidized prices will significantly contribute to enhancing tea cultivation yields. Furthermore, we aim to introduce innovative cultivation technology to improve tea cultivation practices. Furthermore, 59 projects have been initiated under the high-density cultivation system, with 55 of these projects demonstrating notable success. These successful projects yield approximately 1350 kg of tea leaves per month from one acre of cultivation. This year, an estimated expenditure of around Rs. 1000 million anticipated for this initiative. Its worth noting that the implementation of such agricultural enhancement measures owes much to the visionary leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Without the merger of the Ministry of Plantation Industries with the Ministry of Agriculture, this program would not have come to fruition. Hence, it is imperative to express gratitude to the President for undertaking these commendable initiatives. In addition to that, the Agri Tech-24 Agricultural Technology Vision exhibition, coinciding with the 37th Asia Pacific Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is scheduled to commence tomorrow (02) at the Agricultural Technology Park in Bataatha, Hambantota. The event, carefully overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, will take place from March 02 - 05. --PMD",

        "date": "March 2, 2024 10:18 am",
        "content": "Flights at Port-au-Prince airport in Haitis capital have been disrupted for the second straight day by heavy gunfire nearby, as the Caribbean nation grapples with surging gang violence and political instability. The US Embassy in Haiti issued a security alert on Friday, warning of gunfire and disruptions to traffic near the domestic and international terminals of the Toussaint Louverture International Airport, as well as surrounding areas including a hotel and the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police. The US Embassy is temporarily halting travel of official US personnel to the airport and instructing any US personnel at the airport to remain there, the embassy said. It comes a day after shootings erupted across Haitis capital, forcing flight cancellations and killing at least four people during an attack on a police station. American Airlines said Thursday it had suspended its daily service between Miami and Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. We will continue to monitor the situation with safety and security top of mind and will adjust our operation as needed, spokesperson Laura Masvidal told CNN. Haitian airline Sunrise Airways told CNN that it suspended all flights until further notice to ensure the safety of passengers, ground crews, and aircraft. Rapid gunfire near the airport had caused damage to some aircraft and endangered users of the domestic terminal, according to Sunrise Airways. A US flight carrying dozens of Haitian deportees was also canceled, according to a source with knowledge of the operation and a lawyer for one of the deportees. Immigration lawyer Philip Issa told CNN on Friday that his client was removed and taken back to detention facilities after boarding the plane in Miami Thursday. Its baffling that weve continued to deport people to Haiti when the conditions are so dire, he said, while also complaining that US authorities had failed to provide food to the detainees or let them out since 4 p.m. the previous day. CNN has reached out to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment. Surging gang violence Haiti has been gripped by a wave of unrest and gang violence in recent years. Warring gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, choking off vital supply lines to the rest of the country. Gang members have also terrorized the metropolitan population, forcing some 200,000 people to flee their homes amid waves of indiscriminate killing, kidnapping, arson and rape. Some 1,100 people were killed, injured or kidnapped in January alone, in what the United Nations called the most violent month in two years. More than 8,400 people were victims of such violence through last year, according to a report from the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BIUH). Waves of crime and violence began to sweep across Haiti following the assassination of former President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Public frustration has mounted against Prime Minister Ariel Henry for his failure to put a lid on the unrest, especially after he failed to hold elections supposedly slated for last month, citing the escalating violence. On Wednesday, Henry told other Caribbean nations leaders during a regional summit that he would hold polls no later than August 31 next year, his first confirmation on when a vote will finally go ahead. Leaders from the CARICOM regional bloc - a political and economic grouping of 20 developing countries and mostly island states - said they agreed to dispatch a team to assess the electoral needs of Haiti. A powerful Haitian gang leader said gun fights that broke out across Port-au-Prince on Thursday were aimed at overthrowing Henrys government, multiple media outlets reported. Jimmy Cherizier, known as Barbecue, said in a video shared on social media that the battle will not only topple the Ariel Henry government, but change the whole system, according to international news agencies and Haitian media. CNN cannot independently verify the videos authenticity. An attack on Bon Repos Police Station, north of Port-au-Prince, on Thursday left at least four people dead and three wounded, a security source told CNN. Three other people were injured in separate attacks across the capital  one at the airport, a second near a prison in downtown Port-au-Prince, and a third inside the prison, the security source said. International support The fighting broke out as Henry is visiting Kenya to finalize details with Kenyan President William Ruto for the expected deployment of a multinational security support mission to Haiti. CNN has contacted the Haitian government for comment. The security mission, authorized by the UN, has been seen by the international community as key to containing the situation in Haiti. Kenya volunteered to serve as the lead nation in that mission. Officials from Kenya signed an agreement on Friday to send 1,000 police officers to Haiti as part of the security mission. From Kenya, we are ready for this deployment, and I request all the other partners across the globe to step up so that we can provide a response in good time, Ruto said on Friday. Henry thanked Kenya for agreeing to lead the mission, saying that after six months of fine-tuning it, finally, we sign. Its the last step. The signing of the deal is intended to satisfy a court ruling from Kenyas High Court, which delayed the deployment of troops in January after finding that a reciprocal agreement with Haiti was needed. The United States intended to contribute 200 million to the multinational security support mission to back the Haitian national police with planning, with intelligence, with airlift capacity, communications, and medical equipment and services, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.

        "content": "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa alleges that the decision taken by the government to temporarily halt the Parate Law is not being implemented properly. Thus, Premadasa mentioned that he intends to request the President to take actions to communicate the relevant decision to the banks. Commenting regarding the matter, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that even though the Parate Law has been temporarily suspended, banks have not been deprived of their right to expropriate the property. Earlier this week, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted a proposal made by the President to suspend all Parate Executions in a bid to protect small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs (SMEs) that were severely affected by the economic woes over the past 3 years. As per the Cabinets decision, the banks practice of acquiring properties of whose loans are yet to be paid off are suspended until 15 December 2024 and Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 will be amended to facilitate the necessary legal provisions.",

        "title": "Biden says US military to airdrop food and supplies into Gaza",
        "date": "March 2, 2024 01:15 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Friday plans to carry out a first military airdrop of food and supplies into Gaza, a day after the deaths of Palestinians queuing for aid threw a spotlight on an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in the crowded coastal enclave. Biden said the U.S. airdrop would take place in the coming days but offered no further specifics. Other countries, including Jordan and France, have already carried out airdrops of aid into Gaza. We need to do more and the United States will do more, Biden told reporters, adding that aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough. At the White House, spokesperson John Kirby stressed that airdrops would become a sustained effort. He added that the first airdrop would be likely be military MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. This isnt going to be one and done, Kirby said. Biden told reporters that the U.S. was also looking at the possibility of a maritime corridor to deliver large amounts of aid into Gaza. The airdrops could begin as early as this weekend, officials said. At least 576,000 people in the Gaza Strip - one quarter of the enclaves population - are one step away from famine, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Gaza health authorities said Israeli forces had killed more than 100 people trying to reach a relief convoy near Gaza City early on Thursday. Palestinians face an increasingly desperate situation nearly five months into the war that began with a Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Israel blamed most of the deaths on crowds that swarmed around aid trucks, saying victims had been trampled or run over. An Israeli official also said troops had in a limited response later fired on crowds they felt had posed a threat. With people eating animal feed and even cactuses to survive, and with medics saying children are dying in hospitals from malnutrition and dehydration, the U.N. has said it faces overwhelming obstacles getting in aid. While it is unclear which type of aircraft will be used, the C-17 and C-130 are best suited for the job. David Deptula, a retired U.S. Air Force three-star general who once commanded the no-fly zone over northern Iraq, said airdrops are something the U.S. military can effectively execute. It is something thats right up their mission alley, Deptula told Reuters. There are a lot of detailed challenges. But theres nothing insurmountable. The United States and others also expect aid would be boosted by a temporary ceasefire, which Biden said Friday he hoped would happen by the time of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which starts on March 10. ISRAEL AWARE OF AIRDROP Still, there have been questions about the effectiveness of air dropping aid into Gaza. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the airdrops would have only a limited impact on the suffering of those in Gaza. It doesnt deal with the root cause, the official said, adding that ultimately only opening up land borders could deal with the issue in a serious manner. Another issue, the official added, was that the U.S. could not ensure that the aid simply didnt end up in Hamas hands, given that the United States did not have troops on the ground. Humanitarian workers always complain that airdrops are good photo opportunities but a lousy way to deliver aid, Richard Gowan, the International Crisis Groups U.N. Director, said. Gowan said that the only way to get enough aid was through aid convoys which would follow a truce. It is arguable that the situation in Gaza is now so bad that any additional supplies will at least alleviate some suffering. But this at best a temporary band aid measure, Gowan added. Under pressure at home and abroad, another U.S. official said the Biden administration was looking at shipping aid by sea from Cyprus, some 210 nautical miles off Gazas Mediterranean coast. At the White House, Kirby acknowledged that the airdrops into Gaza were extremely difficult because of the dense population and ongoing conflict. The U.S. for months has been calling for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, something Israel has resisted. Kirby noted that Israel had tried to airdrop supplies into Gaza and it was supportive of the U.S. airdropping aid. We are aware of the humanitarian airdrop, said an Israeli official in Washington. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not reply to a question on whether the U.S. had sought Israeli agreement in advance on the air drops or was coordinating the effort with it. Bidens announcement of the fresh aid to Gaza was marred by gaffes as he twice confused it for Ukraine. The U.N. delivered aid to besieged northern Gaza for the first time in over a week on Friday, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The U.N. delivered medicines, vaccines and fuel to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The World Food Programme said 10 days ago that it was pausing deliveries of food aid to northern Gaza until conditions in the Palestinian enclave allow for safe distribution. The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said on Friday that during February an average of nearly 97 trucks were able to enter Gaza each day, compared with about 150 trucks a day in January, adding: The number of trucks entering Gaza remains well below the target of 500 per day.

        "title": "India has officially eliminated extreme poverty: US report",
        "date": "March 2, 2024 03:07 pm",
        "content": "India has now officially eliminated extreme poverty, which can be seen through the sharp decline in headcount poverty ratio and stark increase in household consumption, American think tank Brookings said in a report. The report, authored by Surjit Bhalla and Karan Bhasin, states that this has been a result of the governments strong policy thrust on redistribution, which has led to strong inclusive growth in India over the last decade. India has just released its official consumption expenditure data for 2022-23, providing the first official survey-based poverty estimates for India in over ten years. According to the data, real per capita consumption growth has been recorded at 2.9 per cent per year since 2011-12. Under this, rural growth at 3.1 per cent was significantly higher than urban growth of 2.6 per cent. The data also presented an unprecedented decline in both urban and rural inequality. The urban Gini (x100) (index to measure inequality) declined from 36.7 to 31.9; the rural Gini declined from 28.7 to 27.0. In the annals of inequality analysis, this decline is unheard of, and especially in the context of high per capita growth. According to Brookings, high growth and large decline in inequality have combined to eliminate poverty in India for the Purchasing Power Parity USD 1.9 poverty line. The Headcount Poverty Ratio (HCR) for the 2011 PPP USD 1.9 poverty line has declined from 12.2 per cent in 2011-12 to 2 per cent in 2022-23, equivalent to 0.93 percentage points (ppt) per year. Rural poverty stood at 2.5 per cent while urban poverty was down to 1 per cent. For the PPP USD 3.2 line, HCR declined from 53.6 per cent to 20.8 per cent. Notably, these estimates do not take into account the free food (wheat and rice) supplied by the government to approximately two-thirds of the population, nor utilization of public health and education, the think tank stated. The data show a strikingly lower number of poor people in India, at both thresholds, than those estimated by the World Bank. The Brookings report presented a chart showing Indias Headcount Poverty Ratio for both the 1.9 USD PPP and the 3.2 USD PPP from 1977-78. It stated that the change in slope of the HCR for the higher 3.2 USD poverty line reveals the extent of inclusive growth experienced in India over the last decade. The decline in HCR at the higher poverty line is remarkable given that in the past it took 30 years for India to witness a similar decline in poverty levels as now witnessed over 11 years, it added. The authors are of the opinion that the relatively higher consumption growth in rural areas should not come as a surprise given the strong policy thrust on redistribution through a wide variety of publicly funded programmes. Brookings lauded the national mission for the construction of toilets and attempts to ensure universal access to electricity, modern cooking fuel, and, more recently, piped water, among the policies that thrived consumption. The rural access to piped water in India as of August 15, 2019 was 16.8 per cent and at present it is 74.7 per cent, the report cited. The reduced sickness from accessing safe water may have helped families earn more income. Similarly, under the Aspirational District Programme, 112 districts in the country were identified as having the lowest development indicators. These districts were targeted by government policies with an explicit focus on improving their performance in development. Official data now confirms that India has eliminated extreme poverty, as commonly defined in international comparisons. This is an encouraging development with positive implications for global poverty headcount rates, the Brookings report stated. This also means that time has come for India to graduate to a higher poverty line much like other countries. The transition to a higher poverty line provides an opportunity to redefine existing social protection programs particularly with the objective of better identification of intended beneficiaries and providing greater support to the genuine poor, Bhalla and Bhasin added in the report.

        "content": "Sri Lanka is preparing to send hundreds of nurses to join hospitals in Saudi Arabia in 2024, the Ministry of Labor said on Friday. The first phase of the recruitment process took place in Colombo this week and was overseen by the Saudi Ministry of Health and Sri Lankas Labor and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara. Saudi Arabia is looking for medical and paramedical staff from countries such the Philippines, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka to meet the growing demand of this sector in the Kingdom, Sanjay Nallaperuma, media secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment, told Arab News. Initially, they want to recruit 1,000 nurses in a phased operation throughout the next 12 months. Ninety-five nurses were selected during the first phase out of 400 candidates. Those selected were qualified nurses and they had a Bachelor of Science degree, Nallaperuma said. The Saudi Ministry of Health will post them in government hospitals in all parts of the Kingdom. Similar to global trends, nurses make important contributions to the Saudi health sector as healthcare providers. As a result of the Kingdoms investments in health, nursing has become one of the most demanded professions. These 95 will go in May and the next recruitment (phase) is in August, Nallaperuma said. For Sri Lanka, their employment in the Kingdom, where the average nurse salary is 1,400, will contribute to the reeling economy. Every year, more than 200,000 migrant workers leave Sri Lanka to work abroad. They are a main source of foreign exchange for the country, which since 2022 has been gripped by its worst financial crisis. Gulf Cooperation Council countries are the preferred choice for Sri Lankan workers, with Saudi Arabia being their key destination. We will get foreign currency at a time when we are undergoing a period of economic recovery, Nallaperuma said. Its a great blessing from the Kingdom. Source: Arab News -Agencies",

        "title": "UN rights chief raises concerns over Sri Lankas regressive laws  authoritarian approaches",
        "date": "March 2, 2024 07:36 pm",
        "content": "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged the Sri Lankan government to undertake credible accountability measures to investigate and prosecute past and present human rights violations and economic crimes. Mr. Volker Türk made this remark while delivering updates on human rights in Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Cyprus and Sri Lanka at the 55th Session of the Human Rights Council. Türk said he remains deeply concerned about recurring, credible accounts received by my Office of abductions, unlawful detention and torture, including sexual violence, by the Sri Lankan police and security forces, some of which allegedly took place in 2023, mainly in the north and east of the country. He went on to raise concerns about the recent appointment of the new Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon, despite the Supreme Courts finding that he was implicated in the torture of an individual in 2010. Türk emphasized that the environment for a credible truth-seeking process remains absent regardless of the governments introduction of a draft legislation for a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation. My Office continues to receive allegations of surveillance, harassment and arrests by security forces of civil society representatives, journalists and victims, as well as of people who have been involved in organising commemoration events for war victims. These cases highlight the need for comprehensive security sector reforms, the UN Human Rights Chief pointed out. Commenting on the Online Safety Act, Anti-Terrorism Bill, Electronic Media Broadcasting Authority Bill, and the NGO Supervision and Registration Bill, Türk expressed concerns about the potentially far reaching impact of these laws on fundamental rights and freedoms, the rule of law and democratic governance. Noting that Sri Lanka cannot achieve sustainable peace and reconciliation with regressive laws and authoritarian approaches, which will only serve to perpetuate the human rights concerns of the past, the UN Human Rights Chief urged the authorities to reverse this trend immediately. He said Sri Lanka can achieve genuine reconciliation, sustainable peace and development only by addressing the root causes of the countrys conflict and economic crisis, and ensuring accountability. Read the UN Human Rights Chiefs full update on human rights in Sri Lanka below: Two years ago, tens of thousands of Sri Lankans took to the streets demanding deep democratic reforms and accountability for economic mismanagement and corruption, which resulted in the most severe socio-economic crisis in a generation. There was great hope that the country would embark upon a long overdue transformation that would benefit all its communities. While the Government has taken important steps to stabilize the economy, I am concerned by the introduction of new or proposed laws with potentially far-reaching impact on fundamental rights and freedoms, the rule of law and democratic governance. These include the Online Safety Act; the Anti-Terrorism Bill; the Electronic Media Broadcasting Authority Bill; and the NGO Supervision and Registration Bill  which variously strengthen the executive, grant broad powers to the security forces, and severely restrict rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, impacting not only on civic space but the business environment. Meanwhile, the disastrous consequences of Sri Lankas economic crisis continue to bite deeply, particularly for the most marginalised. Poverty rose further to an estimated 27.9 last year. Nearly two-thirds of households across the country have seen their monthly incomes decrease since March 2022, while food, transportation, health and education costs continue to rise. Despite the Governments efforts, social protection remains overstretched, and the governments largest budget expenditure this year will go towards servicing its debt. I appeal for Sri Lanka to be given the fiscal space and support by international financial institutions and creditors to uphold economic, social and cultural rights. This year, Sri Lanka marks 15 years since the end of a decades-long civil war. Yet violations of human rights remain unaddressed. Tens of thousands of families of the disappeared are still looking for their loved ones and face intimidation, arrests and violence in their search. Land disputes continue to escalate in the north and east of the country impacting on peoples livelihoods. Provincial Councils and local government bodies, that promised a measure of devolution, are not currently constituted. It is also almost five years since the devastating Easter Sunday bombings, and despite Supreme Court orders victims are still seeking truth and justice. While the Government has introduced a draft legislation for a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, the environment for a credible truth-seeking process remains absent. My Office continues to receive allegations of surveillance, harassment and arrests by security forces of civil society representatives, journalists and victims, as well as of people who have been involved in organising commemoration events for war victims. I remain deeply concerned about recurring, credible accounts received by my Office of abductions, unlawful detention and torture, including sexual violence, by the Sri Lankan police and security forces, some of which allegedly took place in 2023, mainly in the north and east of the country. Last week, the appointment of a new Inspector General of Police was confirmed, despite the Supreme Courts finding that he was responsible for torture of an individual in 2010. These cases highlight the need for comprehensive security sector reform. My Office continues to work to advance accountability in Sri Lanka. It is providing support to several jurisdictions undertaking criminal justice investigations, and is deepening its information and evidence base on specific incidents of human rights concern. It has also been carrying out research on enforced disappearance and conducting consultations with victims. Sustainable peace and reconciliation will not be achieved in Sri Lanka with regressive laws and authoritarian approaches, which will only serve to perpetuate the human rights concerns of the past. I urge the Government immediately to reverse this trend and undertake credible accountability measures to investigate and prosecute past and present human rights violations and economic crimes. I also urge Member States to continue to reinforce these efforts, including through appropriate use of universal and extra-territorial jurisdiction and targeted measures against credibly-alleged perpetrators of serious human rights violations and abuses. It is only through addressing the root causes of the countrys conflict and economic crisis, and ensuring accountability, that Sri Lanka will be able to enhance its prospects of achieving genuine reconciliation and sustainable peace and development.

        "date": "March 3, 2024 08:34 am",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is seeking a five-month hold on a lawsuit filed by a bondholder over the countrys historic debt default, telling a New York federal judge that it wants more time to negotiate with private creditors. The island nation was sued in July 2022 by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd., which sought full payment on more than 250 million of Sri Lankas dollar bond that was due that month. The bank says it holds more than 25 of the bonds, which would likely enable it to block any modification of the notes. On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank in the dark about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information. The island nation is prioritizing restructuring obligations to its private creditors as it seeks to fast-track a debt overhaul and exit a sovereign default, the foreign minister told Bloomberg last month. The case is Hamilton Reserve Bank v. Sri Lanka, 22-cv-5199, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "date": "March 3, 2024 11:44 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed relevant officials to develop a national program integrating public and private sectors for successful agriculture modernization initiative. The President highlighted that despite annual budget allocations at national, provincial and local levels, the separate operations of public and private institutions have led to delays in achieving desired outcomes. He underscored the importance of garnering support from both public and private agricultural research institutes, along with the university system, to address the challenges encountered in implementing this program. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed these sentiments during the progress review meeting of the Agriculture Modernization Program, convened at the Presidential Secretariat recently. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also emphasized the necessity of formulating a national program that aligns with government policies and can be effectively implemented at the grass-root level. Furthermore, he instructed the relevant officials to initiate the 26 related projects promptly. The President elaborated that addressing this challenge requires a collaborative effort involving both the public and private sectors, as well as small and medium-scale agricultural entrepreneurs. The President reiterated his ultimate intention to establish an agricultural export economy. Senior Professor Gamini Senanayake briefed the President on the progress of the Agriculture Modernization Project, emphasizing that its implementation should elevate agriculture to a commercial level, safeguard agro-biodiversity and promote land ownership among individuals involved in agricultural activities. He expressed the expectation of establishing a Cabinet Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of the President to address various obstacles and limitations arising in the implementation of the agriculture modernization program. Senior Professor Gamini Senanayake, noting the commencement of pilot projects in 26 Divisional Secretariats across all 25 districts, mentioned that each Divisional Secretariat has been allocated LKR 25 million for agricultural modernization projects. Furthermore, he highlighted that project proposals have already been received from all the selected divisional secretariats. Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff, Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs, Dr. R.H.S.

        "title": "US says Israel has agreed to the framework for a Gaza cease-fire, Hamas must now decide",
        "date": "March 3, 2024 11:50 am",
        "content": "Israel has essentially endorsed a framework of a proposed Gaza cease-fire and hostage release deal, and it is now up to Hamas to agree to it, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday, a day before talks to reach an agreement were to resume in Egypt. International mediators have been working for weeks to broker a deal to pause the fighting before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10. A deal would likely allow aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza who aid officials worry are under threat of famine. The Israelis have more or less accepted the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official. Right now, the ball is in the court of Hamas and we are continuing to push this as hard as we possibly can, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House to brief reporters. Officials from Israel and from Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior Egyptian official said mediators Egypt and Qatar are expected to receive a response from Hamas during the Cairo talks scheduled to start Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not publicly authorized to discuss the talks. There is increasing criticism over the hundreds of thousands struggling to survive in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of the conflict that began when the Hamas militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 hostages. U.S. military planes began the first airdrops of thousands of meals into Gaza, and the militaries of Jordan and Egypt said they also conducted airdrops. Aid groups say airdrops should be only a last resort and instead urge the opening of other crossings into Gaza and the removal of obstacles at the few that are open. The European Unions diplomatic service said many of the hundreds of Palestinians killed or wounded in the chaos surrounding an aid convoy on Thursday were hit by Israeli army fire and urged an international investigation. It said responsibility for the crisis lay with restrictions imposed by the Israeli army and obstructions by violent extremist(s) to the supply of humanitarian aid. Gazas Health Ministry raised the death toll from Thursdays violence to 118 after two more bodies were recovered Saturday. It said the wounded remained at 760. Israels chief military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel organized Thursdays convoy, and claims that we attacked the convoy intentionally and that we harmed people intentionally are baseless. Residents in northern Gaza say they are searching rubble and garbage for anything to feed their children, who barely eat one meal a day. Many families have begun mixing animal and bird food with grain to bake bread. At least 10 children have starved to death, according to hospital records in Gaza, the World Health Organization said. Gazas Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war has climbed to 30,320. The ministry doesnt differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. In the southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of Gazas people now seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike struck tents outside the Emirati hospital, killing 11 people and wounding about 50, including health workers, the Health Ministry said. Israels military said it was targeting Islamic Jihad militants. Israels air, sea and ground offensive has reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained. Roughly one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world, Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza. People have overwhelmed trucks and grabbed what they can, Skau said, forcing the WFP to suspend deliveries to the north. In the violence Thursday, people rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled. Doctors at hospitals in Gaza and a U.N. team that visited a hospital said large numbers of the wounded had been shot. Ahmed Abdel Karim, being treated for gunshot wounds in his feet, said he had spent two days waiting for aid trucks to arrive. Everyone attacked and advanced on these trucks. Because of the large number, I could not get flour, he said. Radwan Abdel-Hai, a father of four young children, heard a rumor late Wednesday that an aid convoy was on its way. He and five others took a donkey cart and found a sea of people waiting. Tanks started firing at us, he said. As I ran back, I heard tank shells and gunfire. I heard people screaming. I saw people falling to the ground, some motionless. Many were shot in the back, he said. Soad Abu Hussein, a widow and mother of five, said more than 5,000 people  mostly women and children  living with her in a school at the Jabaliya refugee camp have not received aid for more than four weeks. A group of people went to the shore to fish, but three were killed and two were wounded by gunfire from Israeli ships, she said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mansour Hamed, a 32-year-old former aid worker living with more than 50 relatives in a Gaza City house, said some are eating tree leaves and animal food. It has become normal to find a child emerging from the rubble with a rotten piece of bread, he said. Acknowledging the extreme need for food, U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would look for other ways of delivery including possibly a marine corridor. Also Saturday, Israel said three soldiers were killed and 14 injured Friday when they inadvertently triggered explosives in a booby-trapped building outside Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

        "date": "March 3, 2024 03:30 pm",
        "content": "Sharif, 72, won a parliamentary vote for premier, resuming the role he had held until August when parliament was dissolved ahead of last months elections. Pakistan has had a caretaker government since then. Shehbaz Sharif, returning as Pakistans prime minister for a second time on Sunday when his brother declined a fourth term, has played a crucial role holding together a disparate coalition for 16 months after rival Imran Khan was ousted. Sharif, 72, won a parliamentary vote for premier, resuming the role he had held until August when parliament was dissolved ahead of last months elections. Pakistan has had a caretaker government since then. He was named by his party and coalition allies to head the South Asian nation, despite his elder brother Nawaz Sharif winning a seat in the assembly and being favourite to be sworn in again. Nawaz Sharif did not want to run a minority coalition government, having had clear majorities in his three previous stints as prime minister, his daughter Maryam said in a post on X. The brothers Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party won only 80 of the 264 seats up for contest in the elections but was supported by other parties for a majority. In addition to holding the coalition together after Khan was voted out in 2022, Shehbaz Sharif helped Pakistan secure a last-gasp International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout last year. He regained the top job as the PML-N buried differences with the powerful military in the face of their common rival, Khan, who was at odds with top generals over policy differences. At the time, Nawaz Sharif was in self-imposed exile in London and disqualified from holding public office. He returned to Pakistan in October. Before his stint as prime minister, the younger Sharif was known more as an administrator than a politician, having served as chief minister thrice in the countrys largest province, Punjab. But as prime minister, he quickly took on the role of peacemaker between coalition parties often at odds with one another over key policies. Shehbaz Sharifs biggest achievement in his short tenure was clinching the IMF bailout with Pakistan on the brink of a debt default. The deal was signed after Sharif personally called on IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva in June. However, under his government, inflation touched a high of 38 with record depreciation of the rupee currency - mainly due to structural reforms necessitated by the IMF programme to stabilise the economy. He blames the economic meltdown on Khans government, which he says broke an agreement with IMF just before he was ousted. Sharif said his government had to introduce a slew of reforms and scrap subsidies, causing inflation to surge. KEY CHALLENGES Pakistan continues to be enmeshed in economic crisis with inflation remaining high, hovering around 30, and economic growth slowing to around 2. February inflation dipped slightly to 23.1 from a year earlier, in part due to a high base effect. Sharif will need to emulate his feat of securing a short-term IMF bailout with the current programme expiring next month and a new extended deal needed to keep Pakistan on a narrow path to recovery. But his main role will be to maintain ties with the military, which has directly or indirectly dominated Pakistan since independence. Unlike his elder brother, who has had a rocky relationship with the military in all his three terms, the younger Sharif is considered more acceptable and compliant by the generals, analysts say. For several years, the military has denied it interferes in politics. But it has in the past directly intervened to topple civilian governments three times, and no prime minister has finished a full five-year term since independence in 1947. Privatising some lumbering state giants, including the national airline, and securing foreign investment will also be key to ease the economic crisis. The Sharis have close ties with rulers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which could help in securing investments in several projects Pakistan has lately showcased for sale. Although defence and key foreign policy decisions are largely influenced by the military, Sharif will have to juggle relations with the U.S. and China, both major allies. He is also faced with dealing with fraying ties with three of Pakistans four neighbours, India, Iran and Afghanistan. WORKAHOLIC Sharif was born in the eastern city of Lahore in a wealthy Kashmiri-origin family that was in the steel business. He started his political career as the chief minister of Punjab in 1997 with a signature can-do administrative style. His cabinet members and bureaucrats who have worked closely with him call him a workaholic. As chief minister, the younger Sharif planned and executed a number of ambitious infrastructure mega-projects, including Pakistans first modern mass transport system in Lahore. He was caught up in the national political upheaval when his brother was ousted from the premiership by a military coup in 1999 and he went into exile in Saudi Arabia. Sharif entered the national political scene when he became the chief of the PML-N after the elder Sharif was found guilty in 2017 on charges of concealing assets related to the Panama Papers revelations. Married twice, Shehbaz Sharif has two sons and two daughters from his first marriage but none from the second. One of the sons is in politics but the others are not in public life. His second wife is Tehmina Durrani, the well-known author of My Feudal Lord, an autobiography about an abusive married life with an earlier husband. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "March 3, 2024 09:11 pm",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan State Minister on Sunday (03 March) said the countrys external sector performance has seen a marked improvement year on year, with tourism fetching 342 million in January 2024, an impressive 122 jump from last year. Speaking in Ruwanwella, his home constituency, Minister of State for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was delving into the Central Bank of Sri Lankas external sector indicators issued mid-week. Siyambalapitiya said the bank figures show that receipts from tourism had fetched 342 million, which is a 122 growth in January 2024 year-on-year. The inward remittances from Sri Lankan expats in January 2024 had grown by 5 to 488 million up from 467 million in January 2023. The Sri Lankan rupee, which had seen a massive slump during the unprecedented economic crisis, had appreciated by 14.6 in January of this year. The foreign reserves had increased to 4.5 billion in January, up 114 from 2.1 billion in January 2023. The economy recorded positive growth in the third quarter of 2023 after six successive quarters of negative growth, Siyambalapitiya said. Sri Lanka, in the second quarter of 2022, had declared bankruptcy, announcing the islands first-ever sovereign default. Negotiations with the IMF for a bailout began almost immediately and the first tranche of the 2.9 billion facility was released in March 2023. The finance ministry officials said the IMF officials are due this week to carry out its second review, after which the third tranche of the facility could be released by around June. The IMF-dictated reforms have proved to be unpopular, with the government resorting to hard economic measures such as high taxes, cost-recovery tariffs for utilities and a programme to sell loss-making state-owned enterprises. The opposition had vowed to renegotiate the IMF bailout to grant economic relief to the public hit by the economic crisis. By the end of the year, the presidential election is due to take place.

        "title": "Hundreds of inmates flee after armed gangs storm Haitis main prison, leaving bodies behind",
        "date": "March 4, 2024 07:55 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Hundreds of inmates fled Haitis main prison after armed gangs stormed the facility in an overnight explosion of violence that engulfed much of the capital. At least five people were dead Sunday. The jailbreak marked a new low in Haitis downward spiral of violence and came as gangs step up coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, while embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry is abroad trying to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to stabilize the country. Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance, which was wide open, with no guards in sight. Plastic sandals, clothing and electric fans were strewn across normally overcrowded concrete patios. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs laid face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires. Authorities had yet to provide an account of what happened. But Arnel Remy, a human rights attorney whose nonprofit works inside the prison, said on X, formerly Twitter, that fewer than 100 of the nearly 4,000 inmates remained behind bars. Those choosing to stay included 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. On Saturday night, several of the Colombians shared a video pleading for their lives. Please, please help us, one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in the message widely shared on social media. They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells. On Sunday, Uribe told The Associated Press I didnt flee because Im innocent. In the absence of official information, inmates family members rushed to the prison to check on loved ones. I dont know whether my son is alive or not, said Alexandre Jean as she roamed around the cells looking for any sign of him. I dont know what to do. The violence Saturday night appeared to be widespread, with several neighborhoods reporting gunfire. There were reports of a jailbreak at a second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates. Armed gangs also occupied and vandalized the nations top soccer stadium, taking one employee hostage for hours, the nations soccer federation said in a statement. Internet service for many residents was down as Haitis top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage. In the space of less than two weeks, several state institutions have been attacked by the gangs, who are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. After gangs opened fire at Haitis international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was temporarily halting all official travel to the country. As part of coordinated attacks by gangs, four police officers were killed Thursday. The epicenter of the latest violence Saturday night was Haitis National Penitentiary, which is holding several gang leaders. Amid the exchange of gunfire, police appealed for assistance. They need help, a union representing police said in a message on social media bearing an SOS emoji repeated eight times. Lets mobilize the army and the police to prevent the bandits from breaking into the prison. The clashes follow violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya to try and salvage a proposed U.N.-backed security mission in Haiti to be led by the East African country. Henry took over as prime minister following Moises assassination and has repeatedly postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which havent happened in almost a decade. Haitis National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned by gangs, which are estimated to control up to 80 of Port-au-Prince. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal was to capture Haitis police chief and government ministers and prevent Henrys return. The prime minister, a neurosurgeon, has shrugged off calls for his resignation and didnt comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home. ___ Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) stated that although the fuel price was slated to be revised at the end of February, the price revision will possibly take place today. The CPC amends the fuel prices monthly as per the pricing formula. Accordingly, the prices were last revised on January 31, where the prices of octane 92 petrol, octane 95 petrol, super diesel and kerosene were increased. Against this backdrop, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued an Extraordinary Gazette declaring all services connected to the supply of electricity and the supply or distribution of petroleum products and fuel as essential services with effect from 03 March 2024.

        "content": "The officials of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) have been summoned to the Cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Tuesday (March 05). There, the CBSL officials will be inquired about the process and rationale behind the recent salary hike given to its employees, with no notice to any responsible parties. Recent media reports revealed that the CBSL had increased the salaries of its employees by 70 and the move was heavily criticized by parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition. Earlier this week, the CBSL requested the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, for an opportunity to apprise the Members of Parliament, through an appropriate Parliamentary Committee, of the recent salary increment which came under fire. The request was made in writing by CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. Issuing a release in this regard, the CBSL had explained that the latest revision of remuneration of its employees had been approved by the Governing Board under the triennial Collective Agreement entered into with the Trade Unions covering the period 2024 - 2026. In light of the situation, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe suggested that CBSL officials be summoned before the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), for clarifications pertaining to the matter. Thus, the relevant officials have also been summoned to the party leaders meeting and the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) which are scheduled to be held tomorrow (05).",

        "title": "Indian companies eye critical minerals mining in Sri Lanka",
        "date": "March 4, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "Indias Ministry of Mines hosted two meetings with industry stakeholders in January to discuss opportunities for the mining of critical minerals by Indian companies in Sri Lanka and Australia. These meetings were organised in line with the ministrys broader push to strengthen Indias critical minerals supply chain through the acquisition of overseas mineral assets. The ministry met with representatives from companies including Ola Electric, Hindalco Industries, and Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation to discuss the prospects of graphite mining in Sri Lanka on January 5. Three days later, it organised a luncheon meeting to explore avenues for mining opportunities in Australia, which was attended by the Indian High Commissioner-designate to Australia, Gopal Bagley, and various industry representatives from companies including Coal India, Steel Authority of India, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Adani Group, and JSW Steel. Sri Lanka holds significant reserves of vein graphite, a highly pure form of natural graphite that is only found on the island nation. Graphite is a critical mineral that is extensively used as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries. By weight, graphite is typically the largest component in lithium-ion batteries, with up to 70 kilograms of graphite used in an average electric vehicle (EV). Graphites vital application in EVs explains the participation of Ola Electric in the ministry meeting. Ola has previously shown interest in entering the critical minerals supply chain by participating in the ministrys ongoing first tranche of critical minerals auction. It had also attended a ministry meeting in October on opportunities in Zambia for the mining of copper, which is used as the cathode material in EV batteries. Indias interest in Sri Lankas graphite coincides with the Sri Lankan governments active pursuit of Indian companies for graphite mining in the country. We have the best graphite in the world. Now, Indian companies will be manufacturing electric vehicles. One of the large components for electric batteries is graphite. We used to have about 30,000 graphite mines. So theres a lot of opportunity with the expertise and the technology these Indian companies have, I think they should seriously look at Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said in an interview to ANI on February 22. Graphite mining in Sri Lanka peaked during the two World Wars in the 20th century, hitting over 30,000 tonnes in annual exports. In 2023, however, the country only exported graphite weighing around 2,500 tonnes and valuing roughly 6 million. Sri Lanka has graphite reserves of around 1.3 million tonnes, as per data with the US Geological Survey. Graphite in India is largely concentrated in Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu  Kashmir, and Jharkhand, with these three states collectively accounting for 74 per cent of Indias graphite resources. However, only Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, and Odisha have graphite reserves, which are measured resources that are economically viable to extract. In FY22, India produced 57,264 tonnes of graphite and imported 54,052 tonnes from countries like China, Madagascar, and Mozambique. As per the National Mineral Inventory, India has graphite reserves of 8.56 million tonnes. In the mines ministrys second tranche of critical minerals auction, which was announced on February 29, 6 out of 18 blocks up for auction contain graphite, with 3 blocks each in Arunachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The meeting on mining opportunities in Australia followed a meeting between V L Kantha Rao, the mines secretary, and Philip Green, the Australian High Commissioner to India, on December 12. Australia produces almost half of the worlds lithium and is the second-largest producer of cobalt. Both lithium and cobalt are used in EVs and consumer electronics. In March, 2022, Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL), a joint venture company formed by the mines ministry, and Australias Critical Minerals Office (CMO) signed an MoU to jointly fund mineral explorations and support potential investments by Indian companies in critical minerals projects in Australia. In March, 2023, KABIL and the CMO identified 2 lithium and 3 cobalt target projects for due diligence studies, which are currently under progress. The Indian Express had previously reported that the mines ministry plans to support central PSUs like Coal India, NTPC, and Steel Authority of India in the acquisition of critical mineral assets overseas by sharing proposals received through partner countries in the US-led Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), of which Australia is also a part. PM Prasad, the chairperson of Coal India, representatives of which were present in the luncheon meeting in January, shared that a company team has visited mining sites in Australia and that talks are in the preliminary stage only, in the Q3FY24 earnings call.

        "content": "Three top-order batters from India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand have made the shortlist for the ICC Mens Player of the Month Award for February 2024. Pathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka) Pathum Nissanka is a top contender for the ICC Mens Player of the Month for February 2024 after he slammed the first ever double century in ODIs by a Sri Lankan. The 25-year-old blasted 210 off just 139 balls against Afghanistan in Pallekele and then went on to end the series with another terrific hundred (118 off 101 balls). Nissanka beat Sanath Jayasuriyas 24-year-old record for the highest score by a Sri Lankan in ODIs. Jayasuriya had scored 189 against India in Sharjah in 2000. In the last 18 overs, Nissanka slammed 110 runs. He took merely 48 balls to reach his double ton after crossing his century, smashing 20 fours and eight sixes. Nissanka carried the form into the T20Is, smashing 25 off 11 to give a riveting start in the second T20I against Afghanistan and then hit 60 off just 30 balls to kickstart a run-chase of 210. However, he retired hurt with the score on 832 and Sri Lanka ended up losing by three runs. Kane Williamson (New Zealand) Kane Williamson played a pivotal role in New Zealands first-ever Test series victory over South Africa. The New Zealand veteran slammed two hundreds in the first Test in Mount Maunganui, and then made 133 to help his team chase down a tricky fourth-innings target in Hamilton to ensure the series victory. This was Williamsons first instance of scoring two hundreds in a Test match. The impactful series he had ensured that New Zealand would climb up the ICC World Test Championship table, finishing in second position at the end of February with three wins in five Tests. It was in Hamilton, though, that Williamson reserved his best for with the team in trouble. Chasing 267, Williamson walked in at No.3 and struck a 133, laced with 12 fours and two sixes to guide the Black Caps to a whitewash 2-0 series victory. The chase orchestrated by Williamson was the fourth-highest successful chase in New Zealand by the Black Caps and the fifth-highest overall. Williamson also notched his 32nd Test ton, now the highest among active players. He also claimed the title of the quickest to 32 Test centuries by innings, bettering Steve Smith who accomplished the feat in 174 innings. Yashasvi Jaiswal (India) With back-to-back double centuries in the month, Yashasvi Jaiswal is a strong contender for the ICC Mens Player of the Month for February 2024. Jaiswal was in top form against England, slamming 2019 in Vizag in the first innings of the second Test and then going on to make a second innings double century in the next Test in Rajkot to help India take a lead in the series. Jaiswals knocks helped India fight back from a loss in the first Test of the series. The left-handed opener also rose to the top of the leading run-scorer list in the ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 cycle. Jaiswal created several records in February, and equalled the long-standing Test record for most sixes in a Test innings (12) during his Rajkot knock. The back-to-back double hundreds at the age of 22 years and 49 days made him the third youngest batter in the world to record two double centuries in Tests after Sir Donald Bradman and Vinod Kambli. Jaiswal ended February with astounding numbers in the three Tests he featured in  560 runs at an average of 112 including 20 sixes. --ICC--",

        "date": "March 4, 2024 04:59 pm",
        "content": "A Thai court on Monday acquitted former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, now living in exile, on charges of mishandling funds for a government project in 2013, the latest legal victory for the powerful family of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra. The action comes shortly after Thaksin, Yinglucks brother, was released on parole for corruption-related offenses. Last year, he returned home after more than a decade of self-imposed exile, and was detained in a hospital for six months before being granted clemency because of his age and ill health. Thaksins release, after almost two decades of antipathy between his populist political machine and Thailands conservative royalist ruling class, raised speculation that Yingluck also might be returning soon. It was the latest favorable verdict for Yingluck, who was prime minister from 2011 until she was forced from office in 2014. In December last year, the same court cleared Yingluck of abuse of power in connection with a personnel transfer she had overseen. But to return to Thailand without facing prison, she would also need a pardon from King Maha Vajiralongkorn or other form of clemency. In 2017 she was sentenced in absentia for alleged negligence in implementing a rice subsidy program that lost the government a massive amount of money, estimated to be as much as 500 billion baht (14 billion). Yingluck and her supporters said she is innocent and being persecuted in an effort to dismantle Thaksins political machine. He was toppled from power by a military coup in 2006, after being accused of abuse of power, corruption and disrespect for the countrys monarchy. The Thaksin-backed Pheu Thai Party came to power last year after a general election in coalition with military parties connected to the coups that twice removed the family from power, and Thaksins daughter Paetongtran has since become the partys leader and a prospective future prime minister. The judges unanimously acquitted Yingluck and five other defendants accused of mishandling 240 million baht (6.7 million) that had been earmarked for a roadshow to tout investors on an ambitious infrastructure plan, according to a press release from a special body under a division of the Supreme Court that handles criminal cases against political officeholders. Yingluck, now 56, was the first female prime minister of Thailand. His supporters, who delivered him unprecedented electoral victories, believe his only offense was challenging the power of the countrys traditional elite, led by monarchists and the military and supported by the urban middle class. His release appeared to reflect a reconciliation with his enemies in Thailands conservative elite, who had believed his brash populist politics and electoral popularity posed a threat to the monarchy. Parties supported by Thaksin continued to reign at the polls after his ouster. However, last year, Pheu Thai managed just a close second-place election finish to the more progressive Move Forward party, whose proposals for reform of the army and the monarchy alarmed the royalist conservative establishment more than a return of Pheu Thai, which had softened its anti-military line and was anxious to get back into power. Thaksin also remains in legal jeopardy despite his release. The Office of the Attorney General says it is still investigating a charge of royal defamation that was made against Thaksin almost nine years ago. He could face up to 15 years in prison if he is ever convicted. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Electricity tariffs to be reduced from midnight today",
        "date": "March 4, 2024 05:54 pm",
        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has approved the revision of electricity tariffs with effect from midnight today (04). The overall tariff reduction is 21.9 percent, the PUCSL said. PUCSL chairman Prof. Manjula Fernando annoucend this during a press briefing held in Colombo today (04) to deliver its decision on the electricity tariff reduction proposal mooted recently by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). He said the final decision was reached after studying and reviewed the proposals and cost data submitted by the CEB in this tariff revision, in accordance with the provisions of Section 30 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 and the provisions of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. The CEB had proposed to reduce tariffs by 3.4 percent last January and then by 16 percent in a revised proposal presented on February 22. The commission said it decided to reduce the electricity tariffs by 21.9 percent, considering suggestions made during the public consultation and reviews that carried out by the PUCSL of the cost data submitted by the CEB. According to this tariff revision which will be effective from midnight today, maximum relief has been provided to all consumer categories. Tariffs have been reduced by 33 percent for consumers who consume less than 30 units of electricity in the domestic sector, he said. Accordingly, the bills of electricity consumers with monthly consumption between 61 and 90 units will be reduced by 30 percent. Those who belong to the category between more than 90 units and less than 180 units will get a 24 percent reduction while 18 percent reduction is given for those who belong to the category of more than 180 units. The PUCSL has decided to reduce the tariffs by 33 percent for religious places. The tariff for the general-purpose consumer category will be reduced by 23 percent and by 22 percent for government institutions. Also, the tariffs have been reduced by 18 percent for hotel and industry sectors and by 20 percent for street lamps. According to the new tariff revision, the monthly fixed charge of consumers who use less than 30 units will be reduced from 180 to 150 rupees. The unit price they pay has been reduced from Rs 12 to Rs 8. The monthly charged of Rs. 360 has been reduced to Rs. 300 for the consumers who are between 31 and 60 units, and the unit price for that category has been reduced from 30 to 20 rupees. The manner in which the monthly fee and unit fee have been reduced for domestic categories is given below: Domestic Sector Customer Category Current Unit Price Approved New Unit Price Current Monthly Charge Approved New Monthly Charge less than 30 units 12 8 180 150 between 31-60 units 30 20 360 300 Categories over 60 units First 60 units 38 25 Units Above 60 and below 90 41 30 480 400 More than 90 units Less than 120 units 59 50 1,180 1,000 Above 120 units Below 180 units 59 50 1,770 1,500 More than 180 units 89 75 2,360 2,000 The condition has also been imposed on CEB to pay the due payments and arrears of interest to owners of renewable power plants, including roof-mounted solar power plants, before the 31st of this month. The PUCSL has also imposed conditions on the CEB to prepare plans to achieve the target renewable electricity generation by 2030 and submit them before June 30. Along with the implementation of this tariff revision, the PUCSL has also imposed 13 other conditions to be implemented by the CEB.",

        "title": "Trump wins Colorado ballot disqualification case at US Supreme Court",
        "date": "March 4, 2024 10:14 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a major victory on Monday, barring states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection and reversing Colorados exclusion of him from its ballot. The justices unanimously overturned a Dec. 19 decision by Colorados top court to kick the former president off the states Tuesday Republican primary ballot after finding that the U.S. Constitutions 14th Amendment disqualified him from again holding public office. The Colorado court had found that Trump took part in an insurrection for inciting and supporting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. But four of the nine justices, including the courts three liberal members, faulted the rest of the court for announcing rules limiting how the constitutional provision may be enforced in the future. Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. His only remaining rival for his partys nomination is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The ruling was issued on the eve of Super Tuesday, the day in the U.S. presidential primary cycle when the most states hold party nominating contests. The Supreme Courts decision came five days after it agreed to decide Trumps claim of immunity from prosecution on charges related to trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. The court acted in a speedier manner in deciding the ballot disqualification issue, benefiting Trump, than it has in resolving the immunity question. Delays in deciding the immunity issue could help Trump by delaying his criminal trial. The 14th Amendments Section 3 bars from office any officer of the United States who took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. We conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency, the unsigned opinion for the court stated. The justices found that only Congress can enforce the provision against federal officeholders and candidates. BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!, Trump wrote on his social media platform immediately after the ruling. Trump was also barred from the ballot in Maine and Illinois based on the 14th Amendment, but those decisions were put on hold pending the Supreme Courts ruling in the Colorado case. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold expressed disappointment at the ruling stripping states of the authority to enforce the disqualification clause. Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot, she wrote in a social media post. MOMENTOUS AND DIFFICULT ISSUES Though the justices unanimously agreed with the result, the three liberal justices, as well as conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, said the courts opinion decided more than what was necessary to resolve the case by specifying that Section 3 can be enforced only through federal legislation. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson objected to the majoritys gratuitous decision to announce rules limiting the way Section 3 can be enforced in the future. Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oath-breaking insurrectionist from becoming president, the liberal justices said. Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majoritys effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision. In a concurring opinion, Barrett wrote that this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency. The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up, Barrett wrote. For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home, Barrett added. Trumps eligibility had been challenged in court by a group of six voters in Colorado - four Republicans and two independents - who portrayed him as a threat to American democracy and sought to hold him accountable for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. The plaintiffs were backed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. CREW President Noah Bookbinder emphasized that while the courts ruling allows Trump back on the ballot, it did not directly address the Colorado Supreme Courts finding that Trump had engaged in insurrection. The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so, Bookbinder said, adding that, The Supreme Court removed an enforcement mechanism, and in letting Trump back on the ballot, they failed to meet the moment. As lawsuits seeking to disqualify Trump cropped up across the country, it was important for his candidacy to clear any hurdles to appear on the ballot in all 50 states. The Supreme Courts 6-3 conservative majority includes three Trump appointees. Not since ruling in the landmark case Bush v. Gore, which handed the disputed 2000 U.S. election to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore, has the court played such a central role in a presidential race. The justices in the immunity case in December declined a bid to speed up resolution of the matter before a lower court had weighed in, then last week agreed to take up the matter after lower courts had ruled - setting arguments to take place in late April, a much longer timeline. CAPITOL ATTACK In a bid to prevent Congress from certifying Bidens 2020 election victory, Trump supporters attacked police, broke through barricades and swarmed the Capitol. Trump gave an incendiary speech to supporters beforehand, repeating his false claims of widespread voting fraud and telling them to go to the Capitol and fight like hell. He then for hours rebuffed requests that he urge the mob to stop. The 14th Amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 in which seceding Southern states that allowed the practice of slavery rebelled against the U.S. government. In ruling against Trump, Colorados top court cited the general atmosphere of political violence that President Trump created and that he aided the insurrectionists common unlawful purpose of preventing the peaceful transfer of power in this country. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Feb. 8. Trumps lawyer argued that he is not subject to the disqualification language because a president is not an officer of the United States, that the provision cannot be enforced by courts absent congressional legislation, and that what occurred on Jan. 6 was shameful, criminal and violent but not an insurrection.

        "title": "France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right",
        "date": "March 5, 2024 09:04 am",
        "content": "French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in Frances constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a womans right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of Frances parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers. The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975. Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as womens rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022. The U.S. decision has reverberated across Europes political landscape, forcing the issue back into public debate in some countries at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence. Both houses of Frances parliament, the National Assembly and Senate, had separately adopted a bill to amend Article 34 of the French Constitution, but the amendment needed final confirmation by a three-fifths majority in the special joint session. The measure specifies that the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed. The French measure is seen as going a step further than was the case in the former Yugoslavia, whose 1974 constitution said that a person is free to decide on having children. Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s, and all its successor states have adopted similar measures in their constitutions that legally enable women to have an abortion, though they do not explicitly guarantee it. In the lead-up to the vote, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal addressed the more than 900 lawmakers gathered for the joint session in Versailles, and called on them to make France a leader in womens rights and set an example for countries around the world. We have a moral debt to women, Attal said. He paid tribute to Simone Veil, a prominent legislator, former health minister and key feminist who in 1975 championed the bill that decriminalized abortion in France. We have a chance to change history, Attal said in a moving and determined speech. Make Simone Veil proud, he said to a standing ovation. None of Frances major political parties have questioned the right to abortion, including Marine Le Pens far-right National Rally party and the conservative Republicans. Le Pen, who won a record number of seats in the National Assembly two years ago, said on Monday that her party planned to vote in favor of the bill but added that there is no need to make this a historic day. A recent poll showed support for abortion rights among the French public at more than 80, consistent with previous surveys. The same poll also showed that a solid majority of people are in favor of enshrining it in the constitution. A group of about 200 anti-abortion protesters gathered soberly in Versailles ahead of the vote, some holding a banner reading: I too was an embryo. A larger crowd of womens rights activists gathered at Trocadero Plaza overlooking the Eiffel Tower, letting out a collective cry of joy as the vote results came in. Others celebrated around France even before the joint parliamentary session began. Sarah Durocher, a leader in the Family Planning movement, said Mondays vote is a victory for feminists and a defeat for the anti-choice activists. We increased the level of protection to this fundamental right, said Anne-Cécile Mailfert of the Womens Foundation. Its a guarantee for women today and in the future to have the right to abort in France. The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it. Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: In many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish, the introduction to the French legislation says. It may not be an issue in France, where a majority of people support abortion, said Mathilde Philip-Gay, a law professor and a specialist in French and American constitutional law. But those same people may one day vote for a far-right government, and what happened in the U.S. can happen elsewhere in Europe, including in France. Inscribing abortion into the French Constitution will make it harder for abortion opponents of the future to challenge these rights, but it wont prevent them from doing it in the long run, with the right political strategy, Philip-Gay added. It only takes a moment for everything we thought that we have achieved to fade away, said Yael Braun-Pivet, the first female president of the French parliament, in her address to the joint session. Amending the constitution is a laborious process and a rare event in France. Since it was enacted in 1958, the French Constitution has been amended 17 times. The justice minister said the new amendment will be formally inscribed into the Constitution at a public ceremony at Vendome Plaza in Paris on Friday  International Womens Day.

        "content": "The no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena was handed over to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament on Tuesday (March 05). It was signed by 44 parliamentarians including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella and MPs Prof. G.L. Peiris, Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, Hesha Vithanage, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen, M.A. Sumanthiran, S.M. Marikkar, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Thalatha Atukorale, Vijitha Herath and Chandima Weerakkody. The no-confidence motion alleges that the Speaker had ignored the Supreme Courts recommendations pertaining to Sections 13, 17, 20, 33 (6), 34 (1), 35 (1), 21, 22 and 33 of the Online Safety Bill. Abeywardena is also accused of allowing the Third Reading of the Online Safety Bill to be passed without a vote and disregarding the Chief Opposition Whips call for a division at the Committee Stage. Further, the Opposition MPs pointed out that the Speaker had unconstitutionally and unlawfully used his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided on a tie on the matter. It was reported that four members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment. (Speaker)-No Confidence Motion by Adaderana Online",
