        "title": "US Surgeon General calls for social media warning labels to protect adolescents",
        "date": "June 18, 2024 05:38 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on Monday called for a warning label to be added to social media apps as a reminder that those platforms have caused harm to young people, especially adolescents. In an op-ed in the New York Times, Murthy wrote that a warning label alone will not make social media safe for young people but that it can increase awareness and change behavior as shown in evidence from tobacco studies. The U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation requiring such a warning label. Youth advocates and lawmakers have long accused social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat of what they say is a harmful effect on kids, including shortened attention spans, promoting negative body images, and making them vulnerable to online bullies and predators. It is time to require a surgeon generals warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents, Murthy wrote on Monday. TikTok, Snap and Meta Platforms, owner of Facebook and Instagram, did not respond to requests for comment. The CEOs of those three companies, along with social media platform X and messaging app Discord, were grilled by U.S. senators in January during a hearing about online child safety, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham accusing the leaders of having blood on your hands, for failing to protect young users from sexual predators. Some U.S. states have been working to pass legislation to safeguard children from the harmful effects of social media, such as anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses as a result. New York state lawmakers this month passed legislation to bar social media platforms from exposing addictive algorithmic content to users under age 18 without parental consent. In March, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that bans children under 14 from social media platforms and requires 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 18, 2024 09:14 pm",
        "content": "Japan has seen cases of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS) surpass 1,000 in 2024, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) reported on June 18. As at June 9, the preliminary number of cases in the country since the beginning of this year reached 1,019, data from the NIID showed, marking a significant increase in the spread of this severe bacterial infection compared to previous years. STSS, also known as severe invasive streptococcal infection, is a sudden-onset disease primarily caused by Group A Streptococcus. Initial symptoms typically include sore throat, fever, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal issues, as well as septic symptoms like low blood pressure. If not treated promptly, it can lead to soft tissue damage, respiratory failure, liver failure, kidney failure, and multi-organ failure, with a mortality rate exceeding 30 per cent. The spread of the disease, or flesh-eating bacteria infection due to its severity, has been notably faster this year. By June 2, a record total of 977 cases had already been reported, surpassing the entire count of 941 cases for the whole of last year. The weekly report on infectious disease trends from the NIID, covering the period from June 3 to 9, indicated that Tokyo has the highest number of confirmed cases this year with 150, followed by prefectures of Aichi and Saitama with 69 and 68 cases, respectively. STSS is primarily transmitted through droplets from the nasal or throat mucosa and through contact with wounds. Experts caution that the early symptoms of this bacterial infection are often mistaken for the common cold, due to the rapid progression of the disease. High fever accompanied by delirium or rapidly spreading redness around a wound are warning signs that require immediate medical attention. Healthcare professionals urge anyone experiencing these severe symptoms to seek immediate medical care to prevent the potentially life-threatening progression of the disease.

Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe made it clear that the government will not accept any decisions that could harm the existence of Buddhism. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the ceremony held today (18) at the Sirikotha Party Headquarters, where letters of appointment were distributed to zonal organizers appointed under the United National Partys new reorganization drive. Addressing the gathering the President stated that, I am pleased to be part of todays event marking the second phase of appointing new zonal organizers under the UNPs reorganization drive. Today in Parliament, extensive discussions took place on the gender equality bill. However, based on the Supreme Court order, women do not have the right to equality. I emphasized in Parliament that denying this right to women, who constitute the majority of the countrys population, could be viewed as a decision that goes against both Parliament and the Constitution of our nation. Our goal is to ensure that women enjoy equal rights to men, as stipulated in all agreements of international womens organizations. The judiciary, executive, legislature or any other institution cannot hinder the realization of this objective. We are fully dedicated to achieving this goal, and I emphasized this commitment in Parliament today to dispel any concerns. Moreover, I emphasized that we cannot accept any decision that may undermine the protection of Buddhism, and efforts are currently underway to address this issue. Source: PMD",

        "title": "Putin arrives in North Korea for first official visit in 24 years",
        "date": "June 19, 2024 10:04 am",
        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea early on Wednesday, after saying the two countries want to cooperate closely to overcome U.S.-led sanctions in the face of intensifying confrontations with Washington. Putin was met at Pyongyangs airport by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They shook hands and embraced, and Kim later joined Putin in his car to personally guide him to Pyongyangs Kumsusan State Guest House, North Koreas official Korean Central News Agency said. The agency described their meeting as a historic event that demonstrates the invincibility and durability of the two nations friendship and unity. Putin, making his first trip to North Korea in 24 years, said in comments that appeared in its state media hours before he landed that he appreciates the countrys firm support of his military actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighboring country in 2022. He said the countries would continue to resolutely oppose what he described as Western ambitions to hinder the establishment of a multipolar world order based on justice, mutual respect for sovereignty, considering each others interests. Putins visit comes amid growing concerns about an arms arrangement in which Pyongyang provides Moscow with badly needed munitions to fuel Russias war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that would enhance the threat posed by Kims nuclear weapons and missile program. In the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the streets were decorated with portraits of Putin and Russian flags. A banner on a building said: We warmly welcome the President of the Russian Federation. Putin also said in his published remarks that Russia and North Korea will develop trade and payment systems that are not controlled by the West and jointly oppose sanctions against the countries, which he described as illegal, unilateral restrictions. North Korea is under heavy U.N. Security Council economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programs, while Russia is also grappling with sanctions by the United States and its Western partners over its aggression in Ukraine. Putin said the countries will also expand cooperation in tourism, culture and education. Before heading to North Korea, Putin traveled to Yakutsk, a city in eastern Russia, where he met regional Gov. Aisen Nikolayev, and received briefings on technology and defense-related projects. He also met with young professionals working in Russias Far East. Putin is being accompanied by several top officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Denis Mantrurov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, according to his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov. He said a number of documents will be signed during the visit, possibly including an agreement on a comprehensive strategic partnership. U.S. and South Korean officials say military, economic and other exchanges between North Korea and Russia have sharply increased since Kim met Putin in September in the Russian Far East, their first since 2019. Earlier this year, Putin sent Kim a high-end Aurus Senat limousine, which he had shown to the North Korean leader when they met in September. Observers said the shipment violated a U.N. resolution banning the supply of luxury items to North Korea. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putins visit to North Korea illustrates how Russia tries, in desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine. North Korea is providing significant munitions to Russia ... and other weapons for use in Ukraine. Iran has been providing weaponry, including drones, that have been used against civilians and civilian infrastructure, Blinken told reporters following a meeting with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday. Stoltenberg reiterated concerns about the potential support that Russia provides to North Korea when it comes to supporting their missile and nuclear programs. Lim Soosuk, spokesperson of South Koreas Foreign Ministry, said Seoul has been stressing to Moscow that any cooperation between Russia and North Korea must not proceed in a direction that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions or undermines peace and stability in the region. Tensions on the Korean Peninsulas are at their highest point in years, with the pace of both Kims weapons tests and combined military exercises involving the United States, South Korea and Japan intensifying in a tit-for-tat cycle. The Koreas also have engaged in Cold War-style psychological warfare that involved North Korea dropping tons of trash on the South with balloons, and the South broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda with its loudspeakers. South Koreas military said soldiers fired warning shots to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the land border Tuesday, apparently in error, for the second time this month. Putin has continuously sought to rebuild ties with Pyongyang as part of efforts to restore his countrys clout and its Soviet-era alliances. Moscows ties with North Korea weakened after the 1991 Soviet collapse. Kim Jong Un first met with Putin in 2019 in Russias eastern port of Vladivostok. After North Korea, the Kremlin said Putin will also visit Vietnam for talks that are expected to be focused on trade. The United States, which has spent years strengthening ties and accelerating trade with Vietnam, criticized Putins planned visit. As Russia continues to seek international support to sustain its illegal and brutal war against Ukraine, we reiterate that no country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Vietnam said in a statement.

        "date": "June 19, 2024 11:33 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today announced forthcoming negotiations with creditor countries and also revealed plans to boost Sri Lankas industrial sector. He stated that these plans feature the creation of a new commercial bank, an economic commission and an institute called Enterprise Sri Lanka to promote a competitive and digitalized green economy, the PMD reported. He made these comments during the opening ceremony of the International Industry Exhibition, Industry EXPO 2024, which was inaugurated at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo today (19). He also said that the government is expected to reach an agreement with the Sri Lankas creditor nations within the next few weeks. Wickremesinghe announced the establishment of a new development bank aimed at providing financial support to industrialists in Sri Lanka. This initiative will offer industrialists the opportunity to obtain loans at low interest rates. Additionally, the President revealed plans to set up an Economic Commission to oversee these activities. A new institution, Enterprise Sri Lanka, will also be created to empower small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, he said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this announcement during the inauguration of the International Industry Expo 2024, the first event of its kind in Sri Lanka. Organized by the Industrial Development Board under the guidance of the Ministry of Industry, and with the support of Industries and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, the exhibition will run from today until June 23 at the BMICH. Over a thousand international industrial entrepreneurs from various countries, along with local large-scale and medium-scale industrialists, are participating in this event. The expo features 1,307 exhibition booths, with the special inclusion of a separate green industrial zone for the first time. Additionally, an experimental academic conference on green industrialization will be held during the exhibition. President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the International Industry Expo 2024 by cutting the ribbon and the President engaged in a tour of the exhibition. In his address, the President remarked that some individuals have become accustomed to taking every development initiative to court. He emphasized that such actions hinder progress and stressed that the country can only be developed through a consistent national policy. President Ranil Wickremesinghes complete speech is below: Minister of Industries and Health Ramesh Pathirana is diligently spearheading the development of the industrial sector in the country, with the industry exhibition being a significant initiative under his stewardship. It stands as the largest exhibition in the country. We were once a bankrupt nation. However, in the coming weeks, we anticipate shedding this label entirely. Negotiations for the related agreement are also slated for completion in the near future, facilitating smoother dealings with private creditors. These achievements have been realized over the past two years. Yet, we must not rest on these achievements. Our focus must now shift to debt repayment strategies, as we aim to settle outstanding loans over an extended period, ideally extending until 2042. Given that we are primarily an import-based economy, we continually need foreign exchange to cover these imports. Without sufficient foreign exchange reserves, we are compelled to resort to taking loans. However, this practice can potentially lead to another economic crisis within the next 15-20 years. Hence, our current focus is on transitioning to an export-oriented economy. In this shift towards an export-oriented economy, the manufacturing sector plays a pivotal role. This sector needs to evolve into a competitive and digital economy, aligned with our goal of achieving zero carbon emissions and fostering a green economy. These initiatives must guide our efforts moving forward. Our immediate priority is to enhance the competitiveness of existing industries through strategic plans. Achieving competitiveness cannot happen overnight; neighbouring countries like India, particularly in states such as Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, have made significant strides in industrial development. It is crucial for us to align and collaborate with these developments. Furthermore, we aim to engage with other global partners to advance these objectives. Therefore, our primary objective is to ensure our industries attain competitive capabilities. The government is committed to providing all necessary support to facilitate this transformation. We are currently exploring the establishment of a development bank to facilitate the required funding for this initiative. Back in 1960, we established the DFCC Bank, followed by the founding of the NDB Bank in 1980. Post-privatization, both banks have evolved into major commercial entities in our country. Notably, without these banks, President Premadasas success with 200 garment industries would not have been possible. Hence, there is a strong need to initiate a new bank. This new bank aims to maintain low interest rates. Additionally, an economic commission will be instituted to advance these initiatives. Furthermore, we plan to introduce a new entity called Enterprise Sri Lanka to support small and medium-scale entrepreneurs. This institutional framework is designed to assist all industrialists across the country. We aim to progress steadily along this path over the next 5-10 years. Furthermore, our policy aims to explore opportunities for production in countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar in the future. Concurrently, we are actively collaborating with India on these endeavours. I have already discussed this with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and anticipate further discussions with the Indian Foreign Minister tomorrow. Our cooperation with India will focus on solar and wind power, as well as acquiring green hydrogen. We aim to leverage these advantages, potentially even in the North Sea. As the first step Adani Company has initiated its presence in Sri Lanka. Embracing this new direction is imperative. However, its observed that some individuals in our country resort to legal action for every issue, primarily benefiting lawyers. Its imperative to understand that litigation alone cannot foster national development; instead, we must adhere to our national policies. I have instructed the Minister of Industries to initiate discussions and formulate a new program to advance industrial growth. We intend to present the Economic Transformation Law to Parliament to reinforce these initiatives. --PMD",

        "date": "June 19, 2024 12:40 pm",
        "content": "Microsoft has been dramatically toppled as the worlds most valuable public company. Nvidia, which had only overtaken Apple for the number two spot earlier this month, dethroned Microsoft during trading on Tuesday as its shares rose by more than 3. The stock has risen more than 170 this year given the chipmakers leading position in the artificial intelligence (AI) race with 80 of the processor market. The latest upward move took its market value to 3.326trn. It had hit 2trn in February. The companys meteoric rise marks another milestone in the tech sector, which Apple had dominated since it launched the iPhone in 2007. Apple only lost its crown to Microsoft earlier this year as worries over iPhone demand weighed on the stock. Microsofts investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI at the same time was seen as beneficial for its shares as it took an early lead in generative AI. Analysts said demand for Nvidias shares was boosted earlier this month by a stock split that created more shares and made them more attractive to individual investors. They had cost more than 1,000 each before the split on 7 June. Microsofts shares have risen just 19 in comparison during the year to date - a surge which would usually be seen as satisfactory but for Nvidias enviable performance. Demand for the California-based firms processors is exceeding supply while Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Googles owner spend big in the race to develop AI computing capabilities. Market watchers said the rise in Nvidias stock on Tuesday alone added more than 100bn to its market value. Sam North, an analyst at investment platform eToro, credited anticipation of the stock split - and the split itself - for the recent share price surge. A stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy, he explained. With Nvidia doing a 10:1 stock split, retail investors are the real winners here. Source: Sky news --Agencies",

        "title": "At least 550 pilgrims die from extreme heat during Hajj in Saudi Arabia",
        "date": "June 19, 2024 07:34 pm",
        "content": "Diplomats on Wednesday said at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year. At least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries responses told AFP. All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca. At least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman. The new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally. The diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550. The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. The pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade. Temperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said. Heat stress Earlier on Tuesday, Egypts foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj. While a ministry statement said a certain number of deaths had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them. Saudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities. At least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians. AFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool. Saudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day. But many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime. Some pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times. Around 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities. Unregistered pilgrims Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas. This places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route. One of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was absolutely boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims. Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims camps, causing the collapse of services, said an Egyptian official supervising the countrys hajj mission. The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time. They died from the heat because most people had no place to take shelter. Earlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj. Other countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal. Most countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related. Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had been successfully carried out, preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. Health officials provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases, SPA said.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that a better country will be created for the children of Sri Lanka within the next 5-10 years. The President emphasized his commitment to ensuring that no child in the country will suffer, highlighting his dedication to resolving the economic crisis within a short span of two years. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while addressing the ceremony for the awarding of Presidential scholarships held today (19) at Temple Trees, the President Media Division said. He stated that the Aswasuma program was implemented to provide income support to the people, while the Urumaya program was implemented to secure land rights. Additionally, he highlighted the launch of the Presidential Education Scholarship Program, aimed at ensuring educational opportunities for children. In 2022 (2023), 60 G.C.E. Advanced Level students from each of the 100 education zones will be selected to receive educational scholarships, totaling 6,000 students. Each student will receive LKR 6,000 per month for a period of two years. These scholarships will be provided from March 2024 until the completion of their G.C.E. Advanced Level studies. Additionally, following the concept of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a scholarship program is being implemented for students from grade 1 to grade 11, covering all 10,126 schools across the island. Scholarships allocated to each school depend on its student enrolment, ranging from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 22 scholarships per school. Beginning from April 2024, educational scholarships from the Presidents Fund will be provided to 100,000 students, amounting to Rs. 3,000 per child per month for 12 months. Symbolizing the awarding of scholarships, 5,108 students received scholarships and awards today. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also participated in the ceremony, symbolically presenting the scholarships Subsequently, the President visited the scholarship recipients to inquire about their backgrounds and achievements. President Wickremesinghe further said: Today marks a joyous occasion for the children of our nation. Congratulations to all of you on receiving these scholarships. A total of 100,000 scholarships have been awarded through this program, including a LKR 6,000 for G.C.E. Advanced Level students. To support these initiatives, we have allocated LKR 4 billion from the Presidents Fund. The past three years have been challenging for all of us. We faced hardships, shortages of food, and difficulties in providing transportation for children to attend school. However, those times are now behind us. As President, I have made a commitment to ensure that no child in this country suffers. Consequently, we swiftly implemented necessary economic recovery programs to restore our nations stability. We have initiated essential programs to steer the country away from bankruptcy, with the goal of creating a better future for our children within the next 5-10 years. Following the recent economic crisis, many lost their sources of income. As part of our response, we have provided assistance to 2.4 million families through the Aswasuma program. Additionally, the Urumaya program was introduced to grant legal ownership of land to residents. This initiative extended property rights to individuals residing in urban apartments without legal entitlements. Moreover, our focus on education has culminated in the awarding of these scholarships to all deserving students across the country. Hence, we have endeavoured to provide livelihoods, secure rights, and ensure children receive education. Therefore, I encourage these children to make full use of these scholarships and advance their education.",

        "date": "June 19, 2024 10:32 pm",
        "content": "Singer Justin Timberlake was arrested in New York for driving while intoxicated, local officials have told the BBC. The pop star was arrested and formally charged on Tuesday morning, the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office said in a statement. Timberlake, 43, was in Sag Harbor, an affluent village in the Hamptons, a popular summer destination for celebrities on Long Island. He was released without bail after being formally charged, the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office said. The BBC has contacted Timberlakes lawyer for comment. Timberlake was arrested after midnight (05:37 BST) after police pulled him over in his grey BMW for driving through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road, according to a charging document. When officers stopped him, Timberlakes eyes were bloodshot and glassy and a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, the document said. His speech was slowed and he performed poorly on the officers sobriety tests, it added. He also refused a breathalyser test, according to records. I had one martini and I followed my friends home, Timberlake allegedly told the officer who stopped him, according to the BBCs US partner CBS News. He is scheduled to appear virtually in Sag Harbor court on 26 July. His lawyer, Edward Burke Jr, told CBS on Tuesday evening that he will vigorously defend his client and is currently engaged in the Discovery process with the District Attorneys Office. Timberlake has been touring the US to promote his sixth album, Everything I Thought It Was, and is due to launch the international leg of it next week, starting in Poland. A former member of the popular 90s boy band NSYNC, Timberlake is an actor, songwriter and one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has spoken openly in the past about seeking help for excessive drinking. In the state of New York, penalties for charges related to driving while intoxicated include up to a year in jail, a 1,000 (786) fine and the suspension of a drivers licence for at least six months. Timberlake was scheduled to perform two shows in Chicago this weekend, followed by a show in New Yorks Madison Square Garden next Tuesday. The 10-time Grammy winner is also known for his roles in the films The Social Network and Friends With Benefits. Timberlake is married to actor Jessica Biel, with whom he shares two children.

In a statement issued on Wednesday (19), the BASL emphasized that the Supreme Court has executed its constitutional duty by evaluating the bills alignment with supreme law of the land. While individuals have the right to agree or disagree, neither the legislature nor the executive should criticize the Court for performing its duty to the people, the BASL stressed. The BASLs response comes after President Wickremesinghes remarks in Parliament on June 18, 2024, where he referred to the Supreme Courts actions as Judicial Cannibalism and suggested the formation of a select committee to review the Courts determination. The BASL expressed grave concern over the relevant statement, viewing it as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and force through a Bill which has been decided to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The judiciary should be allowed to function independently and free from any kind of external pressure, the BASL asserted. The association further condemned the Presidents comments as a threat to the Supreme Court and to the entire judicial system in discharging the judicial function of the republic conferred by the Constitution. The BASL warned that establishing a parliamentary select committee to review the Supreme Courts ruling on the constitutionality of a bill would set a dangerous precedent. It is the duty of both the executive and the legislature to respect the judiciarys functions. Any interference could lead to severe adverse consequences and pose a significant threat to the Rule of Law in the country, the BASL cautioned.",

        "title": "Canada lists Irans Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group",
        "date": "June 20, 2024 12:12 pm",
        "content": "Canada has listed Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, after years of pressure from opposition legislators and some members of the Iranian diaspora. Announcing the decision on Wednesday, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc called it a significant tool in fighting global terrorism. The move will mean that thousands of senior Iranian government officials, including top IRGC officials, will be barred from entering Canada. Irans foreign ministry spokesman, quoted by Irans Fars news agency, has condemned what he described as the unwise and unconventional step. Who are Irans Islamic Revolution Guard Corps? The IRGC is a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is estimated to have more than 190,000 active personnel with its own ground forces, navy and air force that oversee Irans strategic weapons. The IRGC exerts influence elsewhere in the Middle East by providing money, weapons, technology, training and advice to allied governments and armed groups through its shadowy overseas operations arm, the Quds (Jerusalem) Force, according to the government. The Quds Force was already listed as a terrorist group by Canada, but Wednesdays announcement extends the designation to the entire IRGC. Speaking to reporters, Mr LeBlanc said the action sends a strong message that Canada will use all of the tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist entity of the IRGC. The Iranian regime has consistently displayed disregard for human rights, both inside and outside of Iran as well as a willingness to destabilise the international rules-based order, he said. After this designation, current and former senior Iranian government officials already in Canada may also now be investigated and removed. Canadas foreign affairs minister, Melanie Joly, warned that Canadians in Iran could be at risk of arbitrary detention following the announcement. My message is clear: for those who are in Iran right now, its time to come back home, she said. And for those who are planning to go to Iran, dont go. In response, Irans foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted as describing Canadas move as an unwise and unconventional politically-motivated step. Canadas action will not have any effect on the Revolutionary Guards legitimate and deterrent power, he said. The Canadian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had previously declined to extend the terrorism designation to the IRGC, despite pressure from some diaspora members - including the families of those who died after Flight PS752 was shot down by the IRGC in January 2020 in Tehran. All 175 passengers onboard the plane were killed, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents of Canada. Tehran had claimed that the missile strike on the plane was done by mistake. Mr Trudeau had previously said in 2022 that he feared a terrorism designation would unfairly target Iranians in Canada who opposed the regime and fled, but had to serve in the IRGC in the past. Asked why now by reporters, Mr LeBlanc said the decision to designate a group as a terrorist entity is a deliberative process made on advice of security services and with foreign policy considerations. It is a threshold that must be met under the criminal code of Canada, he said. The move makes Canada the second country in North America after the US to label the IRGC as a terrorist organisation, which did so in 2019. The UK had previously indicated its intent to make a similar move as recently as 2023, but has yet to do so. Source: BBC --Agencies",

This was attributed to internal dishonesty and a delay of 8 years and 8 months in issuing critical circulars to filling station owners by the Corporations marketing department.

The issue came to light during a recent COPE meeting chaired by MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena to review the Auditor Generals 2022 report and the current status of the corporation, the Communications Dept. Of Parliament said in a press release. The Committee directed the Corporation to submit a detailed report within seven working days, listing the names of those involved in the fraud and the measures taken to address the issue.

        "title": "Hajj death toll tops 1,000 after extreme heat: report",
        "date": "June 21, 2024 10:57 am",
        "content": "The death toll from this years hajj has exceeded 1,000, an AFP tally said Thursday, more than half unregistered worshippers who performed the pilgrimage in extreme heat in Saudi Arabia. The new deaths reported Thursday included 58 from Egypt, according to an Arab diplomat who provided a breakdown showing that of 658 Egyptians who died, 630 were unregistered pilgrims. Around 10 countries have reported 1,081 deaths during the pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam which all Muslims with the means must complete at least once. The hajj, whose timing is determined by the lunar Islamic calendar, fell again this year during the oven-like Saudi summer. The national meteorological centre reported a high of 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) this week at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. A Saudi study published last month said temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade. Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims try to join the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits. Saudi authorities reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca this month, but it appears many still participated in the main rites which began last Friday. This group was more vulnerable, because without official permits they could not access air-conditioned spaces provided for the 1.8 million authorised pilgrims to cool down. People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted, one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday of Saturdays day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajjs climax. The diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues. Egyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain information and help Egyptian pilgrims get medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives, it said. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has ordered that a crisis cell headed by the prime minister follow up on the deaths of the countrys pilgrims. Sisi stressed the need for immediate coordination with the Saudi authorities to facilitate receiving the bodies of the deceased and streamline the process, said a statement from his office. Burials begin More fatalities were also confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia. Out of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat told AFP. I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural, the diplomat said. Indonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, its religious affairs ministry said, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year. Deaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraqs autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause. Friends and relatives have been searching for missing pilgrims, scouring hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst. Two diplomats told AFP Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, cleaning the bodies and putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred. The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that, said one diplomat, who said his country was working to notify loved ones as best it could. The other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead. Jordans foreign ministry said on Thursday that Saudi authorities had granted 68 permits for Jordanian pilgrims to be buried in Mecca. Sixteen Jordanians remain missing and 22 are in hospital, including seven who are in critical condition, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Extreme danger Saudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of heat exhaustion on Sunday alone. Last year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians. The timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions. A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the extreme danger threshold from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses. Hosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salmans official title includes the words Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, in Mecca and Medina. The hajj has seen a number of disasters over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the stoning the devil ritual killed up to 2,300 people. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "Responding to the allegations levelled by former President Maithripala Sirisena, a Spokesman for the Catholic Church on Friday said that the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has distributed over Rs. 500 million of financial aid received to assist the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. National Catholic Mass Communications Director, Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha charged that the former President is making up such stories in front of the media in order to cover up his own political bankruptcy. Mr. Maithripala Sirisena is politically bankrupt as of today. So, he makes all these false statements in front of media to cover up his political bankruptcy, he said. In fact, His Eminence the Cardinal has distributed over Rs. 500 million for these victims of the Easter attacksThe Seth Sarana Caritas, a welfare organization maintained under Cardinal Ranjith has spent the funds for the victims. There is a teaching of Lord Jesus Christ that even your left hand should not know what your right hand is doing, so that what you are giving may be in secret. That is why the Catholic Church does not advertise the things we do on the media. Thats why we keep confidentiality in the things we give, Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha added. On Thursday (20), former President Maithripala Sirisena alleged that Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has not distributed any of the funds or financial aid received to assist the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. Speaking to the media in Polonnaruwa, the former President also claimed that most of the court cases against him were filed under the influence of Cardinal Ranjith. Commenting further, Sirisena said: What happened to the funds received by the Cardinal from Catholic organisations, other countries of the world, top Sri Lankan businessmen and several other parties following the Easter attacks? It is good if the Cardinal submits a list of individuals who received this money, and about what happened to this money. Not a single cent of those funds has been given to the victims. Even though I paid money from the government when I was president, now I have been sued to pay compensation on my own. That is the situation right now, he added.",

        "date": "June 21, 2024 10:42 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the imperative of not forgetting the hardships endured in the past due to shortages of essential resources such as medicines, fuel and fertilizers critical for the country. He called upon all citizens to unite behind the governments initiative aimed at fostering a new economic transformation in Sri Lanka, ensuring that future generations do not have to face similar challenges. He stated that the government concluded the second round of discussions with the IMF Board of Directors last week received confirmation that the program guiding Sri Lanka is on the right track. Consequently, we have been granted an extension to repay our debts. Currently, negotiations are underway with China to finalize these arrangements. Additionally, discussions are on-going with both Paris Club and non-Paris Club member countries, as well as with official creditors committees, to reach agreements, he said. Wickremesinghe said this marks a significant step towards lifting the country out of the crisis it has faced. However, our journey does not end here. It is imperative that we reflect on the reasons behind our economic challenges. The President highlighted this during his address at the 9th General Assembly of the All-Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association (AIPPOA), which took place on Friday (20). The President also extended his appreciation to the All-Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association for their steadfastness during the past COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, fulfilling their responsibilities to the country. President Wickremesinghe further remarked: I would like to extend my sincere gratitude on behalf of the Government to the All-Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association for supplying essential medicines during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Your proactive response and commitment were crucial during a challenging period when governmental systems faced significant strain. Furthermore, as per the communication from your association, we are actively engaging to address arising issues and implement necessary actions. It is undeniable that many lives in our country have been preserved due to your dedication. In the past, there were financial constraints hindering access to essential medicines nationwide, yet you remained steadfast. Your unwavering commitment exemplifies the responsibility we expect from every citizen of our nation, a trait unfortunately not always prevalent. Neither you nor I are unfamiliar with these challenges, but we are collectively dedicated to rebuilding our country to the best of our abilities. When I assumed leadership of this country, we faced dire circumstances. Foreign exchange was scarce, and funds for essential medicines and fuel were lacking. We were confronted with tough choices, deciding whether to allocate funds for fuel or fertilizers. Opting for fertilizers, we revived agricultural activities, boosting production and ensuring access to medicines and fuel for our people. It was a challenging period, but crucial support from the Indian and Bangladeshi governments enabled us to import medicines and essential food items, sustaining us through the initial difficult 06 months. Subsequently, the nation began to progress steadily. During this time, there were heart-wrenching moments when people sought medicines without means to pay. You have faced the agonizing choice of denying them medication or providing aid amidst scarcity. These decisions were agonizing, but collectively, they propelled our country forward. Implementing necessary measures, including VAT adjustments, bolstered our revenue streams, strengthened the rupee, and facilitated economic progress. Today, we are advancing as a nation due to the resilience shown during these trying times. Last week, we concluded the second round of discussions with the IMF Board of Directors. We received confirmation that the program guiding Sri Lanka is on the right track. Consequently, we have been granted an extension to repay our debts. Currently, negotiations are underway with China to finalize these arrangements. Additionally, discussions are on-going with both Paris Club and non-Paris Club member countries, as well as with official creditors committees, to reach agreements. This marks a significant step towards lifting the country out of the crisis it has faced. However, our journey does not end here. It is imperative that we reflect on the reasons behind our economic challenges. Historically, Sri Lanka has not cultivated a robust export industry despite numerous opportunities. In 1979, during my visit to China, the country was economically less developed than Sri Lanka. Today, China supports us financially. Similarly, in 1991, as Minister of Industry, I met with Vietnams Industry Minister, who sought advice on attracting investments, earning foreign exchange, and establishing economic zones. Now, if I were to visit Vietnam, I would seek advice from them. We have squandered many opportunities. If we fail to rectify this and transition to a new economic paradigm, we risk sliding back into economic turmoil. To prevent a return to those dark days, we have introduced a new economic program for the country. We must depart from the old system and embrace a new paradigm. Our trajectory should mirror the progress achieved by nations like India and Bangladesh, fostering a competitive economy. Embracing cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential as we envision and build a revitalized nation. --PMD",

        "date": "June 22, 2024 09:24 am",
        "content": "The biggest trade union of government doctors in Sri Lanka warned on Friday about a wave of economic crisis-driven brain drain among medical professionals, as 25 percent of them have already taken the necessary exams to find employment abroad. Before the worst economic crisis pummeled Sri Lanka in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, on average 200 doctors would migrate to work in another country, according to Ministry of Health statistics. The number has surged since early 2022, when the country defaulted on its foreign debt. Sri Lankans started experiencing power cuts and shortages of basics such as fuel, food and medicine, and the inflation rate rose to 50 percent a year. If we consider the situation within the last two years, more than 1,800 doctors have left the country in 2022 and 2023, Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, spokesperson of the Government Medical Officers Association, told Arab News. Many more are likely to follow in their footsteps as GMOA data shows that at least 25 percent of doctors currently serving in the government health system have already passed the necessary exams to find employment abroad. To practice medicine in the UAE or Oman, doctors need to take the Prometric Exam for GP Doctor. To work in the UK, they are required to complete the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Boards exams, while in Australia they have to follow the examination of the Australian Medical Council. Considering only those three  recent statistics show that nearly 5,000 Sri Lankan doctors have completed these exams and theyre waiting to take their decision of leaving the country, Wijesinghe said. In government health institutions of Sri Lanka  there are around 20,000 doctors. He warned that an increasing number of those leaving were specialists, mainly in emergency medicine and anesthesia, followed by pediatricians, psychiatrists, neurologists and cardiac surgeons. Some of the worlds most rigorously trained, Sri Lankan doctors are required by their countrys health system to obtain both local and international training before they practice as consultants. At the same time, and compared with the years of experience, they are among the most underpaid, earning between 170 and 720 per month. In the past two years, those who had left for compulsory training in countries such as the UK, Australia or the US, are not willing to return. The high salaries they are being paid in those countries, compared to Sri Lanka, is the main reason. If you consider Middle East countries, it is nearly tenfold of the salary they are getting in Sri Lanka. In the UK and Australia, around 20 to 30-fold, Wijesinghe said, adding that they are attracted by better working environments, better living standards, and education opportunities for their children. Majority of the Sri Lankan doctors migrate to Australia and the United Kingdom  They are migrating with their family members as well. He estimated that nearly 400 specialists have left in the past two years, which was becoming a huge problem for the Sri Lankan health sector. It has affected from the biggest hospital in Sri Lanka, the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, which is situated in Colombo, to the rural hospital system  Patients have to travel hundreds of kilometers sometimes to get their surgeries done, he said. The brain drain of professionals and intellectuals from this country has affected many sectors, but its a well-known fact that health is the most affected sector. The GMOA has proposed to the Sri Lankan government ways to mitigate the brain drain of doctors, but as the solutions involve financial incentives and restructuring of the salary system, the Ministry of Health does not expect it to happen immediately. Increasing the salary is really difficult at this time since the country is just recovering from the economic crisis, Dr. Asela Gunawardena, the ministrys director-general of health services, told Arab News. However, we will do our best to attend to their needs to attract them to come back to their country and work for the nation. He was also hopeful that a sense of duty would help bring them home as well. Sri Lanka is the country which gave them free education from the kindergarten to university, he said. They have an obligation to help the country when in trouble. Source: Arab News --Agencies",

        "date": "June 22, 2024 12:06 pm",
        "content": "The Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith states that he has all the documents on how the funds received for victims of Easter Sunday terror attack was spent. Responding to the allegations levelled by former President Maithripala Sirisena, Cardinal Ranjith emphasized that the statement made by the former President regarding the relevant funds is completely baseless. The statement made by former President Sirisena is completely hateful and inappropriate. He has a duty to ask the concerned parties what happened before making such remarks, Cardinal Ranjith said. Following the Easter attacks, we requested assistance from both international and domestic parties to address the needs of the affected individuals. These requirements were varied, including medical treatment in private hospitals for specialized care, and educational support for orphaned children. They required assistance from us in different areas. I cannot just tell the exact amountaround Rs 500 million that we collectedbut we have the data for verification. We prepare and maintain audited reports from bank accounts. Of the Rs. 500 million, approximately Rs. 460 million have been distributed to those victims, he added. It is very unfortunate that if he former President Sirisena had inquired us before making such a statement, he could have obtained the necessary information. His comment appears to be made impulsively without analyzing the facts, Cardinal Ranjith said further. Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a Journalist, Cardinal Ranjith expressed: We dont know whether anyone has misled the former President. There is politics here. On the other hand, we know that his party is divided now. So, in this situation, he must be under mental stress. Therefore, we dont have any issue with him making all these allegations, because our conscience is clear. On Thursday (20), former President Maithripala Sirisena alleged that Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has not distributed any of the funds or financial aid received to assist the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. Speaking to the media in Polonnaruwa, the former President also claimed that most of the court cases against him were filed under the influence of Cardinal Ranjith. Commenting further, Sirisena said: What happened to the funds received by the Cardinal from Catholic organisations, other countries of the world, top Sri Lankan businessmen and several other parties following the Easter attacks? It is good if the Cardinal submits a list of individuals who received this money, and about what happened to this money. Not a single cent of those funds has been given to the victims. Even though I paid money from the government when I was president, now I have been sued to pay compensation on my own. That is the situation right now, he added.",

        "title": "Queen to sell iconic back catalogue for record breaking 1 billion",
        "date": "June 22, 2024 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Legendary rock band Queen have reportedly sold their iconic back catalogue of hits for a whipping 1Billion pounds following a bidding war. According to The Sun the surviving band members and Freddie Mercurys estate have agreed to the sale with Sony Music, more than doubling the record set by Bruce Springsteen, who sold the rights to his music for 393M in 2021. The publication reports that Sony will now own all the bands hits including Bohemian Rhapsody, Dont Stop Me Now and I Want To Break Free. But unlike Springsteen and Bob Dylan who sold his own back catalogue for 315M, the band will retain the rights to perform their music live. Founding members Brian May, 75, and Roger Taylor, 74, continue to tour live with Adam Lambert, 42, as their new front man following Freddies death in 1991. The deal In is also said to include revenue from merchandise, cash generated by the 2018 biographic movie Bohemian Rhapsody and any other future projects and licensing deals. MailOnline have contacted the bands reps for comment. Springsteens deal was inked before a string of other artists including Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Justin Bieber, also bagged hundreds of millions of dollars for their own collections. But the market has cooled since and some major investors have devalued their song collections by as much as 14 percent. Disney Music Group owns the North America rights to Queens music. But the band retains ownership of the global rights through the UK-based Queen Productions Ltd, which earned 39 million in royalties in 2021. Investors view music catalogs much like owning shares in companies which pay dividends. The 1 billion valuation for Queens catalog is based on the annual returns an investor can expect throughout the next several decades. Ahead of the reports Guy Blake, a leading music industry attorney who has worked on catalog acquisitions, told DailyMail.com earlier this year that the Queen deal would be seismic. In general, I dont see a problem with this 1.2 billion number being accurate, I think theres probably some degree of truth to it, said Blake, a managing partner at Granderson Des Rochers. There arent a whole lot of catalogs out there like Queen, he said. In the streaming age, catalog valuations also rely heavily on a metric called album consumption units, which combine streams and downloads to estimate what the equivalent number of album sales would be. One album sale is equivalent to about 1,500 song streams, according to industry standards. Queens album consumption units in the US were 25.9 million between 1991 and 2017 then surged to 3.58 million in 2019 following the release of the Bohemian Rhapsody movie, according to Luminate figures reported by Billboard. The popularity of the movie and continued airplay of Queens hits decades after they were released has helped the band earn a legion of young fans - something thats also boosted the value of their catalog. Queen has found a much younger audience. And thats unique to a legacy catalog, Blake said. I dont know that theres a whole lot of rock bands out there that could say that they had the popularity with people under 30 that Queen has right now. Theres just some uniqueness to so many of their songs that they just keep coming back, generation after generation. Source: Daily Mail --Agencies",

        "date": "June 22, 2024 12:46 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that his primary focus is on providing rights to the people of the country. He made this statement during a ceremony held today (22) at the Batticaloa District Secretariat, where Urumaya freehold land deeds were awarded to 192 families across 14 divisional secretariat divisions in the Batticaloa district, as part of the governments initiative to distribute 2 million freehold land deeds. Under the Urumaya program, 27,595 landless families in Batticaloa district are to receive freehold deeds, with 2,610 already granted. Additionally, 252 English diploma holders from the Higher National Engineering Diploma Institute received teacher appointments today, presided over by the President. President Wickremesinghe participated in the symbolic handover of Urumaya land deeds and teacher appointments. He also inaugurated the new district secretariat building in Thiraimadu, Batticaloa, constructed at a cost of Rs. 1,055 million. The building project, initiated by then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the former Minister of Home Affairs Wajira Abeywardena on September 11, 2016, aims to enhance service efficiency for the people of the Batticaloa district. The President unveiled the plaque, opened the District Secretariat, and conducted an observation tour of the new facilities. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated the following during his address at the Urumaya land deeds awarding ceremony: We have decided to develop Trincomalee as a major economic hub. During the recent visit of the Indian External Affairs Minister to Sri Lanka, we had extensive discussions on securing Indias support for this endeavour. Under the Agriculture Modernization Program, we plan to launch a large agricultural business in these areas. Additionally, a project to develop undeveloped Mahaweli land in Batticaloa and Trincomalee will commence soon. We also have plans to enhance tourism from Verugal to Arugam Bay. The Batticaloa Fort is set to be developed for tourism by the Department of Archaeology, and a quality hotel will be established in this province. Dairy farming improvements are also on the agenda. Following the passage of the Economic Transformation Act this year, significant efforts will be directed towards implementing projects here, enabling Trincomalee to become a major export economy. With both Eastern and Southeastern Universities located here, we aim to further develop education in this region. The reform of the vocational education sector will provide more vocational training opportunities for our youth. Due to a recruitment freeze over the past three to four years, honorary appointments were made today to enhance school education. Unemployment remains a significant issue in our country. Therefore, we must create jobs for the youth through a new development process. We have endured a very challenging period, and the common people of this country have suffered greatly. As we rebuild, we will never forget these people. The Urumaya program was implemented to provide free land rights to the people. You now have legal title to your land, which no one can take from you. We have also initiated a relief program for low-income individuals and have distributed over 27,000 free land deeds in this area. A new system will send government officials directly to villages to distribute these land deeds efficiently, eliminating the need for people to travel to the District or Divisional Secretariat. District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries, Land Officers, Councilors, and the Governor will visit villages to hand over the land deeds. I have instructed this program to start on the coming Monday and to complete it promptly. My sole objective is to ensure that land rights are given to the people. I urge everyone to protect their land ownership. Governor of the Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman: It is a great honour to welcome the Honourable President today. This project, initiated by him, began with an allocation of approximately one billion rupees provided by Minister Wajira Abeywardena. It is noteworthy that Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who launched the project during his tenure as Prime Minister, is here today as President to inaugurate it. The President has consistently advised us to commit to the agricultural modernization program to boost the countrys production. We are coordinating with the Department of Agriculture to implement this program in the Batticaloa district, which is an agricultural hub with a large number of farmers. The President has also highlighted the potential for aquaculture development, given that the Eastern Province boasts the longest coastline in the country. We are actively promoting local farmers and businesses to engage in aquaculture projects. Additionally, with large deposits of mineral sand in the region, the President has instructed us to add value to this resource and advance the mineral sector. We are diligently working to develop all these projects under the guidance of the Honourable President. Batticaloa District Coordination Committee Co-Chairman A. L. M. Ataullah: President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit today, to inaugurate the new district secretariat building, distribute freehold land deeds, and appoint teachers for the people of Batticaloa, is a historic event. Currently, there is much discussion about the upcoming elections and questions about potential candidates. Political leaders are visiting Jaffna, making various promises to the Tamil people. It is essential to provide some relief to the Tamil community, and we are proud that this consensus has been reached, thanks to your efforts. The war caused significant losses, and it is our responsibility to foster an environment of cooperation to prevent such conflicts in the future. The people of this country aspire to build a nation where Sinhalese, Muslims, and Tamils can live together harmoniously. Empowering the people is crucial for strengthening the countrys economy. State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan: When the country faced a severe economic crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe took charge and implemented numerous new economic policies. It is essential for the people to be committed to advancing these policies. We all share the responsibility of rescuing our country from the economic crisis and providing hope for the youth. We must choose whether to continue borrowing as a bankrupt nation or to manage our debt and build a strong economy. Today, we are progressing with a focus on long-term vision and economic sustainability. It is our duty to maintain this trajectory, which is why we are dedicated to supporting the President. State Minister S. Viyalanderan, When our countrys economy collapsed, no one was willing to take the lead. Even with money in hand, people had to stand in queues for days to buy essentials, and there was no clear plan for recovery. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe courageously took charge because he had the right program to move the country forward economically. While many criticize the darkness, it takes a true leader to dispel it and bring in the light. This is why the President stepped in. Today, the country is developing thanks to the effective economic program implemented under his leadership. The event was attended by Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman, other regional political representatives, Batticaloa District Secretary J. Muralidaran, Eastern Provincial Education Secretary H.E.M.W.G. Dissanayake, and a group of government officials. --PMD--",

It is expected to be introduced after the first quarter of 2025. The wealthiest segment of our society, which is about 10 percent of the population, will be subjected to this tax. 90 percent of the population will benefit through this tax, Siyambalapitiya claimed. He further explained that this tax will allow a reduction in the indirect taxes that the majority of the public currently pay. Even within the wealthiest 10, their primary asset will not be taxed. Only a small percentage of their other assets will contribute to state income. We will ensure that the tax is affordable for them and beneficial in the long run, he noted. This is not an indirect tax, and it will not be passed on to the lower-income class. The responsibility for this tax lies solely with the payer.

        "date": "June 22, 2024 03:35 pm",
        "content": "NASA said on Friday the Boeing Starliners return to Earth from the International Space Station, which was scheduled for next week, has been delayed again. The delay of the rescheduled June 26 return will allow more time for the review of the thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that caused the first delay, it said. Starliners first crewed mission to the ISS, which had initially been scheduled to last about eight days, has been extended to a date yet to be determined. The spaceship blasted off from Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on June 5 following years of delays and safety scares, as well as two aborted launch attempts that came as astronauts were strapped in and ready to go. NASA and Boeing leadership are adjusting the return to Earth of the Starliner Crew Flight Test spacecraft, NASA said in a blog post late Friday. The move off Wednesday, June 26, deconflicts Starliners undocking and landing from a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data, it said. NASAs Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said: We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process. We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking, he said. Stitch said Starliner, which is crewed by two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both ex-US Navy test pilots, is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station. NASA said the crew was not in a hurry to leave the station because it is well stocked with supplies and the stations schedule is relatively open through mid-August. The initial ISS docking was delayed by more than an hour after some of Starliners thrusters that provide fine maneuvering initially failed to kick in. It was known there was one helium leak affecting Starliner before the launch. While non-combustible, helium provides pressure to the propulsion system. However, other leaks emerged during the flight.

        "content": "Darshan Thoogudeepa, a superstar of the Kannada-language film industry in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, has been under arrest for the past 10 days in connection with a crime that resembles the plot of a movie. He is among 17 people picked up by the police for the murder of Renukaswamy - a 33-year-old fan of the actor  after his body was recovered from a drain. Earlier this week, Bengaluru city Police Commissioner B Dayananda said Renukaswamy was killed in a very brutal and barbaric way and described it as a heinous crime committed in a horrific manner. Police said they believe the 47-year-old actor was angry with Renukaswamy, who worked for a pharmacy company, because he had allegedly sent lewd messages on social media to Pavithra Gowda, an actress who has been described in the Indian press as Darshans girlfriend. She is among those arrested. The charges against the suspects include murder, kidnapping, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy. Darshan is in jail and has not commented on the allegations but his lawyer Ranganath Reddy told the BBC that during their meetings, the actor denied the charges against him. These are mere allegations at the moment, he said. The police have no direct evidence against Darshan. Its a case of circumstantial evidence. Mr Reddy also called claims that Pavithra was married to Darshan a blatant lie. Regarded as the most bankable star of the Kannada film industry, Darshan has starred in about 60 films and many of them have been huge hits. Hes the biggest star in the Kannada film industry, with a huge fan following. His face is plastered behind auto-rickshaws and new releases of his films see fans pouring milk on his hoardings, says film critic S Shiva Kumar. Kannada film producer Yogish Dwarakish says Darshan is one actor who can guarantee you an extraordinary opening. His films release in 600-700 screens in 400 theatres. His fans worship him. Hes a star who delivers every single time. His latest, Kaatera, grossed more than 1bn rupees (12m; 9.4m) and was a mammoth hit. Reports say he charges 200-250 million rupees for a role  a figure unheard of in the local film industry, where films usually have small budgets and a majority dont even get released in the neighbouring southern states. So, its not surprising that since 11 June - when the police turned up at the hotel in Mysuru city where Darshan was staying while shooting for Devil, his latest film - his dramatic arrest and the aftermath continue to make headlines in the state. Officially, police are not giving out any details of what  if any - evidence they have against the actor and the other suspects, but the local press have reported fantastical allegations, attributing them to police sources. Blurry CCTV footage has been shown on TV channels, with reporters claiming that it shows Renukaswamys abduction. Details from whats being described as the deceased mans post-mortem have been discussed threadbare and the press went into a frenzy after reports that the shoes Darshan wore on the night of the murder were found in his wife Vijayalakshmis house, forcing her to obtain a restraining order against the press. Darshans private life has also been put under the scanner, including his relationship with his wife Vijayalakshmi and his connection with Pavithra Gowda - and stories of his past behaviour are being repeated on news and social media. A post from January on Pavithras Instagram account, which talks about a 10-year-long relationship with the actor, has gone viral since their arrest. Darshan is the son of actor Srinivas Thoogudeepa, who became very popular and successful playing negative roles in the 1970s. Producer Yogish, who has known Darshan for three decades now, says the actor saw a lot of hardship in his early life after his father died, leaving the family in penury. His first job was with a cinematographer, working as part of the lighting crew on the sets for 150 rupees a day. But the strapping young man with an imposing presence was advised to step in front of the camera and he started doing small roles in films and TV, says Mr Shiva Kumar, adding that his big break came in 2002. He burst into the limelight with Majestic - a film where he played a loveable thug, an anti-hero, that catapulted him to fame and made him into a star. It also won him legions of fans, says Muralidhar Khajane, film critic and author of a book on Kannada cinema. He became a hero for those from the marginalised sections of society. They identified with Darshan. In his early years, he was humble, hardworking and disciplined, says Mr Yogish, who worked closely with him on a film in 2005-2006. At the time, I predicted that hed become the darling of the masses. And he did. His films, Mr Shiva Kumar says, were very run of the mill, his roles repetitive and his acting was wooden, but he built a successful career playing an action hero. In many of his films, his character was the underdog, with a back story that was used as a justification for him taking law into his hands. And for over a decade, Darshan ruled the industry, along with Kichcha Sudeepa and Puneeth Rajkumar, the other two big Kannada stars. As he continued to deliver hit films, his fans affectionately nicknamed him D-Boss the boss and a challenging star - because nothing came easy to him, everything was a challenge, Mr Yogish says. But, Mr Khajane says, he could not manage this stardom and didnt know how to behave when success came to him. The actor was arrested in 2011 and spent four weeks in jail after Vijayalakshmi accused him of domestic violence. News reports from the time quote her police complaint as saying that Darshan assaulted her, threatened her with a revolver and burnt her with cigarette butts. Despite her very visible injuries, the industry and his fans continued to support him. His film Saarathi, which released while he was in jail, became a massive hit. He was released after his wife withdrew the case against him, some say in a truce brokered by the industry. After he came out, he travelled around the state on a sort of thanksgiving tour, apologising to his fans. He said, Please forgive me, Ive set a bad example, Mr Yogish remembers. Mr Khajane says after the episode, some in the industry who had supported him earlier started distancing themselves from him, but it did not affect his success at the box-office. And despite the grievous accusations hes facing now, the reaction in the industry has been muted, with just a handful of actors speaking openly about the case. Mr Khajane says in some cases, the reason behind the silence may be commercial interest. The industry is quiet because 1.5bn rupees is riding on him. If he goes to prison, three of his movies will have to be delayed or shelved. So they cant afford to ban him. Mr Yogish admits that Darshans arrest is a huge loss for the industry and says calls for a ban are premature since hes still being investigated and a man is innocent until proven guilty. My only request is let there be a legal trial, not a media trial. Im not saying he is innocent, but Darshan is being painted as a villain, hes being pronounced guilty even before a trial.

        "title": "Sri Lanka to advance in strong partnership with India to achieve development objectives - President",
        "date": "June 22, 2024 09:30 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his commitment to maintaining a strong partnership with India to achieve Sri Lankas development goals. Emphasizing the urgency to expedite joint initiatives, President Wickremesinghe highlighted a comprehensive agenda aimed at transformative bilateral projects. The President highlighted the importance of enhancing cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the energy sector, aiming to foster new development for the Northern region, which has been deeply affected by three decades of conflict. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while delivering a compelling vision for the future of Sri Lanka-India relations during his address at the 31st All India Partners Meet 2024 (AIPM 2024), held at ICT Ratnadipa in Colombo. The AIPM 2024 which was organised by KPGM Sri Lanka and India provided a platform for both countries to reaffirm their commitment to collaborative projects that promise to redefine bilateral relations and propel socio-economic growth. The 31st All India Partners Meet in Colombo, Sri Lanka from June 20-22, 2024, was collaboratively organized by KPMG in India and KPMG Sri Lanka. The annual meeting of the India Firm is one of the largest events hosted in Colombo, with over 600 India Partners and their families attending. It celebrated achievements from the past year and discussed future plans. A token of appreciation was extended to President Ranil Wickremesinghe by the Chief Executive Officer of KPMG in India Yezdi Nagporewalla and the Managing Partner KPMG Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaking at the ceremony, elaborated: Its a great pleasure and a privilege to have you in Sri Lanka, in Colombo, holding this meeting. It shows on one hand the close friendship that our two countries have, and on the other hand, the confidence that you have in Sri Lanka. Having now survived two difficult years, I must acknowledge that this was possible because India gave us a loan of 3.5 billion. All that will be repaid. We have already repaid the loan of 200 million that Bangladesh gave us. We have just concluded the board of directors meeting of the IMF, which was quite successful and are preparing thereafter to meet with our creditor nations, the Paris Club, India and others, who meet at the official creditors committee next week, and also carrying on discussions with China with the Exim Bank of China. Once we conclude the discussions, then we come to the next phase. With this, we are ready to sign the agreements with our official creditors and with the Exim Bank of China. So next week, on Wednesday, we will be meeting with the OCC, and also in the course of next week, we are carrying out discussions with the Exim Bank of China. And I hope by next week, or thereafter, that we will have come out of this phase of bankruptcy and into the next phase as we go ahead. Sri Lankas return to business signifies a pivotal decision-making phase. The key question is defining what this return entails. Returning to business as usual would mean continuing as an import-dependent economy, leading to on-going borrowing to fund imports and perpetuating a harmful cycle. Having faced this scenario before, the crucial question now is whether we are willing to repeat this path. Alternatively, the objective is to gradually shift towards becoming a competitive, export-oriented economy, marking a significant goal. Acknowledging the inherent challenges in this transformation, especially in Sri Lankas context, we have adopted a new approach: enacting legislative economic policies to effectively steer this transition. We will introduce policies aimed at achieving economic transformation: moving towards a highly competitive, digital, green, and export-oriented economy. These policies will establish benchmarks for foreign investments, export earnings, and reducing multi-dimensional povertya first in our region. Traditionally, policies in Sri Lanka have been subject to change with each new government. To address this, we have drafted the Economic Transformation Bill, currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny in Parliament and the courts. In addition to outlining policies, we are establishing new institutions such as the Economic Commission, which will assume responsibilities from the BOI to drive investment, a dedicated agency for managing investment zones, an International Trade Office to enhance global trade, and a National Productivity Commission to boost productivity. Furthermore, the Institute for Economics and International Trade will serve as a think tank, bringing together economists and experts to shape Sri Lankas economic strategies effectively. So this is broadly the route that we intend to take Second is the second eye, which I have taken on today, which are on my agenda, thats India. When I was in Delhi last week, I discussed with Prime Minister Modi the need to accelerate the joint program that we have decided, agreed on. So the major ones are identified, and Foreign Minister Jaishankar came down today to have a discussion. Now this will show the new path we are taking, and a number of projects, all will be in one parcel. It wont be individual projects. Weve discussed a fair number of them. First is the grid interconnection between Sri Lanka and India, so that sustainable energy can be transmitted to India, where you all need that very badly. We have the Sampur solar power project, which is a Government to Government (G2G) project, and a three island project, which is where we hope the ground breaking can take place in July. So thats the basis of our energy partnership, and we are looking at developing Polk Straight for wind energy and solar energy, both countries to get together and have a , large farm for solar energy, for renewable energy. It also means that we will have a new economy for the northern province, which was worst affected by the wars. In addition to energy, we have also discussed India helping us to expand the Kankasanturai port, which is the major port on the Jaffna Peninsula, and to ensure that more business comes into the port. We are also discussing with India on airport development, on the Palali airport, on the Colombo airport. The National Livestock Development Board of Sri Lanka, in collaboration with Indias Amul Dairy Company, has highlighted the program aimed at enhancing liquid milk production in the country. Thats the big project, which virtually the bulk of our, organized dairy industry. Additionally, there is a focus on a project to establish a land connectivity between Sri Lanka and India. Extensive discussions have also taken place regarding expediting the Trincomalee Development Project, which encompasses industrial investment zones and tourist areas. Furthermore, plans are underway to construct a multi-product oil pipeline from Nagapatnam to Trincomalee, pending the final observation report. Trincomalee is poised to become a hub for oil refining, with the development of ports and investment zones, transforming Trincomalee Port into a significant hub on the Bay of Bengal. Today, the entire East Coast is being opened up for tourism, with additional land earmarked for hotels in Galle and southern areas. Moreover, there are plans to establish more investment zones across the country, alongside expanding our professional training programs. In these endeavours, we are collaborating closely with India. In this momentous event, the Chief Executive Officer of KPMG in India Yezdi Nagporewalla praised President Ranil Wickremesinghes visionary leadership and unwavering dedication to the welfare of the Sri Lankan people, highlighting his role in guiding the nation towards a promising future amidst various challenges. He emphasized that the Presidents initiatives in advancing economic development, strengthening democratic institutions, and fostering societal cohesion have earned both national admiration and international acclaim, positioning Sri Lanka as a model nation. Highlighting the enhanced connectivity and collaboration between the two nations, Mr. Nagporewalla also described President Wickremesinghes presence at the assembly as a testament to the robust and enduring relationship between the countries, founded on shared values, mutual respect, and a commitment to global advancement. Several partners from other member firms of the KPMG Global network joined this meeting, while other leading Indian business and industry luminaries also participated in the event.",

        "date": "June 22, 2024 10:23 pm",
        "content": "The International Committee of the Red Cross says its offices in Gaza have been damaged by shelling, which killed 22 people who had sought shelter around its compound. Heavy-calibre projectiles landed within metres of the office and residences of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Friday afternoon, an ICRC statement said. It added that all parties had an obligation to take precautions to avoid harm to civilians and humanitarian facilities. On Saturday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said an initial inquiry found there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility. It said the incident would be quickly examined and the findings presented. Also on Saturday the EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU condemned the attack and called for an independent investigation and for those responsible to be held accountable. The strike damaged the structure of the ICRC office, which is surrounded by hundreds of displaced civilians living in tents, including many of our Palestinian colleagues, the ICRC said. This incident caused a mass casualty influx at the nearby Red Cross Field Hospital, with the hospital receiving 22 killed and 45 injured, with reports of additional casualties. The ICRC said the grave security incident was one of several in recent days. We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk, the statement added. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza gave different figures, saying 25 people had been killed and 50 injured in the shelling, which it blamed on Israel. On Saturday William Schomburg, head of the ICRC office in Rafah, described the scene of Fridays attack. There were many wounded, the scenes were horrific, frankly nothing that Ive ever seen before, he told the BBC from Rafah. We had an influx of children, women, young men all of whom had been extremely badly injured as a result of these explosions. We were able to transfer them to the nearby located Red Cross field hospital where we have dedicated teams working to try and save lives and to meet the needs of civilians during this conflicts, who have consistently lacked access to healthcare The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,551 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April. In another development, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned that spiralling hostilities between Israel and the Lebanese Islamist movement Hezbollah risk triggering a catastrophe for the region and beyond. Mr Guterres accused both sides of increasingly warlike rhetoric and called for an immediate de-escalation, saying the world could not afford for Lebanon to become another Gaza. The past months have seen a series of retaliatory cross-border strikes between Israel and Hezbollah. The Iran-backed group says it is fighting Israel to support its ally, Hamas, in Gaza.

        "date": "June 23, 2024 11:52 am",
        "content": "SriLankan Airlines will spread its wings across the Middle East region after acquiring more aircraft on lease this year to strengthen its fleet, its top official says. Richard Nuttall, chief executive officer of SriLankan Airlines, said fleet modernisation plays an important in the carriers turnaround as well as caters to growing passengers demand in the region. He said the airline will strengthen its current fleet of 21 to 22 in July, with plans to add three more aircraft within the next three months to increase the tally to 25 aircraft this year. We are aiming to boost SriLankan Airlines fleet with more leased aircraft that will help increase frequency on existing routes as well as add two or three new routes. The airline will place major orders for fleet replacement after its restructuring is completed under the International Monetary Funds (IMF) programme, Nuttall told Khaleej Times during his recent visit to Dubai. Nuttall was in Dubai to attend the International Air Transport Associations 80th annual general meeting and World Air Transport Summit in Dubai. He joined SriLankan Airlines as the chief commercial officer in November 2021 and was promoted to the position of chief executive officer in April 2022. Nuttall, an industry veteran, has a wealth of airline industry experience spanning three decades and five continents, having held multiple chief officer and board positions in aviation companies across the globe. He has previously worked for Saudia, Bahrain Air, Royal Jordanian, Kenyan Airways and Philippine Airlines, has an exceptional record of delivering performance improvement and driving sustainable growth. Im confident of rosy outlook of SriLankan as it continues to make significant strides in the airline industry despite a challenging environment. Weve been focusing on strategic initiatives to improve the airlines operations, enhance customer experience, and expand its global reach with the addition of new aircraft this year, Nuttall said. The 57-year-old chief executive from Yorkshire, England, expertise includes airline turnarounds; restructuring; strategy development; mentoring; global leadership; revenue management; network planning; airline distribution and sales and digital strategy. Progress on privatisation Nuttall said the privatisation of SriLankan is a part of the countrys IMF programme under which its balance sheet will be improved by restructuring the airlines debt. The government is working on a comprehensive strategy to support the airline through debt restructuring and then find a suitable buyer. It is a time-taking process and Im unable to give any time frame when it will be completed, he said. In reply to a question, he said the government has shortlisted three potential investors out of six candidates who submitted their expressions of interest in April. The government is now talking to three shortlisted companies and well see what happens in coming months. One of the consortium involves Qatari Not Qatar Airways and Indian investors who are keen to buy a majority stake in SriLankan Airlines, he said. Bright future Nuttall said the airline future is bright either the government opt for a privatisation or decide not to privatise it as restructuring process has put SriLankan on the right path. We just need 150-200 million to strengthen the fleet, expand our flight operations and sustain robust profits in coming years as the airline has shown remarkable results despite challenges in availability of widebody aircraft and engine issues. We have carried about 3.65 million passengers in 2023 and 1.15 million passengers during the first four months of 2024, he said. Referring to unaudited management accounts, he said the company recorded a profit of LKR8.72 billion, including an exchange gain of LKR31.44 billion, from April 2023 to March 2024 compared to LKR73.62 billion loss, including an exchange loss of LKR63.49 billion due to the Sri Lankan rupee depreciation, in the corresponding period from April 2022 to March 2023. To a question, he said SriLankan Airlines has codeshare agreements with Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, Oman Air and Gulf Air in the region. We have strong ties with all major airlines in GCC region. SriLankan currently operates daily flights to Colombo from the Gulf cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Riyadh and Kuwait. We also operate five times a week to Colombo from Dammam and three times a week to Colombo from Jeddah, he said. To a question about rising competition, he said SriLankan competes eight foreign airlines on one of its strongest routes (Colombo-Maldives) as it believes in quality of service. We are confident to increase our market share from 40 per cent to more than 50 per cent once we operate with our full fleet of 25-27 aircraft. The airline will gain more passengers on its flights to GCC, Indian and Far East route network, Nuttal concluded. Source: Khaleej Times --Agencies",

The team, led by veteran Chamaru Athapaththu has only lost one match out of the six ODI matches they played so far in 2024. Meanwhile, several players of the Sri Lanka womens team have also climbed up several spots in both ODI batting and bowling rankings after their brilliant individual performances.",

        "title": "Trump says foreigners who graduate from US colleges should get green cards",
        "date": "June 23, 2024 01:04 pm",
        "content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a podcast released on Thursday said that students graduating from U.S. colleges should get a green card to stay in the country, a proposal that runs counter to his hardline immigration stance. During the All-In podcast hosted by Silicon Valley tech investors, angel investor Jason Calacanis told Trump that the U.S. needs to be able to legally retain more high-skilled workers, a major issue for the tech industry. Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America? Calacanis said. I do promise, Trump said. But I happen to agree, otherwise I wouldnt promise... You graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country and that includes junior colleges too. A green card, also known as a permanent resident card, allows individuals the right to live and work permanently in the United States and is a step towards citizenship. It was not clear if Trump was referring to all foreigners, including those who came to the United States illegally or overstayed their visas, or only those people on student visas. Asked for comment, the Trump campaign said in a statement that only after the most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history would the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America be able to stay. The Biden campaign cast doubt on whether Trump would in fact enact the proposal he outlined on Thursday, given the hardline immigration stances he adopted during his 2017 to 2021 term. Every chance Donald Trump got in office, he made it his mission to rip apart immigrant families for his own political gain, said Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz. Trumps empty promise is both a lie and an insult, especially to the countless people that have been permanently damaged by his first-term in office. Immigration advocates were also unconvinced by Trumps proposal. I almost have to laugh because his administration adopted multiple policies aiming to restrict student visas and make it harder for people to stay in the country after graduating, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council. During his presidency, Trumps administration took steps aimed at curbing U.S. companies use of skilled foreign workers on H-1B visas, a key visa option for international students seeking to remain in the United States. During the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration tried to force tens of thousands of foreign students to leave the country if their schools held all classes online. Faced with lawsuits and strong opposition from colleges and universities, the administration later rescinded the order. Trump has vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected in the November election against Democrat Joe Biden, and has lambasted Bidens efforts to curb the record number of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally. Two of the All-In hosts, venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, hosted a swanky fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco earlier this month, raising some 12 million for his campaign. UKRAINE, ABORTION During the interview, Trump ruled out committing U.S. troops to Ukraine. I would guarantee it, he said, when asked if he would pledge not to put boots on the ground there. I wouldnt do it, no. Trump also appeared skeptical of creating a pathway for NATO membership for Ukraine. The Biden administration supports Ukraines eventual ascension into the mutual defense alliance. On abortion rights, Trump said he would not support a federal ban, echoing previous comments.

        "content": "Sri Lankas State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says that any reversal of the hard-earned reforms could result in a catastrophe for the country. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Semasinghe expressed that as the elections approach, it is concerning to see opposition parties and their main advisors expressing unrealistic views on managing the economy. Any reversal of the hard-earned reforms could result in a catastrophe for the country, he added. Furthermore, the Finance State Minister also noted that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international stakeholders have played a pivotal role in reshaping Sri Lankas economic landscape, which was in total chaos two years ago. I urge all opposition parties and their advisers to avoid making false promises that may not even offer short-term gains but definitely lead to long-term pain, Semasinghe expressed. Meanwhile, he also emphasized that it is crucial to prioritize the nations economic stability and progress over political games, requesting to engage in responsible discourse and ensure that our economic policies are based on sound and realistic principles, and a design of economic landscape with globally accepted and adopted good practices.",

        "date": "June 23, 2024 02:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that a nation cannot prosper under leaders who flee during times of crisis. He further highlighted that had he not taken charge during the countrys period of turmoil, he shuddered to think of the current state of affairs. These remarks were made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his attendance at a meeting of United National Party representatives from the Batticaloa District, held yesterday (22) at the Municipal Council Auditorium, Batticaloa. The President further elaborated that; I had the opportunity to engage with various political and public organizations in Batticaloa. Presently, our country faces significant challenges. During the previous administration, I consistently emphasized the necessity of maintaining a reserve of at least USD 03 billion to propel our economy forward. No political party endorsed this stance. What did Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna have to say about it? We were the sole advocates of this crucial initiative, often dismissed as spreading false propaganda. Irrespective of our political affiliations, we must uphold truthfulness for the sake of our nations future. In politics, honesty must always prevail. Amidst that struggle, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa proposed Mr. Sajith Premadasa to take charge of the country, but they declined the responsibility for the countrys future. Similarly, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, aspiring for leadership, remained conspicuously absent. It begs the question whether these individuals are fit to lead our country. Nevertheless, we stood steadfast against adversity and established a government. Presently, the country is emerging from bankruptcy. During that period, the opposition levelled numerous accusations, urging my resignation from both the roles of Prime Minister and President upon assuming leadership amidst challenges. What would have become of the country had I stepped down then? I steered the country through its most trying times. I undertook numerous initiatives that benefitted the people, actions that were neglected during the countrys financial turmoil. Even amidst the countrys economic collapse, we increased allowances for government employees and worked to double the Samurdhi allowance through the Aswasuma program. Initiatives were also launched to grant freehold land deeds to those who have no land rights. In Batticaloa district alone, I directed officials to issue freehold land deeds to over 27,000 individuals within just two months. If such measures were achievable during a financial crisis in a country, imagine what more can be accomplished for a country that has emerged from bankruptcy. The time has arrived for us all to unite, organize, and progress together. The event was attended by Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Head of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, General Secretary of the United National Party Palitha Range Bandara, District Organiser of the UNP in Batticaloa K. Mohan, Organizer of the UNP in Eraur M.A.M. Bilal, Zonal Organiser of the UNP in Batticaloa M.A. Nazar, group of former UNP local government members, regional organizers, party activists, and other participants. --PMD--",

        "date": "June 23, 2024 04:42 pm",
        "content": "The head of Indias National Testing Agency (NTA) has been dismissed following accusations of irregularities in recent exams for higher education. The government has also appointed a committee to recommend reforms in the fiercely competitive process. There have been calls to rerun a medical entrance test after thousands of candidates secured unusually high marks, prompting protests over alleged cheating. The National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) is the gateway to studying medicine in India. Millions of students sit the exam every year, but only a small percentage get good enough marks to secure a placement. The results announced on 4 June meant that even high-scorers found it difficult to do so. Since then, the exam has come under scrutiny for reasons ranging from errors in the question paper to unwarranted grace marks (compensatory marks) and fraud. Earlier this month federal Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan admitted that some irregularities had come to light. NTA chief Subodh Kumar Singh has come under intense criticism and on Saturday he was dismissed. A qualifying exam for PhD fellowships was also cancelled after the question paper was leaked on the dark web. The entrance test for post-graduate degrees in medicine, which was due to be sat on Sunday, has been postponed. Opposition parties and student groups have been holding protests across the country against the lapses, putting pressure on the recently reelected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

        "title": "Sri Lanka maintains a steadfast position on Gaza issue, says President Ranil",
        "date": "June 23, 2024 05:27 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas unwavering stance on the conflict in the Gaza Strip, emphasizing that Sri Lanka remains steadfast in supporting the establishment of the Palestinian state within five years. The President made these remarks during his participation in a special service held today (23) at the New Kathankudy Grand Jummah Mosque for the affected people of Gaza. The service was conducted by Maulavi Harith. In a significant display of solidarity, the New Kathankudy Grand Jummah Mosque donated ten million seven hundred and sixty-nine thousand four hundred and seventeen rupees (Rs. 10,769,417) to the Children of Gaza Fund, established under the Presidents directives to support children affected by the conflicts in Gaza. Trustees of the mosque presented the donation cheque to the President during the ceremony. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe engaged in friendly conversations with devotees attending the special service and took the opportunity to pose for several selfies with them, fostering a warm and inclusive atmosphere. Addressing the gathering the President further emphasized: Thank you for inviting me to this event during my visit to Batticaloa. This mosque stands as an exemplary showcase of Muslim art. The Katthankudy Muslims have been a community here since ancient times. My purpose in Batticaloa is to discuss the development initiatives. We aim to modernize agriculture, promote tourism and also to enhance educational standards in this province. Today, I was invited to this event in support of the Gaza Fund. The government maintains a steadfast position on the Gaza issue, which will not change. If Israel has issues with Hamas, retaliation should not be taken against the people of Gaza. It is crucial to assist Palestine in finding solutions. Our stance is to establish the Palestinian state within five years. It is essential to set a deadline because discussions have been ongoing over four to five decades. Therefore, we must take action according to a specific timeframe. If Israel faces security challenges, those should be addressed separately. However, the creation of the Palestinian state is imperative. The loss of many innocent lives deeply concerns us and we unequivocally condemn it. The Government of Sri Lanka has initiated the Gaza Fund to assist children affected by the Gaza conflict. As the first step, we donated USD one million. Despite being a small county and facing economic challenges, we have contributed this amount. We urge the public to support this cause and I express sincere gratitude for every donation received. The issue of burial has been a significant concern over the Muslim community in the country. Initially, a separate committee was appointed, deviating from the guidelines of the World Health Organization, which created problems and caused grief among the Muslim community. In response, the government has decided to introduce new legislation allowing individuals to choose between burial and cremation according to their wishes. Additionally, provisions have been made for bodies to be donated to medical faculties if desired. These measures aim to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. My foremost priority has been to revive the countrys faltering economy, a goal we anticipate achieving in a short span of time. Following this, our focus will shift towards addressing other national issues. Furthermore, the Urumaya program has been launched to grant freehold land rights to the people. Governor of the Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Members of Parliament A. L. M. Ataullah, Ali Zahir Maulana, Former Minister of State M. L. M. Hizbullah, Chairman of New Kathankudi Grand Jumma Mosque K. L. M. Farid, Chief Priest Ilham Moulavi, former Mayor of the Batticaloa Municipal Council A. H. M. Asfar, Chairman of Kathankudy Mosques A. M.

        "content": "Prof. Channa Jayasumana says that the recent statement made by leader of the National Peoples Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake regarding the chronic kidney disease spreading associated with agricultural communities in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts is completely false. The Parliamentarian, who was a researcher on epidemic kidney disease in agricultural communities in Sri Lanka, alleged that research has already confirmed the cause of kidney disease in these areas. There is nothing new to discover about this, nor any new treatment to be found. We have been conducting research on the matter for 15 years, and all the facts have been revealed, he said. Two main causes have been identified for this kidney disease: one is the impact of certain types of agrochemicals, and the other is long-term dehydration. The solution is to provide clean drinking water to the people in these areas. We have been supplying drinking water to these areas through water filtrations systems continuously since 2011. As a result, this agricultural kidney disease is being reduced, Jayasumana expressed. This statement was made by Mr. Anura Kumara after seeing a large crowd, he charged. On Saturday (22), NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the cause of the chronic kidney disease that is spreading in the agricultural communities associated with the North Central Province will be identified through research in near future under an NPP government. He had made this remark while addressing a farmers rally of the National Peoples Power held in Dehiattakandiya yesterday.",
