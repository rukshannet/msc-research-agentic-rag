        "date": "August 15, 2024 03:06 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of women marched across several Indian cities overnight and Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for strict punishment for crimes against women, as outrage and protests against the gruesome rape and murder of a doctor escalated. Holding candles and posters that said reclaim the night, women held marches across cities, including the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, where the rape and murder of a trainee doctor last week has triggered protests by fellow medics, demanding better and safer working conditions. Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice for the victim. The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime. As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage, Modi said in an address to the nation on its 78th Independence Day on Thursday. The rape has revived memories of a similar case in New Delhi in 2012, when a gang of men raped and severely injured a 23-year-old student in a moving Delhi bus, leading eventually to her death. This horrific incident has once again reminded us that women disproportionately bear the weight of ensuring their own safety, Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt said in a post on her Instagram page, which has more than 85 million followers. Doctors in Indias crowded and often squalid government hospitals have long complained of being overworked and underpaid, and say not enough is done to curb violence levelled at them by people angered over the medical care on offer. Crimes against women in India rose 4 in 2022 from the previous year, data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), released late last year, showed. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Google confirms Iranian group trying to access emails linked to both US presidential campaigns",
        "date": "August 15, 2024 03:27 pm",
        "content": "Google said Wednesday that an Iranian group linked to the countrys Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump since May. The tech companys threat intelligence arm said the group is still actively targeting people associated with Biden, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate last month when he dropped out. It said those targeted have included current and former government officials, as well as presidential campaign affiliates. The new report from Googles Threat Analysis Group affirms and expands on a Microsoft report released Friday that revealed suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in this years U.S. presidential election. It sheds light on how foreign adversaries are ramping up their efforts to disrupt the election that is now less than three months away. Googles report said its threat researchers detected and disrupted a small but steady cadence of the Iranian attackers using email credential phishing, a type of cyberattack where the attacker poses as a trusted sender to try to get an email recipient to share their login details. John Hultquist, chief analyst for the companys threat intelligence arm, said the company sends suspected targets of these attacks a Gmail popup that warns them that a government-backed attacker might be trying to steal their password. The report said Google observed the group gaining access to one high-profile political consultants personal Gmail account. Google reported the incident to the FBI in July. Microsofts Friday report had shared similar information, noting that the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign had been compromised and weaponized to send a phishing email to a high-ranking campaign official. The group is familiar to Googles threat intelligence arm and other researchers, and this isnt the first time it has tried to interfere in U.S. elections, Hultquist said. The report noted that the same Iranian group targeted both the Biden and Trump campaigns with phishing attacks during the 2020 cycle, as early as June of that year. The group also has been prolific in other cyber espionage activity, particularly in the Middle East, the report said. In recent months, as the Israel-Hamas War has aggravated tensions in the region, that activity has included email phishing campaigns targeted at Israeli diplomats, academics, non-governmental organizations and military affiliates. Trumps campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame. The same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, though it wasnt clear whether the leaked documents were related to the suspected Iranian cyber activity. The Washington Post and The New York Times also received the documents. While the Trump campaign hasnt provided specific evidence linking Iran to the hack, both Trump and his longtime friend and former adviser Roger Stone have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions. Stones email was compromised by hackers targeting Trumps campaign, a person familiar with the matter said. Google and Microsoft wouldnt identify the people targeted in the Iranian intrusion attempts or confirm that Stone was among them. Google did confirm that the Iranian group in its report, which it calls APT42, is the same as the one in Microsofts research. Microsoft refers to the group as Mint Sandstorm. Harris campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, but has said it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and isnt aware of any security breaches of its systems. The FBI on Monday confirmed that its investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign. The reports of Iranian hacking come as U.S. intelligence officials have warned of persistent and mounting efforts from both Russia and Iran to influence the U.S. election through their online activity. Beyond these hacking incidents, groups linked to the countries have used fake news websites and social media accounts to churn out content that appears intended to sway voters opinions. While neither Microsoft nor Google specified Irans intentions in the U.S. presidential race, U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehrans efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. Irans mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. We do not accord any credence to such reports, the mission told The Associated Press. The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Googles report. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The Government of Canada first listed the LTTE as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code on 6 April 2006 and it is a statutory requirement to undertake a review every five years. The latest review process concluded in June 2024. The continued listing of the LTTE by the Government of Canada is presently the third consecutive ban on the LTTE in recent times, with the extensions on proscription of the LTTE having also taken place in India and the European Union, in addition to the judgement of dismissal by the Proscribed Organisations and Appeal Commission (POAC) in the United Kingdom on the application made for the de-proscription of the LTTE in the UK, this year.",

        "content": "An Australian Federal Court judge has slammed the Home Affairs Department for failing to properly scrutinise a Sri Lankan diplomat who confiscated a staffers passport and gave her just two days leave in three years, Australian media reported today. Sri Lankas former deputy high commissioner to Australia has been ordered to pay 543,000 in unpaid wages and interest to a domestic worker and now faces a large fine for breaches of employment laws. Himalee Arunatilaka, who served in Canberra from 2015 to 2018, denied her employee, Priyanka Danaratna, minimum pay and conditions during time in Australia, the court found. Justice Elizabeth Raper found Ms Danaratna worked from 6am to 10pm, seven days a week and was only allowed two days off in that time after she burnt her hand with cooking oil. Over the period, she was paid just 11,200  around 75 an hour  which was sent to Sri Lanka. Ms Danaratna also was denied permission to leave the Canberra residence alone, and had her passport confiscated. In addition to handing down a damning judgment for Ms Arunatilaka, Justice Raper suggested that if the Home Affairs Department had taken a closer look, Ms Danaratnas employment may have been very different. It is not without concern that it would have been clear to Home Affairs, by reason of the materials provided ... that Ms Danaratna was not going to be paid nor enjoy the protections under the Award or the FW Act, she wrote. There was no apparent attempt to conceal the arrangement by Ms Arunatilaka. It is perplexing that the department, in the circumstances, did nothing and granted the visa in the circumstances. Himalee Arunatilaka currently serves as Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) in Geneva. The case is one of several recent examples where diplomats from countries with poor employment practices have been caught failing to comply with employment laws and have been hit with big penalties in Australia. The Australian Federal Court last year ordered Indias high commissioner between 2015 and 2016 Navdeep Suri Singh to pay 189,000 in unpaid wages and interest to Seema Shergill, who was found to be working in slave-like conditions in the chief diplomats residence. Justice Raper also ordered Mr Suri to pay a 97,200 fine for wage theft, the maximum amount allowed. Mr Suri brought Seema Shergill to Australia when he started in 2015. When they arrived in Australia, he confiscated Ms Shergills passport and confined her to the familys Canberra residence. Neither Ms Arunatilaka nor Mr Suri defended the legal actions against them, and it is not clear whether the claimants in either case will ever see a cent of the amounts awarded. The cases were only possible because the Federal Court recognised that the residual immunity granted former diplomats does not extend to employees in their direct employment, who are covered by Australian fair work laws. Clayton Utz pro bono Partner David Hillard, who led both matters along with Canberra barrister Prue Bindon, said these were not isolated cases. It is the second Federal Court matter in less than a year involving domestic workers at diplomatic residences in Canberra, Mr Hillard said. Domestic workers in foreign diplomatic residences are among the most vulnerable and isolated workers in Australia. It is hard to conceive of someone in 21st century Australia literally being trapped in a job for three years and earning 75 cents an hour. This decision  confirms clearly that these workers have rights in Australia, and that senior diplomats cannot hide behind diplomatic immunity when it comes to keeping their servants under slave-like arrangements. Ms Arunatilaka was in 2023 appointed Sri Lankas ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva. Source: Australian Financial Review --Agencies",

        "date": "August 15, 2024 08:47 pm",
        "content": "Following an invitation by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka, the European Union has decided to deploy an Election Observation Mission (EOM) to Sri Lanka to observe the Presidential Election scheduled for 21 September 2024. The EU has a long history of accompanying electoral processes in Sri Lanka and has deployed EOMs on six occasions, the last in 2019, reflecting the EUs commitment and partnership with the country. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, has appointed Nacho Sánchez Amor, Member of the European Parliament, as Chief Observer. The High Representative stated: The deployment of the Election Observation Mission in Sri Lanka this year confirms our long-standing commitment to supporting credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections in the country. For the EU, observing the election is a way to support the Sri Lankan people and their efforts to strengthen democratic institutions, in line with our multidimensional and sustainable partnership with the country. The Chief Observer declared: I am honoured to lead the EU EOM to Sri Lanka. The forthcoming presidential election will give a new impetus to democracy following to the 2022 political and economic crisis. This election is important for Sri Lanka to continue making progress on its path of reforms and lasting recovery, in full respect of democratic values. Background The EU EOM is deployed at the express invitation of the host country and is led by a Chief Observer. It is comprised of different groups of observers. The Core Team consists of a Deputy Chief Observer and nine election experts who will arrive in Colombo on 13 August 2024. Later in August, 26 long-term observers will join the mission and be deployed across the country to follow the election campaign. Thereafter, 32 short-term observers will reinforce the mission on election week, also deployed throughout the country. The EU EOM will remain in the country until the completion of the electoral process. In line with the EU methodology on election observation, the mission will issue a preliminary statement and hold a press conference in Colombo after the election. A final report, including recommendations for future electoral processes, will be presented and shared with national authorities and stakeholders after the finalisation of the entire electoral process Source: European Times --Agencies",

        "date": "August 15, 2024 09:41 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Open and Accountable Government, Member of Parliament Jagath Kumara Sumitraarachchi, recently informed the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration to take immediate action to issue passports in a way that does not inconvenience the public. This was discussed when the Department of Immigration and Emigration was summoned to the Sectoral Oversight Committee on An Open and Accountable Government to consider the new Immigration Bill, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Addressing the meeting, the Immigration and Emigration Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya said that nearly 1 million passports had been issued in 2023, but only 23 of them had been used and the remaining 77 of passports had not been used. Also, he added that since the electronic passport (E-Passport) is to be introduced by the end of October, there is a possibility to request the new e- passport from some countries and accordingly, the department requests the non-essential public to refrain from getting passports. The Chair of the Committee pointed out that people should be informed about this as much as possible. However, the Chair also emphasized that it is the responsibility of the Immigration and Emigration Department to issue the requested passports so that the people are not inconvenienced, as it is the right of the people to get passports after paying money. If not, the Chair of the Committee Jagath Kumara Sumitraarachchi pointed out that the department as well as the government will be deeply displeased by the people. Also, the officials of the Immigration and Emigration Department said that the obstacles to obtaining passports for pilgrims traveling to India and Nepal will be promptly removed. While considering the new Immigration Bill, the Committee inquired the provisions of the bill from the officials. Immigration and Emigration Controller General Harsha Ilukpitiya said that the drafting of this bill, which was presented to Parliament on June 20, 2024 by the Minister of Public Security, commenced in 2017. This new bill has been prepared by amending the issue of travel documents, the Immigrants and Emigrants Act and the Passport (Regulation) and Exit Permit Act, No. 53 of 1971 to suit the current social and technological situation. He also mentioned that since this bill has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the relevant determination has been announced to the Parliament, the related amendments will be made. It was also revealed that this bill has provided provisions to fill the gaps in the immigration laws of this country. The Controller General pointed out that for the first time, the necessary legal provisions have been made by this new bill especially for Human Smuggling, which has not had any laws in this country so far. Also, this new bill has enacted new laws including the legal provisions necessary for the department to move forward with the new technology as well as the provisions applicable to people staying illegally in the country. Mr. Ilukpitiya further mentioned that this bill was prepared after considering the opinions and suggestions of several experts. It was also discussed in the committee that this bill, which has been delayed for a long time, is a very important bill, the Parliamentary Communications Department added. Also, the committees attention was drawn to filling the vacancies of the employees of the Immigration and Emigration Department. The chair of the committee also advised to submit the related proposal to the committee. Giving approval to the bill, the committee chair said that in order to implement this bill more successfully, the department should proceed with new technology. The committee also informed the Immigration and Emigration Department to provide the related proposals to the committee within 2 weeks to remove the existing obstacles. Also, the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration stated that the procurement process of electronic passports (e - Passports) is in the final stage and 5 million electronic passports will be received by the end of October 2024. Officials representing the Ministry of Public Security, the Attorney Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department also attended the meeting. Members of Parliament John Seneviratne, Udayana Kiridigoda, Gunathilaka Rajapaksa, Jayantha Weerasinghe, Ishaq Rahuman, Sudath Manjula, Kumarasiri Ratnayake and Madhura Withanage were also present in this committee meeting.",

        "date": "August 16, 2024 10:47 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the Puluwan Sri Lanka agreement, signed by 34 political parties and alliances, was not intended to create a new political party but to unite the nation and build a brighter future for the country and its people. He noted that those who signed this agreement are not individuals who shied away from the economic challenges, but rather, they are people who embraced these challenges, believing in the potential to rebuild the country. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during the opening ceremony of the Puluwan Sri Lanka agreement signing, held this morning (16) at the Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla. The convention was jointly signed by 34 political parties in support of the President for the upcoming presidential election. The ceremony was consecrated and blessed by the Maha Sangha with Seth Pirith, and religious rites were also performed by clergy from other faiths. In his address, the President stated that while other candidates may ask for votes by claiming to be the best fit to lead the country, he urged the people to vote in this presidential election with their own future in mind, rather than focusing on the future of politicians. He also remarked that had the countrys economy been allowed to collapse, holding a presidential election today would not have been possible. He added that he is conducting this years presidential election to secure the countrys future. Expressing his views further President Wickremesinghe said; The Puluwan Sri Lanka agreement was signed to demonstrate unity and commitment to building the future of the country and its people, rather than simply forming a political party. This agreement was made by individuals who did not shy away from challenges but chose to face them head-on. When the countrys economic and political systems collapsed, and the nation faced a difficult situation, some political leaders abandoned their responsibilities. Leadership was forgotten, and they were afraid to confront the countrys problems. When I took over the country, there was no party standing behind me. However, the Prime Minister, ministers, and a group of parliament members joined me, believing that the country could be rebuilt. It was because of this belief and determination that we are now able to hold a presidential election. Had the economy collapsed back then, there would not have been an opportunity for this election. This is something everyone should remember. The purpose of this presidential election is to confirm the progress of the country. While other candidates are asking for votes, claiming to be the best person to lead the country, I am asking all the people to vote with their own future and the future of their children in mind. Lets move forward together with Sri Lanka. We inherited a bankrupt country, an era of queues for fuel, gas, food, and medicine. We had no money, with some days not even a million dollars available. We had to make tough decisions to lift the country out of bankruptcy, and these were not easy choices. Just as a parent or family member might have to make difficult decisions when caring for a sick child, we made these decisions for the sake of the country. We extend our gratitude to the people who endured the hardships during these challenging times. We took over a nation with a collapsed economy and have since managed to control inflation and increase foreign reserves. This progress was achieved in partnership with the people. While others were calling for the government to step down and claiming that the situation was unsolvable, even taking their grievances to Geneva, we focused on delivering results. We provided Samurdhi benefits to the people at three times the previous amount, despite the countrys significant financial difficulties. We also provided 10 kilograms of rice for two months to low-income families and granted land rights through the Urumaya program. Housing rights were given to lowincome individuals living in Colombo apartments, and the salaries of government employees were increased by Rs. 10,000, with another salary increase planned for next year. No previous government has undertaken such initiatives. Additionally, the wages of plantation workers were raised. The question now is whether to continue this program or abandon it halfway. We engaged in negotiations with 18 countries and 21 institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, to establish economic stability in this country. To continue along this path, we must adhere to the agreements in place. Any amendments would require renegotiating with these 21 countries and institutions, a process that took us two years to complete and would take another two years to revise. However, we cannot afford to go another year without these concessions. We must decide whether to allow this system to collapse and risk losing the financial gains we have made. We also need to consider how to move forward, building a developed country and creating a better future for our youth. The future of our nation is at stake. While some only think five to six years ahead, Gen Z looks 20 to 30 years into the future, and many are contemplating leaving the country due to concerns about their prospects. Our responsibility is to build this country for them, ensuring they have a future here. We have emerged as a new force, uniting when the countrys political parties were in disarray. It is essential to continue this program for another five years, during which a new leadership would have been born in this country, one that we havent seen in recent times. It is crucial to move forward with this team, with the aim of building a stronger nation. Our goal is to develop Sri Lanka by fostering the growth of our villages and uniting the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena When a nation is rebuilt from a state of collapse, its people will never forget the leader who spearheaded that transformation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stands as the sole leader who accepted the responsibility of rebuilding the countrys economy during one of its most challenging periods. With the support of 134 members of parliament, the President successfully led the government through this crisis. President Wickremesinghe has laid a strong foundation for the future by upholding the peoples right to a secure life. When comparing the leaders running in this years presidential election, there is no one who matches the current Presidents parliamentary history, government experience, and international relationships. Therefore, we must acknowledge that all our political leaders are united in securing his victory, which will be a victory for the nation. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, representing the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, Nimal Siripala de Silva, and Mahinda Amaraweera from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, alongside Ramesh Pathirana and Prasanna Ranatunga of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, Presidents Counsel M.

        "title": "Daughter of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin will be nominated as new leader in parliamentary vote",
        "date": "August 16, 2024 11:04 am",
        "content": "Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, will be nominated as the countrys new prime minister in a parliamentary vote, her party and its coalition partners said Thursday. The move follows the removal of former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin by court order over an ethical violation a day earlier. Leaders of the 11 party-coalition led by Paetongtarns populist Pheu Thai party declared their support for her at a news conference on Thursday after the partys secretary-general Sorawong Thienthong announced her candidacy. Paetongtarn thanked her party and the coalition partners for their support, adding she is ready to move the country forward. I have confidence in Pheu Thai. I have confidence in all government coalition parties to bring our country out of the economic crisis, she said. Pheu Thai had campaigned heavily on improving Thailands sluggish economy. If Paetongtarn is approved in Parliaments vote, which is scheduled for Friday, she will become Thailands second female prime minister and the countrys third leader from the Shinawatra family, after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. Thaksin was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. His residual popularity and influence is a factor behind the political support for Paetongtarn. Srettha was ousted on Wednesday after less than a year in office. The Constitutional Court found him guilty of a serious ethical breach over his appointment of a Cabinet member who was jailed in connection with an alleged bribery attempt. Paetongtarn said she respects Srettha and thinks what happened to him was unfortunate, but added: The country must move on. It was the second major ruling in a week to shake Thai politics. The same court last week dissolved the progressive and main opposition Move Forward party, which won last years general election but was blocked from power, saying it violated the constitution by proposing an amendment to a law against defaming the countrys royal family. The party has already regrouped as the Peoples Party. Pheu Thai finished second in last years election but was given a chance to form a government after the winners, the reformist Move Forward party, was blocked from taking power by the previous Senate, a military-appointed body. Move Forward was then excluded from the coalition by Pheu Thai, which went on to join hands with parties affiliated with the previous military-backed government that ousted it in a coup. The move drew criticism from some of its supporters but party officials say it was necessary to break the deadlock and start reconciliation after decades of deep political divisions. The former senators were given special power to veto a prime ministerial candidate by the constitution adopted in 2017 under a military government. However, that power expired when their term ended in May. New members of the Senate, selected in a convoluted process last month, do not retain the veto. A candidate now needs just a majority from the lower house, or at least 247 votes. The House of Representatives now has 493 sitting members after six were banned from politics as a result of Move Forwards dissolution. Another lawmaker in the Bhumjaithai party, which finished third in the election and is Pheu Thais major partner in the coalition, is suspended awaiting a court ruling. While Pheu Thais coalition endorsed Paetongtarns candidacy, some of its key partners have reiterated that they would not support a proposal to amend the royal defamation law which became a key issue during last years election. Pheu Thai discussed the issue during the election campaign but has spoken about it less since taking power. The law, also known as Article 112 in Thailands criminal codes, protects the monarchy from criticism with penalties of up to 15 years in jail per offense. Critics say the law is often wielded as a tool to quash political dissent. The Peoples Party, the new home for lawmakers of the dissolved Move Forward party, said Thursday it will not vote to approve a candidate from Pheu Thai on Friday. Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut said the party will continue its duty as an opposition. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Pakistan has detected three patients with the mpox virus, the health department in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said on Friday. The viral infection was detected in the patients on their arrival from the United Arab Emirates, the department said. The World Health Organization has declared recent outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern after a new variant of the virus has been identified. Pakistan has had cases of mpox, also called monkeypox, previously. It was not immediately clear which variant was detected in the patients. Two of the patients had been confirmed to have mpox, said Salim Khan, the director general of health services for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A third patients samples had been sent to the National Health Institute in the capital, Islamabad, for confirmation, he said, adding all three patients were being quarantined. A spokesperson for Pakistans national health ministry said Pakistan has detected one suspected case of mpox. Global health officials on Thursday confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden and linked it to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent a day after the World Health Organization declared the disease a global public health emergency. The WHO on Wednesday declared the outbreak in Africa a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert, after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in Congo since the current outbreak began in January 2023. The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever and can make some people very ill, the WHO website says. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 16, 2024 11:36 am",
        "content": "Thailands Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the youngest daughter of the divisive former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, as the countrys new prime minister Friday. Paetongtarn becomes Thailands third leader from the Shinawatra family, after her father, who was ousted by coup before returning from exile last year, and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, who lives in exile. Paetongtarn also became Thailands second female prime minister after her aunt and the countrys youngest leader at 37. She is the leader of the ruling Pheu Thai party but was not an elected lawmaker, which was not required for her to be a candidate for prime minister. Paetongtarn was the sole nominee and got a majority of the votes in Parliament with the voting ongoing. The last prime minister had been removed by the Constitutional Court two days ago over an ethics violation. Thaksin is one of Thailands most popular but divisive political figures and was ousted by a military coup in 2006. He is widely seen as a de facto leader of Pheu Thai, the latest in a string of parties linked to him. His residual popularity and influence is a factor behind the political support for Paetongtarn. Her public entry into politics came in 2021 when the Pheu Thai party announced she would lead an inclusion advisory committee. She was appointed as leader of Pheu Thai last year, after she was named one of its three prime ministerial candidates ahead of the polls. When Paetongtarn was on the campaign trail for Pheu Thai, she acknowledged her family ties but insisted she was not just her fathers proxy. Its not the shadow of my dad. I am my dads daughter, always and forever, but I have my own decisions, she told a reporter. However, her fathers shadow is too big to be dismissed and her work will not be easy with him continuing to call political shots for Pheu Thai, said Petra Alderman, a political research fellow at Englands University of Birmingham. Thaksin was a political force to reckon with, but he was also a liability, she said, He has a tendency to overplay his political hand, so serving in his shadow has never been easy. Paetongtarns nomination followed the removal of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday after less than a year in office. The Constitutional Court found him guilty of a serious ethical breach regarding his appointment of a Cabinet member who was jailed in connection with an alleged bribery attempt. It was the second major ruling in a week to shake Thai politics. The same court last week dissolved the progressive Move Forward party, which won last years general election but was blocked from taking power. The party has already regrouped as the Peoples Party. Pheu Thai and its predecessors had won all national elections since 2001, with core populist policies pledging to solve economic problems and bridge income equality, until it lost to the reformist Move Forward in 2023. It, however, was given a chance to form a government after Move Forward was blocked from taking power by the previous Senate, a military-appointed body. Move Forward was excluded from the coalition by Pheu Thai, which went on to join hands with parties affiliated with the military government that ousted it in a coup. The move drew criticism from some of its supporters but party officials say it was necessary to break the deadlock and start reconciliation after decades of deep political divisions. Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after years in exile in what was interpreted as part of a political bargain between Pheu Thai and their longstanding rivals in the conservative establishment to stop Move Forward Party from forming a government. The former senators were given special power to veto a prime ministerial candidate by the constitution adopted in 2017 under a military government. However, that power expired when their term ended in May. New members of the Senate, selected in a convoluted process last month, do not retain the veto. A candidate now needs just a majority from the lower house, or at least 247 votes. The current 11 party-coalition led by Pheu Thai now has 314 lawmakers in the lower house, and they have declared their unanimous support for Paetongtarn. The coalition under the leadership of Paetongtarn could strengthen their unity because Paetongtarn possesses something that Srettha does not  a direct line to her powerful father who has the final say  said Napon Jatusripitak, a political science researcher at Singapores ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. In a strange way, it creates a clear chain of command and curbs factionalism, he said. Paetongtarn will be given clear jurisdictions on where she can exercise her own agency and where it is a matter between her father and the coalition members. With Move Forward dissolved and the partys only prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat banned from political activities, Napon believes its the time that the rest of major political parties resume a game of musical chairs of the premiership race that has been put on hold with an agreement to share power, regardless of who becomes the prime minister. Most importantly, the overarching goal remains the same: to keep the music playing and exclude the reformists from power, he said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 16, 2024 01:07 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) predicts that the headline inflation is expected to be below the target in the forthcoming months, and reach the 5 target with appropriate policies in the medium term. In its monetary policy report for the month of August 2024, the CBSL has highlighted that the economic growth recovery towards the potential level is expected to continue over the medium term with appropriate policies. Furthermore, it mentioned that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka conducts monetary policy under a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework, aimed at maintaining inflation at the target rate of 5, while supporting economic growth to reach its potential. The Economic Research Department of the CBSL released its second Monetary Policy Report for 2024 in keeping with the requirements of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 of 2023, based on information that the Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank considered in formulating the monetary policy decision during the July 2024 review. The Monetary Policy Report provides forward-looking insights about the economy, particularly in terms of inflation and economic growth. The Report also aims to provide an assessment of risks to the projections on inflation and economic growth, considering the ongoing and expected developments on domestic and global fronts, the CBSL said. Meanwhile, the key highlights of the report include; Following a temporary rise in early 2024, headline inflation declined notably thereafter due to reductions in energy prices, a slowdown in food inflation, and subdued demand conditions. Headline inflation is expected to remain well below the targeted level of 5 per cent (yearon-year) in the near term, and gradually stabilise around the targeted level over the medium term. Economic activity continued to rebound in 2024, supported by the gradual restoration of macroeconomic stability, low interest rates and improving investor confidence. The Sri Lankan economy is expected to continue its growth momentum in 2024, gradually moving towards its potential level over the medium term.",

        "date": "August 16, 2024 03:17 pm",
        "content": "Japan grounded hundreds of flights and urged tens of thousands of people to evacuate in the eastern parts of the country on Friday, as a strong typhoon caused power blackouts in the middle of a major summer holiday week. Typhoon Ampil, categorised as very strong by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), was situated off the Pacific coast of Japans main island at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT). The agency has two higher categories - very strong and violent. The typhoon is expected to get close to the eastern region of Kanto, which includes the capital Tokyo, on Friday evening. Ampil has wind speeds of 45 metres per second with maximum gust of 60 metres per second (216 kph134 mph), according to the JMA. The Kanto region is expected to experience fierce winds that could cause injuries from flying debris or even overturn trucks in motion, the JMA warned on its website. Iwaki City in Fukushima Prefecture in northeastern Japan issued an evacuation order for about 323,000 residents, telling them to evacuate as the likelihood of heavy rain was increasing through Saturday morning. Mobara City in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo also placed an evacuation order for about 18,500 residents, while dozens of other cities opened special evacuation centres and advised voluntary evacuation. More than 2,500 households in the Kanto area were still experiencing blackouts in the afternoon, the Tokyo Electric Power Co said. ANA Holdings said it will cancel 281 domestic flights and 54 international flights slated to leave or arrive on Friday, affecting nearly 70,000 passengers. The airline later said it will cancel 32 domestic flights into or out of Tokyos Haneda airport on Saturday, disrupting travel plans for about 2,300 passengers. Japan Airlines is planning to cancel 281 domestic and 38 international flights on Friday, affecting about 50,000 passengers.

        "content": "The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in India and Kankesanthurai (KKS) near Jaffna in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, which was earlier launched in October 2023, has resumed on Friday (August 16) after repeated delays. The ferry Sivagangai run by a private operator, IndSri Ferry Services, completed its maiden journey between Nagapattinam and KKS in approximately 4 hours with around 50 passengers on board. The passengers were welcomed at the KKS port by the Consul General of India at Jaffna. This resumption of ferry service is a testament to the broader effort to enhance maritime connectivity between India and Sri Lanka, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka said. In order to make service more affordable for passengers, Government of India has decided to provide financial assistance of over LKR 25 million per month, for a period of one year, to cover relevant charges and operating costs at Nagapattinam port. Similarly, the Government of Sri Lanka has reduced the deviation tax currently charged to passengers leaving Sri Lanka by passenger vessels and ships. It would be recalled that Government of India has also extended a grant assistance of USD 63.65 million to Government of Sri Lanka for rehabilitation of the KKS Harbour, which was earlier envisaged to be undertaken under a Line of Credit. This is line with Indias commitment to supporting Sri Lankas economic recovery and its journey towards progress and prosperity, in close partnership with India, the statement said. The resumption of this service underscores the commitment of both countries to strengthening bilateral relations through improved connectivity, as highlighted in the vision document for economic partnership jointly adopted during the visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in July 2023. Future plans include the exploration of additional routes and services that will further expand connectivity and economic collaboration, the Indian High Commission added.",

        "date": "August 17, 2024 09:14 am",
        "content": "Palestinian health officials on Friday reported the first case of polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in the Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, the first case in years in the coastal enclave that has been engulfed in the Israel-Hamas war since Oct. 7. After discovering the childs symptoms, tests were conducted in Jordans capital of Amman and the case was confirmed to be polio, the health officials said. The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under the age of 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where the spread of polio has never been stopped. The World Health Organization did not immediately respond to requests to confirm the case. However, U.N. health and childrens agencies have called for seven-day pauses in the fighting, starting at the end of August, to vaccinate 640,000 Palestinian children against polio. They said the polio virus had been discovered in wastewater in two major cities last month in Gaza, which has been polio-free for the last 25 years, according to the United Nations. The humanitarian community has warned of the re-emergence of polio since the latest war erupted when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israels devastating retaliatory offensive has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza in the 10-month-long conflict and created a dire humanitarian situation, which health officials say has created a public health emergency. In July, WHO said a variant of type 2 was discovered in wastewater samples from southern Khan Younis and central Deir al-Balah, linked to a variant of the polio virus last detected in Egypt last year. While WHO did not confirm the polio case, it said earlier on Friday that three children in Gaza were found with acute flaccid paralysis  the onset of weakness or paralysis with reduced muscle tone, a common symptom of polio. The childrens stool samples have been sent for testing to the Jordan National Polio Laboratory, the agency said. More than 1.6 million doses of the polio vaccine are expected to arrive in Gaza by the end of August, WHO said, in time for the vaccination campaigns which would have to be conducted in two rounds. Children under 10 will be given two drops of the oral vaccine against type 2 of the polio virus. Health officials in Gaza warned they would not be able to stop the spread of polio and treat people without an urgent cease-fire in place. The stark warning came as international mediators expressed hope that a cease-fire deal is within reach. Two days of talks had wrapped up in Qatar on Friday, the mediators said, adding that they plan to reconvene in Cairo next week to seal an agreement to stop the fighting. The mediators have spent months trying to hammer out a three-phase plan in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

The Police Media Division said that the arrest was made following a tip-off from a local jewellery shop manager who became suspicious of the currency notes when the suspect attempted to purchase gold jewellery. The suspect had entered the shop and produced a bundle of Rs. 5,000 notes on Friday (17), claiming that he wished to purchase a gold chain. However, the manager, noticing discrepancies in the currency notes, had informed the police in this regard. Upon inspection, police officers have found 102 counterfeit Rs. 5,000 notes and a pen drive in the suspects possession. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the suspect had printed the counterfeit notes using a printer at his home. Ratnapura Police have taken the suspect and the forged currency notes into custody and are conducting further investigations into the incident.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry summoned the Canadian High Commissioner on Friday (16) to reiterate Sri Lankas strong objections conveyed on several occasions previously to the laying of foundation stone for the construction of a socalled Tamil Genocide Monument at the Chinguacousy Park in Brampton, Canada on 14 August 2024, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Issuing a statement, the ministry stated that Foreign Minister Sabry emphasized that the Government of Sri Lanka categorically rejects this outrageously false narrative, which is being perpetuated for vote bank politics within Canada. Minister Sabry noted that ill-advised action by the City Council of Brampton is offensive to all peace-loving people in Canada and Sri Lanka. The so-called allegation of a genocide in Sri Lanka is a fabrication based on malicious disinformation and is not substantiated by any responsible authority, nationally or internationally, the statement highlighted. The Government of Sri Lanka has consistently engaged in efforts to foster reconciliation and build lasting peace following the end of the conflict despite the economic crisis in the country for the last two years, and such divisive action undermines those efforts by glorifying terrorism and sowing discord and mistrust which democratic countries, including Sri Lanka and Canada, cannot endorse, it added. The Foreign Minister requested the Government of Canada to intervene and take action to prevent the construction of this monument in recognizing the damaging impact of this narrative on bilateral relations and to take immediate action to prevent further harm, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

        "date": "August 17, 2024 01:30 pm",
        "content": "The first test flight of Indias human rated rocket for its human space mission Gaganyaan is expected to take place in December 2024, said a top official of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Speaking to the media after the successful orbiting of Indias earth observation satellite-08 (EOS-08) Dr S Somanath, Chairman, ISRO said: The Gaganyaan rockets three stages have come to Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The integration of the crew module is happening at VSSC (Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram). According to Dr Somanath, all the systems for the Gaganyaan rocket code named G1 will reach Satish Dhawan Space Centre in November this year and the target for the rocket flight is December. On Friday morning ISROs new rocket - Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) successfully put into orbit two satellites EOS-08 and SR-0 belonging to a space start-up Space Rickshaw in copy book style. It was the third and final development flight of SSLV. Dr Somanath said the third development flight of SSLV has been successfully accomplished. We can declare the process of SSLV development has been completed. We are in the process of transferring the SSLV technology to the industries, he said. Dr Somanath said the SSLV design has been kept simple for the industry to make it. The SSLV designed and developed by ISRO has a payload capacity of 500 kg and is powered by solid fuel. The space agency will not only transfer the SSLV technology to Industry for commercial production but also teach the process of building the rocket. We will transfer the knowledge and not just the drawings. The industry people will come to ISRO to learn how to build rockets, he added. Last year the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the regulator for private players in the Indian space sector, had announced ISROs decision to transfer the SSLV technology to private companies. The process of selecting the industry or the consortium of industries is on. Dr Somanath said it will take about two years for the selected party to learn and roll out two SSLVs. In the interim, public sector NewSpace India Ltd will fund the making of the SSLV. As regards the status of the second launch pad at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu, Dr Somanath said construction work has begun and it would take two years for the facility to be commissioned.

Speaking at a conference held in Colombo yesterday (17), Mr. Ratnayake asserted that the choice of the countrys leadership should not be influenced by financial transactions. He highlighted the importance of ensuring that voters remain participants in the democratic process rather than being reduced to mere consumers during elections. Furthermore, the Elections Commissioner General expressed concerns that the expected outcomes from the laws regulating election expenses have not been fully met in a way that the Election Commission expected. You cant hold an election without money, but you also cant use money to turn voters into customers, Mr. Ratnayake stated. If voters are swayed by financial incentives, it undermines the integrity of the electoral process, which is why certain restrictions are essential, he added. In related developments, the Election Commission reported that it has received 519 complaints related to the upcoming presidential election.",

On top of being Marvel Studios first R-rated entry in the MCU, Deadpool  Wolverine is now the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time with the latest round of box-office numbers. After 23 days playing in theaters, the film, starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the titular dysfunctional duo, earned a cumulative total of 1.086 billion worldwide, which surpassed previous title holder Joker at 1.0789 billion. The film is still the second highest-grossing movie of the year so far, behind Inside Out 2s haul of 1.596 billion. But its all good news for Disney, which released both titles. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige had some fun with the newly reached milestone by releasing playful notes from his desk. Thanks for making Marvel Studios first R-rated movie the biggest of all time, reads the first note on top of the pile. Its fantastic to see that audiences are loving this movie as much as we all loved making it. All those conversations were worth it! Speaking of those conversations, beneath the letter is another address about all the drug names banned from Deadpool  Wolverine. To whom it may concern, Per my most recent telefax, the use of the aforementioned illegal substance shall not be shown, reference, or implied in any Marvel Studios production, the comical note reads. This restriction applies to any and all... one word is covered by Feiges more professional remarks ...including but not limited to the following: Booker Sugar, Nose Beers, Bolivian Marching Powder, Forrest Bump, Snorp, Sniffy Lube, Nose Line, Nose Dive, A Low Blow, Blow and Arrow, Blow is Me, Blow Pop, Bumplestiltskin, Bumpty Dumpty, Dust Bowl, Dust Fund... Of course, theres a scene in Deadpool  Wolverine in which Reynolds Wade Wilson is listening to his roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) run through the entire list of nicknames for cocaine, including many of the ones listed here. Deadpool  Wolverine brought together Reynolds Wade and Jackmans Logan for the first time on screen since 2009s X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In addition to the hype surrounding this reunion and bringing Jackman out of Marvel retirement after 2017s Logan, the multiversal jaunt included some dynamite A-list cameos. Reynolds and Jackman tell Entertainment Weekly that they are now looking to do another project together thats not Marvel related.

Insider sources hint that Apple will likely reveal the keynote date soon, with precise details on the events timing and subsequent product availability. The unveiling is part of a broader Apple strategy, including updates to other flagship devices such as the Apple Watch Series 10 and possibly new iPad models. The iPhone 16 lineup, expected to include iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, will also feature alongside these releases. Speculation, supported by industry patterns, suggests the keynote will occur on Tuesday, September 10. This date aligns with Apples historical preference for September launches, avoiding conflicts with other major tech events like the IFA in Berlin, scheduled from 6th to 10th September. Apple traditionally announces its event dates a few weeks in advance, often with cryptic messages that hint at the forthcoming innovations. The tech giant is expected to make this announcement around 4th or 5th September, leveraging the close of IFA for maximal impact. Pre-orders for the new iPhones are anticipated to open on Friday, 13th September, following the keynote. The official release is expected to be a week later, on September 20, aligning with Apples standard release schedule post-reveal. Source: Dimsum Daily --Agencies",

        "date": "August 17, 2024 03:05 pm",
        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says its attention has been drawn to the recent media reports regarding a judgement given by the Australian Federal Court in a case against the former Deputy High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canberra. The Foreign Affairs Ministry said that it is the standard practice that diplomats are facilitated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take domestic assistants to assist their official representational duties, adding that the domestic assistant in question served a full three-year term, and on the eve of the employers originally intended departure from Australia, absconded the residence of the employer. The allowance approved by the Ministry as the salary of the employee has been paid to her, the statement mentioned, highlighting that the Ministry is satisfied that the said salary was paid to the domestic assistant by the employer as mutually agreed. On Thursday (15), Australian media reported that a Federal Court judge had slammed the Home Affairs Department of Australia for failing to properly scrutinise a Sri Lankan diplomat who confiscated a staffers passport and gave her just two days leave in three years. Accordingly, Sri Lankas former deputy high commissioner to Australia had been ordered to pay 543,000 in unpaid wages and interest to a domestic worker and faced a large fine for breaches of employment laws. Himalee Arunatilaka, who served in Canberra from 2015 to 2018, denied her employee, Priyanka Danaratna, minimum pay and conditions during time in Australia, the court found. Justice Elizabeth Raper found Ms Danaratna worked from 6am to 10pm, seven days a week and was only allowed two days off in that time after she burnt her hand with cooking oil. Over the period, she was paid just 11,200  around 75 an hour  which was sent to Sri Lanka. Ms Danaratna also was denied permission to leave the Canberra residence alone, and had her passport confiscated. In addition to handing down a damning judgment for Ms Arunatilaka, Justice Raper suggested that if the Home Affairs Department had taken a closer look, Ms Danaratnas employment may have been very different. The Australian Federal Court last year ordered Indias high commissioner between 2015 and 2016 Navdeep Suri Singh to pay 189,000 in unpaid wages and interest to Seema Shergill, who was found to be working in slave-like conditions in the chief diplomats residence. Justice Raper also ordered Mr Suri to pay a 97,200 fine for wage theft, the maximum amount allowed. Ms Arunatilaka was in 2023 appointed Sri Lankas ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "August 17, 2024 03:48 pm",
        "content": "A brawl broke out among Turkish lawmakers Friday during a heated debate over an opposition delegate currently jailed on what are widely considered to be politically motivated charges. Televised footage showed Ahmet Sik, a representative from the same party as the imprisoned deputy, being approached and attacked by a lawmaker from President Recep Tayyip Erdogans ruling party while speaking at the chambers podium. Sik had just called members of the ruling party a terrorist organization. In a subsequent scuffle involving dozens of deputies, a female lawmaker was struck, leaving drops of blood on steps leading the speakers lectern. Another opposition member was also reportedly injured. Physical tussles are not uncommon among Turkeys lawmakers. It is a shameful situation, said Ozgur Ozel, who heads the largest opposition party. Instead of words flying in the air, fists are flying, there is blood on the ground. They are hitting women. The extraordinary session of the Turkish Grand National Assembly was called to debate the case of Can Atalay, who was elected from prison as a parliamentary deputy for the Workers Party of Turkey, or TIP, in last years election. He had been sentenced the previous year to 18 years imprisonment for his role in anti-government protests in 2013, which challenged the rule of Erdogan, then Turkeys prime minister. Since being elected, Atalay has been fighting to take his seat in parliament, which comes with immunity from prosecution and would see him released from Marmara prison. He has said he would return to prison once his term ends. Although he has achieved successful rulings from the Constitutional Court, these have been ignored by lower courts, sparking a judicial crisis and enflaming a sense of injustice among his supporters. In its third ruling in Atalays favor, the Constitutional Court on Aug. 1 said the decision to strip him of his parliamentary status was null and void. Opposition parties then demanded a special session to discuss the case. The conviction of Atalay and seven other defendants in the Gezi Park case led to widespread criticism from human rights groups and lawyers. The main defendant, philanthropist Osman Kavala, was jailed for life without parole. The European Court of Human Rights has twice called for his release, saying his detention was arbitrary and based on political motives. The Gezi Park protests began in the summer of 2013 with an environmental camp to stop the development of a central Istanbul park. The discontent soon spread to other cities as people protested against Erdogans increasingly authoritarian rule. Atalays personal freedom and security, as well as his right to be elected, which the Constitutional Court ruled to have been violated, should be restored, Amnesty Internationals Turkey office said Friday in a social media post. The parliamentary session resumed after three hours, with both Sik and his assailant accepting reprimands from the parliaments speaker. Source: AP --Agencies",

The former national mens teams chief selector feels Englands present approach to Test cricket is impressive and reckons its not impossible to defeat them in their backyard. The likes of Romesh Kaluwitharana, Sanath Jayasuriya, Arjuna Ranarunga, de Silva, Chaminda Vaas, and Muttiah Muralitharan were the nucleus of the mens teams golden era.

The 58-year-old stated that the team of the yesteryears inspired their rivals to emulate their style of play. He also observed that England decided to take a positive approach and its paying off handsomely. That was Sri Lanka playing like no other side has done in history, Aravinda de Silva said. We had an identity, people knew the way that Sri Lankan cricketers played the game and teams wanted to emulate that. I dont think we have that at the moment. Im enjoying the way that England are playing their cricket at the moment. Theyre playing very, very attacking cricket  whether theyre bowling or batting, England are taking a really positive approach and its paying off. Winning in England is hard.

        "date": "August 17, 2024 08:30 pm",
        "content": "Hospitals and clinics across India turned away patients except for emergency cases on Saturday as medical professionals started a 24-hour shutdown in protest against the brutal rape and murder of a doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata. More than one million doctors were expected to join the strike, paralysing medical services across the worlds most populous nation. Hospitals said faculty staff from medical colleges had been pressed into service for emergency cases. The government, in a statement issued on Saturday after a meeting with representatives of medical associations, urged doctors to return to duties in the public interest. A 31-year old trainee doctor was raped and murdered last week inside the medical college in Kolkata where she worked, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012. The strike, which began at 6 a.m. (0030 GMT), cut off access to elective medical procedures and out-patient consultations, according to a statement by the Indian Medical Association (IMA). Junior doctors have all been on strike, so this would mean 90 of doctors are on strike, Sanjeev Singh Yadav, a representative of the IMA in the southern state of Telangana, told Reuters. Outside the RG Kar Medical College, where the crime took place, a heavy police presence was seen on Saturday while the hospital premises were deserted, according to the ANI news agency. Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata, has backed the protests across the state, demanding the investigation be fast-tracked and the guilty be punished in the strongest way possible. A large number of private clinics and diagnostic centres remained closed in Kolkata on Saturday. Dr Sandip Saha, a private paediatrician in the city, told Reuters he would not attend to patients except in emergencies. Hospitals and clinics in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Guwahati in Assam and Chennai in Tamil Nadu and other cities joined the strike, set to be one of the largest shutdown of hospital services in recent memory. HARSH PUNISHMENT Patients queued up at hospitals, some unaware that the agitation would not allow them to get medical attention. I have spent 500 rupees (6) on travel to come here. I have paralysis and a burning sensation in my feet, head and other parts of my body, an unidentified patient at SCB Medical College Hospital in the city of Cuttack in Odisha told local television. We were not aware of the strike. What can we do? We have to return home. Raghunath Sahu, 45, who had lined up at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, told Reuters a daily quota set by the doctors to see patients had ended before noon. I have brought my ailing grandmother. They did not see her today. I will have to wait for another day and try again, Sahu said while moving away from the queue. Indias Central Bureau of Investigation, the agency investigating the rape and murder, has summoned a number of medical students from the RG Kar college to ascertain the circumstances of the crime, according to a police source in Kolkata. The CBI also questioned the principal of the hospital on Friday, the source said. Questioning continued on Saturday, local television channels reported. One suspect is in the agencys custody. Indias government introduced sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, including tougher sentences, after the Delhi gang-rape, but campaigners say little has changed. Anger at the failure of tougher laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and womens groups. Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them, IMA President R. V. Asokan told Reuters on Friday. The IMA has called for further legal measures to better protect healthcare workers from violence and swift investigation of the barbaric crime in Kolkata. The punishment should be the harshest possible, should come faster, so within public memory, said senior criminal layer Shobha Gupta, who represented a Muslim woman gang-raped during religious riots that swept the western state of Gujarat in 2002. When we are still angry about the crime, the result should come out. Punishment to play a role of deterrence, it should come faster. The government said in its statement a committee would be set up to suggest measures to further improve protection for healthcare professionals. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Scheduled to take place from August 27 to 31 in Lima, Peru, the World Junior Athletics Championship represents a critical opportunity for young athletes to showcase their talents on the global stage. However, despite their qualifications, the Sri Lankan athletes have reportedly faced an uncertain future as the authorities of the Sports Ministry have refused to provide necessary provisions, including air tickets. Against this backdrop, the Sri Lanka Athletics Association had taken steps to obtain the necessary visas for the athletes after travelling to India since the athletes have successfully met the required performance standards. Nevertheless, despite their efforts, the associations request for financial assistance from the sports ministry has been rejected, with a notice in writing that the budget allocated for foreign competition trips had been exhausted, leaving no funds available for air tickets or any other essential provisions for the World Junior Athletics Championship. As a result, the dreams of these 13 promising athletes are now at risk, as their participation in the World Junior Athletics Championshipa key event in their athletic careersremains uncertain without the necessary financial support. In 2022, the athletes who qualified for the World Junior Athletics Championship held in Colombia faced similar challenges. Due to delays in obtaining visas, the team arrived after the tournament had already begun. As a result, some athletes were forced to rush directly from the airport to their competition events, severely impacting their performance.",

X, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, claims Moraes secretly threatened one of the companys legal representatives in the South American country with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform. The social media giant published pictures of a document allegedly signed by Moraes which says a daily fine of 20,000 reais (3,653) and an arrest decree would be imposed against X representative Rachel Nova Conceicao if the platform did not fully comply to Moraes orders. To protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately, X said. Brazils Supreme Court, where Moraes has a seat, told Reuters it would not speak on the matter and would not confirm nor deny the authenticity of the document shared by X. The X service remains available to the people of Brazil, the platform said on Saturday. Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts, as he investigates so-called digital militias that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. Moraes opened an inquiry earlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked. Musk has called the Moraes decisions regarding X unconstitutional. After Musks challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazils Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings. Lawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that operational faults have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform, after Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.

        "date": "August 18, 2024 01:47 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of strengthening economic cooperation and regional integration from Japan to India, with a special focus on deepening ties with India. The President made these remarks while addressing the Head of State Session of the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit, held under the theme An Empowered Global South for a Sustainable Future. Speaking from the Presidents House in Anuradhapura virtually yesterday (17), President Wickremesinghe highlighted Sri Lankas strategic commitment to expanding economic partnerships across Asia, particularly through the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). The President noted that as the Bay of Bengal region emerges as a hub of economic growth, the significance of BIMSTEC continues to rise. Sri Lanka, as a member, seeks closer economic integration with India and is exploring economic cooperation agreements extending from Japan to India. The conference, chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, brought together heads of state from various countries. During his address, President Wickremesinghe praised Indias efforts to strengthen the Global South, acknowledging that the West can no longer maintain its dominance in global leadership. He lauded the Voice of the Global South Summit as a crucial platform for fostering consensus on challenges facing developing nations. Reflecting on Indo-Sri Lankan relations, the President emphasized the Vision statement shared between the two nations, which celebrates their historical cooperation and lays the foundation for future collaboration. He expressed optimism that this vision will lead to stronger integration between Sri Lanka and India across various sectors. President Wickremesinghe also expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Modi and the people of India for their support during Sri Lankas recent economic crisis. The President acknowledged that Indias assistance played a vital role in helping Sri Lanka navigate the challenges of the past two years and emerge from bankruptcy. President Wickremesinghe further elaborated, Your Excellencies, Sri Lanka thanks India for hosting the third virtual seminar on Voices of the Global South. This series enables us to engage with each other to understand our different viewpoints while also helping us arrive at a common stance on many issues confronting the South. We have reached a point where the West can no longer dominate global leadership and, furthermore, has become part of the problem. Ukraine and Gaza are prime examples, which I will not address as they have already been discussed by previous speakers. In this context, we must appreciate Indias efforts to strengthen the Global South. Your Excellencies, let me speak a few words about my country. Sri Lanka has reached agreements with the Official Creditor Countries, the Export-Import Bank of China, the IMF, the World Bank, and the ADB to emerge from bankruptcy. At this stage, I must acknowledge the generosity of Prime Minister Modi and India, whose contributions made it possible for us to survive the two years of bankruptcy, which imposed a heavy burden on our people. The Vision Statement agreed upon by both our countries outlines the path for closer relations, emphasizing our 2,000-year history of cooperation. This will ultimately lead to deeper integration between our nations across many sectors. We will be finalizing the Comprehensive Economic and Technological Agreement. We will also inaugurate connectivity in power, transport, and land, and we will focus on the development of Trincomalee Harbour, among other projects we have agreed upon. These efforts will help us upgrade our knowledge and technology, enabling us to move towards a digital economy. I must express my gratitude to India for the assistance it has provided. I must also mention the Bay of Bengal, which is becoming a growth centre, with BIMSTEC gaining increasing importance. As a member of BIMSTEC, Sri Lanka, with its close economic integration with India, seeks membership in the RCEP, aiming to establish economic cooperation agreements from Japan to India. We recognize the Bay of Bengal as essential for the development of our economies. Given that many of the topics I intended to address have already been covered by previous speakers, I would only like to mention that the post-1989 era, started with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was dominated by such views as the clash of civilization and the end of history, which highlighted the dominance of the Western system, has now coming to an end. This summit, along with similar gatherings, the expansion of BRICS, and the expansion of the G20, will pave the way for a new order where the Global South will leave a lasting legacy. I must thank India, which, since its independence, has worked to unite Afro-Asian countries and for the role it continues to play in forging closer unity among all of us. Thank you. --PMD",

        "date": "August 18, 2024 03:11 pm",
        "content": "French film legend Alain Delon has died at the age of 88. The actor was a star of the golden era of French cinema, known for his tough-guy persona on screen in hits including The Samurai and Borsalino. He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family, a statement released to AFP news agency said. Delon has been in poor health in recent years and become a virtual recluse. More recently, the breakdown of his family had been making headlines in France. Once described as the most beautiful man in the movies, Delon starred in hits from the 1960s including The Leopard and Rocco and his Brothers. He stole the hearts of fans whatever role he was playing, from a murderer to a charismatic conman. From the 1990s, his film appearances grew rare, but he remained a fixture in the celebrity columns. In total, he appeared in more than 90 films during the course of his career. A statement from his family said: Alain Fabien, Anouchka, Anthony, as well as (his dog) Loubo, are deeply saddened to announce the passing of their father. He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family. Le Parisian newspaper called Delon a legend of the cinema, while Liberation described him as a leading figure of cinema, symbol of shadowy masculinity, the actor with crazy charisma. Delons last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme dor at the Cannes film festival in May 2019. At the event, he made an emotional speech in which he appeared to bid farewell to cinema. Its a bit of a posthumous tribute, but from my lifetime, he had said. I am going to leave, but I wont leave without thanking you. For decades, the French public have followed the ins and outs of Delons prolific career and equally prolific love life, via Paris-Match and other magazines. His colourful personal life regularly made the front pages as he charmed and seduced his way around Europe at the height of his fame. But he also faced criticism. Some disapproved of his support for Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, who championed the death penalty and opposed same-sex marriage. His relationship with women also caused controversy and led to claims of misogyny. More recently, the breakdown of his family had been making headlines in France. The actor had three children - two sons and a daughter - by two different women, and a third son unacknowledged and now dead. In recent years, his surviving children have been laying bare their mutual grievances before the media in a series of insults, accusations, lawsuits and secret recordings. It included disagreements over his medical treatment, following his stroke in 2019. Another row involved Hiromi Rollin, Delons former housekeeper. Delons children ejected her last year, but she subsequently filed a suit against them for endangering Delons life by refusing him medicines. In April this year, a judge placed Delon under reinforced curatorship, meaning he no longer had full freedom to manage his assets. Delon also made headlines in February of this year when French police seized 72 firearms and 3,000 rounds of ammunition from his home. Prosecutors said he did not have a gun licence. A shooting range was also found at his Douchy-Montcorbon mansion. BBC News has contacted Delons representatives. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Sunday that Ukraine had stationed more than 120,000 troops at its border with Belarus and Minsk had deployed nearly a third of its armed forces along the entire border, the Belta state news agency reported. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Vladimir Putin, was speaking against the backdrop of a Ukrainian incursion into Russia that began on Aug. 6 when thousands of Kyivs troops smashed through Russias western border in a major embarrassment for Putins top military brass. Seeing their aggressive policy, we have introduced there and placed in certain points - in case of war, they would be defence - our military along the entire border, Belta cited Lukashenko as saying in an interview with Russian state television. Kyiv did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Andriy Demchenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian border service, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda on Sunday that the situation on the border with Belarus remained unchanged. As we can see, Lukashenkos rhetoric does not change either, constantly escalating the situation with regularity to please the terrorist country, Demchenko said. We are not seeing any increase in the number of equipment or personnel of Belarusian units near our border. Lukashenko did not say exactly how many troops Minsk deployed along the border. Belarus professional army has about 48,000 troops and around 12,000 state border troops, according to the 2022 International Institute for Strategic Studies Military Balance. Belarusian Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin said on Friday there was a high probability of an armed provocation from neighbouring Ukraine and that the situation at their shared border remains tense. Lukashenko said the Belarusian-Ukrainian border was mined as never before and that Ukrainian troops would incur huge losses if they tried to cross it. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A group of election observers from the European Union and the Commonwealth have arrived in Sri Lanka to monitor the September 21 presidential election, Election Commission officials said on Sunday. They arrived in the island at the invitation of Sri Lankas Election Commission. The EU has previously done election monitoring in Sri Lanka six times with the last being at the presidential election of 2019. The deployment of the Election Observation Mission in Sri Lanka this year confirms our long-standing commitment to supporting credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections in the country, the head of the observer group said in a statement on Saturday. The forthcoming presidential election will give a new impetus to democracy following the 2022 political and economic crisis. This election is important for Sri Lanka to continue making progress on its path of reforms and lasting recovery, in full respect of democratic values, the head of the observer group was quoted as saying. The EU observer mission is comprised of different groups of observers. While the core team of a Deputy Chief Observer and nine election experts have already arrived in Colombo, 26 long-term observers will join the mission and will be deployed across the country to follow the election campaign. Thereafter, 32 short-term observers will reinforce the mission on election week, also deployed throughout the country. Over 17.1 million registered voters are eligible to vote at the election for a direct vote to elect an executive president for a 5-year term. The incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and the Marxist JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake are the front runners with over 17 million of the islands 21 million population eligible to vote.

        "date": "August 19, 2024 09:51 am",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday on another Middle East tour to push for a ceasefire in Gaza but Hamas raised doubts about the mission just hours after he landed by accusing Israel of undermining his efforts. The Palestinian militant group said it holds Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for thwarting the mediators efforts, delaying an agreement and exposing Israeli hostages in Gaza to the same aggression faced by Palestinians. On his ninth trip to the region since the war began in October, Blinken will meet on Monday with senior Israeli leaders including Netanyahu, a senior State Department official said. After Israel, Blinken will continue onto Egypt. The talks to strike a deal for a truce and return of hostages held in Gaza were now at an inflection point, a senior Biden administration official told reporters en route to Tel Aviv. We think this is a critical time, the official said. The mediating countries - Qatar, the United States and Egypt - have so far failed to narrow enough differences to reach an agreement in months of on-off negotiations, and violence continued unabated in Gaza on Sunday. Israeli strikes killed at least 21 people in Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian health authorities said, including six children and their mother in an airstrike on a house in the central city of Deir Al-Balah. The youngest was aged 18 months, their grandfather Mohammed Khattab told Reuters as relatives later gathered around the bodies, wrapped in white shrouds. What was their crime? ... Did they kill a Jew? Did they shoot at the Jews? Did they launch rockets at the Jews? ... What did they do to deserve this? asked Khattab. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has denied targeting civilians as it hunts down Hamas militants, accusing the group of operating from civilian facilities including schools and hospitals. Hamas denies this. The Israeli military said it destroyed rocket launchers used to hit Israel from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks, and killed 20 Palestinian militants. In the occupied West Bank, where violence has escalated since the war in Gaza broke out in October last year, an Israeli man died from wounds sustained in an attack, according to a hospital spokesperson. CLOSING GAPS The talks towards a ceasefire are set to continue this week in Cairo, following a two-day meeting in Doha last week. Blinken will try to secure a breakthrough after the U.S. put forward bridging proposals that the mediating countries believe would close gaps between the warring parties. The war erupted on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants rampaged into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and reduced much of Gaza to rubble. Israel says it has killed 17,000 Hamas combatants. There has been increased urgency to reach a ceasefire deal amid fears of escalation across the wider region. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. Israel remained firmly committed to principles established for its security in the May 27 outline proposals, Netanyahus office said in a statement following a meeting of the cabinet. I would like to emphasise: We are conducting negotiations and not a scenario in which we just give and give, Netanyahu told the meeting. There are things we can be flexible on and... things that we cannot be flexible on, which we will insist on. Netanyahus office said he still insists Israeli forces remain on a border strip that runs between Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor, in order to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. It said Netanyahu would continue to work towards advancing a deal that maximizes the number of living hostages released and allows for Israels war objectives to be achieved, including not allowing Hamas to retain control of Gaza. Hamas said that optimistic U.S. comments were deceptive and accused Netanyahu of making new conditions in an attempt to blow up the negotiation. Disagreements include whether Israeli troops should remain present in Gaza after the fighting ends, notably along the border with Egypt, and over checks on people going into northern Gaza from the south which Israel says is needed to stop armed militants. Hamas has pushed for a ceasefire deal to end the war, while Israel has not been willing to agree to go beyond a temporary pause in the fighting. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 19, 2024 10:23 am",
        "content": "The armies of India and Sri Lanka have deployed canines K9s in military parlance in the bilateral exercise Mitra Shakti underway in the island nation. The Indian Army has deployed Zac, a Belgian Malinois, while Sri Lanka has fielded two canines. The 10th edition of Exercise Mitra Shakti is being held from August 12-25 at the Army Training School, Maduru Oya, Sri Lanka. Two-and-half-year-old Zac is trained in specialised tactical operations such as cordon-and-search, search-and-destroy, fighting in built-up areas, jungle search, and area-sanitisation among others, an Army official said. It has additionally been trained in specialised skills such as laser-guided assault and weapon retrieval, which greatly augment the K9 capabilities of our forces, the official stated. Zac, an assault K9, was trained at the dog training facility of Remount Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre and College, Meerut. He is a force multiplier and first responder in majority of tactical operations, said Major Rishi Sharma, the K9 Detachment Commander. Army dog trainer (ADT) Pranjal Sakiya is also part of the K9 Detachment. During the course of the joint exercise, Zac will participate in a range of activities, including house intervention, jungle searches, laser-guided assaults, area sanitisation, and other facets of counter-insurgency operations. In one of the scenarios during the exercise, Zac intercepted an assailant who was trying to run away from a road block. Army dogs are routinely employed in urban operations such as vehicle checks, search-and-assault operations and explosive detection. These K9s are also trained in radio-guided directional control techniques. Wearing a head-mounted tactical camera that enables real-time video surveillance, the assault canines can launch stealth attacks, another official stated. The Indian contingent comprising of 106 personnel is represented by a battalion of Rajputana Rifles along with personnel from other arms and services. The Sri Lankan contingent is being represented by personnel from Gajaba Regiment of Sri Lankan Army. The aim of the exercise is to enhance joint military capability of both sides to undertake counter-insurgency operations in a sub-conventional scenario under Chapter VII of the United Nations Mandate, the Army said in a statement at the commencement of the exercise. The exercise will focus on operations in the semi-urban environment. Tactical drills to be rehearsed during the exercise include response to a terrorist action, establishment of a joint command post, establishment of an intelligence and surveillance centre, securing of a helipadlanding site, small-team insertion and extraction, special heliborne operations, cordon-and-search operations, besides employment of drones and counter-drone systems, the Army said. Exercise Mitra Shakti will enable both sides to share best practices in tactics, techniques and procedures of conducting joint operations. It will facilitate developing inter-operability, bonhomie and camaraderie between the two armies, it added. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

He made these remarks during his visit to the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya to invoke blessings on Sunday (18). He was accompanied by several other lawmakers including Chamal Rajapaksa and State Minister of Power and Energy, D.V. Chanaka. We implemented measures to turn Hambanthota into an aviation and naval hub. Unfortunately, the good governance government put an end to those measures. After the 22nd of September, we expect to turn hambanthota into South Asias hub of aviation and naval affairs once again, creating close to a million direct and indirect employment opportunities, Rajapaksa claimed. Meanwhile, responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the rumours that certain MPs who left the party are going to rejoin it, Namal Rajapaksa stated that what matters more than the politicians decision, is the political decisions of the public. My dealings are only with the people, he said. Rajapaksa also expressed that even though, higher ups change their allegiances for positions and privileges, the loyalists in the grass-roots level remain with the party. However, he further mentioned that those who left can come back to the party at any time. Furthermore, the SLPPs presidential candidate said: This is your election.

        "content": "Presidential Candidate of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance and leader of the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera proposes the establishment of an authority on national strategic framework planning under the strategic framework proposed by his alliance. Addressing a gathering attended by intellectuals and entrepreneurs, at the MJP Headquarters in Colombo, Jayaweera expressed confidence that that his proposal is capable of achieving national priorities and objectives within a specific period of time. Speaking further, Dilith Jayaweera said: The presidential election has been announced. Sajith Premadasa, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Namal Rajapaksa are contesting. All of those candidates held cabinet portfolios in the past Once, Anura Kumara was a powerful cabinet minister. He held massive power through his portfolio of Agriculture Minister compared to other agriculture ministers in the past. The situation with Namal Rajapaksa is also the same. He held five ministerial portfolios. Those very same people propose changes to be made in this country. Anura Kumara is the biggest fraudster. Indirectly, he has supported each and every government. He has directly served in two governments, Jayaweera added. The proportionate representation system was one of the factors behind the spread of corruption in this country. Other than objecting to the proposals introduced, have they introduced at least one proposal to change this corrupt political system? That is because they are part of this corrupt political system. Meanwhile, the MJP leader also said that Ranil Wickremesinghe, under the guise of the symbol of a gas cylinder, is trying to secure votes by instilling fear in the people while highlighting the possibility of gas queues forming in the future. He is supported by those who created gas queues, he expressed. Sajith Premadasa mentioned a list of proposals to change the education system. However, he did not have a proper agenda to that end. Anura Kumara said fuel prices will be reduced under their government. He said the VAT imposed on stationery items will be reduced. Do we need a President to do that? Is this what a President should tell his people?, Jayaweera questioned. Furthermore, the Sarvajana Balaya presidential candidate stated that the most important concept of their framework is the establishment of an authority on national strategic framework planning. What we propose is a central authority that facilitates the achievement of national priorities and objectives within a specific period of time, he said, adding that the country requires this authority to ensure that the ministers do not act the way they want. We expect strategic frameworks of this nature from the presidential candidates. We do not expect them to deceive people through their traditional methods, he emphasised.",

        "date": "August 19, 2024 12:34 pm",
        "content": "The Philippines has detected a new case of the mpox virus in the country, the first since December last year, its health department said on Monday, adding it was awaiting test results before being able to determine the strain. The patient was a 33-year-old Filipino male who had no travel history outside the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said. We are awaiting sequencing results and will update once available, its spokesperson Albert Domingo said when asked about the strain. The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency, its highest form of alert, following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries. A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily though routine close contact. A case of the new variant was confirmed on Thursday in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. Pakistan on Friday confirmed at least one case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, but said they did not yet know the strain of the virus. The new case in the Philippines is the 10th laboratory-confirmed case the health department has detected. Its first case was in July 2022. Symptoms started more than a week ago with fever, which was followed four days later by findings of a distinct rash on the face, back, nape, trunk, groin, as well as palms and soles, the Philippine DOH said in a statement. The disease, caused by the monkey pox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Posting on X (formerly Twitter), the CWC General Secretary highlighted that never before have they seen a leader dedicate so much effort to improving the living conditions and status of plantation Malaiyaha Tamil community, which he termed as our people. This decision by the CWC therefore represents the faith that our party, union and our community has in the President and his ability to resolve the issues that matter to us the most, Thondaman said. Meanwhile, the Minister added that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the CWC and President Wickremesinghe, setting out the CWCs requests, is currently being prepared and will be signed shortly. The CWC is ready to stand with a leader who has not only delivered results but has done so with compassion and a clear vision for Sri Lankas future, he said. Furthermore, Minister Jeevan Thondaman wrote: Our support is in recognition of his remarkable leadership since he took up the Presidency in July 2022 during one of the most challenging chapters in our nations history. We know that his continued leadership is the right thing for our country. In his two years of leading our nation, President Wickremesinghe has turned around Sri Lankas economy after a period of bankruptcy and economic collapse. Under his leadership, we have seen a significant recovery, with shortages easing, prices stabilising and the country regaining international confidence, he added.

        "date": "August 19, 2024 01:46 pm",
        "content": "Apple is reportedly planning to launch the iPhone 16 series with a new colour option. According to a report by 9To5Mac, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models will be offered in a new bronze colour, likely to be called Desert Titanium. This new colour is expected to replace the existing Blue Titanium colour that Apple introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro line. Apple currently offers the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max in Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and Blue Titanium. The report indicates that the anticipated Desert Titanium colour will have a dark gold shade. It also mentions that the colour will be relatively discrete and deep, similar to the iPhone 14 Pros Deep Purple colour. In addition to the new colour, Apple might introduce changes to the existing colours. The report suggests that the Black Titanium colour for the iPhone 16 Pro models could be significantly darker and that the Natural Titanium colour might have a more grey finish. Additionally, Apple might revert to a stainless steel-like finish for the iPhone 16 Pro line, akin to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. Apple iPhone 16 series: What to expect Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 series next month. The next-generation iPhone series is anticipated to bring significant changes, including a new chip, design modifications, a new dedicated camera button, and more. Apple is expected to introduce a new A18 chip for this years iPhone models. Unlike previous years, where Apple equipped standard iPhone models with the previous years flagship chip, the company is likely to equip all four models of the iPhone 16 series with the same processor. However, Apple might still differentiate the Pro models by incorporating more Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) cores and branding the chip in the Pro models as the A18 Pro. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models are also expected to feature the Action Button, which debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. Moreover, Apple is likely to add a new dedicated camera button, potentially named the Capture Button. Unlike the Action Button, which was exclusive to the Pro models, the Capture Button could be available across the iPhone 16 series. Design-wise, not much change is expected; however, the standard iPhone models could receive a redesigned rear camera module, with both sensors aligned vertically rather than diagonally.

        "title": "Alien: Romulus bites off 41.5 million to top box office charts",
        "date": "August 19, 2024 02:49 pm",
        "content": "Alien: Romulus, the latest installment in the 45-year-old franchise, opened in first place at the North American box office. The 20th Century Studios release earned an estimated 41.5 million in its first weekend, where it was playing in 3,885 locations in the U.S. and Canada. Including 66.7 million from international showings in 49 markets, Alien: Romulus boasted a 108.2 million global debut. The Walt Disney Co., which owns 20th Century Studios, claimed the top two spots on the charts, with Marvels  Deadpool  Wolverine  now in its fourth weekend, taking second place with 29 million. The company has been responsible for an estimated 42 of the industrys summer box office haul, including hits Inside Out 2 and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. August can often be slow for the movie business, or, less charitably, a dumping ground. But while 2024 has lagged overall for the movie business, a string of recent hits including Deadpool  Wolverine and  It Ends With Us  helped build a momentum that put this late August weekend over 30 ahead of the same weekend last year. Its also up over 10 from August 2019. The summer started off pretty gloomy, but its winding up really strong, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. We thought we were going to coast through August, but now were powering through August towards a much better overall summer number than we expected for the box office. Fede Álvarez directed Alien: Romulus,  set around the time of Alien and Aliens, and recruited a cast of up-and-coming 20-somethings to lead the cast including Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson and Isabela Merced. The sci-fi film leans into Álvarezs propensity for all things horror, as he is known for Evil Dead and Dont Breathe, and embraces the franchises horror roots. Reviews have been a little mixed, but mostly positive, with an 81 on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave it a B CinemaScore. The romantic drama  It Ends With Us  landed in third place with 24 million, down just 52 from its triumphant opening. The Sony movie starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, who also directed, has made 97.8 million to date. It cost only 25 million to produce. The film was adapted from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel of the same name that follows Lively as Lily Bloom, a woman at a crossroads when a past love upends her current relationship with Baldonis Ryle Kincaid. Rumors of behind-the-scenes drama on the film also continues to dominate social media discourse and tabloid headlines  but Dont Worry Darling also taught us that gossip and chatter dont always translate to box office returns. Twisters placed fourth in its fifth weekend with 9.8 million from 3,483 theaters. The Universal release has made over 238.4 million domestically. Rounding out the top five was a re-release: Coraline, which Fathom Events put on over 1,500 screens for its 15th anniversary where it made 11.3 million in four days and 8.6 million from Friday through Sunday. The stop-motion animated film was an adaptation of a Neil Gaiman novella, written and directed by Henry Selick and marked the first-ever release for Laika. Itll be in theaters until Aug. 22. Borderlands, the video game adaptation starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart and Jamie Lee Curtis, brought in 2.4 million in its second weekend bringing its total box office earnings to 13.5 million compared to its reported 120 million budget. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Alien: Romulus, 41.5 million. 2. Deadpool  Wolverine, 29 million. 3. It Ends With Us, 24 million. 4. Twisters, 9.8 million. 5. Coraline, 8.6 million. 6. Despicable Me 4, 6 million. 7. Trap, 3.4 million. 8.

        "content": "Western Province - South Crimes Division officers have raided a Kush cannabis cultivation illegally carried out within a two-storey house at Kahanthota Road in Pittugala, Malabe. The raid, which was carried out last afternoon (19), has led to the discovery of a highly sophisticated cultivation setup, where approximately 174 Kush cannabis plants were cultivated inside an air-conditioned room on the ground floor of the residence, police said. During the raid, one of the suspects was caught in the process of packaging the drugs, and preparing for distribution. Police estimate the street value of the seized Kush cannabis to be around Rs. 100 million. Further investigations have revealed that the house, which was purportedly operating under the guise of a tea-packing business, had been rented out for the purpose of running this illegal operation. Two suspects, aged 25 and 48, who were arrested at the scene are scheduled to be produced before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court, police said.",
