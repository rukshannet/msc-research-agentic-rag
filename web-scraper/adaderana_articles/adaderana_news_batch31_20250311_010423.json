Accordingly, a petition was submitted by M. G. Lasanthi, the wife of an inmate who had died during the clash. The relevant petition sought an order against the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), directing them to arrest all related suspects. The Welisara Magistrate, who conducted a comprehensive probe into the deaths of the inmates, had called for the immediate arrest of those involved, the petitioner pointed out, adding that the CID has yet to make the arrests, although nearly two months have passed since the orders were given. At least eight inmates were killed while over 50 others were injured after inmates of the Mahara Prison launched protests amid a surge of COVID-19 infections within the prison, demanding early release on bail and better facilities.",

        "title": "BASL deeply concerned over recent surge in custodial deaths, criminal activity",
        "date": "June 14, 2023 01:42 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has raised deep concerns about the recent surge observed in custodial deaths and, criminal activity in many parts of the country. In a statement, the association urged the government, together with other stakeholders, to impose stricter laws and punishments on errant police officers who misuse their power and fail to fulfill their duties. The BASL went on to demand draft enforceable guidelines, to prevent the reoccurrence of custodial deaths, what it deemed one of the worst crimes in a civilized society under the rule of law. Further, law enforcement authorities should take immediate steps to prevent criminal activity in order to protect the citizens, the statement emphasized. The BASL says Sri Lankas legal system provides for investigation, inquiry, trial and punishment by proper authorities which is the base of democracy and the Rule of Law, and, the credibility and transparency of such process, must be diligently and fiercely preserved. In terms of Article 13 (4) of the Constitution, no person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a competent court. Hence, even a convicted criminal has a right to his life. The countrys top courts have repeatedly maintained that the extra-judicial killing of a suspect in police custody violated the right to life, despite the absence of an explicit right to life in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the BASL said further. Taking into account the repeated occurrence of custodial deaths, the Supreme Court in February 2023, directed the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to formulate, issue and implement, guidelines to the police, elaborating the steps that should be taken by each officer to avoid encounter deaths in the future. However, despite these directives, the BASL says it has observed that custodial deaths and torture continue at an alarming rate. The association, in its statement, insists that the duty of the State is not only to safeguard the rights of citizens but also to compensate the victims and punish those who violate the law.",

        "title": "110 million people forcibly displaced as Sudan, Ukraine wars add to world refugee crisis, UN says",
        "date": "June 14, 2023 01:47 pm",
        "content": "Some 110 million people have had to flee their homes because of conflict, persecution, or human rights violations, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says. The war in Sudan, which has displaced nearly 2 million people since April, is but the latest in a long list of crises that has led to the record-breaking figure. Its quite an indictment on the state of our world, Filippo Grandi, who leads the U.N. refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva ahead of the publication Wednesday of UNHCRs Global Trends Report for 2022. Last year alone, an additional 19 million people were forcibly displaced including more than 11 million who fled Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what became the fastest and largest displacement of people since World War II. We are constantly confronted with emergencies, Grandi said. Last year the agency recorded 35 emergencies, three to four times more than in previous years. Very few make your headlines, Grandi added, arguing that the war in Sudan fell off most front pages after Western citizens were evacuated. Conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Myanmar were also responsible for displacing more than 1 million people within each country in 2022. The majority of the displaced globally have sought refuge within their nations borders. One-third of them - 35 million - have fled to other countries, making them refugees, according to the UNHCR report. Most refugees are hosted by low to middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, not rich countries in Europe or North America, Grandi said. Turkey currently hosts the most refugees with 3.8 million people, mostly Syrians who fled the civil war, followed by Iran with 3.4 million refugees, mostly Afghans. But there are also 5.7 million Ukrainian refugees scattered across countries in Europe and beyond. The number of stateless people has also risen in 2022 to 4.4 million, according to UNHCR data, but this is believed to be an underestimate. Regarding asylum claims, the U.S. was the country to receive the most new applications in 2022 with 730,400 claims. Its also the nation with the largest backlog in its asylum system, Grandi said. One of the things that needs to be done is reforming that asylum system so that it becomes more rapid, more efficient, he said. The United States, Spain and Canada recently announced plans to create asylum processing centers in Latin America with the goal of reducing the number of people who trek their way north to the Mexico-U.S. border. As the number of asylum-seekers grows, so have the challenges facing them. We see pushbacks. We see tougher and tougher immigration or refugee admission rules. We see in many countries the criminalization of immigrants and refugees, blaming them for everything that has happened, Grandi said. Last week European leaders renewed financial promises to North African nations in the hopes of stemming migration across the Mediterranean while the British government insists on a so-far failed plan to ship asylum-seekers to Rwanda, something UNHCR is opposed to. But there were also some wins, Grandi said, pointing to what he described as a positive sign in the European Unions negotiations for a new migration and asylum pact, despite criticism from human rights groups. Grandi also celebrated the fact that the number of refugees resettled in 2022 doubled to 114,000 from the previous year. But he admitted this was still a drop in the ocean.

        "content": "Dr. G. Wijesuriya, the Director of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children in Colombo, has raised concerns over the recent spread of dengue among children. Expressing his concern on the matter, Dr. Wijesuriya explained that there are currently 35 children being treated for dengue at the hospital, with seven of them suffering from hemophilia. He also added that nearly three to four novel dengue patients are also admitted on a daily basis. Dengue is still an imminent threat across the island, and we do not see a decrease in this. It is hard for us to believe that the spread of this virus will reduce any time soon, as rainy conditions are also likely to continue for a while, the doctor said, urging everyone to remain vigilant of their environment and surroundings around schools, offices and their residences. Meanwhile, the Health Entomology Officers Association has warned that in the event the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled, it is likely that Sri Lanka will record the highest number of dengue cases in its history. Speaking in this regard, the chairman of the association, Nijith Sumanasena, further noted that there has not yet been a decrease in the number of dengue cases being reported, adding that 2 of Sri Lankas housing units have been identified as dengue mosquito-breeding sites. Sri Lanka recorded the highest number of dengue cases in 2017, with 186,101 patients being recorded, while 440 deaths were reported. In the first six months of 2023, however, the island has already seen a total of 43,346 dengue cases, which is only likely to further increase owing to the inclement weather conditions.",

        "date": "June 14, 2023 04:45 pm",
        "content": "Johnny Depp has chosen the charities he plans to donate the 1 million settlement hes owed from Amber Heard stemming from their highly publicized defamation trial, CNN has learned from a source close to Depp. On Tuesday, the source confirmed that Depp has chosen five charities to donate the settlement funds, which include the Make-A-Film Foundation, The Painted Turtle, Red Feather, Marlon Brandos Tetiaroa Society charity, and the Amazonia Fund Alliance. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor plans to donate 200,000 to each of the five charities, according to the source. CNN has reached out to representatives for Heard seeking comment on the development. A Virginia jury found both Heard and Depp liable for defamation in June 2022. The former couple later came to a settlement in December with Heard agreeing to pay Depp 1 million in damages. At the time, Depps lawyers said in a statement that he pledged to donate the settlement money from Heard to charity. The Virginia jury originally awarded Depp 10 million in compensatory damages and 5 million dollars in punitive damages in June 2022. Heard was awarded 2 million in compensatory damages and no money for punitive damages. Ultimately, the damages that Heard owed to Depp were reduced to 1 million in December, when the former couple came to a settlement agreement. Heard posted a statement on her verified Instagram page at the time announcing that theyd reached a settlement, writing that she had made no admission and that the settlement is not an act of concession. I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder, Heard said in her post. Depps lawyers, Camille Vasquez and Benjamin Chew, told CNN in a statement at the time, We are pleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter for Mr. Depp, who made clear throughout the process that his priority was about bringing the truth to light. More recently, both actors have been photographed spending time in Europe, doing their best to move on from the public trial. Source - CNN -Agencies",

On February 24, Booru Muna fled police custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake after he was barred from boarding a flight to Dubai owing to a travel ban previously issued by the court. Booru Muna had attempted to fly out of the country using a forged passport. At the time of his arrest, he had confessed to taking shelter at a house located on Malwatta Road in Millaniya, Bandaragama, after the murder of the said restaurant owner. Following his escape, Avissawella High Court, on March 15, once again barred the foreign travels of Booru Muna after taking into the submissions presented by the Western Province South police division.",

        "date": "June 14, 2023 05:51 pm",
        "content": "At least 59 people have died and dozens are feared missing off the coast of southern Greece after a fishing boat carrying migrants capsized and sank, authorities said Wednesday. A large search and rescue operation was launched in the area. Authorities said 104 people have been rescued so far following the nighttime incident some 75 kilometers (46 miles) southwest of Greeces southern Peloponnese region. Four of the survivors were hospitalized with symptoms of hypothermia. It was unclear how many passengers might remain missing at sea after the 59 bodies were recovered, the Greek coast guard said. Six coast guard vessels, a navy frigate, a military transport plane, an air force helicopter, several private vessels and a drone from the European Union border protection agency, Frontex, were taking part in the ongoing search. The Italy-bound boat is believed to have sailed from the Tobruk area in eastern Libya. The Italian coast guard first alerted Greek authorities and Frontex about the approaching vessel on Tuesday. At the southern port of Kalamata, dozens of rescued migrants were taken to sheltered areas set up by the ambulance services and the United Nations Refugee Agency to receive dry clothes and medical attention. Libyan authorities have launched a major crackdown on migrants earlier this month across eastern Libya. Activists have said several thousand migrants, including Egyptians, Syrians, Sudanese and Pakistanis, have been detained. Libyan authorities deported many Egyptians to their home country through a land crossing point. In western Libya, authorities have raided migrant hubs in the capital, Tripoli, and other towns over the past few weeks. At least 1,800 migrants were detained and taken to government-run detention centers, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Mediterranean smugglers are increasingly taking larger boats into international waters off the Greek mainland to try to avoid local coast guard patrols. On Sunday, 90 migrants on a U.S.-flagged yacht were rescued in the area after they made a distress call. Separately Wednesday, a yacht with 81 migrants on board was towed to a port on the south coast of Greeces island of Crete after authorities received a distress call.

        "title": "Belarus starts taking delivery of Russian nuclear weapons",
        "date": "June 14, 2023 09:34 pm",
        "content": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said his country has started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons, some of which he said were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The deployment is Moscows first move of such warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. We have missiles and bombs that we have received from Russia, Lukashenko said in an interview with the Rossiya-1 Russian state TV channel which was posted on the Belarusian Belta state news agencys Telegram channel. The bombs are three times more powerful than those (dropped on) Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he said, speaking on a road in a forest clearing with military vehicles parked nearby and some kind of military storage facility visible in the background. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia, which will retain control of the tactical nuclear weapons, would start deploying them in Belarus after special storage facilities to house them were made ready. The Russian leader announced in March he had agreed to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, pointing to the U.S deployment of such weapons in a host of European countries over many decades. The United States has criticised Putins decision but has said it has no intention of altering its own stance on strategic nuclear weapons and has not seen any signs that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. The Russian step is nonetheless being watched closely by the United States and its allies as well as by China, which has repeatedly cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TARGET Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, told Russian state TV in the interview, which was released late on Tuesday, that his country had numerous nuclear storage facilities left over from the Soviet-era and had restored five or six of them. He played down the idea that Russian control of the weapons was an impediment to using them quickly if he felt such a move was necessary, saying he and Putin could pick up the phone to each other at any moment. Earlier on Tuesday, he had said separately that the Russian tactical nuclear weapons would be physically deployed on the territory of Belarus in several days and that he had the facilities to host longer-range missiles too if ever needed. Lukashenko, who has allowed his country to be used by Russian forces attacking Ukraine as part of what Moscow calls its special military operation, says the nuclear deployment will act as a deterrent against potential aggressors. Belarus borders three NATO member countries: Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. The 68-year-old former Soviet collective farm boss, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, making him Europes longest-serving leader, said he didnt simply ask Putin for the weapons, but demanded them. We have always been a target, Lukashenko said. They (the West) have wanted to tear us to pieces since 2020. No one has so far fought against a nuclear country, a country that has nuclear weapons. Lukashenko has repeatedly accused the West of trying to topple him after mass protests against his rule erupted in 2020 in the wake of a presidential election the opposition said he had fraudulently won. Lukashenko said he had won fairly, while conducting a sweeping crackdown on his opponents. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 15, 2023 07:47 am",
        "content": "At least 79 migrants have died after their boat sank off the Peloponnese, Greeces coastguard has said, as fears mounted that the death toll could rise much higher. Some 100 people were rescued after the boat capsized in international waters in the Ionian Sea during an operation complicated by strong winds, the coastguard said. Coastguard spokesman Nikolaos Alexiou told state TV ERT the search and rescue effort would continue during the night with flares fired by a C-130 military transport plane. The boat capsized and sank early today in a location that is among the deepest in the Mediterranean, he said. A migration ministry source told AFP that according to the coastguard there could have been hundreds of people on board the boat. We fear there will be a very large number of missing persons, the official said. The coastguard spokesman said exact numbers cannot be safely given on those aboard, but the boat was overloaded. The fishing boat was 25-30 metres long. Its deck was full of people, and we assume the interior was just as full, he told ERT. The survivors are mainly from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt, Alexiou said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) acknowledged fears of a large number of missing people, noting in a tweet: We fear more lives were lost. Initial reports suggest up to 400 people were onboard. Another tragedy in the Aegean that reinforces the urgency for concrete, comprehensive action from States to save lives at sea and reduce perilous journeys by expanding safe and regular pathways to migration, another IOM tweet read. Greeces head of state, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, visited the port of Kalamata to confer with senior officials on the rescue and accommodation response. Three days of mourning Greece is under an interim government until 25 June elections. The office of interim prime minister Ioannis Sarmas declared three days of mourning to Saturday, adding that the nations thoughts were with all the victims of ruthless smugglers who take advantage of human misfortune. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said she was deeply saddened by the news of the shipwreck off the Greek coast and the many reported deaths and very concerned by the number of missing people. We must continue to work together, with member states and third countries, to prevent such tragedies, she said. The worst migrant tragedy in Greece was in June 2016 when at least 320 people were listed as dead or missing, according to AFP records going back to 1993. The IOM until Wednesday had listed 48 migrants dead and missing in the eastern Mediterranean so far this year, compared to 378 a year earlier. Along with coastguard patrol boats and a navy frigate, the rescue operation included a helicopter as well as seven other boats that were in the area. Passengers refused help Greek media reported that nearly 30 people have been taken to the ports hospital. The coastguard said four in a more serious condition were transferred to hospital by helicopter. The coastguard said a surveillance plane with Europes Frontex agency had spotted the boat on Tuesday afternoon, but the passengers had refused any help. It added that none on board were wearing life jackets. Authorities said it appeared the migrants had departed from Libya and were heading for Italy. Greeces migration ministry said the survivors would be taken to a migrant camp near Athens. Also today, a sailing boat in distress carrying about 80 migrants off Crete was rescued by a coastguard patrol and towed to port, Greeces port police said. Along with Italy and Spain, Greece has been one of the main landing points for tens of thousands of people seeking to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Another 90 people in a sailboat, more than a third of them children, were rescued near the island of Cythera over the weekend. Greece is also facing an increase of crossing attempts from Turkey on southern routes near the Cyclades islands and toward the Peloponnese peninsula, with boats hoping to avoid patrols in the northern Aegean Sea. Rescue operations are common, but last month the Greek government came under international pressure over video footage reportedly showing the forceful expulsion of migrants who were set adrift at sea. Greece and other EU member states on the southern and southeastern rim of the bloc say they are being unfairly tasked with managing arrivals of undocumented migrants. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the first discussion of the expert committee appointed to support the ministerial committee for the national education policy framework, emphasized the crucial role of human resources in the development of any country. Drawing inspiration from the progress achieved by developed nations, the President stressed the importance of establishing a robust education system and cultivating a skilled workforce to accomplish the objectives of becoming a developed country by 2048, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. During the discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (June 14), the President acknowledged the significance of aligning the countrys human resources, enhancing the education system, and transforming the nation into a regional education hub. To facilitate this, the Education Ministerial Committee was formed, chaired by President Wickremesinghe and comprised ten members. Additionally, a sub-committee was appointed to support the reforms in five key areas, including early childhood education, primary and secondary education, higher education, vocational training, and information technology, the PMD said. Amidst the discussions, urgent amendments to the education system were extensively deliberated upon, with a focus on equipping the future generation to overcome upcoming challenges and build a skilled workforce. The President emphasized the need for fixed examination periods and announced his intention to legally establish a specific month for the GCE Advanced level examination, it added. Any changes to the fixed schedule would require submission to Parliament for approval, except in cases of extreme emergencies such as pandemics or tsunamis. The President also highlighted the preparation of corresponding laws. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of retaining children in school education for thirteen years and called for a decision regarding the necessity of the GCE Ordinary Level Examination and the Grade Five Scholarship examination, according to the PMD. In addition, the President emphasized the imperative of advancing education and technology while maintaining the standard of the school system. Special attention was given to the measures required to enhance the English skills of school children. Recognizing the significance of the quality of education, the President stressed the need for established standards in both government and private schools. To achieve this, the operation of inspectorates was deemed necessary. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the urgency for immediate changes in the vocational training sector. Acknowledging that a trained workforce is essential for a countrys development, he underscored the importance of rapid transformations in Sri Lankas vocational training sector to meet the demands of the upcoming labour market, the PMD mentioned. President Wickremesinghe further stated that a comprehensive long-term economic philosophy should precede discussions on education. Emphasizing the interdependence of education and economic growth, he outlined the aim to overcome short-term debt and achieve a sustained economic growth rate of 8 to 9 within three years, maintained for at least a decade. Such progress is pivotal for propelling the country forward. The President highlighted several factors influencing the rate of economic growth, emphasizing the importance of scaling up products and drawing inspiration from successful examples such as Malaysia, China, and Singapore. However, he emphasized the need for a phased approach, recognizing that immediate transformation on par with Singapores development is not feasible. However, the President said that Sri Lanka needs to look at automation to meet the labour shortage within the next ten years, so that Sri Lanka would have a highly automated labour force and become the automated manufacturing hub in this region, it said. Highlighting human resources as the primary resource for this journey, the President referred to the examples of South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and India, which have achieved development through the effective utilization of human capital. The path to such goals needs to be carefully planned and determined, the PMD reported. Therefore, the convergence of education, economic framework, and climate change was identified as crucial. The President noted that only through competitiveness can the country progress towards a highly competitive economy, which remains the ultimate objective. The discussion was attended by Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Prime Ministers Secretary Anura Dissanayake, and members of the Education Expert Committee, according to the PMD.",

        "content": "Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara says measures will be taken to submit a new Bill to the National Labour Advisory Council soon, in order to amend the shortcomings of the existing labour law. The minister points out that a series of proposals have been made for the preparation of the Bill. Joining an event held at the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, Nanayakkara highlighted that legal provisions would be introduced so as to prevent discrimination against employees in the recruitment process, or at the workplace. In addition, he also mentioned that relevant legal provisions will be provided through this Bill against all forms of harassment and sexual harassment that take place at workplaces. Nanayakkara, who mentioned that a 5-day workweek and flexible work hours that are open to the choice of the employees would be introduced, emphasized that required legal provisions will be facilitated for the employees to engage in part-time jobs. Furthermore, the minister asserted that the stipulations on the female employees working night shifts would be conditionally relaxed. Meanwhile, necessary legal provisions are also planned to be made to facilitate paternity leave. Based on the aforementioned, Nanayakkara said a new layout of the labour law would immediately be submitted to the National Labour Advisory Council and then to the Cabinet of Ministers. In the meantime, suggestions and feedback will be accepted, he said, adding that the proposed Bill would become the Act once it is tabled and passed in the parliament. However, the organizing secretary of the Workers Struggle Centre, Duminda Nagamuwa alleged that the government is working to bring in a new labour law to appease the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Commenting on the matter, the Director General of the Trade Unions to President, Saman Ratnapriya said the trade unionists have been given the opportunity to draft a bill together.",

        "content": "The Chief of Presidential Staff, Sagala Ratnayake says that beneficiaries who have lost Samurdhi subsidies will be given the opportunity to submit appeals. He added that the new welfare benefits programme is scheduled to commence on July 01. Joining an event held in Colombo, Ratnayake mentioned that a procedure will be introduced to directly deposit the welfare money to the benefit receivers bank accounts. Furthermore, he revealed that the government plans to prepare a programme to empower the beneficiaries without keeping them poor forever. Samurdhi subsidy was in place for a long time to eradicate the poverty of the poor. But did it happen? It didnt. He said the Samurdhi subsidy is not enough for low-income people to make ends meet, and that it did not help them to overcome poverty. A census was carried out recently to properly identify the welfare benefit recipients. The list of beneficiaries is not 100 based on the census report. There is an opportunity to submit an appeal if someone thinks they deserve the Samurdhi benefits. If they think they were subject to any injustice, this is an opportunity to rectify it.",

        "date": "June 15, 2023 02:13 pm",
        "content": "State Minister Seetha Arambepola, Chairperson of the Dengue Control Expert Committee, has emphasised the need to raise to raise awareness among the public regarding the protection of both dengue-infected patients and individuals with fever until a confirmed diagnosis is obtained. Addressing a meeting held yesterday (14 June), the State Minister stressed the urgency of spreading the message on safeguarding fever patients from mosquitoes, highlighting that dengue, a disease transmitted through mosquitoes, can be passed from one infected person to another. In response to the escalating dengue crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently appointed a ministerial committee and an expert committee dedicated to dengue control. The expert committee promptly established nine provincial sub-committees, one of which is chaired by State Minister Arambepola. The primary focus of the Western Province sub-committees meeting revolved around taking immediate measures to effectively control the dengue outbreak within a few days. State Minister Arambepola led discussions on the urgency of implementing necessary steps to combat the disease and minimise its transmission. Furthermore, the State Minister emphasised that the current situation presents an opportunity to promptly address the carriers and levels of the virus through immediate measures. Instructing the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU), guidelines were issued to control dengue in the vicinity of hospitals. The NDCU was also directed to create designated areas exclusively for fever patients (Fever Corners) as well as for patients diagnosed with dengue, with the aim of preventing the spread of the disease within hospitals. Additionally, steps were advised to disseminate information regarding the risk of dengue transmission, through text messages. Accordingly, the State Minister has announced a comprehensive plan to allocate five days a week for inspecting schools, places of worship, government and private institutions, commercial premises, and abandoned plots, which are notorious breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes. To facilitate this effort, the State Minister has enlisted the support of the police and armed forces for spot checks. She has advised the relevant departments to coordinate these inspections effectively. In an endeavour to control the spread of dengue among school students, particular attention has been given to advising the provision of suitable clothing that covers the limbs. It was emphasized that this should be implemented without imposing any additional costs on parents. The Ministry of Education will play an active role in informing schools about this recommendation. Furthermore, raising awareness about the use of mosquito repellents has been proposed as an effective measure. State Minister Seetha Arambepola acknowledged the valuable contribution of the dengue groups in the fight against COVID-19. She expressed her commitment to addressing any challenges faced by these groups and emphasized the need to strengthen their efforts to combat dengue. Recognising the significance of the situation, the State Minister advised local government commissioners to address the issues faced by Medical officers of Health (MoH) and provide them with the necessary facilities. Additionally, it was suggested that regional health directors actively participate in the weekly meetings of the sub-committee, allowing them to remain updated through discussions with Medical officers of Health and Public Health Inspectors (PHI). The discussion was attended by Western Province Chief Secretary Pradeep Yasaratne, Western Province Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Dhammika Jayalath, Provincial Health Ministry Secretary Gamini Dharmasena, Local Government Secretary A. D. S. Sadika, Presidents Senior Assistant Secretary Budhika S. Gamage, Presidential Media Director Mr. Shanuka Karunaratne, members of the Western Province Dengue Control Sub-Committee, and officials from the National Dengue Control Unit.",

The 52-year-old was produced before the Colombo Magistrates Court today (June 15). The police arrested the suspect in connection with the death of a five-year-old who was found dead after suffering critical cut wounds at a construction site in Halbarawa, Mulleriyawa on the night of June 08. It was initially believed that the child had died due to excessive bleeding caused by the pieces of a broken glass bottle which was found nearly 4 feet away from body. However, suspicions were raised as no blood stains were observed between the body and the shards. Later, the grass cutter, who had been in the vicinity of the construction site that day, was placed under arrest on suspicion. During investigations, he confessed that the five-year-old, named Jonathan Mark Fonseka, in fact, died after the blades of his lawnmower struck the boy accidently. Stating that he was grappled with panic at the time, the grass cutter admitted to placing the pieces of a broken glass bottle found nearby to make it look like that the boy died from the cut wounds caused by the shards. It was reported that the child was looked after by his grandparents during the daytime, while his mother, who is separated from her husband, was away at work. However, on the day of the incident, the grandfather had gone out to get some work done after leaving the child with the grass cutter who was working at the construction site where he was employed as a caretaker. The grandfather, too, was later arrested over his failure to provide necessary protection for the child, however, he was released on two surety bails of Rs. 300,000 each, and was also ordered to appear before the courts today.",

        "date": "June 15, 2023 03:39 pm",
        "content": "The Attorney General today informed the Court of Appeal that the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) is conducting investigations against Pastor Jerome Fernando under the Money Laundering Act. Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrama, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, informed the court of this when the writ petition filed by Fernando, requesting the issuance of an order to prevent his arrest, was taken up for consideration today (15). The writ petition was taken up today before the Appellate Court bench consisting of Justices Sobitha Rajakaruna and A. Marikkar. The Senior State Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, raised these preliminary objections and requested that the relevant petition be dismissed without being taken up for hearing. The senior state counsel charged that through this petition, the petitioner has concealed facts from the court as well as presented facts that mislead the court. He said that the petitioner has stated in the petition that there are preparations to arrest him based on media reports and also that his accusation is entirely based on media reports. The senior state counsel informed the court that the petitioner had filed a fundamental rights petition with this request before the Supreme Court, but that fact has been concealed in this petition. The senior state counsel providing further information said that an investigation will be conducted regarding this petitioner under the Money Laundering Act. Senior state counsel Mr. Shaminda Wickrama alleged that the malicious actions of the petitioner are revealed through this petition and therefore requested the court to dismiss it without issuing a notice for hearing. However, the further consideration of the petition was adjourned until June 19 while Presidents Counsel Jagath Wickramanayake is scheduled to present the facts on behalf of the petitioner on that day. On Monday (12), the Court of Appeal had granted time for the Attorney General to file objections in relation to the writ petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando. Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema, appearing on behalf of the AG, had strongly objected to Pastor Jeromes request, when the petition was taken up for consideration on June 12. Accordingly, the court granted time until June 14 for the AGs Department to submit the relevant objections, and ordered the case to be recalled today (June 15). Pastor Fernando, in his petition filed through his attorneys, alleges that the CID is preparing to arrest him, accusing him of having committed an offence under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) through a statement he made during a religious sermon. Thus, he had filed this writ petition seeking an order to prevent his arrest.",

        "title": "India, Pakistan brace for winds, flash flooding as Cyclone Biparjoy heads for evening landfall",
        "date": "June 15, 2023 03:43 pm",
        "content": "A vast swath of western India and neighboring southern Pakistan that suffered deadly floods last year are bracing for a new deluge as fast-approaching Cyclone Biparjoy whirls toward landfall Thursday. Rain was falling and skies were darkening in western India and in southern Pakistan along the Arabian Sea, where dusty storms were hampering the evacuation and rescue work. Authorities expect conditions to worsen for two or three days after the cyclone makes landfall in Indias Gujarat. Officials from the two South Asian countries stood on high alert as the cyclone approached. Its expected to make landfall near Jakhau port in Indias Kutch district and inundate the area. In Pakistan, Keti Bandar in the countrys flood-ravaged southern Sindh province, also lies in Biparjoys path. The bazaars and beaches in Mandvi, India, usually a bustling coastal town known for its wooden boat-makers, were deserted Thursday under shutdown orders from the government. Thousands of people in India were evacuated, bringing the total number of people shifted to relief camps to 75,000. In Pakistan, National Disaster Management Authority chief, Lt. Gen. Inam Haider Malik, said 73,000 people have been evacuated to safer places so far, and authorities are providing them shelter and food. The disaster management agency said Thursday that the cyclone was packing sustained winds of up to 120 kph (about 75 mph) and was projected to hit Pakistans Sindh province, the site of one of historic deadly floods last summer. At least 1,739 people were killed and 33 million were displaced in 2022 when climate-induced floods swept the country, causing 30 billion in damage. Thursday morning, authorities said that the storm had lost some of its intensity and was expected to have a maximum sustained wind speed of between 115 kph and 125 kph (71 mph to 78 mph), gusting up to 140 kph (87 mph), a slight decrease in predictions a day earlier. The Indian Meteorological Department said the cyclone was bearing down on Jakhau port, where it is likely to make landfall on Thursday evening. Like southern Pakistan, large parts of coastal Gujarat have also been experiencing heavy rainfall and strong winds. Indian authorities warned that the cyclone, classified as a very severe cyclonic storm, has the potential to inflict heavy damage once it makes landfall. A storm surge of two-to-three meters (two-to-three yards) above the astronomical tide is likely to inundate low-lying areas in the storms path. The tides could rise as high as six meters (more than six yards) in some places, the IMD has said. Elaborate arrangements have been made by us for post-cyclone work like restoration of electricity infrastructure, mobile networks and other infrastructure, Gujarat Health Minister Rushikesh Patel told the Press Trust of India news agency. A government release said major religious sites in coastal Gujarat such as the Dwarkadhish temple in Devbhoomi Dwarka and Somnath temple in Gir Somnath district will remain closed on Thursday. A statement from the Indian railways said 76 trains have been canceled on account of the cyclone. On Thursday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was in Azerbaijan on an official visit. In a tweet the previous day, Sharif said the government had taken all possible measures to ensure the safety of those at risk in the countrys southern Sindh province. Preparations have been made to handle any kind of emergency as a result of rains and strong winds in Karachi, while the evacuation of fishermen from the sea and the population on the coastal areas is going on rapidly, he said. Pakistani Climate Minister Sherry Rehman advised against panic and said Karachi, the countrys largest city with 20 million people, was safe as the cyclone will not make landfall there, as was feared earlier. A reporter for The Associated Press saw people moving to safer places in vehicles, indicating they initially ignored government warnings. Pakistan so far has not issued any appeal for assistance from the United Nations, which said the previous day it was monitoring the situation. Local charities and aid agencies on both sides were helping the displaced people. Experts say climate change is leading to an increase in cyclones in the Arabian Sea region, making preparations for natural disasters all the more urgent. Pakistan is among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change, although the countrys contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1. A 2021 study found that the frequency, duration and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea had increased significantly between 1982 and 2019. In 1998, a cyclone that hit Gujarat state claimed more than 1,000 lives and caused excessive damage. A cyclone that hit Sindh province and the city of Karachi in 1965 killed more than 10,000 people.

        "date": "June 15, 2023 04:21 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court today (June 15) refused to grant leave to proceed with two fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed against the restructuring of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) PLC. The petitions had been filed by Sri Lanka All Telecommunication Employees Union president J.B. Gurusinghe, its secretary H.K. Hettiarachchi and the president of SLT Samagi Sewaka Sangamaya president Indika Priyadarshana. Following a lengthy trial, the Supreme Courts three-judge bench comprising, Justices Murdu Fernando, Kumudini Wickamasinghe and Priyantha Fernando, decided to dismiss the two petitions. The SLT trade union leaders, in their petitions, had deemed the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers to divest the government-owned shares in the SLT a violation of fundamental rights. When the petitions were called before Supreme Court today, Deputy Solicitor General Rajeeva Gunathilake told the judge bench that the Cabinet of Ministers, in March 2023, gave its approval to go ahead with the restructuring of SLT, adding that the proposal was also green-lighted in the budget speech delivered by the President in his capacity as the Finance Minister. He also deemed the concerns raised by the petitioners, about the potential threats to the national security posed by privatization of SLT, baseless. The Deputy Solicitor General went on to note that the move would not be prejudicial to the shareholders nor the subscribers of SLT, as mentioned in the petitions, and requested the judge bench to refuse to grant leave to proceed with the two FR petitions. Later, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva presented submissions on behalf of Sri Lanka Telecom.",

        "content": "Two military personnel have been placed under arrest for their alleged complicity in a human trafficking racket. The arrests were made when the duo was summoned to the Human Trafficking, Smuggling Investigation  Maritime Crime Investigation Division to record a statement. According to reports, a lance corporal of the Sri Lanka Army and a Sri Lanka Navy soldier had obtained Rs. 7 million from several people to help them illegally immigrate to Australia via sea routes. On December 04, 2022, Sri Lanka foiled an illegal immigration attempt by a group of 25 people, who had set sail for Australia from Sampoor in Trincomalee. The apprehended individuals were subsequently handed over to the Human Trafficking, Smuggling Investigation  Maritime Crime Investigation Division for onward probes. The investigators found that this human trafficking racket had been orchestrated by a group of people residing in Sampur. Accordingly, at least 20 people were arrested over the fraudulent scheme and were remanded after being produced before the court. They had purportedly secured approximately Rs. 30 million by obtaining an amount ranging between Rs. 500,000 and Rs. 1.5 million from each illegal immigrant. While probing the matter further, they discovered the involvement of a Lance Corporal of the Sri Lanka Army and a Navy soldier, who had pocketed Rs. 7 million and Rs. 1 million from this racket. It is reported that the navy soldier had provided a boat to the group of illegal immigrants assuring that they would not be taken into custody by the authorities if they use it to set sail. The lance corporal in question was supposed to be produced before the court today, while the navy soldier was remanded until June 21.",

        "date": "June 15, 2023 06:33 pm",
        "content": "After dancing for five days straight, 16-year-old student Srushti Sudhir Jagtap (India) has broken the record for the longest dance marathon by an individual, with a time of 127 hours. The previous record of 126 hours was set by Nepalese dancer Bandana Nepal in 2018. Srushtis dance marathon took place in her colleges auditorium, which was jam packed with supporters, as described by GWR Official Adjudicator Swapnil Dangarikar. There were moments of her being too tired, but her parents were by her side all the time, spraying her face with water to keep her fresh, Swapnil said. Very impressive performance overall. Srushtis attempt began on the morning of 29 May and continued until the afternoon of 3 June. Afterwards, she slept for an entire day. To achieve this record, a recognized dance style must be performed to a reasonable standard, and the participants feet must be moving to the music at all times. Srushti performed the Kathak dance style, which is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance. She decided to break this record because it was her dream to represent India through dance. I wanted to promote our Indian culture, she explained. Srushti prepared for her record attempt for 15 months. She was trained by her grandfather, Baban Mane, who taught her Yoga Nidra, a form of guided meditation also known as yogic sleep. The goal of Yoga Nidra is to activate delta brainwaves  associated with healing and restoring the body during deep sleep  while awake. Srushti said this gave her control over sleep. Srushtis daily training regimen involved up to four hours of guided meditation, six hours of dance practise, and three hours of other exercise. She slept at 10 p.m. and woke up at 3 a.m. every day, getting around five hours of sleep per night. Remarkably, Srushti performed two 126-hour dance marathons at home as part of her preparation. Because of this, she said that her official attempt was not very difficult. Besides coffee, Srushti did not take any stimulants to aid her wakefulness during the record attempt. She drank coconut water and ate chocolate to stay fresh. The final day of Srushtis record attempt was particularly hard for her. My body was not responding, she said. All my body parts felt frozen and in pain. But mentally I was focused towards my goal. Due to strong practise, I was familiar with all the changes in my mind and body, so I was calm and composed until the end. As per our guidelines for longest marathon records, the participant is permitted a five-minute rest break for every continuous hour of activity. These rest breaks can be accumulated if not taken. They were the only times Srushti could sleep or use the bathroom during the attempt. Srushti took her rest breaks mostly at midnight, using the time to nap or talk to her parents for brain refreshment. Without the strong support of her parents, Sudhir and Sanjivani Jagptap, Srushti said she might not have made it to the end. Source - Guinness World Records - Agencies",

        "content": "ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) recently hinted at the possibility of Sri Lanka joining the worlds largest trade deal, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, which is set to give its signatories even more benefits. ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn on Wednesday (June 14) met with the Sri Lankan presidential secretariat delegation, led by the presidents senior economic advisor Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, in Jakarta. They discussed Sri Lankas economic reform agenda, including Sri Lankas possible interest in acceding to the RCEP in the future, an ASEAN press statement reads. The RCEP encompasses the 10 ASEAN member states, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. All these countries represent 32 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The RCEP states that new members can join the trade deal 18 months after it enters into force. Such accession is also subject to the consent of the parties. Original negotiating member India can join the RCEP at any time. In 2019, India decided to drop out of the RCEP talks. The RCEP is set to eliminate up to 90 percent of the tariffs imposed on the goods traded between its signatories over 20 years of coming into force. Indonesia officially implemented the RCEP at the beginning of this year. The Philippines became the last of the 15 countries to implement the RCEP. This trade pact only came into force in the Philippines two weeks ago. Government data showed Indonesia-Sri Lanka trade totaled 433.3 million in 2021, but dropped to 314.2 million a year later. The Trade Ministry reported that Indonesias main exports to Sri Lanka in 2021 included coconut (copra) oil, natural rubber, and semi-finished products of iron or nonalloy steel, among others. Indonesia mostly imported knitted or crocheted fabrics from Sri Lanka. Think tank Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute wrote that ASEAN-Sri Lanka trade reached around 4.5 billion in 2019. Sri Lankas exports to ASEAN amounted to 396 million, accounting for 4 percent of what the country exported that year. Sri Lankan imports from the 10-member grouping were much higher at around 4.1 billion. Source: Jakarta Globe",

        "date": "June 16, 2023 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Roofs were blown off houses and trees and electric poles uprooted, leaving thousands without power as a severe cyclone made landfall and rain lashed both the Indian and Pakistani coasts early on Friday. At least two people died in Indias western state of Gujarat after being swept away by flood waters just before the cyclone hit. More than 180,000 people were evacuated in India and Pakistan in the last few days as authorities braced for the cyclone, named Biparjoy, which means disaster or calamity in the Bengali language. It made landfall late on Thursday near Jakhau, a port in Gujarat that is close to the border with Pakistan, weather officials said. Biparjoy had weakened to a cyclonic storm from a severe cyclonic storm on Friday morning, Indias Metereological Department said in its latest bulletin, with speeds going down from 105 km (65.24 miles) to 85 km (52.82 miles). Wind speeds are likely to reduce further by afternoon, the bulletin said. Two men, both shepherds, died while trying to rescue their cattle from being swept away during heavy rains and floods in Gujarats Bhavnagar district on Thursday evening, the cyclone control room said. Power was disrupted at many places in the Kutch district of Gujarat because of strong winds, said Amit Arora, a top district official overseeing rescue operations. In neighbouring Pakistan, the cyclone had no major impact, with rain reported in some parts of the southern metropolis of Karachi, which was on high alert. Pakistans weather department advised local authorities to remain on alert for expected heavy rain in some coastal areas until Saturday. Gale-force winds caused hundreds of trees to be uprooted in the coastal areas of Gujarat, and heavy rains led to electricity poles being damaged, causing thousands to be without power on Friday, local officials said. Indias weather department warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall in Gujarat and the neighbouring state of Rajasthan through Friday. Pakistans weather department said moderate to heavy rain was expected in the Hyderabad, Nooriabad and Thatta regions. Biparjoy weakened after hitting land with a wind speed of 85 km per hour (53 miles per hour) to 115 kmph (71 mph) Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general at the India Meteorological Department said earlier on Friday. Local television showed visuals of uprooted trees, people sheltering against strong winds and debris lying on roads in the aftermath of the cyclone. Biparjoy was classified as a category one storm, the least severe on a scale of one to five. The government had directed all offshore oil installations to ensure the immediate return of all staff to land and advised ports to also take preventive action, but there was no word on how the landfall had affected operations, if at all.

He gave necessary directives to respective departments during a progress review discussion at the Presidential Secretariat this morning. The Head of State has emphasized the need for a thorough examination of the issues causing delays in the project and urged the authorities to promptly address these problems, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Implemented by the Road Development Authority (RDA) with foreign aid, the entire stretch of road spans over 7.7km. As of May 2023, the physical progress of the first phase of construction was at 85, while the second phase stood at 80. The project, which commenced in January 2016, was originally scheduled for completion in 2020. However, due to challenges faced by the contractor company, issues related to compensating residents for relocation, complications arising from water pipes along the road, and various other general problems, the project experienced significant delays, the PMD explained. Thus, the President decided to engage in an extensive discussion regarding the inability to meet the stipulated deadline. Attending the discussion were Ministers Bandula Gunawardena, Jeevan Thondaman, and Member of Parliament S.M.

The lawmaker told the media that the decision to lift import restrictions on vehicles should be taken after carefully studying the countrys situation. Speaking on the recent significant depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, the lawmaker attributed the situation to prevailing demand and supply, assuring that it is not unusual. Explaining the reasons for rupee depreciation, Siyambalapitiya said the situation was caused by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) purchasing approximately USD 75-80 million from the market and the Central Bank to procure fuel and the heavy buying of US dollars by parties investing in the foreign currency expecting it to appreciate. In response to a question on allowing vehicle imports, the state minister said even the allocation of nearly USD 80 million for fuel purchases had an impact on the value of Sri Lankan rupee against the USD, noting that, at this juncture, permission cannot be granted to import vehicles.",

Testifying before the Senates standing committee on finance, he once again stressed that the country would meet its obligations with or without the Funds bailout package, Dawn news reported. He said no reason had been given by the IMF for the unnecessary delay behind the ninth review, which has been pending since November 2022. IMF or no IMF, Pakistan will not default, he added. Dar made it clear that Pakistan is a sovereign country and cannot accept everything the IMF demands, The News reported. He said that as a sovereign country, Islamabad should have the right to give some tax concessions. The IMF wants us not to give tax concessions in any sector, he added. About the widespread rumours of default, the Minister claimed that geopolitics was aimed at forcing Pakistan to default. Foreign hostile elements want Pakistan to turn into another Sri Lanka and then the IMF will negotiate with Islamabad, Dar alleged. However, he made it clear Pakistan would not become another Sri Lanka at all, The News reported. He said the Chinese understand that politics is being played with Pakistan, so they rolled over deposits and re-financed the commercial loans. Earlier, they were also hesitant on moving ahead, he noted. IMF or no IMF, there are difficulties but we will manage, he claimed. The IMF, he said, was delaying the revival of the programme and wasting time. There are no valid reasons for delaying the 9th Review of the IMF, and the Fund staff approach is non-professional, he said and added that he had categorically refused to share the budgetary details with the IMF without completion of the pending 9th Review. However, when the prime minister instructed him after a telephonic conversation with the IMF MD, then he had to share the budgetary framework, The News reported. Source: IANS",

During the meeting chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, the COPF noted that this legislation was long overdue and would inject some much-needed independence in the analysis process. The committee scrutinized key areas of the Bill and paid special attention to:  The scope of the budget office with regards to evaluations done on economic cost and revenue generation only. There is no mandate to evaluate social impact.  The selection process through an advisory committee consisting of the Chairs of the Public Finance and Ways  Means Committees and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament. This advisory committee will help the Secretary General of Parliament shortlist candidates for selection by the Constitutional Council for the Parliamentary Budget Office.  The ability of the Budget Office to stay consistent with the National Physical plan and disseminate information in strict compliance with the Act that ensures that no sensitive data of compromising nature would be shared. Further, the COPF says a new provision grants the ability for leaders of recognized political parties to forward their own party economic manifestos to the office for an independent analysis. This enables greater transparency and accountability by aspiring candidates who will have to have a scientific methodology for their manifesto provisions. The chairman pointed out that the Parliamentary Budget Office is an independent entity enshrined by the legislature to analyze what has been proposed using alternative methodologies to see what the financial impact on the forecasts is. The Bill was approved pending one amendment to present the budget of the Parliamentary Budget Office within 60 days.",

An agency spokesperson said the accused charge-sheeted on Thursday under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act include three Indians -- Selvakumar M, Vigneshwara Perumal alias Vicky and Iyyapan Nandhu alias Ayyappan Nandhu. The official identified the remaining 10 as Sri Lankan nationals - C Gunasekaran alias Guna, Pushparajah alias Pookutti Kanna, Mohammad Asmin, Alahapperumaga Sunil Ghamini Fonseka, Stanly Kennady Fernando, Dhanukka Roshan, Ladiya alias Nalin Chathuranga, Vella Suranga alias Gamage Suranga Pradeep, Thilipan alias Dileepan and Danarathnam Nilukshan. While Vicky and Nandhu were arrested in April this year, the others were arrested in December last year. The NIA had filed the case suo motu on July 8 last year and arrested the 13 persons from Tamil Nadu. The spokesperson said the charge-sheeted men had conspired for exploiting the illegal drugs trade for funding, amassing and stashing weapons for the revival of LTTE in India and Sri Lanka. The drugs were being sourced from one Haji Salim, who is suspected to be residing in Pakistan, the official said, adding the accused persons had been using various foreign WhatsApp numbers to carry out the clandestine trade. Investigations in the case had exposed their conspiracy to fund the revival of LTTE through drug trade. They were arrested at the Trichy Special Camp (Tamil Nadu), the spokesperson said. The official said the accused were using the proceeds of crime to live a lavish life. Several mobile phones with pre-activated Indian SIM cards were seized from them. The NIA also seized various digital devices, documents relating to drug transactions, cash to the tune of Rs 80 lakh and nine gold bars during the course of the investigations, the official said. The spokesperson said the cash and gold were proceeds from the sale of narcotics and were being channelled through hawala networks between Chennai and Sri Lanka.

        "content": "Around 40 people, mostly students, have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group. A further eight people remain in a critical condition after the attack on Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe. Boys who were staying in dormitories at the school are among the dead. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) - a Ugandan group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - have been blamed for Fridays attack. Many of the bodies were transferred to Bwera Hospital, national police spokesperson Fred Enanga said. The attack happened at around 23:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Friday at the school in the Kasese district in western Uganda. Over 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there. ADF rebels burnt a dormitory and a food store was also looted during the incident, Mr Enanga said. Some of the boys were burnt or hacked to death, Major General Dick Olum from the Ugandan army told the media. Others at the school, mostly girls, have been abducted by the group, he added. Some of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them. The attackers are said to have torched the students mattresses and are also thought to have detonated bombs in the region. Members of the wider community are possibly among the dead. A number of students remain unaccounted for. Soldiers are pursuing ADF insurgents towards the DRCs Virunga National Park - Africas oldest and largest national park which is home to rare species, including mountain gorillas. Militias including the ADF also use the vast expanse, which borders Uganda and Rwanda, as a hideout. Our forces are pursuing the enemy to rescue those abducted and destroy this group, defence spokesperson Felix Kulayigye said on Twitter. The Ugandan army has also deployed planes to help track the rebel group. Uganda and the DRC have held joint military operations in the east Congo to prevent attacks by the ADF. Security forces had intelligence that rebels were in the border area on the DRC side for at least two days before Friday nights attack, Major General Olum said. The deadly episode follows last weeks attack by suspected ADF fighters in a village in the DRC near to the Ugandan border. Over 100 villagers fled to Uganda but have since returned. The attack on the school, located less than two kilometres (1.25 miles) from the DRC border, is the first such attack on a Ugandan school in 25 years. In June 1998, 80 students were burnt to death in their dormitories in an ADF attack on Kichwamba Technical Institute near the border of DRC. More than 100 students were abducted. The ADF was created in eastern Uganda in the 1990s and took up arms against long-serving President, Yoweri Museveni, alleging government persecution of Muslims. After its defeat by the Ugandan army in 2001, it relocated to North Kivu province in the DRC. The groups principal founder, Jamil Makulu, was arrested in Tanzania in 2015 and is in custody in a Ugandan prison. ADF rebels have been operating from inside the DRC for the past two decades. Makulus successor, Musa Seka Baluku, reportedly first pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2016, but it was not until April 2019 that IS first acknowledged its activity in the area. In 2021, suicide bombings in Ugandas capital Kampala and other parts of the country were blamed on the ADF. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security has urged the Foreign Ministry to intervene to dispute the international travel bans imposed on military personnel. At a recent meeting chaired by Dr. Sarath Weerasekera, the parliamentary committee noted that these travel bans affects the moral of the respective military personnel. In response to the concern, Foreign Secretary explained that through the ambassadors and at high-level discussions, the Foreign Ministry has consistently conveyed the position of Sri Lanka on this matter to the respective governments of those countries. The Foreign Secretary also pointed out that they have also requested the respective governments to reconsider their decisions on this regard. The SOC on National Security directed the Foreign Secretary to put together all relevant facts and convey to the respective ambassadors to challenge the travel bans imposed on the island nations military personnel. They also directed the Foreign Ministry to give publicity that Sri Lanka is strongly contesting the travel ban as it is in violation of the Geneva Convention as the island nation has had a non-international armed conflict as proved by both Darusman and OICL reports.

Hence, the committee requested the Foreign Secretary to take necessary actions to strongly communicate to other countries that Sri Lanka is not accountable for such claim made.

        "date": "June 17, 2023 09:00 pm",
        "content": "Exactly one year after political chaos and economic crisis hit Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is visiting India for a day on July 21 to consolidate ties with New Delhi, which gave nearly USD 3.5 billion in emergency aid to stabilize the island nation. While the economic and political situation of the country is headed towards stabilization with the post-Covid return of tourists and increased US dollar remittances from the Sri Lankan diaspora. During his visit, President Wickremesinghe will call on the entire Indian leadership from President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi apart from holding delegation-level talks. Although the political situation is in flux in Sri Lanka with President Wickremesinghe in no hurry to call the general election and serve the mandate given to Gotabaya Rajapaksa till November 2024, the economic situation in the Pearl nation will take time to improve with IMF second loan tranche out of a total package of USD 2.9 billion due at the end of this year. Sri Lanka today remains a net debtor country with large external liabilities and depleted external assets. As per the IMF report, Sri Lankas net external liabilities increased sizably from 51 per cent of the GDP on average during 2017-2018 to 74 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to a jump in gross external liabilities from 64 to 86 per cent of the GDP amid high government borrowing and substantial rupee depreciation, in particular in 2022. The gross external assets dropped from 15 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 11.7 per cent of GDP in 2022. Foreign Direct Investment accounted for about a quarter of the next external liabilities and other investments (debt portfolios and bank loans) accounted for about 60 per cent. About 85 per cent of the total external debt liabilities (74 per cent of the GDP) are long-term, with the government remaining the largest debtor, holding 70 per cent of the total external debt liabilities. It was during the political and economic crisis last year that India gave an emergency aid package to Sri Lanka out of which some USD 3 billion still remains outstanding apart from the bilateral aid extended in the past amounting to another billion dollars. Apart from India, Sri Lanka owes multi-billion amounts to both Japan and big brother ally China, who funded white elephant projects of the Rajapaksas on high interest loans. It was Ranil Wickremesinghe as a Prime Minister in 2017 who changed terms of agreements and gave the Hambantota deep seaport on lease to China for 99 years. It is understood that President Wickremesinghe will travel to China in October to attend the Belt-Road Initiative and meet President Xi Jinping for the first time after his appointment as Sri Lankan President. While Sri Lanka has assured India that it will not allow military use of Hambantota by China, Colombo is still to move on New Delhis request to develop the Trincomalee seaport to push economic revival of north Sri Lanka.
