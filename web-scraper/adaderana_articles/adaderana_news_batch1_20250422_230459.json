        "date": "April 15, 2025 10:19 am",
        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin is likely to move the State Autonomy resolution in the legislative Assembly today. The resolution aims to urge the Indian central government to ensure that states get more powers. This resolution follows several others criticising the central governments policies. The Tamil Nadu Assembly had previously adopted a resolution against the recently passed Waqf (Amendment) Act, urging the central government to repeal the law. On April 4, CM Stalin had informed the Legislative Assembly that the resolution seeking exemption for the state from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has been declined by the President. The Chief Minister had criticised the decision to deny the resolution as a dark chapter in federalism. The Tamil Nadu Assembly has also passed a resolution urging the retrieval of Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka. This resolution to ensure more power to states also came after the significant development of ten bills passed by the Tamil Nadu assembly, which became law without the Governors assent after a Supreme Court order. On April 8, the Supreme Court termed Governor RN Ravis withholding assent to ten bills after they were re-enacted by the State Legislature illegal and erroneous in law. A bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said the Governor must act in aid and advice of the State Legislature. The oldest of the bills passed had been pending since 2020. Sharing the good news of the SC judgement in the state assembly, CM Stalin had termed it as a victory to all states in India. Source: ANI -Agencies-",

        "date": "April 15, 2025 10:36 am",
        "content": "A request made by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe to have a discussion with former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, alias Pillayan, who is currently in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under a detention order, has been denied. Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala confirmed that the former President had made a request to the CID for an opportunity to speak with former State Minister Chandrakanthan, who is currently in custody. It is reported that one of former President Wickremesinghes security officers contacted CID officials via telephone requesting that the former President be allowed to speak with the detainee. Public Security Minister Wijepala clarified that the request was denied on the grounds that it is illegal to speak over the phone with a suspect held in custody. However, former Member of Parliament Udaya Gammanpila has been granted permission to meet and speak with former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan. It was reported that former MP Gammanpila had made the request to the CID, claiming that he needed to speak with the suspect in his capacity as Chandrakanthans legal counsel. Accordingly, Minister Wijepala further stated that Udaya Gammanpila was recently allowed to visit the CID and hold discussions with Chandrakanthan. He also noted that the discussion took place in the presence of CID officers. Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan was arrested by the CID on April 9 in Batticaloa, in connection with the abduction and disappearance of Professor Sivasubramaniam Ravindranath, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Eastern University. Following his arrest, the CID obtained a 90-day detention order for further questioning.",

        "date": "April 15, 2025 11:08 am",
        "content": "The number of Japanese nationals living in the country saw a record year-on-year fall of 898,000 people to 120.3 million as of October 2024, official data showed on Monday (Apr 14). Japans birth rate is among the lowest in the world, a trend which has meant having a shrinking workforce, fewer consumers and businesses fighting to recruit workers. It was the largest fall on record for Japanese nationals since the government began collecting comparable data in 1950, according to the internal affairs ministry. The government has been trying to offer assistance to young couples who wish to have children but feel they cannot due to economic reasons, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi. We understand that the declining birthrate is continuing because many people who wish to raise children are not able to fulfil their wishes, he said during a regular media briefing on Monday. Japans population including foreign nationals also fell by 550,000 people to 123.8 million - the 14th straight annual fall, as the country has failed to effectively address its chronic population decline. Many young people in Japan are delaying getting married and having children for a variety of reasons, ranging from fragile job security to changing social values that put less emphasis on marriage. Japan has turned to young foreigners as a source of labour, but the government has maintained a strict immigration policy, only letting in foreign workers on a temporary basis. The government is trying to raise wages for young people while also offering child rearing assistance, Hayashi said. We will promote comprehensive measures to realise a society where everyone who wishes to have children can have children and raise them with peace of mind, he said. Source: AFP",

        "content": "Nick Frost, Paapa Essiedu, Janet McTeer and Paul Whitehouse will appear in the forthcoming Harry Potter TV series, US network HBO has confirmed.

HBO launched an open casting call for the three lead roles, which reportedly attracted more than 30,000 submissions. John Lithgow, who will play Dumbledore, recently starred in the Oscar-winning Conclave, and has also appeared in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Footloose and The Crown. He won an Olivier Award last week for playing Roald Dahl in stage play Giant, which soon transfers to the West End Paapa Essiedu, who will portray Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape, shot to fame in the TV series I May Destroy You, and has also appeared in Gangs of London and The Lazarus Project.

Rowling will serve as an executive producer on the TV series, which HBO has said will be a faithful adaptation of her books. Further casting announcements are expected to follow soon, with rumours swirling about other actors reportedly in discussions about joining, including Cillian Murphy as a possible Voldermort.

        "date": "April 15, 2025 02:29 pm",
        "content": "Singapores parliament was dissolved Tuesday, paving the way for general elections in which the city-states long-ruling Peoples Action Party will seek to strengthen its dominance under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. Th election will be held May 3, the Elections Department said later in the afternoon. Victory is virtually assured for the PAP, which has led Singapore since its independence in 1965. But Wong, who was sworn in as Singapores fourth leader in May last year, wants to clinch a stronger win after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters rising discontent with the government. Wong succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down after two decades at the helm. Lees departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapores first leader who built the colonial trading outpost into one of the worlds richest nations during 31 years in office. In the 2020 polls held during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP maintained its supermajority with 83 out of 93 seats. But it ceded more seats to the opposition, which increased its parliamentary representation from six to 10, the highest ever. The PAPs share of popular support also slipped to a near-record low of 61. As Wong heads into his first general election as PAP chief, he has sought to reach out to disgruntled younger voters. He launched a Forward Singapore plan that aims to give Singaporeans a say in how to develop a more balanced, vibrant and inclusive agenda for the next generation. The PAP will field more than 30 new candidates to refresh the party. Wong has warned that who you have in the cockpit matters amid economic uncertainties as U.S. tariffs hit the global trading system. The biggest contest we face isnt between political parties, its Singapore vs the world, Wong said in a Facebook post earlier this week. Our mission... is clear: to keep our nation a shining beacon of stability, progress and hope. While Singapore has flourished as one of the worlds wealthiest nations, it has also become one of the most expensive cities to live in. The PAP has been criticized for tight government control and a government-knows-best stance, media censorship and the use of oppressive laws against dissidents. Issues like widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAPs grip on power.

Consultant physician Dr. Nandana Dickmadugoda noted that the high temperatures pose a risk that could even lead to death. Therefore, he emphasized that individuals with chronic illnesses should be particularly cautious, and that even the general public should be mindful of the prevailing weather pattern. Dr. Nandana Dickmadugoda said, Even though there are occasional rains, we still feel intense heat. The main reason is the presence of clouds, which prevent water vapor from rising, resulting in extremely high humidity in the environment. Because of this, we are experiencing severe discomfort from the heat. He added, So, if you go outdoors, you are exposed to intense sunlight, which can lead to several health problems. Especially those working outdoors may experience issues due to high temperatures, including dizziness, body pain, and excessive sweating. While these symptoms may seem mild at first, the situation can become severe. We should all avoid reaching a state known as heatstroke. This condition can potentially be fatal. Children, the elderly, and people with chronic medical conditions are more vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat than the general population. Therefore, these groupsand children in particularshould be protected from exposure to heat as much as possible, he said. Dr. Nandana Dickmadugoda noted that if there is an urgent need to step outside, its important to use an umbrella or wear protective clothing to shield from the heat. He also emphasized the importance of staying hydrated while encouraging the public to take plenty of fluids such as porridge, soup, tea, and oral rehydration solutions containing sugar and salt.",

        "date": "April 15, 2025 05:32 pm",
        "content": "China accused the United States National Security Agency (NSA) on Tuesday of launching advanced cyberattacks during the Asian Winter Games in February, targeting essential industries. Police in the northeastern city of Harbin said three alleged NSA agents to a wanted list and also accused the University of California and Virginia Tech of being involved in the attacks after carrying out investigations, according to a report by state news agency Xinhua on Tuesday. The NSA agents were identified by Xinhua as Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling and Stephen W. Johnson. The three were also found to have repeatedly carried out cyber attacks on Chinas critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber attacks on Huawei RIC:RIC:HWT.UL and other enterprises. It did not specify how the two American universities were involved. The U.S. Embassy in China did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Chinas foreign ministry later confirmed the attacks and said Beijing had raised its concerns with the United States. We urge the U.S. to take a responsible attitude on the issue of cyber security and ... stop unprovoked smears and attacks on China, ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular news briefing. The detailed allegations come as the worlds two largest economies spiral deeper into a trade war that has already spurred travel warnings for Chinese tourists going to the U.S. and halted imports of U.S. films into China. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) launched cyber attacks against important industries such as energy, transportation, water conservancy, communications, and national defence research institutions in Heilongjiang province, Xinhua said, citing the Harbin city public security bureau. The attacks had the intention of sabotaging Chinas critical information infrastructure, causing social disorder, and stealing important confidential information, it added. Xinhua said the NSA operations took place during the Winter Games and were suspected of activating specific pre-installed backdoors in Microsoft Windows operating systems on specific devices in Heilongjiang. In order to cover its tracks, the NSA purchased IP addresses in different countries and anonymously rented a large number of network servers including in Europe and Asia, Xinhua said. The NSA intended to use cyberattacks to steal the personal data of participating athletes, the news agency said, adding that the cyber attacks reached a peak from the first ice hockey game on February 3. The attacks targeted information systems such as the Asian Winter Games registration system and stored sensitive information about the identities of relevant personnel of the event, Xinhua said. The U.S. routinely accuses Chinese state-backed hackers of launching attacks against its critical infrastructure and government bodies. Last month, Washington announced indictments against a slew of alleged Chinese hackers who targeted the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the foreign ministries of Taiwan, South Korea, India, and Indonesia. Beijing denies all involvement in overseas cyber espionage. After years of being accused by Western governments of cyberattacks and industrial espionage, in the past two years several Chinese organisations and government organs have accused the United States and its allies of similar behaviour. In December, China said it found and dealt with two U.S. cyber attacks on Chinese tech firms to steal trade secrets since May 2023, but did not name the agency involved. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 15, 2025 05:39 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has reiterated that owners of rooftop solar systems must switch off their units until 03.00 p.m. on a daily basis until 21 April if they receive an SMS from the board. The CEB noted that such measures are taken when there is a risk of grid instability, owing to the significant reduction in demand during the New Year holiday period. After a detailed study on the forecast demand for electricity during the April holidays and the operational renewable energy supplies, the CEB decided that the supply of electricity would need to be managed during the April holidays, the board said in a statement. The statement went on to say, At any given moment, electricity production should exactly match the consumption. If customers are not using much electricity or have closed down, electricity production, too, has to be reduced. On Sundays and national holidays, the customer demand is very low, and therefore, electricity supply too, must be reduced. On Thursday, 10th April from 1500hrs onwards, supply from rooftop units of 100kW and above, operating on net plus and net plus plus contracts, were shut down. These units, numbering about 500, supply energy to the grid on a commercial basis. In line with standard operational practices during periods of low demand, similar to other CEB and privately-owned power plants, these units remain offline throughout the holiday period to support grid stability. The vast majority of 100,000 customers have solar units smaller than 100 kW and consume some of its production at the same location. On Friday, April 11th, as some factories were still working, the morning demand was met initially with the support of three coal generating units. Later during the day, all three coal units were backed off to their minimum power levels to accommodate solar generation from about 100,000 smaller solar units during daytime. The daytime peak demand was successfully met using a diverse energy mix of hydro, coal, naphtha, wind, solar, and mini hydro sources. As the night-time demand sharply declined, signaling that the holiday season has commenced, one coal unit was completely shut down at 21:57. Although rooftop solar units, which collectively exceed 1,500 MW in capacity, are not directly visible to the System Control Centre (SCC), the recorded overall demand during most of the daytime remained above 1,500 MW. This suggests a significant contribution from rooftop solar units. Additionally, large synchronous generators played a vital role in maintaining system inertia, ensuring grid stability throughout the day. On Saturday, April 12th, with factories and offices shut down, electricity demand dropped sharply as expected. The demand at 6 am, before any solar units commenced production, was lower by about 400 MW compared with a typical Saturday. The only remaining oil power plant that was helping overnight in the absence of one coal unit, the Kelanitissa power plant using Naphtha from the refinery, was fully shut down by 09:16 AM to accommodate the production from solar units. No oil-fired power plants operated the rest of daytime. Only two coal units operating at minimum power and larger hydro power plants maintained grid stability. CEB prioritized renewables, allowing all small solar units to produce, but as a precaution, issued SMS alerts to all rooftop solar owners to support grid management. The night peak was met using hydropower and ramped-up coal power from the two coal units that were still in operation. Shutting down another coal unit would have risked meeting night-time customer demand and inertia. On Sunday, April 13th, the demand fell further as shops and other commercial customers, too, closed down, increasing grid stability challenges. CEB again issued a public request to all rooftop solar unit owners, including smaller units, to temporarily shut down during the day. Only two coal units at minimum production operated during daytime to accommodate solar powerno oil-fired power plants were used. Throughout this period, only two coal units, operating at minimum power at daytime to enable solar power to be absorbed, but operating at almost full power overnight to serve the customer demand, were active. Oil-fired generation was used briefly during night peaks, when the other renewables (wind and biomass) and hydropower alone could not meet the demand. In conclusion, CEB Media Spokesman Dhammike Wimalaratne said the board continuously reviews the supply-demand situation, and when there is a risk of grid instability, a request will be made from owners of rooftop solar systems to shut down their units. Therefore, the CEB Spokesman requested relevant parties to support the initiatives taken by the board until 21 April.",

The 31-year-old suspect, who is employed by a company involved in land trading in the US, had arrived from Bangkok, Thailand, on SriLankan Airlines flight UL-403, which landed at 10:15 a.m. at the BIA. He was detained while attempting to exit the airport through the Red Channel, a designated business corridor at the arrival terminal. Upon inspection, Customs officers discovered a total of 23 kilograms of the narcotic substance Kush concealed in 23 one-kilogram packets within his suitcase. The estimated street value of the seized drugs is approximately Rs. 230 million. The Director General of Customs, Mr. Sarath Nonis, and Customs Media Spokesperson and Additional Director General, Mr. Seevali Arukgoda, were present at the airport to observe the operation. According to Mr. Arukgoda, the legalization of substances such as Kush in Thailand has made such drugs readily available in the open market. As a result, there is a growing trend of narcotics such as Kush, Hashish, and Cocaine being smuggled into Sri Lanka from Thailand in significant quantities.",

        "content": "China is tearing down walls and expanding its circle of trading partners, shaking hands instead of shaking fists, its foreign ministry said on Tuesday, as Beijing works on diversifying ties amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. President Donald Trump has added an eye-watering 145 of tariffs on Chinese goods this year as part of broader reciprocal duties on all U.S. trading partners. That prompted ridicule and criticism from Beijing, which retaliated by jacking up levies on U.S. goods by 125. In the face of external uncertainties, China will insist on shaking hands rather than shaking fists, tearing down walls instead of building barriers, connecting instead of decoupling, Lin Jian, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a press briefing on Tuesday. The World Trade Organization has warned the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade row could cut the shipment of goods between two economies by as much as 80 and severely hurt global growth. Beijing has called U.S. President Donald Trumps tariffs strategy a joke, irritating U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. These are not a joke. I mean these are big numbers, Bessent said in a Bloomberg Television interview. I think no one thinks theyre sustainable, wants them to remain here, but its far from a joke. Any U.S. China negotiations would have to come from the top, involving Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Bessent also said. Xi on Monday kicked off a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia. In Vietnam, which is facing potential U.S. tariffs of 46, Xi called for the two countries to oppose unilateral bullying and to strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains. Chinese and Vietnamese officials also signed dozens of cooperation deals during Xis visit, including on production and supply chains as well as railway cooperation. After a two-day stop in Hanoi, Xi will continue his Southeast Asian trip by visiting Malaysia and Cambodia, which could be slapped by additional U.S. tariffs of 24 and 49, respectively. A commentary published on Tuesday by Chinas state-run Peoples Daily underlined the need for unity amid the trade turbulence. In the face of crisis, no one can keep only to oneself, the commentary said, referencing Dorothys adventure in the American childrens story The Wizard of Oz. Only unity and cooperation can meet the challenge. The commentary presented China as a benevolent advocate for free trade, spotlighting Chinas decision to implement zero tariffs for some of its least developed partners. Source: Reuters Agencies",

The Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge is currently nearing the end of construction in Guizhou, southwest China. It will measure 2,051 feet above river level, which is 947 feet taller than current bridge title holder the Millau Viaduct in France. Guizhou province is a mountainous areas of China, with complex terrain. The bridge crosses the dramatic Huajiang Grand Canyon, also called the earth crack. China has a nationwide push to improve infrastructure, especially in relatively underdeveloped mountainous areas like Guizhou, which is 800 miles west of the city of Shenzhen. Thus, the bridge isnt just about breaking a record  once in operation, it will be easier than ever for cars and trucks to traverse the area. According to state media, it will reduce travel time over the Huajiang Grand Canyon from two hours to just one minute. The bridge is a steel truss suspension bridge with a total length of 9,482 feet. Construction officially started on January 18, 2022 and is expected to be completed on June 30, 2025, Guizhou local state media said. Altogether, these trusses weigh about 22,000 tons, equivalent to three Eiffel Towers. At present, the overall progress of the bridge has reached 95, and it is planned to be opened to traffic in the second half of 2025, Zhang Shenglin, chief engineer of Guizhou Highway Group, told the state-run newspaper China Daily. By then, this super project that spans the earth crack will be the worlds first in both directions. It will become another landmark project to demonstrate Chinas infrastructure strength, Zhang added.

        "date": "April 16, 2025 10:45 am",
        "content": "Perus former president, Ollanta Humala, has been found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison. A court in the capital, Lima, said that Humala had accepted illegal funds from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaigns in 2006 and 2011. His wife, Nadine Heredia, who co-founded the Nationalist Party with Humala, was also found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years. Heredia was granted asylum by Brazil and will have safe passage to travel there with her son, Perus foreign ministry said. Prosecutors had asked that Humala be sentenced to 20 years in jail and Heredia to 26 and a half years. After a trial lasting more than three years, the court gave its long-awaited verdict on Tuesday. Humala attended the verdict in person while his wife heard it via video link. The 62-year-old former president and his wife had denied any wrongdoing. Who is Ollanta Humala? Humala, a former army officer who fought against the Maoist Shining Path rebels, first came to national prominence in 2000 when he led a short-lived military rebellion against then-President Alberto Fujimori. In 2006, he ran for president. He allied himself with the Venezuelan president at the time, Hugo Chávez, and prosecutors alleged that Humala had accepted illegal funding from Chávez to finance his campaign. His rival for the presidency, Alan García, used Humalas close ties to Chávez as a way to attack him, warning voters not to let Peru turn into another Venezuela. In 2011, Humala ran for the presidency again, this time on a more moderate platform. He said that rather than emulating Chávezs socialist revolution in Venezuela, he would model his policies on those of the Brazilian president at the time, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. His approach proved successful and he defeated his right-wing rival, Keiko Fujimori. But violent social conflicts early on his presidency quickly dented his popularity. He also lost the support of many members of Congress, further weakening his position. His legal troubles started shortly after his term had finished in 2016. That year, the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht confessed to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and political parties across Latin America, to win business orders. Prosecutors accused Humala and his wife of receiving millions of dollars from Odebrecht. A year later, a judge ordered that the couple be placed in pre-trial detention. They were released after a year but the investigation into their links with Odebrecht continued, culminating in todays verdict. Source: BBC --Agencies",

This adjustment is part of a broader strategy to balance electricity supply and demand during the festive season. The CEB said it had conducted a detailed study on projected electricity demand and available renewable energy output during the holidays, which informed the temporary operational changes. The utility provider emphasized that maintaining a balance between electricity generation and consumption is critical for grid stability. Since April 10, electricity demand has dropped to unusually low levels. As a result, the CEB has temporarily disconnected rooftop solar systems exceeding 100 kilowatts in capacity. Further, on April 13, the board issued a notice requesting all rooftop solar power unit owners to stop generating power during daylight hours. In its latest announcement, the CEB reiterated that rooftop solar system owners should disconnect their units only if they receive an SMS notification from the board and only until 3.00 p.m. This step, the board said, is essential to maintaining national grid stability. The CEB also extended its appreciation to the public, especially rooftop solar users, for their continued cooperation in managing the power supply during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.",

        "date": "April 16, 2025 02:01 pm",
        "content": "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe warns that Sri Lanka faces the potential loss of more than 100,000 jobs in the country as a result of the new trade tariff policy implemented by the United States. Delivering a special statement today (16), Wickremesinghe described the situation as an economic emergency and urged the government to inform the public of the steps it is taking to address the looming crisis. As tariffs increase, consumer demand for goods declines. This is not a hypothetical situation. It is already unfolding. One direct consequence of this will be job losses. Some estimate over 100,000 jobs are at risk. Whether the number is exactly that or slightly lower, the figure is set to rise, he stressed. The former President also emphasised that the impact would not be limited to jobholders alone but would ripple across the broader economy, stating, People running boarding houses, shops, and other support services will also see their income affected. This will, in turn, hurt our overall economy. He further noted that a drop in export revenue could worsen Sri Lankas balance of payments, weaken the rupee, and lead to a further slowdown in economic growth. As our earnings decline, our borrowing needs will increase. The economy may slow down further, and the rupee could depreciate even more, Wickremesinghe cautioned. Calling for immediate diplomatic engagement with the United States, Wickremesinghe stressed the urgency of transparent communication. The government must treat this as an emergency and clearly communicate what measures are being taken locally. Otherwise, one problem will follow another, he added.",

        "content": "The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has strengthened its position as the leading entity in the superannuation sector, accounting for 81.0 of the sectors total assets by the end of 2024. The Funds net worth rose by 12.6 year-on-year to Rs. 4,375.7 billion, up from Rs. 3,886.7 billion in 2023, primarily driven by robust investment returns and a rebound in net contributions. Total contributions received during 2024 increased by 11.3 to Rs. 234.4 billion, while refund payments to members and legal heirs fell by 12.9 to Rs. 188.1 billion. This shift translated into a positive net contribution of Rs. 46.3 billion for the year, a significant turnaround from the Rs. 5.3 billion net outflow recorded in 2023. The EPF recorded an investment income of Rs. 513.8 billion in 2024, marking a 6.8 increase from Rs. 481.1 billion the previous year. Interest income, the Funds primary revenue stream, rose by 2.9 to Rs. 455.1 billion. Dividend income surged by 82.9 to Rs. 5.5 billion, while net fair value gains from listed equity investments more than doubled to Rs. 49.2 billion. The Fund maintained an operating expenses to gross income ratio of just 0.6, demonstrating continued operational efficiency. However, its tax expenditure climbed to Rs. 64.1 billion, reflecting higher investment earnings. In light of the Funds performance, the Governing Board of the Central Bank has approved an interest rate of 11.00 on member balances for 2024, subject to the approval of the Ministers of Labour and Finance.

        "date": "April 16, 2025 04:54 pm",
        "content": "The United Kingdoms highest court ruled on Wednesday that the definition of a woman under equality legislation referred to biological sex, but it said trans people would not be disadvantaged by its landmark decision. The Supreme Courts judgment related to whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate, a formal document that gives legal recognition of someones new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britains Equality Act. The landmark case is the latest example of the wider debate around transgender rights ending up before the courts. Campaign group For Women Scotland had argued rights under the Equality Act should only apply based on a persons biological sex. It had challenged guidance issued by the devolved Scottish government that accompanied a 2018 law designed to increase the proportion of women on public sector boards. Scottish ministers guidance said a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate was legally a woman. After For Women Scotland had lost in the Scottish courts, the Supreme Court ruled in the campaign groups favour after an appeal last November, a decision greeted by cheering outside the building. The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms women and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex, Deputy President of the Supreme Court Patrick Hodge said. But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in our society at the expense of another - it is not, he added. Critics of the Scottish law had said its definition could impact single-sex services for women such as refuges, hospital wards and sports. But transgender campaigners had said if the court ruled in favour of For Women Scotland, it could lead to discrimination against those with gender recognition certificates, especially over employment issues. The correct interpretation of the EA (Equality Act) as referring to biological sex does not cause disadvantage to trans people, whether or not they possess a gender recognition certificate, Hodge said. Trans people have the rights which attach to the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. In the United States, legal challenges are underway after President Donald Trump issued executive orders that include barring transgender people from military service. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "US says China faces up to 245 tariff due to retaliatory action",
        "date": "April 16, 2025 07:07 pm",
        "content": "China now faces tariffs of 245 per cent on import of goods into the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions, the White House said Tuesday afternoon (India time) as the trade war between the two countries appears to run further and further off road. The announcement came as President Donald Trump authorised an investigation into national security risks posed by the US reliance on imported, processed critical minerals and derived products, which includes cobalt, lithium, and nickel, and rare-earth metals used to manufacture smartphones and batteries (for electric vehicles), as well as military equipment. Trumps order points out the US is dependent on foreign sources... that are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks. This dependence, the White House said, raises potential for risks to national security, technological growth, and economic prosperity. Until now tit-for-tat tariff exchanges had seen the US levy a 145 per cent tax on Chinese imports and China slap a 125 per cent duty on American goods. Beijing has also banned the export of certain goods, including those used by aerospace manufacturers and military contractors. On Wednesday morning a top Chinese official claimed the US tariffs were putting pressure on it. However, simultaneously China also said its economy grew a forecast-beating 5.4 per cent in the first quarter. Industrial output climbed 6.5 per cent and retail sales 4.6 per cent year-on-year. Beijing, though, warned the global economic environment is becoming more complex and severe and that more needs to be done to boost growth and consumption. Trump, meanwhile, has said China needs to make the first step in any negotiation. The ball is in Chinas court. China needs to make a deal with us. We dont have to make a deal with them, the President said, a day after he accused Beijing of reneging on a major Boeing deal. Trump has repeatedly accused China, India, Brazil, and most of the rest of the world, in fact, of levying higher tariffs on American imports than the US places on goods it imports from them. The President has argued, and this was a major issue in his re-election campaign, that levying reciprocal tariffs will either force other countries to bring down their taxes or jumpstart a stuttering American manufacturing sector, offering much-needed local employment. In line with that vision that Trump, since the start of the year, has imposed duties on imports from China, alongside a 10 per cent baseline tariff on many US trading partners. These began with cumulative 10 per cent tariffs in February and March, and a massive 34 per cent in April. By April 9 the cumulative tariffs had crossed 100 per cent, prompting markets worldwide, including in the US, to nosedive. Since then Trump has paused several orders, although not those impacting China. China responded in kind and also suspended import of sorghum, poultry, and bonemeal, put trade restrictions on 27 American firms, and filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The tariff war has also prompted Beijing to reach out to India and the European Union to drum up support. Last month Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on New Delhi and Beijing to make elephant and dragon dance and take the lead in opposing hegemonism and power politics. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

The agency believes Asian economic growth will slow as exports and export-oriented investment are hit by tariffs and high uncertainty. Fitch also pointed out that regional governments policy responses to the trade war will be key to its impact on APAC sovereign ratings. According to the rating agency Foreign-exchange reserves could shrink if authorities intervene to support their currencies in the face of market pressure to depreciate following the tariff increases. This could be credit negative for sovereigns with relatively low external buffers, such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, particularly if their export earnings are hurt by the tariffs.",

        "content": "A boat has capsized after catching fire in northwestern Congo, leaving at least 50 people dead and hundreds missing, a local official said on Wednesday. Dozens were saved following the accident on the Congo River late on Tuesday night, many of them with bad burns. The search for the missing was underway Wednesday with rescue teams supported by the Red Cross and provincial authorities. The motorized wooden boat with about 400 passengers caught fire near the town of Mbandaka, Compétent Loyoko, the river commissioner, told The Associated Press. The boat, HB Kongolo, had left the port of Matankumu for the Bolomba territory. About 100 survivors were taken to an improvised shelter at the Mbandaka town hall. Those with burn injuries were taken to local hospitals. The incident began while a woman was cooking on board, Loyoko said. Several passengers, including women and children, died after jumping into the water without being able to swim. Deadly boat accidents are common in the central African country, where late-night travels and overcrowded vessels are often blamed. Authorities have struggled to enforce maritime regulations. Congos rivers are a major means of transport for its more than 100 million people, especially in remote areas where infrastructure is poor or nonexistent. Hundreds have been killed in boat accidents in recent years as more people abandon the few available roads for wooden vessels packed with passengers and their goods.

        "content": "The Maldives has changed its immigration law to bar people from entering the country with Israeli passports in a show of outrage over the war in Gaza. The amendment was passed by Parliament on Monday and approved by President Mohamed Muizzu on Tuesday, according to a statement from the presidents office. The Maldives immigration service clarified that Israeli citizens who have a second passport would be able to enter the country. The Cabinet took the decision nearly a year ago but the government did not formalize it until this week. The ratification reflects the governments firm stance in response to the continuing atrocities and ongoing acts of genocide committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, the statement said. Maldives is a tiny archipelago state south of India known as a high-end tourist destination. It is predominantly a Sunni Muslim nation where preaching and practicing other faiths is legally banned. According to the latest available immigration statistics, 59 people with Israeli passports entered the Maldives in February. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 17, 2025 09:47 am",
        "content": "The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) says that all Value Added Tax (VAT) returns must be filed electronically from July 01, 2025. Meanwhile, manual filed return submissions will only be allowed under exceptional circumstances approved by the Commissioner General, the IRD noted. Earlier today (17), the IRD announced that locally produced liquid milk and yogurt are now exempted from VAT, following the enactment of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill. In addition to dairy products, VAT has also been removed on naphtha supplied by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for electricity generation. The amendment introduces new tax obligations for the digital economy. From October 1, VAT will be imposed on digital services provided by non-resident entities to consumers in Sri Lanka through electronic platforms. This move aligns with global trends in taxing cross-border digital services. Further, the department announced that all individuals and entities engaged in the commercial import or export of goods are now required to register under the updated VAT framework. The department clarified that the VAT exemption came into effect on April 11, the day the bill received parliamentary assent from Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne. The bill was passed in Parliament on April 9. Additionally, the VAT exemption on the import of aircraft engines or aircraft spare parts, identified under specified Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Numbers for Custom purposes has been lifted with effect from April 11.",

        "date": "April 17, 2025 10:34 am",
        "content": "During an interview with San Francisco Chronicle, Chris Columbus shared that he wishes he could remove Donald Trumps cameo from Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Home Alone 2 director Chris Columbus has expressed his desire to remove US President Donald Trumps cameo from the iconic film, calling it a curse and an albatross. During an interview with San Francisco Chronicle, Chris Columbus shared that he wishes he could remove Donald Trumps cameo from the 1992 sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. He said, I cant cut it. If I cut it, Ill probably be sent out of the country. Ill be considered sort of not fit to live in the United States, so Ill have to go back to Italy or something. Chris, with Italian ancestry, was born and raised in the US. He was sarcastically referring to the Donald Trump administrations mass deportation plans. Back in 2023, Donald Trump shared that Chris was begging him to appear in the film. I was very busy, and didnt want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent. I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket, and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time. People call me whenever it is aired. Now, however, 30 years later, Columbus (what was his real name?) put out a statement that I bullied myself into the movie. Nothing could be further from the truth. That cameo helped make the movie a success  Just another Hollywood guy from the past looking for a quick fix of Trump publicity for himself, he posted on Truth Social. Now, Chris has responded to Trumps post, saying, We screened the film in Chicago, and when that moment came onscreen the audience went crazy. They cheered and they cheered and they thought it was hilarious. I think I know a lot about comedy, but I dont, obviously, because I never thought that was going to be considered hilarious. Years later, its become this curse. Its become this thing that I wish it was not there. Whats going through this guys mind? He said I was lying. Im not lying. He said I begged him to be in the movie, but theres no world I would ever beg a non-actor to be in a movie. But we were desperate to get the Plaza Hotel. But its there. Its become an albatross for me. I just wish it was gone. In the film, little Kevin -- played by Macaulay Culkin and again separated from his parents -- struggles to find his way through the gilded hotel. He stops a man in a long black overcoat and red tie to ask him for directions to the lobby. Down the hall and to the left, replies Trump. Actor Matt Damon claimed in a 2017 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the businessman would allow films to be shot in his buildings as long as he received a part. Trump is thus -- most of the time playing himself -- in the credits of some 20 films and series, including Zoolander and Sex and the City. Chris family comedy Home Alone (1990) starred Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, a 10-year-old who fends off home invaders after his parents accidentally leave him alone at Christmas. The movie, which cost 18 million to make, was a huge hit, pulling in more than 475 million. Source: Hindustan Times --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake announced in Mannar that the government will extend the Aswesuma welfare benefits program to an additional 400,000 families starting in June this year. He made these remarks while addressing a public rally held in Mannar today (17). After five to six years, we now have the largest foreign exchange reserves. The rupee has remained stable for the past six months. We have reduced fuel prices and lowered electricity tariffs. We are actively working to resolve the problems faced by the people. We have increased the salaries of government employees and enhanced the Aswesuma welfare benefits, the President said. He further elaborated on a range of people-centric initiatives: In addition to increasing the allowance under the Aswesuma program, we are now working to extend this support to 400,000 more families by June. We are providing school uniforms to all students and financial assistance for purchasing shoes for schools with fewer than 300 children. Furthermore, Rs. 6,000 has been granted to 1.6 million children for the purchase of school books. This is a government that genuinely cares for its people. For the first time in five to six years, we are recruiting 30,000 individuals into the public service. There is no longer a need to seek political influenceapplicants can simply respond to public notices, sit for the relevant exams, and be selected based on merit. Highlighting the importance of inclusivity, the President addressed the need for Tamil-speaking officers in public service and law enforcement: There is a shortage of Tamil-speaking personnel in the public sector, including the police. To address this, we are recruiting 2,000 new police officers. I urge parents to encourage their Tamil-speaking children to join the police servicea respected profession responsible for maintaining law and order. We will ensure improved facilities and a dignified career path. Those proficient in Tamil are also encouraged to enter the wider public service. Let us work together to build a united nation. The President also acknowledged the challenges faced by the Northern Province due to the civil conflict: During the war in the Northern Province, the government had to take over lands and close certain roads. The National Peoples Power is committed to resolving these longstanding issues and building a country where people can live and work freely. He further noted that Rs. 1.5 million has been allocated for road construction in the Northern Province, with a significant amount also earmarked for promoting coconut cultivation in the region. Additionally, President Dissanayake stated that discussions are underway with the Government of India to expedite the commencement of a ferry service between Mannar, Sri Lanka, and Rameswaram, India.",

        "date": "April 17, 2025 12:08 pm",
        "content": "China is banning automakers from using the terms smart driving and autonomous driving when they advertise driving assistance features, and it will tighten scrutiny of such technology upgrades. The mandate on vehicle advertising was delivered by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in its meeting with nearly 60 representatives from automakers on Wednesday, according to a transcript seen by Reuters and confirmed by one of the attendees. The move follows a fatal accident involving Xiaomis best-selling SU7 sedan in March that triggered widespread concerns over vehicle safety. Preliminary findings showed the Xiaomi car caught fire after hitting a cement roadside pole at a speed of 97 kph (60 mph) seconds after its driver took over control from the advanced driving assistance system (ADAS). The ministry confirmed the meeting in a short statement that said it provided clarity to automakers about new requirements published in February involving driving-related over-the-air technology upgrades of intelligent and connected vehicles. Under the updated rule, automakers are no longer allowed to test and improve their ADAS via remote software updates for vehicles already delivered to customers without approval, according to the meeting transcript. They are now required to carry out enough tests to verify reliability and to obtain approval from the authorities before such roll-outs. Huawei, which supplies its ADAS to at least seven brands including Audi in China, was among the firms that attended the meeting, according to the transcript. The regulatory move comes as automakers have been rushing to launch new models equipped with ADAS, touting the smart driving capability as a key selling point to battle a brutal price war that has extended into the third year in the worlds largest auto market. BYD escalated the competition in February when it rolled out at least 21 affordable models priced from less than 10,000 that are equipped with free smart driving features. Many of its peers including Leapmotor and Toyota followed suit, introducing affordable vehicles with similar features. The Chinese regulators are tightening the scrutiny on electric vehicle technologies as the industry has grown faster than expected, with sales of EVs and hybrids accounting for more than half of total vehicle sales late last year, a milestone achieved ahead of policymakers schedule. The regulators are also tightening regulations on EV battery standards, aiming to reduce risks of fire and explosions. Analysts and industry sources cautioned the stricter regulatory rules would increase costs and slow the pace of technology development and adoption. But it could also accelerate a long-overdue consolidation in Chinas crowded auto industry that has been grappling with overcapacity, they added. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Apple has released iOS 18.4.1 and it comes with a warning to update your iPhone now. Thats because iOS 18.4.1 fixes two iPhone security flaws, both of which are being used in real-life attacks. Apple doesnt provide a lot of detail about whats fixed in iOS 18.4.1, because the iPhone maker wants to give people as much time to update before more attackers can get hold of the details. The first flaw fixed in iOS 18.4.1 is an issue in the iPhones CoreAudio tracked as CVE-2025-31200 and reported by Apple and the Google Threat Analysis Group. Processing an audio stream in a maliciously crafted media file may result in code execution, Apple warned on its support page. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS, the iPhone maker added. The second bug patched in iOS 18.4.1 is a flaw in RPAC tracked as CVE-2025-31201 and reported by Apple. The vulnerability could allow an attacker with arbitrary read and write capability to bypass Pointer Authentication, Apple said, adding that the issue may also have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack. The iOS 18.4.1 update comes just two weeks after the release of iOS 18.4, which itself patched 62 vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of the latest upgrade. In March, Apple again addressed an already-exploited flaw in the iOS 18.3.2 update. Why You Should Update Now To iOS 18.4.1 Apples iOS 18.4.1 is an emergency security update that comes in between major point upgrades, ahead of iOS 18.5s arrival in May. There is no iOS 17 update for older iPhones, perhaps because the operating system is not affected by this flaw. However, Apple is no longer issuing security updates to iOS 17 users that are able to upgrade to iOS 18. The flaws have been fixed in a smaller iPhone update  and there is an indication that theyre being actively exploited. This highlights the importance of this update, says independent security researcher Sean Wright. As a result I would recommend people update as soon as possible, he says, adding that there is no need to panic in most cases. Ineed, despite the urgency of the iOS 18.4.1 upgrade, Apple said the flaws fixed in iOS 18.4.1 were used in targeted attacks. These are likely against journalists, dissidents, government officials and businesses in certain sectors. Yet if attackers get hold of the details, they can use the flaws more widely. Apples iOS 18.4.1 also addresses several bugs, including one that prevents wireless CarPlay connection in certain vehicles. The iOS 18.4.1 update is available for the iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 13.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later. So what are you waiting for? Go to your iPhone Settings  General  Software Update and download and install iOS 18.4.1 now. Source: Forbes --Agencies",

He made these remarks during a special police press briefing held this evening (April 17), focusing on security arrangements for devotees and traffic management during the event. DIG Masinghe stated that, while there will be no priority access for VIPs, a limited number of Buddhist monks will be granted special access and security within the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Additionally, foreign ambassadors attending as dignitaries will undergo special screening procedures. He further noted that they will be given the opportunity to venerate the Sacred Relic prior to the formal commencement of the exposition. Emphasizing the prioritization of worshippers, DIG Masinghe said that approximately 98 of the arrangements are dedicated to ensuring a smooth and respectful experience for devotees. He added that those attending the early morning Kiri Ahara Puja will be able to participate in the religious observances without interruption. However, he stressed that all devotees must vacate the temple premises by 10:30 a.m. To streamline movement, three entry queues and two exit queues will be established. The DIG also cautioned that bringing Pirikara (offerings or religious items) may lead to delays and inconvenience for other devotees. Meanwhile, DIG Masinghe stated that video surveillance will be in place along the queues to ensure orderly conduct and to prevent unauthorized access, assuring that there is no room for anyone to sneak in. The special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic will take place at the Sri Dalada Maligawa from 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on April 18.

        "title": "Scientists find strongest evidence yet of life on an alien planet",
        "date": "April 17, 2025 03:03 pm",
        "content": "In a potential landmark discovery, scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have obtained what they call the strongest signs yet of possible life beyond our solar system, detecting in an alien planets atmosphere the chemical fingerprints of gases that on Earth are produced only by biological processes. The two gases - dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, and dimethyl disulfide, or DMDS - involved in Webbs observations of the planet named K2-18 b are generated on Earth by living organisms, primarily microbial life such as marine phytoplankton - algae. This suggests the planet may be teeming with microbial life, the researchers said. They stressed, however, that they are not announcing the discovery of actual living organisms but rather a possible biosignature - an indicator of a biological process - and that the findings should be viewed cautiously, with more observations needed. Nonetheless, they voiced excitement. These are the first hints of an alien world that is possibly inhabited, said astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridges Institute of Astronomy, lead author of the study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. This is a transformational moment in the search for life beyond the solar system, where we have demonstrated that it is possible to detect biosignatures in potentially habitable planets with current facilities. We have entered the era of observational astrobiology, Madhusudhan said. Madhusudhan noted that there are various efforts underway searching for signs of life in our solar system, including various claims of environments that might be conducive to life in places like Mars, Venus and various icy moons. K2-18 b is 8.6 times as massive as Earth and has a diameter about 2.6 times as large as our planet. It orbits in the habitable zone - a distance where liquid water, a key ingredient for life, can exist on a planetary surface - around a red dwarf star smaller and less luminous than our sun, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). One other planet also has been identified orbiting this star. A Hycean World About 5,800 planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets, have been discovered since the 1990s. Scientists have hypothesized the existence of exoplanets called hycean worlds - covered by a liquid water ocean habitable by microorganisms and with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Earlier observations by Webb, which was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022, had identified methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18 bs atmosphere, the first time that carbon-based molecules were discovered in the atmosphere of an exoplanet in a stars habitable zone. The only scenario that currently explains all the data obtained so far from JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), including the past and present observations, is one where K2-18 b is a hycean world teeming with life, Madhusudhan said. However, we need to be open and continue exploring other scenarios. Madhusudhan said that with hycean worlds, if they exist, we are talking about microbial life, possibly like what we see in the Earths oceans. Their oceans are hypothesized to be warmer than Earths. Asked about possible multicellular organisms or even intelligent life, Madhusudhan said, We wont be able to answer this question at this stage. The baseline assumption is of simple microbial life. DMS and DMDS, both from the same chemical family, have been predicted as important exoplanet biosignatures. Webb found that one or the other, or possibly both, were present in the planets atmosphere at a 99.7 confidence level, meaning there is still a 0.3 chance of the observation being a statistical fluke. The gases were detected at atmospheric concentrations of more than 10 parts per million by volume. For reference, this is thousands of times higher than their concentrations in the Earths atmosphere, and cannot be explained without biological activity based on existing knowledge, Madhusudhan said. Scientists not involved in the study counseled circumspection. The rich data from K2-18 b make it a tantalizing world, said Christopher Glein, principal scientist at the Space Science Division of the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. These latest data are a valuable contribution to our understanding. Yet, we must be very careful to test the data as thoroughly as possible. I look forward to seeing additional, independent work on the data analysis starting as soon as next week. Transit Method K2-18 b is part of the sub-Neptune class of planets, with a diameter greater than Earths but less than that of Neptune, our solar systems smallest gas planet. To ascertain the chemical composition of an exoplanets atmosphere, astronomers analyze the light from its host star as the planet passes in front of it from the perspective of Earth, called the transit method. As the planet transits, Webb can detect a decrease in stellar brightness, and a small fraction of starlight passes through the planetary atmosphere before being detected by the telescope. This lets scientists determine the constituent gases of the planets atmosphere. Webbs previous observations of this planet provided a tentative hint of DMS. Its new observations used a different instrument and a different wavelength range of light. The Holy Grail of exoplanet science, Madhusudhan said, is to find evidence of life on an Earth-like planet beyond our solar system. Madhusudhan said that our species for thousands of years has wondered are we alone in the universe, and now might be within just a few years of detecting possible alien life on a hycean world. But Madhusudhan still urged caution. First we need to repeat the observations two to three times to make sure the signal we are seeing is robust and to increase the detection significance to the level at which the odds of a statistical fluke are below roughly one in a million, Madhusudhan said. Second, we need more theoretical and experimental studies to make sure whether or not there is another abiotic mechanism (one not involving biological processes) to make DMS or DMDS in a planetary atmosphere like that of K2-18 b. Even though previous studies have suggested them (as) robust biosignatures even for K2-18 b, we need to remain open and pursue other possibilities, Madhusudhan said. So the findings represent a big if on whether the observations are due to life, and it is in no ones interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life, Madhusudhan said.

He further clarified that, without any changes to the existing arrangements, postal voters from all relevant institutions will be able to mark their ballot papers at their respective offices during this period. In addition, a special postal voting center will be established at Kandy Girls High School to facilitate voting for police officers deployed for special duties at the Sri Dalada Maligawa during the exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic. He also noted that the necessary facilities have been arranged for members of the tri-forces to cast their postal votes within these four days, under the supervision of designated certifying officers at each military camp. Meanwhile, the official ballot papers for all eligible voters in the 339 local government bodies where elections are scheduled were handed over to the Postal Department by the respective Returning Officers on April 16. The distribution of ballot papers has already commenced and will continue until April 29, he said. The Election Commission advised that if a voter has not received their ballot papers after April 29, they should make inquiries at the relevant post office. Previously, on March 27, the Election Commission had announced that postal voting would take place on April 22, 23, and 24 at all District Secretariats and election offices, and that individuals unable to vote on those days could do so on April 28 and 29. However, with the latest revision, the official postal voting days are now April 24, 25, 28, and 29.",

        "date": "April 18, 2025 08:15 am",
        "content": "The son of a police officer has opened fire with her former service weapon at Florida State University (FSU), killing two people and injuring six others, authorities say. The alleged gunman, 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, began shooting at around lunchtime near the student union building in the state capital of Tallahassee. The suspect was shot by police and taken to hospital. The motive is unclear. The deceased were not students, campus police said, but their identities have not been released. The suspect is the son of a veteran Leon County police officer who is a model employee, said Sheriff Walt McNeil. Jessica Ikner, a school resource officer, kept the gun after the force upgraded its weapons. A shotgun was also found at the scene, police said. The gunman is believed to be a FSU student, according to investigators. He was a longstanding member of the sheriff offices youth advisory council and was engaged in a number of training programmes, Sheriff McNeil said. So it is not a surprise that he had access to weapons, he said. The suspect was a protester at a campus demonstration against President Donald Trumps inauguration in January, according to the student newspaper. His quote to FSUNews.com was removed on Thursday with an editors note saying the outlet did not wish to amplify the suspects voice. Police responded to an active shooter call at around midday local time, the university said. An alert was issued warning students and those on campus to seek shelter and await further instructions. One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class, student Ava Arenado told CBS News Miami. Another student, Blake Leonard, told CBS he initially heard roughly 12 shots fired. In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too, he said. President Donald Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident before meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House, was asked whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting. He said he was a big advocate of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights. I have been since the beginning, he said. I have protected it. These things are terrible. We will have more to say about it later. He called the shooting a shame, a horrible thing. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said: Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding. This is not the first shooting at FSU. In 2015, a graduate of the school shot and injured three people at the library before he was fatally shot by police. The father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Parkland High School in Florida said some of her classmates who were lucky enough to survive that attack were on the campus at FSU during Thursdays assault. Fred Guttenberg, a gun control advocate, wrote on X: Incredibly, some of them were just a part of their 2nd school shooting and some were in the student union today. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2025 08:33 am",
        "content": "Dont freak out when you try to board a flight to this southwestern Japanese prefecture and the destination on the ticket says Hello Kitty  youre definitely on the right plane. Oita, a scenic region known for its natural hot springs on the Japanese island of Kyushu, has recently renamed its air hub Oita Hello Kitty Airport to lure fans and tourists. The six-month rebrand, which runs from now through October 13, will inject the otherwise sleepy airport with an extra dose of the countrys quintessential cuteness  or kawaii in Japanese. As expected, Hello Kitty (who is, by the way, not a cat) is everywhere. Arriving passengers peeking through plane windows will get their first greetings from the Japanese character painted on the boarding bridge. As they make their way to the luggage conveyor belt, they will see posters of Hello Kitty dragging a suitcase and riding on a miniature plane. The rebranding rides on the hype of Osaka Expo 2025 and seeks to offer an alternative destination to the already congested ones, as Japan grapples with record numbers of tourists. The tourism boom  which hit a record-breaking 10.5 million in the first three months of 2025  has given the worlds fourth-biggest economy a needed kick but also created headaches for locals. We hope to encourage more tourists, particularly those who typically visit high-traffic destinations like Tokyo and Kyoto, to travel to Oita instead, a spokesman from Oita Prefectural Governments tourism bureau told CNN on Thursday. Oita is about one hour away from Osaka by plane and four hours by train. Joining Hello Kitty at the Oita airport are friends like My Melody, Little Twin Stars and Pochacco. All are characters from Sanrio, the merchandising company behind her universe of cuteness. Why Oita, though? Sanrio runs a theme park called Harmonyland in the prefecture. The company will be selling exclusive Hello Kitty key chains and t-shirts at the domestic terminal. In addition to attracting visitors not only from major metropolitan areas such as the Tokyo and Kansai regions but also by highlighting the unique appeal of Oita Prefecture and Kyushu such as hot springs, nature, and cuisine, we aim to leverage the global popularity of Japans Sanrio characters and their theme park, Sanrio said in a statement. We are filled with the hope that this airport will become a bridge connecting countless smiles, Sanrio Entertainment President Aya Komaki said during a recent launch, before touting Hello Kittys slogan written on a flag she holds in posters at the airport: Hello from Oita to the world. Oita prefecture sits about 40 miles southeast of Fukuoka, Kyushus biggest city, and is home to some of Japans most sought-after onsen towns, like Beppu and Yufuin. Its more popular among local tourists than international visitors, though. Almost 80 of 530,033 visitors recorded last month were domestic travelers. The airport operates mainly domestic flights, but also runs a few international routes to Seoul in South Korea and Taipei in Taiwan. It is not the first airport to name itself after the nations much-worshipped cartoon characters, with Japanese manga and anime being among the countrys most influential exports. In the central city of Tottori, officials renamed its airport Tottori Sand Dunes Conan Airport in 2015 to pay tribute to Case Closed, a Japanese manga and anime series about a child detective, Conan, who battles criminals with cool gadgets a la James Bond. The neighboring Yonago Kitaro Airport also took its name from another manga and anime series, GeGeGe no Kitaro, which follows the quest of a young boy named Kitaro who fights off demons  or yokai in Japanese  to protect humans. Other airports have also featured popular characters from Super Mario Bros and Pokemon in their tourism campaigns, even though they werent down for a name change. The country with one of the most complex train networks in the world also puts its favorite characters on trains, including  guess who  Hello Kitty. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "Ukraine said on Thursday that Kyiv and Washington had signed a memorandum as an initial step towards clinching an agreement on developing mineral resources in Ukraine, a deal promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said the accord could be signed next week. Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraines first deputy prime minister and economy minister, wrote on social media that the memorandum had been signed. We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, she wrote. A Ukrainian delegation travelled to Washington at the end of last week for negotiations after the Trump administration offered a new, more expansive deal. The initial framework agreement that was agreed to has never been signed. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said: We have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday. Trump has pushed for a compact that would allow the United States to have privileged access to Ukraines natural resources and critical minerals in what he casts as repayment for military aid provided by Washington to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden. Sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said were still working on the details and that the signing could come by next Friday. Its substantially what wed agreed on previously, he said. When the president was here, we had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal, and I think its an 80-page agreement and thats what well be signing. The White House did not respond to a request for further details on the timing and contents of the agreement. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said earlier that the two countries could sign the memorandum online later in the day. This is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions, Zelenskiy told reporters in Kyiv. He added that the offer to sign the memorandum before the comprehensive deal, which would require ratification in the Ukrainian parliament, had come from the U.S. side. Svyrydenko earlier said that Kyiv and Washington had made significant progress while discussing the agreement, and the memorandum was the first stage to record this. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2025 10:24 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Trilingual Inscription (Tribhasha Sellipiya) and a collection of documents connected with the Pānadurā Vādaya (The Great Debate of Panadura) in 1873 have been inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced on Thursday. The Trilingual Inscription, a submission made jointly by China and Sri Lanka, is a stone tablet with Chinese, Persian and Tamil inscriptions, praising Buddha, God Vishnu and Allah. Discovered in 1911 in Sri Lanka by a British engineer, it is now preserved in the Colombo National Museum, with a replica exhibited in the Galle National Museum. Dated 15th February 1409, the tablet was installed by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He. Originally inscribed in the Treasure Boat Shipyard Park in Nanjingin, it was brought to Sri Lanka during his third voyage. The text mentions offerings made to a sacred mountain shrine. This is the only trilingual inscription having texts in Chinese, Tamil and Persian which represent three different regions and cultures, according to the UNESCO. Meanwhile, four documents connected with the Pānadurā Vādaya in 1873, kept at the Rankot Viharaya Buddhist temple in Panadura, which was also inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register on Thursday, hold immense historical, cultural, spiritual, and intellectual value. Created against the backdrop of religious discord between Buddhists and Christians in mid-19th century, they consist of correspondence between the Christian and Buddhist leaders advocating for an open dialogue on doctrinal issues, as well as a transcription of the entire dialogue. This transcription spans 27 and a half page of handwritten text on paper using ink, the UNESCO decribed. The event fostered reconciliation and mutual respect between the two religious communities. The English translations, later made available in Europe and the US, had a significant impact on religious activists and scholars in those countries, contributing to the recognition Buddhism as an advanced religion. The Memory of the World Register consists of documentary collections including books, manuscripts, maps, photographs, sound or video recordings, which bear witness to the shared heritage of humanity. Documentary heritage is an essential yet fragile element of the Memory of the World. This is why UNESCO invests in safeguarding it, shares best practices, and maintains this register that records the broadest threads of human history, said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. With the latest additions, the Memory of the World Register now comprises 570 collections, encompassing a wide range of subjects including the scientific revolution, womens contribution to history, and major milestones of multilateralism. Established in 1992, the Memory of the World Programme aims to promote the preservation of  and universal access to  the documentary heritage of humanity. Often extremely fragile, this heritage is exposed to risks of deterioration and disasters. In addition to the International Register, UNESCO has supported the creation of four regional registers and National Memory of the World Committees in more than 100 countries.",

        "title": "US strikes on Yemen oil terminal kill at least 58, Houthis say",
        "date": "April 18, 2025 03:44 pm",
        "content": "US air strikes on a key oil terminal on Yemens Red Sea coast controlled by the Houthi movement have killed at least 58 people and wounded 126 others, Houthi-run media say. The US military said it had destroyed Ras Issa to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue. The Houthi-led government that runs north-western Yemen said the terminal was a civilian facility and that attack constituted a full-fledged war crime. It was one of the deadliest incidents since President Donald Trump ordered US forces to intensify their bombing campaign last month in response to Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel linked to the Gaza war. Several hours after the strikes on Ras Issa, the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Sirens sounded in several Israeli areas but there were no reports of any casualties or damage. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 14 air strikes hit Ras Issa late on Thursday. Videos posted online purportedly showed several explosions, large fires and destroyed fuel tankers at the facility, which is about 60km (35 miles) north of the Red Sea city of Hudaydah. Al-Masirah cited local health authorities as saying many of the dead were workers at the facility. It also reported that five paramedics were killed in secondary US strikes as they arrived at the scene. The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but footage from Al-Masirah appeared to show at least 10 charred bodies near the burning tankers, including one driver, as well as men being treated for serious burns in hospital. We affirm that the targeting of the Ras Issa oil port is a full-fledged war crime, as the port is a civilian facility and not a military one, the Houthi-run government said in a statement. We hold the US administration fully responsible for the consequences resulting from its escalation in the Red Sea, it warned. The US militarys Central Command said in a statement that the objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen. The Houthis, their Iranian masters, and those who knowingly aid and abet their terrorist actions should be put on notice that the world will not accept illicit smuggling of fuel and war material to a terrorist organisation, it added. Irans foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the strikes as barbaric. On Thursday, the Houthis leader gave a defiant speech in which he claimed the recent US strikes failed to stop their attacks. Abdul Malik al-Houthi said the groups forces had carried out almost 80 operations involving around 170 missiles and drones since mid-March, including 30 attacks targeting the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman and 26 attacks on Israel. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the countrys north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden. After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation - something the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the countrys humanitarian crisis. Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be completely annihilated. He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing. Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since last July in retaliation for the hundreds of missiles and drones that the Israeli military says have been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which have been shot down.

        "title": "Trump says US will pass on Ukraine peace talks if no progress soon",
        "date": "April 19, 2025 09:09 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said the US will take a pass on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv make it very difficult to reach a peace deal. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in a specific number of days but he wanted it done quickly. His comments came hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days. Were not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end, Rubio said, adding that the US had other priorities to focus on. This comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue, with two people reported killed and more than 100 injured in the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy on Friday. Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Russian troops have been advancing - albeit slowly - in eastern Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire. When asked about a deal between Russian and Ukraine, Trump said: Were talking about here people dying. Were going to get it stopped, ideally. Now if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, were just going to say, Youre foolish, youre fools, youre horrible people, and were going to just take a pass. Despite the Trump administrations initial confidence that it could secure a deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides. Following a meeting with European leaders in Paris about a potential ceasefire on Thursday, Rubio told reporters on Friday: We need to determine very quickly now - and Im talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable. If its not going to happen, then were just going to move on, he said about truce talks. He admitted that a peace deal would be difficult to strike. Trump had said before he re-entered office that he would stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked to respond to Trump saying he expected an answer from Russia on a ceasefire, said the negotiations taking place are quite difficult. The Russian side is striving to reach a peace settlement in this conflict, to ensure its own interests, and is open to dialogue, he said. During a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance said he was still optimistic about ending the Ukraine war. I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours, he said. I wont prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war - this very brutal war - to a close. Vances comments followed separate news that Ukraine and the US took the first step towards striking a minerals deal, after an initial agreement was derailed when a February meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky erupted into a public shouting match. On Thursday, the two countries signed a memorandum of intent on setting up an investment fund for Ukraines reconstruction as part of an economic partnership agreement. The aim is to finalise the deal by 26 April, the memo published by the Ukrainian government says. The details of any deal remain unclear. Previous leaks have suggested the agreement has been extended beyond minerals to control of Ukraines energy infrastructure, as well as its oil and gas. Ukrainian negotiators have tried to resist Trumps demands that a joint investment fund would pay back the US for previous military aid, but have seemingly accepted his claim that it would help the country recover after the war ends. The memo said the American people desire to invest alongside the Ukrainian people in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine. Zelensky had been hoping to use the deal to secure a US security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire deal, telling European leaders last month that a ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. The US has so far resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees. The White House argues the mere presence of US businesses would put off Russia from further aggression, but that did not exactly work when they invaded in 2022. Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced the signing of the memorandum on X, with pictures of Svyrydenko and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately signing the document over an online call. There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries, Svyrydenko wrote. Bessent said the details were still being worked out but the deal is substantially what wed agreed on previously. Trump hinted at the deal during a press conference with Meloni, saying we have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on (next) Thursday... and I assume theyre going to live up to the deal. So well see. But we have a deal on that. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP and the chair of Ukraines parliamentary committee on EU Integration, told the BBC the Ukrainian parliament would have the last word in the deal. She added: I hope that there will be enough reasoning to ensure that whatever is signed, and if it is going to be ratified that it is in the interest of our country and our people. On Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Rubio and Trumps special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris to discuss how to end the war. Sybiha said they had discussed the paths to a fair and lasting peace, including full ceasefire, multinational contingent, and security guarantees for Ukraine. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Following investigations based on received intelligence, officers from the Manampitiya Police Station arrested the suspect  a 38-year-old resident of Manampitiya. Preliminary investigations suggest the shooting was motivated by a personal dispute with the pastor of the church, according to police. Further investigations are being carried out by Manampitiya Police.",

        "title": "Pakistan-Sri Lanka Naval exercise scrapped after Indias concern - report",
        "date": "April 19, 2025 10:35 am",
        "content": "A plan to hold a military exercise between the navies of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the strategic waters of Trincomalee was shelved a few weeks back, after New Delhi conveyed its concerns to Colombo over the proposed drills, multiple sources have said. Trincomalee is situated on Sri Lankas northeastern coast and is considered a significant hub in the Indian Ocean region, especially for Indias maritime security interests. The sources said the navies of the two countries had planned to carry out the exercise off Trincomalee, in line with their regular engagements. The plan did not go through after India apprised its apprehensions over the exercise to the Sri Lankan side, they told PTI. The joint exercise was planned weeks ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Colombo, the sources said. The navies of Pakistan and Sri Lanka are known to have cordial relations and warships from both countries visit each others ports regularly, besides carrying out wargames. There was no official word on the plan either from Sri Lanka or Pakistan. Military experts, explaining Trincomalees strategic importance for India, said it has the potential to dominate the Bay of Bengal and much of the northeast Indian Ocean, and New Delhi was right in expressing concerns over the proposed exercise. The Pakistani Navy operates in close cooperation with Chinas PLA Navy and New Delhi has reasons to have concerns over any visit by Pakistani warships to Trincomalee, said one of the experts. The docking of Chinese missile and satellite tracking ship Yuan Wang at the Hambantota port in August 2022 had triggered a diplomatic row between India and Sri Lanka. Another Chinese warship docked at the Colombo port in August 2023 had also triggered some concerns in New Delhi. In the last few years, India has been focusing on extending assistance to Sri Lanka in developing Trincomalees energy infrastructure. India is especially looking at revitalising the oil tank farms in Trincomalee that has one of the finest natural harbours in the world. During Modis visit to Colombo this month, India, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) firmed up an ambitious agreement to develop Trincomalee as an energy hub, with a broader aim to help the island nation achieve energy security and fuel its economic growth. Significantly, India and Sri Lanka also signed a defence pact to institutionalise military cooperation following talks between Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The agreement on defence cooperation signals a major attempt to boost the India-Sri Lanka defence ties, nearly four decades after the Indian Peace Keeping Forces intervention in the island nation strained the relations. India has been expanding its overall strategic ties with Sri Lanka amid concerns over Chinas attempts to increase influence over the island nation. Three years back, India handed over a Dornier maritime surveillance aircraft to Sri Lanka. The aircraft was given to Sri Lanka from the inventory of the Indian Navy to help the country meet its immediate security requirement. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "April 19, 2025 11:46 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police have launched an investigation into a viral video circulating on social media, showing a female tuition teacher being escorted by police motorcycles and vehicles to an event organized by her. Police Media Spokesperson SSP Buddhika Manathunga confirmed that the individual in question is a private tuition teacher who conducts classes for students preparing for the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. Addressing the controversy, SSP Manathunga explained that the Sri Lanka Police may provide officers and vehicles for specific public affairs  such as for filming a movie  but only after a thorough intelligence review of the request and its context, including the script. He further clarified that police officers may also be deployed for public events such as musical shows or ticketed functions, but this is permitted only upon payment of a required fee. In this particular case, the teacher is reported to have requested police support, claiming it was needed for a ceremony honoring students who had successfully passed the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. The event was said to involve nearly 8,000 students and 35,000 parents. However, preliminary investigations have revealed that the teacher may have used the police escort to boost her personal image, raising serious concerns about the misuse of state resources. Sri Lanka Police have since launched an inquiry into how the vehicles and officers were allocated for the event, and whether any police personnel were complicit in the unauthorized use of official resources, SSP Manathunga said.",

        "date": "April 19, 2025 12:22 pm",

Devotees will be allowed to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic today from 12 noon to 5.30 p.m. today (19). The religious observance began yesterday at 2.30 p.m. and concluded at 5:30 p.m., granting thousands the chance to pay homage to the Sacred Relic after a gap of 16 years. Over 100,000 devotees had visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa on the opening day. Many who were unable to worship the Sacred Relic yesterday remained overnight in Kandy in hopes of doing so today. A Dansala organized by the Sri Dalada Maligawa for visiting devotees was held last night, with Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela also in attendance. The Dansala served dinner to approximately 35,000 people daily from 7.30 p.m. to 2.00 a.m. A special dining hall capable of accommodating 1,000 people at a time has also been set up. To manage the massive influx of worshippers, three main access routes have been arranged: -From D.S. Senanayake Street to the Sri Dalada Maligawa entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Sangharaja Mawatha to the main entrance, -From Rathu Bokkuwa via Maligawa Place to the main entrance. Each of these queues had stretched over 4 kilometers by this afternoon (19). In the meantime, special public transport services are in operation for devotees traveling from across the island, including Colombo. Sri Lanka Railways has deployed eight additional daily train services to Kandy, while the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is running special bus services from several major cities. To ensure public health and safety, the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors Association has deployed nearly 50 public health inspectors daily. Their duties include inspecting food outlets, monitoring garbage disposal, and ensuring adequate drinking water and toilet facilities for devotees. However, authorities noted that some pilgrims had carelessly disposed garbage at various locations in the city. Health officials are urging the public to responsibly dispose of waste in designated areas and help maintain a clean environment. According to reports, the accumulated garbage had been cleared by this morning. The Kandy Municipal Council has taken steps to further improve public health amenities, including expanding toilet facilities. Meanwhile, devotees can access real-time updates on queue status and parking availability through the official police website at www.police.lk. Sri Lanka Police request the public to dress in white attire and refrain from bringing large bags, cameras, video equipment, and other electronic devices to the Sri Dalada Maligawa for security reasons.",
