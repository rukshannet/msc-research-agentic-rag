        "title": "Putin tells Poland any aggression against Belarus is attack on Russia",
        "date": "July 22, 2023 10:05 pm",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused NATO member Poland of having territorial ambitions in the former Soviet Union, and said any aggression against Russias neighbour and close ally Belarus would be considered an attack on Russia. Moscow would react to any aggression against Belarus, which forms a loose Union State with Russia, with all the means at our disposal, Putin told a meeting of his Security Council in televised remarks. Warsaws Security Committee decided on Wednesday to move military units to eastern Poland after members of the Russian Wagner mercenary force arrived in Belarus, the state-run news agency PAP quoted its secretary as saying on Friday. Poland denies any territorial ambitions in Belarus. In his remarks Putin had also stated that the western part of Poland was a gift from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to the country and that Russia would remind Poles about it. In apparent reference to that, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted on Friday evening that Stalin was a war criminal, guilty of the death of hundreds of thousands of Poles. Historical truth is not debatable. The ambassador of the Russian Federation will be summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said. On Thursday, Belarus said Wagner mercenaries had started to train Belarusian special forces at a military range just a few miles from the Polish border. RUSSIA STAGING TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS Russia has in recent weeks begun stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus for the first time. The Kremlin said Putin would meet Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, with whom he speaks regularly, in Russia on Sunday. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday that Germany and NATO were prepared to support Poland in defending the military alliances eastern flank. Putin said there were press reports of plans for a Polish-Lithuanian unit to be used for operations in western Ukraine - parts of which in the past belonged to Poland - and ultimately to occupy territory there. It is well known that they also dream of the Belarusian lands, he said, also without providing any evidence. On Wednesday, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was shown in a video welcoming his fighters to Belarus, telling them they would take no further part for now in the war in Ukraine but ordering them to gather strength for Wagners operations in Africa while they trained the Belarusian army. Prigozhin says Wagner, which led the conquest of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, is Russias most effective fighting force. But his frequent clashes with the Moscow defence establishment led him to stage an armed mutiny four weeks ago. The insurrection ended with an agreement that Wagner fighters - many recruited from prison - could move to Belarus if they wished. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka may allow Indian rupee to be used in local transactions",
        "date": "July 23, 2023 08:48 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Sri Lanka is considering the possibility of allowing the use of the Indian rupee for local transactions, as the island nation struggles to build its depleted foreign reserves and to emerge from last years unprecedented economic crisis. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said Saturday the move to allow the use of its giant neighbors currency would enable tourists and other people from India to directly use Indian rupees here without going through the hassle of multiple currency conversions. Sri Lanka imports plenty of items from India  its largest trading partner  including food, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, automobiles, fertilizers and chemicals. Trade between the two nations stood at 5.45 billion in 2021, according to official figures. Sabry said accepting the Indian rupee would work as an advantage for Sri Lanka as the trade imbalance between the two countries is in favor of India. We need more Indian currency, so more Indian people coming here and spending Indian currency is good for us, Sabry told reporters a day after visiting India with Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe. During the visit, India and Sri Lanka signed a series of energy, development and trade agreements, signalling growing economic ties between the neighboring countries. Relations between the two countries surged last year when Sri Lanka was mired in its worst economic crisis in modern history, triggered by a severe foreign currency crunch that saw essential items run out and citizens queue for fuel for days. It also suspended its repayment of foreign debt last year. India provided critical financial and humanitarian assistance worth over 4 billion to its neighbor, including food, medicine and fuel. India was also the first creditor to extend a letter of support towards Sri Lankas debt restructuring efforts that helped kickstart support from the IMF, which approved a 3 billion bailout package in March. Sri Lankas total debt has exceeded 83 billion, of which 41.5 billion is foreign and 42.1 billion is domestic. Sri Lanka has now started the process of restructuring its debt. Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean has long attracted attention from regional rivals India and China. For years, free-flowing loans and infrastructure investments from Beijing helped it gain an upper hand against New Delhi in the quest for influence. But the countrys economic collapse gave New Delhi an opportunity to swing the pendulum back in its favor, especially as China delayed its support for debt restructuring, experts say. China owns about 10 of Sri Lankas foreign debt. Source: AP --Agencies",

The decision to withdraw the use of the drugs in question was made following an investigation conducted by the NMRA, during which samples of many categories of Aspirin were tested. The two categories in question were subsequently found to be substandard, and were thus withdrawn from use. MSD Medical Director Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake assured, however, that despite the withdrawal of the two drugs, there is no shortage of Aspirin in hospitals.

        "date": "July 23, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has emphasised on strong connectivity between India and Sri Lanka, highlighting how both ferry and aviation will increase people-to-people linkages. Speaking to World Is One News (WION) correspondent Sidhant Sibal from Colombo, FM Sabry, on the proposal of land connectivity said,  Connecting with each other could be a good opportunity. But the proposal, first of all, you need to study the feasibility of it, see the benefit for both countries and see that it will be beneficial for both countries and the both nations then we must go ahead with it. Earlier this week, President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited New Delhi, with both countries agreeing on new ferry services among other key connectivity issues. Regarding the proposal on an energy pipeline, Sabry stated, The idea is to freely flow oil, making it easier to connect. This could ensure energy security for both Sri Lanka and India at various points. Both countries have also been working on FinTech connectivity, with pact on UPI being announced during the visit of President Wickremesinghe. UPI is expected to start in Sri Lanka in a few months and will help Indian tourists. On Indias security concerns in the backdrop of a visit of a Chinese vessel last year, Sabry assured, We have finalized SOP and SOPs is in place...We have worked on that over a period of time in line with the UNCLOS-UN laws of seas. Speaking on the two-day official visit to India, Sabry, who accompanied President Wickremesinghe, stated that discussions focused on economic partnership, mutual benefit for both countries and taking the maximum out of the expected economic growth in the region. So, in that everybody understands the entire growth is centred around people-to-people contact, whether it is business, social, economic, or educational thing, people are centred around that, he said. When asked to comment on the current economic status of Sri Lanka, Sabry said we have made some good progress, but a long, long way to go. Below is the full interview: WION: Connectivity was the key focus of the visit, connectivity in various formats, if you can talk about that. Also, a proposal on land connectivity, if you can talk about that, what is the plan for it? Ali Sabry: We had a wonderful 2-day tour led by our President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the discussion centered around the economic partnership, mutual benefit for both countries and taking the maximum out of the expected economic growth in the region. So, in that everybody understands the entire growth is centred around people-to-people contact, whether it is business, social, economic, or educational thing, people are centred around that. That could only happen if you have better connectivity. So connectivity as you said that different forms and shapes but we thought in the long run it really to make sense of it like many countries and the regions which are connected with each other in various parts of the world, whether in Europe or in Northern America, or in the Middle East, going North Southeast Asia. Connecting with each other could be a good opportunity. But the proposal, first of all, you need to study the feasibility of it, see the benefit for both countries and see that it will be beneficial for both countries and the both nations then we must go ahead with it. So the idea is to propel growth through connectivity and connectivity really takes place when you are connected through land so ordinary people could drive from one end to the other end, and it becomes a larger region where economic cooperation, social cooperation educational cooperation, and people to people contact become a reality. WION: Ferry connectivity, aviation connectivity were other focus areas, if you can talk about that.. Ali Sabry: Aviation connectivity is to some extent is well connected. Sri Lankan airlines fly to different destinations within India and some of the Indian Airlines are flying to Sri Lanka so we would want more airlines to fly for both times. We are open to it. Then of course the Alliance airline which flies from Chennai to Jafna is now flying more frequencies on every day. So thats an area in which we want to see more connectivity so that it is affordable for people to travel and connect with each other. The second one of course the ferry, we identified two points, in Sri Lanka and two points in India so that it takes shape and form in the foreseeable future and very soon it and thirdly, His Excellency Prime Minister Narendra Modi very clearly stated that he would like to see more cruise tourism take place and connecting Sri Lankan and Indian ports in various regions. So these are the forms and shapes we are looking at connecting people, so we hope this will again, help to really tap the real potential of tourism and hospitality trade and other forms and shapes. WION: Coming to land connectivity, will it be passed by the cabinet? Ali Sabry: Yeah, generally any main decision-making process in Sri Lanka is we can propose any proposal thereafter, there will be a feasibility study from both countries. And once the feasibility study shows that it is feasible and then of course, it has to be taken into several layers, Attorney General have to clear and then the cabinet has to clear and ultimately they have to come before the parliament and get that get the clearance. So and why we want to do that is then it becomes not a partisan action it becomes a national issue. So, once a national decision is taken, is sustainable, it has long-term stability in that so, so these decisions are important decisions. It has to be taken by taken after consulting various levels with the decision makers and the representative of the people. WION: Key announcement on Trincomalee as India, Sri Lanka agree to develop Trincomalee city as regional hub...if you can talk about that.. Ali Sabry: Yes, Sri Lanka has seen three major ports. Colombo is one of the worlds largest port and busiest ports. And then of course we have the Hambantota port, Trincomalee is the in the eastern part of Sri Lanka. Thats a very important port, which is the second deepest natural port in the world, in the world. So its a very strategically located port, and thats easier to connect with the southern part of Indian ports. So we are looking at the whole region of Trincomalee to be developed and through that, to develop the living standard of the Eastern Sri Lankans and northern Sri Lanka in order to do that, we will--government of Sri Lanka will identify several projects-- in that some of the projects which we have earmarked are for port development, creating an energy hub and to develop the tank farms jointly and also to establish a probably industrial zone, hospitality trade. So, in all these things, we are also looking at the opportunity to work with the Indian side, a joint working group sitting and looking at the feasibility of those projects, various projects and work to get. WION: Focus also on energy connectivity, with proposal of an energy pipeline, if you can talk about that Ali Sabry: Yeah, oil pipeline, the idea is freely to flow the oil, rather than physically carrying it through mobile applications like what is happening now through the vehicles. So once that happens, its become easy to connect. So the idea is our Ministry of Power and Energy working very closely on that. We have looked at the feasibility of it. We feel this is good and this could ensure the energy security of the Sri Lankan at various points so both countries and within the country also in Sri Lanka to connect it at various points. WION: Focus also on financial connectivity, the big announcement was on the UPI, so how do you see it benefiting people of the 2 countries, and also Indian tourists travelling to Sri Lanka? Ali Sabry: yeah, I think it will be a good beginning, it will help many other Indians to feel safe, easy and devoid of unnecessary transaction costs. For example, if you are an Indian and to travel, he has to go get another third denomination currency by changing his Indian rupee and then come back to Sri Lanka and then again get Sri Lankan rupee and then before you go back, again change it to the international currency, then go back again get it into Indian currency. See this is a lot of countries have seen this, this is not good and therefore, like many other currencies, which we have identified, Indian currency will also be given an opportunity to use it as a legal tender and UPI will allow them to come into Sri Lanka and just use like you they use in India, at any shop, any place so that it really becomes very feasible for them. So thats an idea, that will definitely encourage more Indians to travel more efficiently and at less expense. So therefore, we see this good opportunity for Indians to travel more and how Sri Lanka will benefit out of that is that more Indians feel better travelling to Sri Lanka and easy destination just like many of us travel to Singapore without some time visa-free or Visa on arrival, it could propel tourism growth so we see an opportunity and mutually beneficial for both countries. WION: Are we looking at a timeline when the UPI can be started in Sri Lanka? Ali Sabry: I believe within the next three months or so, we should be able to use that because we have signed a key agreement. Financial authorities and monetary authorities have worked on that. So all in all the maximum timeline I feel is about three months time WION: Usage of Rupee has started in Sri Lanka, if you can give an update how the transaction has been going or what kind of transaction has been going? Ali Sabry: Yeah, I think those discussions have been held with the experts. I think, once there is clarity on that, we will share with the ordinary public, general public rather, its important that at this point in time, we continue to work towards it. We all see an opportunity in that and a lot of traction in that, our experts are working on that with their counterparts. All in all, we see this will happen sooner rather than later. WION: India has its set of concerns over security, and we saw a visit of a Chinese spy ship, any assurances by Sri Lanka or how both countries are working on the issue? Ali Sabry: Basically, the conversation centred around keeping the Indian Ocean as a peaceful region and the commitment towards it. Number two is to be sensitive towards each other security concerns. In other words, as far as India is concerned that Indias legitimate security concerns are to be taken into consideration in whatever the decisions what we are making. To be fair by India, India didnt ask or wanted us in any way to block any investment from any other countries or any trade with any other countries. And thats all perfectly normal because every country is doing that. But security concerns which are legitimate need to be taken into consideration. So that we have repeatedly told that the legitimate security concerns of the Indian Government and the people of India will not be compromised by Sri Lanka at any stage being a responsible neighbour and also a close friend of India for generations. WION: There was a plan for a standard operating procedure or SOP in the backdrop of the visit of the Chinese research vessel, any update on that? Ali Sabry: Yes, we have finalised SOP and SOPs are in place. We will share this with all our stakeholders and the friends of the SOPs. We have worked on that over a period of time in line with the UNCLOS-UN laws of the seas. We have developed that and then probably we will put that in place very soon. WION: Sri Lanka has also sought an innocent passage, for its vessels to the Arabian Sea, was that matter raised? Ali Sabry: Yes, in fact, the Sri Lankan side made a request that, innocent passage to be allowed which means not to engage in fishing in the Indian water, but sometimes from Sri Lanka you had to pass the Indian water to get into the mid sea and the Arabian Sea which is international waters, anybody can fish in that particular areas. So we have sought the innocent passage that will pass through the Indian territory and Indian waters to go into the international waters, so our fishermen who are engaging in multi-day troll operations. WION: Indian PM Modi called for a humane view on the fisherman issue, if you can talk about your view? Ali Sabry: Yeah, basically two things were in the conversation. That is all agreed that we should have a joint working group sitting and talking in detail in order to avoid any unpleasantries. Secondly, Sri Lanka, kind of explained that the bottom trawling which is taking place, bottom trawling is very dangerous, it just sweeps the seabed and it could be very dangerous. And in our understanding, the bottom trawling had already done a lot of damage to the seabed on the side of the Indian waters. So there are a lot of bottom trawlers coming into international waters and to the Sri Lankan water, which is bad for all, not only for Sri Lanka but for India as well in the long run, because that will kind of destroy marine life. So therefore we explain the concerns that we have and our fishermen have, and Im sure Fisheries Working Group will sit and discuss this and finalise it so. WION: If you can give an update on the current economic situation in Sri Lanka? India played a key role, but what is the current situation? Ali Sabry: Actually, compared to the last year, we have made a lot of progress. We had a plan, for getting over this economic crisis. The first step was to stabilize the economy, that is, to control inflation and eliminate the various queues and shortages, the second was the recovery; and the third was the growth. So what we are now going through is the second page of recovery. We have started to recover; it is like a vehicle that was going down where you first stop stabilization, then slowly take it back to the normal level of the ground, and then you start moving. So, we are on the second level, we are coming to the ground stage now, and now we have taken off. So in terms of that, in other words, we have controlled the inflation, which was running around 80 and came down to a single figure in July, less than 10. The Sri Lankan Rupee has stabilized; in fact, until recently it gained about 20, and its already again for this year about 10 to 12. Then there are no queues, 24 hours electricity, and tourists have started to come back, migrants working in the middle east, and in East Asia and also from some of the countries in the West have started sending their money through the normal channels. So our foreign reserves have significantly improved. The Sri Lankan situation is much better than it used to be. You can see that right now. So many of cricket matches are taking place. This month tourism has picked up very well. So we are very confident that Sri Lanka is on a path to a moderate recovery. But it is just the first step a long, long way to go. We understand the gravity of it. And President Ranil Wickremesinghe had given leadership to an unprecedented economic reform package in terms of revenue generation, in terms of fiscal discipline and in also in terms of laws, which are necessary to curb corruption. So all in all, we have made some good progress, but a long, long way to go. I could only see some resemblances and similarities of India in the early 1990s, they started a reform program. Across the government and party lines, they continued with the same policies and are reaping the benefits now. So we can only learn lessons from that and hope that we will continue to proceed with these reforms in order to achieve the true potential of the Sri Lankan economy. WION: Sir, you and the President have played a key role in Sri Lankan recovery, My last question is: what next in Indo-Sri Lanka ties? Do we expect Prime Minister Modi to travel to Sri Lanka? Ali Sabry: We would love to have the honourable Prime Minister Modi visit Sri Lanka. And we also wanted your finance minister, who played a very crucial role in getting Sri Lanka out of the woods, to visit Sri Lanka, and we will have many high-level delegations coming from both sides. We also discussed the parliamentary groupsSri Lankans and Indian parliamentarians meet--so that they will tell people to people contact and work together by dispelling all the myths and the suspicion of each other so that you can move on with the new generation of leadership. So we look forward and are confident that in the years to come, our relationship, with both Sri Lanka and India will be stronger, better, mutually beneficial, and will be an example for the region.

        "title": "First two Sinopec fuel shipments to arrive in August",
        "date": "July 23, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "The first two shipments of fuel under the agreement with Chinas Sinopec are due to arrive in Sri Lanka next month, State Minister of Petroleum D.V. Chanaka revealed. Accordingly, Chanaka stated that the two shipments are expected to arrive in the first week of August. Meanwhile, he assured that a Maximum Retail Price (MRP) will be stipulated by the Government to all fuel companies under the price formula from August. Sri Lanka signed a contract agreement with Sinopec in May this year, in response to the ongoing foreign exchange crisis. Under the new deal the Chinese firm will be given a 20-year licence to operate 150 fuel stations and will also be able to invest in 50 new fuel stations. Meanwhile, steps will be taken to replace the fuel price formula with a maximum retail price, thereby creating a fuel competitiveness that benefits the country, State Minister D. V. Chanaka said. The State Minister also said that it is expected to take a decision regarding the QR code after discussing it with all the parties in the future. He expressed these views today (23) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). State Minister of Power and Energy D. V. Chanaka further commented; The Ministry of Power and Energy was one of the hardest-impacted ministries during the countrys economic crisis. There was an era of oil queues. After President Ranil Wickremesinghe took office, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera took up the challenge of solving the fuel crisis. There were no dollars in the country at that time. Only two of the 28 fuel suppliers registered with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation offered to provide fuel to the country. Such was the situation then. The countrys dollar reserves began to stabilize thanks to President Ranil Wickremesinghes sound economic policy. On the other hand, in accordance with Minister Kanchanas management strategy, it was possible to supply fuel to customers in accordance with the quantity of dollars available in the country by using the QR code. The fuel queues started to shorten two or three days after the QR code was implemented. The percentage of fuel delivered by QR code is currently being gradually increased. As the State Minister, Minister Kanchana assigned me four key duties, including ensuring a consistent flow of fuel and boosting competitiveness. It was decided to establish a fuel procurement program for a year rather than just a few months in order to ensure a steady supply of fuel. Previously, while soliciting bids for fuel, the fuel was purchased based on the amount of room that was available in our warehouses. An effort was made to research the Singaporean system instead. Later, tenders were called in lieu of the conventional procedure on days when the price was the lowest in the world. Previously, there were no arrangements to maintain buffer reserves. So far, steps have been taken to maintain a reserve of 30,000 litres of fuel including petrol and diesel. We are in charge of additional 60 million dollars in addition to the money needed for daily expenses. After studying the existing methods in the world, a new method was introduced in this country. Accordingly, we no longer pay any advance. Fuel tankers coming to Sri Lanka should be fully stocked in our warehouses. After that, the necessary purchases for the week are made with the dollars available in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. There are several advantages here. Risk fees were completely eliminated. This new system has the potential to save 300 million dollars per year. We previously only paid late fees. But as of right now for the first time, we have earned 13 million dollars in late fees from fuel companies only in the first half of this year. The first installment of 3 million dollars is being collected before the 18th. The remaining amount of 10 million dollars will be fully recovered from the suppliers. In order to increase fuel competitiveness, agreements have been reached with three major internationally registered companies. This will increase competition and offer a sound remedy for the current dollar issue. By the first week of next month, a ship of Sinopec Company is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka signed a contract agreement with Sinopec in May this year, in response to the ongoing foreign exchange crisis. Until now, the fuel price formula existed only for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Instead, steps will be taken to set a maximum retail price using the price formula to affect all companies through this new system. Thus, the Ministry will decide only the maximum retail price in the future. The companies will then be able to provide fuel at a price of their choice subject to the maximum price. This will create competition among fuel companies resulting in reduced fuel prices.",

        "date": "July 23, 2023 04:48 pm",
        "content": "Chief of Presidential Staff and Senior Adviser on National Security to the President Sagala Ratnayake has assured that the current governments priority to set the country right, and not play politics. Attending an event organized by the Young Professionals Organization (YPO) in Colombo recently, Ratnayake said We are focused. We are not going to play any politics. We want to set the country right. We want to deliver. People in this country deserve it. Many individuals like to see the country collapse as they will not have any political opportunities if it succeeds, he continued, adding that the while the youth employed abroad could contribute to Sri Lankas economy, it cannot be the governments policy. The youth need a future. We cant have all of them going overseas. he said in this regard. Thus, in a bid to secure a future for the youth within the country, he stressed the need for a robust manufacturing industry, bolstered by education, a thriving tourism sector, and support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Speaking with regards to welfare benefit schemes, Ratnayake ensured that the government will give the said benefits to those most deserving, given that they are paid with tax money. The government only needs to implement the growth agenda and reforms properly while making sure to ward off evil for the country to have a better future, he added. Meanwhile, addressing misinformation surrounding the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) programme, the Chief of Presidential Staff stated that despite claims made by certain parties that the banking system would collapse following the implementation of the DDO strategy, that the government was planning to seize all of the deposits, and the EPF capital would be taken over, nothing of the sort happened. No bank collapsed, in fact the banks have become stronger and the EPF is still available in totality, he said. He further said that the interest rate would not fall below the level that the EPF fund had been receiving up to now, and that the government would step in to ensure that the specified percentage was delivered if it did and this was the purpose of the DDO. So dont let the evil people, the politically minded people, derail this program. You should all stand together. You help those who find it difficult to understand and may have the tendency to go believe the stories that are being told instead of understanding the real story, so that the country can go this path and have a future for its younger generation. We want you to take this message around because you can deliver it to other professionals who in turn can take it to the people in general, he said.",

        "content": "Director Greta Gerwigs Barbie movie grossed 70.5 million in opening day box office sales on Friday, the biggest opening day for any film this year, according to Variety, fueling hopes it (along with Oppenheimer, which opened with 33 million) could help turnaround a declining audience turnout. Barbie surpassed opening day box office sales for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which opened to 51.8 million in June, according to Variety, and is projected to gross between 95 million and 110 million this weekend, putting the film on pace to land between box office numbers from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (106.11 million) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (118.41 million) for the fourth-largest opening weekend this year. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer, which opened to 33 million on its opening day, the third-largest this year, following 10.5 million in Thursday previews, has projections of 50 million at the domestic box office for its opening weekend. Barbie could break the record for the biggest opening weekend for any film directed by a woman. Captain Marvelco-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleckholds the record for any film with a female director after it opened to 153 million in 2019. Wonder Womandirected by Patty Jenkinsholds the record for any movie solely directed by a woman, opening to 103 million in 2017. Barbie opened to early reviews suggesting the film was a pink fever dream featuring a flat emotional landing. Analysts expected the same-day release for Barbie and Oppenheimer to alleviate low box office sales this year. Some big-budget films have underperformed at the box office so far, including Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which opened to 60 million its first weekend. The domestic box office recorded 4.46 billion in ticket sales through June 20, a 20 increase over the previous year, though ticket sales are down 21 from 2019. Paul Dergarabedian, a film analyst, told Variety the combined same-day release of Barbie and Oppenheimer is a movie marketers dream come true. Other films are also expected to boost box office sales later this year, including The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and Dune: Part Two, in addition to Disneys The Marvels.

Early in September last year, the Government of Norway announced that they have decided to permanently close the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo by the end of July 2023, owing to some structural changes in its network of diplomatic missions abroad. Accordingly, the Government of Norway announced that the following missions will be closed in 2023: the embassies in Bratislava (Slovakia), Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Pristina (Kosovo), the embassy office in Antananarivo (Madagascar) and the Consulate General in Houston (USA). Norways diplomatic relations with Kosovo, Madagascar, Slovakia and Sri Lanka will be dealt with through alternative arrangements, for example responsibility for this will be given to a Norwegian embassy close by, or an ambassador based in Norway will be appointed for the country concerned, as per the earlier announcements.",

        "date": "July 24, 2023 02:38 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments debt restructuring plan is likely to reduce investment and liquidity risks for domestic insurers, Fitch Ratings says. Fitch expects pressure on insurers investment and capital profiles to ease as the proposed plan will not have direct impact on the local-currency government debt holdings of insurers, banks and non-banking financial institutions. Nonetheless, the proposal is only one aspect of the sovereigns (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating: C) debt sustainability plan. Ratings on Sri Lankan insurers remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) amid high investment and liquidity risks, pressure on regulatory capital positions and a weak financial performance outlook, which could undermine insurers credit profiles relative to other entities on the national ratings scale. Insurers holdings of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), which are foreign-currency denominated but governed by local law, will be affected by the debt restructuring proposal, as we expected. However, restructuring of the sovereigns foreign debt, including international sovereign bonds (ISB), has yet to be finalised. Among Fitch-rated insurers, only a few have exposure to SLDBs or ISBs, which accounted for less than 5 and 0.2, respectively, of the total invested assets of Fitch-rated insurers at end-March 2023. The government has presented three treatment options for SLDBs, with the impact of any present-value losses on capital dependent on the treatment each insurer chooses. However, we believe that the satisfactory capital buffers maintained by Fitch-rated insurers would help to cushion any negative impact from the losses. The investment and liquidity risk profiles of Sri Lankan insurers are closely linked with the sovereign, banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) as their investment portfolios are dominated by fixed-income securities issued or guaranteed by the government (47 of invested assets at end-March 2023), corporate debt (21) and deposits with local banks and NBFIs (10). The governments domestic debt restructuring proposal excludes banks holdings of Sri Lankan rupee-denominated treasury securities, which will ease pressure on banks already stressed credit profiles. Fitch continues to maintain all ratings on domestic banks and NBFIs on RWN due to the heightened near-term downside risks to their credit profiles from capital, funding and operating environment risks. We expect the sparse foreign-currency liquidity in the local banking system to continue to limit insurers ability to meet foreign-currency obligations, such as reinsurance payments and claim obligations arising from the small portion of foreign currency-denominated policies. Fitch-rated insurers foreign-currency insurance contract obligations are mostly reinsured. Fitch-rated insurers also have foreign-currency deposits with local banks to support their foreign-currency obligations, it added.",

        "title": "President announces govts new tourism strategy: Visit Sri Lanka",
        "date": "July 24, 2023 03:14 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that the government will be unveiling a new tourist plan called Visit Sri Lanka that will be released in the upcoming months. He claimed the proposal is in the final stages of development and would be made public as soon as it is complete. President Wickremesinghe made this statement while attending the Award Ceremony and a Gala dinner of the Bocuse dOr 2023 competition held at the Waters Edge Grand Ballroom yesterday (23) evening, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The government aims to bring in 5 million tourists, of whom 2.5 million will be high-end visitors, President Wickremesinghe said while emphasizing the industry as a significant economic driver. According to Indian estimates, Sri Lanka can host up to 10 million tourists, of whom most will be tourists from Asian and the Indian Ocean region, he continued. Transformation of the tourism industry is required to make Sri Lanka competitive in the global travel market place and the government has recognized the potential in promoting the country as a tropical nation with a diverse culinary style. Hence attention will be given to develop the culinary tourism in the country, the President said. The government is prepared to launch a Culinary School in collaboration with the private sector, the travel industry, and the hotel industry, the President added, noting that there is a need to train more personnel in the hospitality field, particularly in culinary tourism. Attention will also be paid to aid private Culinary Schools in accomplishing this task, he added. The President expressed admiration for the late Mr. Merrill J. Fernando, a prominent business figure and founder of Sri Lankas renowned Dilmah Tea brand. He praised Mr. Fernandos valuable contributions to the countrys tourism industry, it added. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented; Theres a void in our room. We all feel it. These functions would not have been possible without Merrill, and we meet here today for the first time without him. We all feel the loss, we all feel the sadness. For me, its also been a personal loss. All the articles on Merrill referred to the tea industry, Dilma, and what he had done. He made a similar contribution to the tourism industry; our hotels would not have been the same without him. I remember in the beginning, it was when I was Prime Minister in 2002, Merrill was one of those within a small circle. I used to consult on economic matters. That was the time Adrian Zecha had come. He was talking about tourism, how we could expand tourism. And there was a Geoffrey Dobbs who came along talking about Boutique Hotels. This concept of Boutique Hotels came on how we could turn the planters bungalows into Boutique Hotels. Merrill used to follow it though he was not in the industry. And then I lost the election, I didnt think we could see Boutique Hotels again, and one day Merrill came out and said, Look, I am starting Tea Trails, and he invited me to one of the first Boutique Hotels, and he established such a standard that we can all be proud of him. Later on, he went to Cape Weligama and set another standard. So you have to remember, not merely the contribution he made to tea, but also the contribution hes made to tourism. He started the hospitality school in Kalkudah. I think I have been lucky enough as a politician. For 40 odd years, I have been going around the country and eating different types of food. Yesterday I was in Anuradhapura, and we had a delicious tank fish curry. Some time back, I was in Trincomalee, and they gave me Biriyani with Venison. It was quite delicious. There was a time when you talked of Seaweed. I could tell a story that goes back about another 40 years when the hygiene standards outside the hotels were not that high. Today it is good everywhere, even in our small restaurants. It was not so in the 80s. We once went to the Kalpitiya restaurants, which had the best crab curry on the West coast. So I went along with a few others, and we had this delicious crab curry. I think that was true. It was the best you could get on the West coast. Afterwards, we had a Seaweed jelly. This Seaweed jelly was made by the Muslim ladies from a recipe left behind by the Portuguese. So if you go there to Kalpitiya, you can learn how to make Seaweed jelly. Before I left, I asked them why they dont have a white tablecloth, why they had one that was a yellow mustardy colour. And then they told me that the tablecloth hadnt visited the laundry for some time. So despite these risks, its really worth going around Sri Lanka. Its how you can make fusion food. So, I think thats one of the reasons why we are now on a new journey. Because once we hit rock bottom and we are bankrupt, and as we are coming out of it, we still need sufficient foreign exchange. All of that wont come easily. Some of the debt carries with it repayment terms and investments, while one source that doesnt incur debt is tourism; through tourism, you can earn this money. So the question is, how much can we earn from tourism which dropped last year? What will it be this December and next year? We want to go ahead. 2.5 million tourists are not enough. We are now aiming for 5 million, of which 2.5 million should be high-end tourists. Indian estimates are that Sri Lanka can take up to 10 million tourists, most of them from Asia and the Indian Ocean region. So there will be a change. But we have to ensure that we go upmarket. If you want, today you find a fast turnover staff. Most of the young people here who took part in the competition will most probably be serving outside of Sri Lanka in about another three years time. If you want to keep them, we have to at least match the salaries of the Maldives hotels. If you have to match the salaries of the Maldives hotels, then you must charge the same as Maldives hotels. To charge so, you must give that service, and that is essential. Now, if youre looking at 5 million tourists or 10 million tourists, there have to be different types of tourism. And one that we can do well is culinary tourism. And thats what we should focus on. Not merely in our hotels, but any place. And if youre having culinary tourism, remember, bulk is going to come from Asia. So there has to be fusion food from different parts of Asia, not only Europe. Thats what we should focus on. Therefore, I think we must now train more and more personnel in the hospitality field, especially in the field of tourism and culinary tourism. So lets get ready for it. I have been talking with some of my planners and others, and we feel, firstly, we have to upgrade our hotel school, and it must become a genuine hotel school. But more than that, together with the private sector, the travel industry, the hotel industry, the government is prepared to start a culinary school just for that, for large numbers. But you cant stand on the side and say, let the government do it. Then you know what you will get. So, therefore, if you all get together, we will plan that. And some of the private culinary schools are there. I said well see how we can help them too. It doesnt matter whether its a government school or a private school, as long as they do it. We are prepared to go ahead and back them. I will talk with the industry. Well be announcing a new tourism plan called Visit Sri Lanka, which will most probably be released in August or September. We are giving the final touches, but you are ready to go along. So at this stage, first, I have to thank all those, especially all of you who have organized this competition this time, and youve been doing it for a long time. I hope Bocuse dOr will not only be organizing the competitions here, but they will also help us to set up a good culinary school. You all are always welcome to raise our standards. There is a good future. Lets train more and more people, and lets all get used to it. Not merely in hotels, but the time will come when most of you will be running restaurants or supplying food. And thats what the trade has to be. Services have taken over. This is now an important part of our economy. And like an army, the travel industry also marches on. It travels on its stomach. So lets look after the stomach. Others will look after the tablecloth. Bocuse dOr 2023 competition is an esteemed culinary event of global repute, which serves as a beacon for showcasing the exceptional talents and skills of renowned chefs from around Sri Lanka. Previous Bocuse dOr winners have been victorious in representing Sri Lanka on the international stage in Lyon, France. The judging panel of Bocuse dOr 2023 comprised esteemed culinary experts, including the globally renowned Chef Otto Weibel and Chef Frank Widmann, evaluating the dishes based on their exquisite taste, impeccable presentation, and outstanding originality. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the President Sagala Ratnayaka presented trophies and certificates to the Bocuse dOr 2023 Competition winners. First Lady Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe, Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the President Sagala Ratnayaka, The French Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jean-Fran√ßois Pactet, President of Bocuse dOr Sri Lanka Rohan Fernandopulle, CEO of Dilmah Tea Dilhan C.

        "content": "Elon Musk and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino unveiled a logo for the social media platform on Monday that featured a white X on a black background as a replacement for the familiar blue bird symbol. X is here! Lets do this, tweeted Yaccarino, who also posted a picture of the logo projected on the companys offices in San Francisco. Both Yaccarinos and Musks Twitter handles feature the X logo, although the Twitter blue bird is still visible across the platform. GoodbyeTwitter was trending on the platform with reference to the old logo as several users criticised the new one. Musk said on a post on Sunday he wanted to change Twitters logo and polled his millions of followers on whether they would favour changing the sites colour scheme from blue to black. He posted a picture of a stylised X against a black outer space-themed background. He also referred to the interim X logo, and tweeted that soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds. In response to a tweet asking what will tweets be called under X, Musk replied xs. The original Twitter logo was designed in 2012 by a team of three. The logo was designed to be simple, balanced, and legible at very small sizes, almost like a lowercase e, tweeted Martin Grasser, one of the designers. Weeks before completing his Twitter acquisition last year Musk had said that buying the company would speed up his ambition to create an everything app called X by three to five years. Musk bought x.com back from PayPal in 2017, saying it had sentimental value. Musk had co-founded x.com as an online bank in 1999 which later transformed into PayPal. While Twitters official page on the platform has been renamed as X, the domain x.com is not active. X is the future state of unlimited interactivity  centred in audio, video, messaging, paymentsbanking  creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities, Yaccarino tweeted on Sunday. Yaccarino, the former advertising chief at NBCUniversal who started as Twitter CEO on June 5, has taken over when the social media platform is trying to reverse a plunge in advertising revenue. Since the takeover of Twitter, the company has faced tumultuous times with layoffs, a sharp drop in advertisers and the meteoric rise of Threads, Metas response to Twitter.

The trade union action was launched against the Railway Departments efforts to commence several new train services. However, the Department of Railways had stated earlier that a total of 35 trains were cancelled by this afternoon, owing to the relevant strike action. Meanwhile, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena had said that a strict decision will be reached in the Cabinet against the execution of railway strikes causing inconvenience to the public. He stated that the Railway trade unions have been informed to at first discuss their issues with the General Manager, if any, and solve them without inconveniencing the passengers. If no solution is received, refer them to the Ministry Secretary and see if the issue is resolved. If not, talk to me. As the minister in charge, I always intervene and submit cabinet papers to solve their issues. The engine drivers may have some political interests, he added. Speaking further regarding the matter, the minister expressed that the passengers demand was to privatize the railway service. It can never be done.

Invitations have been extended to leaders of all political parties and independent groups with representation in Parliament, according to the PMD. The development closely follows the Presidents two-day official visit to India last week, where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Tamils issue figured prominently in the wide-ranging talks between the two leaders. The Indian prime minister highlighted the need for the implementation of the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Sri Lankan Constitution. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A, brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. It created nine provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces. Prior to his India visit, at a meeting with the Tamil parties, Wickremesinghe assured that the 13th Amendment would be fully implemented, without police powers, in the provincial councils. Prime Minister Modi, during his talks with Wickremesinghe, expressed hope that the Sri Lankan leader would be committed to implementing the 13A and holding the provincial council elections. He urged Wickremesinghe to ensure a life of respect and dignity for the Tamils. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "July 24, 2023 08:52 pm",
        "content": "The Local Loans and Development Fund under the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government was summoned to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) which met recently under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Prof. Ranjith Bandara. This institution has been established by Ordinance No. 22 of 1916 with the aim of providing financial facilities at a concessional interest rate to the local government bodies for running public utility services as authorized by law. It has been amended on several occasions and has been named as the Local Loans and Development Fund under Act No. 24 of 1993. The investigation was done through the following basic facts related to the Auditor Generals reports for the financial years 2020, 2021 and current performance. Since this is a financial institution similar to a bank, the need to amend the Act was emphasized by taking into consideration the timely matters, the statement said. According to the Act, it is not appropriate for the Secretary of the Ministry to act as the Chairman of the Fund, so the Auditor General pointed out the importance of making amendments by focusing on all those matters. It was discussed that, in 2018 Asian Foundation had given a report regarding the restructuring of the institution and if it had been acted upon, great progress could have been achieved. Since the Prime Minister as the Minister in charge of the subject has also held a discussion to amend the Act, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government was informed to take steps promptly.  Need to make the posts of Director General and Internal Auditor full time permanent posts The committees attention was drawn to the fact that the position of Director General has been an acting position for many years. It was also discussed about the absence of a permanent Internal Auditor. Accordingly, the COPE ordered to inform within two weeks about the next steps to be taken to appoint a permanent Director General as well as a full-time permanent Internal Auditor.  Absence of a formal system for disbursement of loans, project evaluation, and loan recovery It was revealed that the fund has received 9 projects worth 249 million rupees in the year 2023, but the board of directors has not considered them yet. Thus, it was recommended that a formal system and set of guidelines be set up, focusing on issues such as granting and recovery criteria, loan recovery capabilities, projects using loans and productivity. The committee emphasized the need for the loan committee to operate according to that formal system.  Need to streamline the system of loan distribution to each province The COPE chairman revealed that 691 million rupees of the total loan amount of 847.7 million rupees has been given to the North-Western Province in 2021. The committee recommended that the loan distribution system to each province be streamlined.  Streamline the Internal Audit The committee discussed about the lack of a permanent Internal Auditor to conduct the internal audit properly.

        "date": "July 24, 2023 09:44 pm",
        "content": "BBC newsreader George Alagiah has died at the age of 67, British media reported on Monday. The Sri Lanka-born journalist - the face of BBC Ones News At Six since 2007 - was diagnosed in 2014 with stage four bowel cancer, which had spread to his liver and lymph nodes. He endured two rounds of chemotherapy and several operations, including the removal of most of his liver. In October 2015 he announced his treatment was over and returned to BBC News At Six on 10 November. Alagiah joined the BBC in 1989 and spent many years as one of the corporations leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting. In a statement, his agent Mary Greenham said: I am so terribly sorry to inform you that George Alagiah died peacefully today, surrounded by his family and loved ones. George fought until the bitter end but sadly that battle ended earlier today. George was deeply loved by everybody who knew him, whether it was a friend, a colleague or a member of the public. He simply was a wonderful human being. My thoughts are with Fran, the boys and his wider family. BBC director-general Tim Davie said: George was one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation who reported fearlessly from across the world as well as presenting the news flawlessly. He was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: Deeply saddened by the news of George Alagiahs passing. A much-loved face of BBC News for decades, George will also be remembered for his brilliant, fearless journalism as foreign correspondent. He rightly won awards for his evocative, boundary-pushing reporting. British journalism has lost a talent. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Alagiah first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host, Natasha Kaplinsky. He was previously a prominent foreign correspondent, often as a specialist in Africa with coverage of civil wars in Somalia and Liberia, as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.

The journalist spent part his of childhood in Ghana in west Africa where he moved with his engineer father Donald and mother Therese. The family moved to England when Alagiah turned 11.

        "title": "Plans to establish Agriculture and Plantation Research University in Sri Lanka  Minister",
        "date": "July 24, 2023 11:47 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Plantation Industries and Minister of Industries, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana stated that action will be taken to establish an Agriculture and Plantation Research University by merging all institutions connected to the plantation industry and agriculture sector, as per President Ranil Wickremesinghes concept. The fundamental draft related to this has already been prepared, the Minister noted, and it is intended to complete the basic work this year. He expressed these views today (24) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Minister Ramesh Pathirana further commented; A year ago, plantations and agricultural centers faced a severe crisis due to the shortage of fertilizers. Due to this, the tea industry and other plantations also suffered some collapse. Soon after taking office, President Ranil Wickremesinghe launched a program to provide fertilizers to the farmers. Therefore, the farmers are getting the fertilizers they need in a systematic way. All the fertilizers required for tea, coconut, rubber and other crops are available in the market at competitive prices. Fertilizer prices, which have increased in the world market due to the war situation, are currently decreasing. As a country, the agricultural and plantation sectors are now showing some effectiveness due to timely availability of fertilizer to the farmers. 251 million kilos of finished tea was produced in 2022. As a result, it is expected that 280 million kilograms of finished tea would be ready by the end of this year. Last year, the price of tea increased drastically due to the decrease in production. Currently, the rupee is strengthening, which has resulted in a fall in tea prices. Tea exports have been adversely impacted by global conditions, the Russian-Ukrainian war situation, and civil wars in countries like Iran, Libya, and Syria, which are our top buyers. An agreement was recently signed to supply tea for nearly 500 million dollars worth of crude oil purchases from Iran. Accordingly, arrangements are made to provide tea according to the value of the relevant amount. Arrangements have also been made to re-export Sri Lankan tea to the Iranian market under the concept of Tea for fuel. Due to this, we will be able to re-export more tea to the Iranian market, which was lost to some extent in the past. Also, it has been possible to get an income of nearly one billion dollars last year through the export of rubber. Its biggest value was 1.1 billion dollars in 2021. During Covid, rubber-related products received high demand in the world market. Sri Lanka is considered to be the hub among the main tyre producing countries. It is believed that the export of rubber-related products will be able to reach between 900 million dollars and 1 billion dollars this year as well. With the world economic deviation, the export of every product has experienced a decrease. Economists predict that normalcy will return after the third quarter. Due to this, it will be possible to reach the export targets of plantation crops again in the future. In recent times, apart from tea and rubber, coconut-related products have seen the highest growth. Compared to 2020, the market has expanded by approximately 15-20 in 2021 and 2022. Accordingly, in 2022, it was able to earn an export income of 836 million dollars. It can reach a value close to that this year as well. Within the next five years, there is a high probability of increasing the export income of coconut-related products to 1.5-2.00 billion dollars. In order to improve the countrys coconut industry, a law will be brought in the near future that states that a special permission must be obtained to divide coconut lands of more than one acre. For that, we hope to follow up again on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Additionally, the law requiring the authorization of the Divisional Secretariat and the Grama Niladhari shall be enforced if more than two coconut trees are to be cut down. In addition, it is believed that nearly 400 million dollars will be earned this year by exporting cinnamon and other spices. President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented a new proposal to establish an Agriculture and Plantation Research University in Sri Lanka by integrating all research institutes related to the plantation industry and agriculture. There are seven institutions related to the plantation industry in this country. Agricultural institutions are also to be integrated into this. The basic draft related to this has been prepared by now. This is a very complex project. But the basic work is expected to be completed this year. However, through the available resources of the country, children are able to get better educational opportunities. Also, efforts are being made to focus on upgrading to university standards. It is anticipated that the plantation industrys backwardness will be reduced, allowing it to go forward more vigorously in the future. The government is prepared to offer the assistance required to expand the plantation industrys value chains. It will step in as a Ministry in situations involving technological know-how and financial resources. --PMD",

        "title": "Thousands of tourists evacuated as wildfires rage in Greece",
        "date": "July 25, 2023 12:02 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Tour operators flew more than 2,000 holidaymakers home on Monday as wildfires raged on the island of Rhodes in what the Greek government said was the largest evacuation ever undertaken in the country. More repatriation flights were due on Monday and Tuesday as the fires remained out of control and the Civil Protection authority warned the threat of further fires was high in almost every part of Greece, gripped by a heatwave. Fires burning since Wednesday on Rhodes forced 19,000 people to leave homes and hotels over the weekend as an inferno reached coastal resorts on the islands southeast. A wildfire also led to evacuations on the island of Corfu. Rhodes and Corfu are among Greeces top destinations for tourists mainly from Britain and Germany. For the next few weeks we must be on constant alert. We are at war, we will rebuild what we lost, we will compensate those who were hurt, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament. The climate crisis is already here, it will manifest itself everywhere in the Mediterranean with greater disasters. After leaving hotels and resorts, many tourists spent the night on Rhodes airport floor, waiting for repatriation flights, the first of which left overnight. From Sunday until 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Monday, 2,115 tourists were flown home, mainly to Britain, Germany and Italy, on 17 flights, the Greek transport ministry said. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis described the evacuation as the largest undertaken in the country. British Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell estimated that up to 10,000 Britons were on the island. At Cologne-Bonn Airport, returning German tourists talked of holidays in the sun turned into torment, one relating how her family had to walk 11 km (7 miles) to safety. We wanted to drink and people were standing at their houses and sprayed us from their hoses and we drank out of the hoses. Everyone was just walking and we didnt know where to, Violetta Kaczmarzyk told Reuters. Others expressed their relief to have escaped. For local residents though, there was no let-up. In the southern resort of Kiotari, smoke wafted across its empty beach and a singed Greek flag waved over a burned-out truck. Many local residents sheltered at a restaurant near the coast, fearing for their homes. Others poured sea water into a large tank stacked on a truck to battle the flames. The wind is very high today. It will be worse Wednesday. Its very, very bad, the situation. We need help. Send us help from everywhere, said local resident Lanai Karpataki. REPATRIATION FLIGHTS TUI took three plane loads of passengers back to Britain overnight, Britains easyJet laid on two additional flights on Monday and Jet 2 had three extra flights for 600 people. Air France was also flying from Rhodes with increased capacity. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael OLeary said his airline had not seen passengers seeking to cancel flights to Rhodes over the weekend, given fires were more in the south of the island and the airport and most resorts in the north. On Corfu, nearly 2,500 people were offered shelter, including in stadiums, although many returned to their hotels on Monday. Greece is often hit by wildfires during the summer months but climate change has led to more extreme heatwaves across southern Europe, raising concerns that tourists will stay away. Tourism accounts for 18 of Greeces GDP and one in five jobs. On Rhodes and many other Greek islands, reliance on tourism is even greater. Civil Protection said practically every region of Greece was facing the threat of wildfires on Monday ranging from high, very high to state of alert. Temperatures over the past week have exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country and were forecast to persist in the coming days. Emergency services were also dealing with fires on the island of Evia, east of Athens, and Aigio, southwest of Athens. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 25, 2023 09:34 am",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers advised the Secretary to the President to appoint an expert committee for the purpose of obtaining necessary recommendations for a complete restructure and improvement of Sri Lanka Railways service, says Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena. He added that it has been recognized that the Department of Sri Lanka Railways required to be restructured in order to maintain the service rendering at a precise level by minimizing issues erupted by now in regard to administration, financial and monitoring activities of the Sri Lanka Railway Department, which serves both passenger transportation and goods transportation and categorized as an A grade government department. Accordingly, since the concurrence of all the relevant parties to the Department has been received for the purpose, the Cabinet has approved the proposal furnished by the Minister of Transport and Highways to appoint a committee comprised of relevant subject experts to submit appropriate proposals in regard to restructuring the Department under a more appropriate structure, the cabinet spokesman said. Nevertheless, earlier on several occasions, the railway trade unions stressed that although the authorities are working towards restructuring the Railway Department, they would not allow them to do so. Meanwhile, over 35 train journeys were cancelled yesterday (24), owing to a trade union action launched by a group of engine drivers on Sunday (23) against the Railway Departments efforts to commence several new train services. Furthermore, 04 office trains were also cancelled this morning (25) since the driving assistants had not reported to duties, according to the Department of Railways. Speaking to the media in this regard, Minister Gunawardene emphasized yesterday that a strict decision will be reached in the Cabinet against the execution of railway strikes causing inconvenience to the public. However, the minister, who claimed that the passengers demand was to privatize the railway service, mentioned that it is not possible, and also requested time to make the department an authority in order to solve the issues pertaining to the railways, without privatizing it.",

        "date": "July 25, 2023 01:11 pm",
        "content": "TikTok has announced the start of rolling out support for text posting. Although TikTok was originally a short video platform, image support was later added to videos to compete with Instagram. TikTok will now have text posts. The new option allows creators to share their stories, poems, song lyrics and other written content on the platform, giving them another way to express themselves. Now when the user opens the camera page in the application, they are presented with three options: photo, video and text. In text entry mode, the user can set the context by adding sounds, specifying a location, enabling comments, and allowing duets. TikTok claims that text messages will be just as interactive and dynamic as any video or photo. There are stickers and hashtags, you can choose from different background colors. The user can create and save draft messages for later editing or delete them entirely. Many had doubts when TikTok decided to support image posting last year, but now the feature has become a staple of the app. The same is likely to happen with text messages as well, especially since some users are already posting text content in the form of videos or images on TikTok. TikToks new feature makes it easier and more intuitive to add text content to the platform. TikToks decision to add support for text posts is timely. While Twitter is actively involved in radical changes and rebrands, its time to poach a segment of its audience, namely millions of users. The skyrocketing popularity of the recently launched Threads application also supports this decision. Of course, the format of text messages on TikTok is different than on Twitter, but thats exactly why it might be interesting for a younger segment of the audience. TikTok dominates the short video market and now wants to expand beyond this content format to give users more ways to express themselves and compete with other popular social platforms.

        "content": "China removed Foreign Minister Qin Gang from his post on Tuesday after a one-month absence from public duties, replacing him with his predecessor Wang Yi, state media said, after weeks of speculation about what had happened to him. Qin, 57, who only took up the job in December after a brief stint as envoy to the United States, had not been seen in public since June 25 when he met visiting diplomats in Beijing. After he missed an international diplomatic summit in Indonesia, his ministry later said he was off work for unspecified health reasons, but the lack of detailed information fuelled a swirl of speculation. It also deepened suspicion about transparency and decision-making among the countrys cloistered leadership, analysts and diplomats said. Wang, 69, who filled in for Qin during his absence, retakes the role he held between 2018 and 2022. Chinas foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment about reasons behind the switch. It comes amid a flurry of international engagements and frayed ties with rival superpower the United States, which Beijing has described as at their lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic relations. The worlds two biggest economies are at odds over issues including Ukraine and Beijings close ties to Moscow, trade and technology disputes, and Taiwan, the democratic, self-ruled island which Beijing claims as its own.

        "content": "Sri Lankan-born Kalya Kandegoda Gamage, who is a South Otago student has become the youngest-ever winner of a Mountbatten medal yesterday (24), after the heroic rescue of his younger brother from heavy surf in New Zealand. He was presented with the Commonwealth Mountbatten Medal for bravery in a surf rescue, during a special assembly at Tokomairiro High School, in Milton. On August 27 last year, the then 13-year-old Kalya was paddling on the waters edge at Chrystalls Beach with his 11-year-old brother Kithmi, when a large wave swept his younger brother off of his feet, and two more large waves pulled him into the water, foreign media reported. Although Kithmi was a confident swimmer and tried to get back to shore, he failed and continued to tread water and was pulled further from shore. It was then, when his older brother turned to their mother and said: Ok Mum, Im going out. I might not be back. According to Kalya, it took several jumps to get into the bitterly cold surf, and while he was not scared on the way to his brother, who was 60m from shore, he was scared when he reached him, and the pair had to return. He was concerned that he and his brother might not make it back to shore, but was relieved when they did so, cold and tired. Kalya said he was happy the siblings did not die that day. Both were now more careful around the sea after their experience. The citation from the Royal Life Saving Society noted a comment from a local police officer that no-one survives in that stretch of water, it is notoriously dangerous. Undoubtedly, Kalyas brave response saved his brothers life that day. While Kalya wanted to start a business, or become an engineer, he also wanted to improve on the swimming skills and lifesaving training he undertook in his home country of Sri Lanka. Those life-saving skills meant Kalya qualified  and won  the 2022 Mountbatten Medal, which was awarded to just one member of the Commonwealth, each year. Kalya, who is currently 14-years-old, is the youngest-ever recipient of a prestigious international bravery award. Principal of the Tokomairiro High School Declan Sheridan, expressed at the assembly that the Commonwealth comprised of 56 countries and 2.4 billion people, so for him to be singled out in this way is an amazing achievement for a humble young man. Taieri MP Ingrid Leary, member of Labours Ethnic Caucus and who was at the ceremony, said Kalya was a true hero. --With Agencies Inputs",

The currency has tumbled more than 6 this month as it fell a 14th day on Monday, on track for its longest daily losing streak in almost five years. Thats a stark reversal from its stellar performance in the first six months of this year, when the rupee was Asias top performer with a 19 advance. The currency may further weaken by 8 by year-end, according to Natixis SA. Demand for dollars is rising as the crisis-hit nation eases import controls on more goods such as tiles and medical supplies. Sri Lanka cut its benchmark rate for the second consecutive meeting early this month amid faster disinflation, a move thats also weighed on the currency. The trade balance will go more negative and more rate cuts may come as inflation is cooling rapidly, said Haoxin Mu, an economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. Mu forecasts a further 8 depreciation in the rupee to about 355 per dollar by the end of the year. The rupee volatility is due to banks covering positions, central bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said last week. Businesses should use hedging instruments, avoid basing decisions on the exchange rate and instead use inflation expectations, he said. Source  Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "date": "July 25, 2023 09:34 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund has slightly upgraded its outlook for global growth this year on the back of resilient service sector activity in the first quarter and a strong labor market, the lender said Tuesday. But despite the mildly better economic outlook, global growth is expected to slow to three percent this year and then stay there, held down by weak growth among the worlds advanced economies, the IMF announced in a new report. Were not out of the woods yet and growth remains on the low side, IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told AFP in an interview ahead of the reports publication. The global growth forecast for this year was raised by 0.2 percentage points from the IMFs last forecast in April, putting the world economy on track for three percent growth in both 2023 and 2024. This is down from global economic growth of 6.3 percent in 2021, and 3.5 percent last year, the IMF announced in its update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The IMF published its lowest medium-term forecast since the 1990s, citing slowing population growth and the end of the era of economic catch-up by several countries including China and South Korea. On Tuesday, the IMF said the global inflation picture has improved somewhat, with consumer prices now forecast to increase by 6.8 percent this year, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous forecast in April. This is largely on account of subdued inflation in China, the IMF said, adding that global inflation remains well above its pre-pandemic levels of around 3.5 percent. Resilient US consumption The IMF has lifted its outlook for US growth this year to 1.8 percent, up 0.2 percentage points from April, citing resilient consumption growth in the first quarter. The still-tight labor market in the worlds largest economy has supported gains in real income and a rebound in vehicle purchases, the IMF said in its report. The Fund sees US growth slipping to 1.0 percent next year, as savings accumulated during the pandemic dry up and the economy loses momentum. We are cautiously prudent that the US economy could avoid a recession and, you know, glide towards its inflation target without having a recession in its future, Gourinchas told AFP. But its a very, very narrow path, he added. Asian economies still dominate As with the April forecast, much of the global growth this year is forecast to come from emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) like India and China, with economic activity in advanced economies predicted to slow substantially this year and next. Advanced economies are now forecast to grow by 1.5 percent this year, up 0.2 percentage points from April, and by 1.4 percent in 2024. Citing positive recent economic news from the United Kingdom, the IMF has lifted the countrys forecast for 2023 growth to 0.4 percent, leaving Germany as the only G7 economy expected to contract this year. the news is much more positive among the EMDEs, which are forecast to grow by 4.0 percent this year, and by 4.1 percent next year. The IMFs 2023 growth forecast for China remained unchanged at 5.2 percent, although it notes there has been a change in composition due to the underperformance of investment due to the countrys troubled real estate sector. Alongside weakness in the real estate sector, the IMF said foreign demand remains weak and warned of rising and elevated youth unemployment, which reached almost 21 percent in May. The IMF lifted Indias 2023 growth prospects to 6.1 percent, up 0.2 percentage points from April, citing momentum from stronger-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of stronger domestic investment. The Fund now expects Russias economy to grow by 1.5 percent this year, an upward revision of 0.8 percentage points from April, due to stronger-than-expected economic data fueled by a large fiscal stimulus.

        "date": "July 26, 2023 08:58 am",
        "content": "The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has issued a special gazette notification lifting the maximum retail price (MRP) imposed on eggs. The order came into effect at midnight on Tuesday (July 25). Pursuant to the communiqu√©, the Gazette Extraordinary No. 232805 dated April 19, 2023, through which a controlled price was announced on eggs, has been rescinded. On April 19 this year, the CAA stipulated that a white egg be sold at Rs. 44 and a brown egg at Rs. 46. Further, the MRP for a kilogram of white eggs was set at Rs. 880 and the MRP for a kilogram of brown eggs at Rs. 920. However, the price controls proved ineffective, as the shortage of eggs prevailed in the market while the vendors continued to sell eggs for higher prices at their discretion. The president of All-Ceylon Egg Producers Association attributed the shortage to the maximum retail price imposed on their products, adding that they are able to sell an egg at Rs. 50 once the price controls are lifted. Against this backdrop, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando revealed on Tuesday that eggs imported from India would be sold at Rs. 35 per egg at all Lanka Sathosa outlets and Rs. 40 per egg at supermarkets. Accordingly, the State Trading (General) Corporation has taken measures to supply imported egg stocks to Lanka Sathosa outlets and supermarkets from today. Meanwhile, a group of All-Island Canteen Owners Association members had staged a protest in front of the main office of Laugfs Gas PLC, demanding expeditious reduction in LP gas prices. A tense situation ensued as the Laugfs Gas representative arrived at the scene to discuss the matter with the protesters. Minister Nalin Fernando said the Cabinet of Ministers would be informed of the Laugfs Gas PLCs failure to take measures to slash the prices. Litro Gas Lanka has, however, slashed the prices of domestic LP gas on four consecutive occasions this year. Following the price revision announced earlier in July, the price of a 12.5kg cylinder now stands at Rs. 2,982.",

The Presidents Media Division (PMD) said invitations were extended to all political party leaders and independent groups with representation in the parliament seeking their attendance for the meeting, during which the Head of State will brief them about the National Reconciliation Program. The development closely follows President Wickremesinghes two-day official visit to India last week, where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Tamils issue was given prominence in the wide-ranging talks between the two leaders. The Indian prime minister had underscored the need for the implementation of the 13th Amendment (13A) to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13A, brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. It created nine provinces as devolved units with a temporary merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces. Prior to his India visit, at a meeting with the Tamil parties, Wickremesinghe assured that the 13th Amendment would be fully implemented, without police powers, in the provincial councils. However, political parties in the opposition appear to be divided on attending the all-party conference. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Vijitha Herath said the government needs to come to an internal agreement on the convening an all-party conference before doing so. Now-independent MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara and National Freedom Fronts MP Mohamed Muzammil have confirmed their participation while National Peoples Power (NPP) decided to boycott the meeting.",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 10:42 am",
        "content": "The number of Japanese people has decreased at the fastest pace ever while the number of foreign residents has risen to a record of nearly 3 million, government data showed on Wednesday. The data showed that Japanese society is aging across the country and suggests that foreign nationals are playing an ever bigger role in making up for the shrinking population. The number of Japanese nationals fell for a 14th year, by about 800,000 people, to 122.42 million, according to resident registration data as of Jan. 1, 2023, released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. For the first time, the number of Japanese residents fell in all 47 prefectures, the data showed. The number of foreign nationals living in Japan was a record 2.99 million, a 10.7 increase from the previous year, the biggest year-on-year increase since the ministry began tracking the data a decade ago. As of Jan. 1, 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, there were 2.87 million foreigners living in Japan. Japans total population fell to 125.42 million, a decrease of about 511,000, the new data showed. The population has fallen every year since peaking in 2008 due to a low birth rate, reaching a record low last year. The government aims to address the problem by various means, including employing more women, the top government spokesperson said. To secure a stable workforce, the government will promote labour market reforms to maximise the employment of women, the elderly and others, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has made reversing the sliding birth rate a top priority and his government, despite high levels of debt, plans to earmark 3.5 trillion yen (25 billion) a year for child care and other measures to support parents. A group of Tokyo-based public think tanks said last year that Japan needed about four times as many foreign workers by 2040 to achieve the governments economic growth forecasts. Tokyo had the most foreign residents with 581,112 of them, or 4.2 of the capitals population. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 12:19 pm",
        "content": "An Australian court ordered Facebook owner Meta Platforms to pay fines totaling A20 million (14 million) for collecting user data through a smartphone application advertised as a way to protect privacy without disclosing its actions. Australias Federal Court also ordered Meta, through its subsidiaries Facebook Israel and the now-discontinued app, Onavo, to pay A400,000 in legal costs to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the civil lawsuit. The fine wraps up one strand of Metas legal issues in Australia related to its handling of user information since a global scandal erupted over its use of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 U.S. election. Meta still faces a civil court action by Australias Office of the Information Commissioner over its dealings with Cambridge Analytica in Australia. Wednesdays judgment was in relation to a virtual private network (VPN) service the company then called Facebook offered from early 2016 to late 2017, Onavo, which it advertised as a way to keep personal information safe. VPNs obscure an internet users identity by giving their computer a different online address. However, Facebook used Onavo to collect users location, time and frequency using other smartphone apps, and websites they visited for its own advertising purposes, the judge Wendy Abraham said in a written judgment. The failure to make sufficient disclosures ... may have deprived tens of thousands of Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their data before downloading andor using Onavo Protect, Abraham wrote. She added that the court could have fined Meta hundreds of billions of dollars since Australians downloaded the app 271,220 times and each breach of consumer law carried a A1.1 million fine, but the contraventions can be characterised as a single course of conduct. The fine was agreed by both sides but carries with it a sufficient sting to ensure that the penalty amount is not such as to be regarded ... as simply an acceptable cost of doing business, she wrote. Meta, which made global revenues of 116 billion last year, said in a statement the ACCC had acknowledged it never sought to mislead customers, and over the last several years we have built tools to give people more transparency and control over how their data is used. In a statement, ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information.

        "date": "July 26, 2023 12:21 pm",
        "content": "Less than a month after being named party chief of Chinas central bank, Pan Gongsheng has further solidified his oversight of the monetary authority by being elevated to bank governor  placing him in a critical role to address financial risks and growth momentum in the worlds second-largest economy. The 60-year-old replaces Yi Gang, 65, who held the post since 2018. Pan has become a key member in President Xi Jinpings third term as leadership eyes a steady post-pandemic recovery with low inflation and measures taken to guard against a variety of financial risks. Pan, who had been at the helm of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange since 2016, was named party chief of the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) on July 1 and was widely expected to take Yis place as governor. Appointments of party posts usually precede government positions. Before being formally named governor of the PBOC on Tuesday, Pan had already taken on some of the responsibilities while serving in the de facto role. He met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Japan on Sunday and also attended the Executives Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks the following day. Pans appointment came as Beijing has been introducing new blood to help supervise the worlds second-largest capital market, and new regulatory requirements will soon be unveiled at the upcoming National Finance Work Conference that generally convenes twice a decade. The previous meeting was in July 2017, but it was pushed back from last year to ensure that the new leadership line-up that took office this year will be overseeing their own policy changes. At its quarterly economic-analysis meeting on Monday, the Politburo, headed by Xi, vowed to enhance countercyclical policy adjustments and provide monetary support for innovation, the real economy and small businesses. It also called for defusing risks at small financial institutions, urged a package for debt relief, and outlined plans to stabilise the real estate market. Pan, a native of Anqing in southeast Chinas Anhui province, has a doctorate in economics from Renmin University. He was a visiting scholar at Cambridge University from 1997 to 1998, and he studied at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2011. Pan has a deep understanding of Chinas financial industry  he helped in 2006 with the restructuring and listing of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  the countrys largest bank by assets  and also headed another Big Four state-owned bank  the Agricultural Bank of China  before being named deputy PBOC governor in 2012. Some analysts expect that his decade at the forefront of the countrys monetary issues has given him the experience needed to tackle Chinas most pressing financial issues. The worlds second-largest economy is currently facing a depreciating yuan, falling producer prices and mounting pressure from the market to help shore up the slowing economy. In the past, the PBOC has launched more than a dozen structural tools, including a variety of relending programmes, to address the countrys structural issues such as funding for small businesses, agriculture and technology firms. There are also many hidden risks, including large holdings of debt at local levels of government. Pans predecessor also oversaw Chinas first bank seizure in 20 years, as Baoshang Bank went bankrupt amid a massive misappropriation of funds by the banks largest shareholder. Unlike Western central banks that emphasise price stability and the job market, the PBOC is under the countrys cabinet, the State Council, and economic growth often enjoys a high priority among its multiple policy objectives. Beijing has also been reshuffling its financial regulatory regime this year, with the establishment of the Central Finance Commission and the National Financial Regulatory Administration.

Rajakumari, who died while in the custody of the Welikada Police. Accordingly, the verdict will be delivered on August 25. Rajakumari, 41, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on May 11 based on a complaint made by her employer, famed producer Sudharma Nethicumara, claiming that she had stolen gold jewellery belonging to her. She had later died while in the custody of the Welikada Police, of which her relatives raised suspicions, alleging that she had been subjected to assault. When the case was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala today, the evidence hearing led by the Criminal Investigation Departments Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Meryl Ranjan Lamahewa was concluded. During a previous court proceeding, a witness, identified as Mahendran Suresh, had testified that he had seen Rajakumari being assaulted by the officers of Welikada police. He also divulged that two police officers had handcuffed him while he was at the Pettah bus stand and took him to a house at Cotta Road in Borella, where the deceased woman was employed. According to Suresh, both he and Rajakumari were handcuffed together, and at that point, she had been in good health. After bringing them to the Welikada police station, Suresh said two police officers had assaulted both him and Rajakumari, despite her employers pleas to resolve the issue in a non-violent manner. Later, disciplinary action was then taken against seven officers attached to the Welikada Police, with a Sub-Inspector (SI), two Sergeants and a Constable being interdicted while a Constable and two Women Constables were subsequently transferred.",

Hollywood has been effectively shut down since 14 July, when the Screen Actors Guild of America  American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) joined its fellow screenwriters union, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), in the fight for increased base pay, higher streaming residuals and assurances that their work wont be replaced by AI. The latter point has been a chief concern among several high-profile actors, including Succession star Brian Cox who raged against the scary technology last week during a solidarity rally in London. The wages are one thing, but the worst aspect is the whole idea of AI and what AI can do to us, the 77-year-old Scottish actor said in an impassioned tirade. However, even as fears of AI not only taking over jobs but also actors likenesses grow, Netflix appears to remain strong in its investment in the technology. At current, the streaming conglomerates job board includes a position for a Product Manager  Machine Learning Platform. It notes that the overall salary range for this role is typically 300,000 to 900,000. The listing states that the person in the position will collect feedback and understand user needs from MLAI practitioners and application engineers across Netflix, deriving product requirements and sizing their importance to then prioritise areas of investment. Writer, actor and comedian Rob Delaney (Catastrophe), who stood alongside Cox at the rally, reacted to the job listing, calling it ghoulish. So 900kyr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for SAG-AFTRA health insurance is just ghoulish, the comedian, 46, told The Intercept. Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you theres enough money to go around; its just about priorities. Netflix declined to respond to The Independents request for comment. Other TV and movie actors, such as Matilda child star Mara Wilson, romcom staple John Cusack and This Is Uss Mandy Moore, have shared their appalling pay stories in order to highlight the importance of the historic strike. Hours before the strike action was ordered on 13 July, Disney CEO Bob Iger criticised the decision, saying it was very disturbing to me. This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption, he said, adding: Theres a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic. The 67-year-old actor said on Tuesday (25 July) from the front lines of New Yorks Rock the City for a Fair Contract rally: I know, sir, that you look at things through a different lens. We dont expect you to understand who we are. But we ask you to hear us, and beyond that to listen to us when we tell you we will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots. We will not have you take away our right to work and earn a decent living. And lastly, and most importantly, we will not allow you to take away our dignity! We are union through and through, all the way to the end! Source  The Independent -Agencies",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 03:53 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), becoming the 178th state to endorse the treaty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. The instrument of ratification of CTBT, the document by which a State expresses its consent to be bound by the treaty, was deposited with the UN Office of Legal Affairs (UNOLA) on Tuesday (July 25) at the UN Headquarters in New York. By depositing the CTBT instrument of ratification, Sri Lankas status as a signatory is elevated to a complete State Party to the Treaty. Drafted at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and adopted by the General Assembly on 10 September 1996, the CTBT has been open for signature since 24 September 1996 at the United Nations, New York. Sri Lanka was among the first signatories of the CTBT in October 1996, just days after the Treaty opened for signature. Sri Lanka later entered into a Facility Agreement with the CTBTO in June 2000 which led to the establishment of an auxiliary seismological station in Pallekale, Kandy, as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) to verify compliance with the CTBT. The Geological Survey  Mines Bureau is the national technical focal point of Sri Lanka for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) based in Vienna, Austria. The CTBT bans all nuclear explosions everywhere, by everyone, and for all time. The Treaty is nearly universal, with 186 Signatory States and 178 ratifying states. However, the Treaty will only enter into force, once it is ratified by all 44 States listed in its Annex 2. Sri Lankas ratification at this juncture bears testimony to its long-standing commitment towards nuclear non-proliferation and its pursuit to achieve the principle objectives of the CTBT.",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 04:16 pm",
        "content": "A fire on a freight ship carrying nearly 3,000 cars was burning out of control Wednesday in the North Sea, and the Dutch coast guard said one crew member had died, others were hurt and it was working to save the vessel from sinking close to an important habitat for migratory birds. Boats and helicopters were used to get the 23 crew members off the ship after they tried unsuccessfully to put out the blaze, the coast guard said in a statement. Some of the crew members jumped off the ships deck into the sea and were picked up by a lifeboat, the lifeboats captain told Dutch broadcaster NOS. Some of the crew suffered broken bones, burns and breathing problems and were taken to hospitals in the northern Netherlands, emergency services said. Currently there are a lot of vessels on scene to monitor the situation and to see how to get the fire under control, coast guard spokesperson Lea Versteeg said by telephone. But its all depending on weather and the damage to the vessel. So were currently working out to see how we can make sure that ... the least bad situation is going to happen. Asked if it was possible the ship would sink, Versteeg said, Its a scenario were taking into account and were preparing for all scenarios. The Coast Guard gave an update shortly before midday, saying the situation was unchanged. The Fremantle Highway was sailing from the German port of Bremerhaven to Port Said in Egypt when it caught fire about 27 kilometers (17 miles) north of the Dutch island of Ameland. Its location is close to a chain of Dutch and German islands popular with tourists in the shallow Wadden Sea, a World Heritage-listed area described by UNESCO as the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world and one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known, and it wasnt clear how the crew members death occurred. Its carrying cars, 2,857 of which 25 are electrical cars, which made the fire even more difficult. Its not easy to keep that kind of fire under control and even in such a vessel its not easy, Versteeg said. Images taken from shore showed a long plume of gray smoke drifting over the sea from the stricken ship. One towing ship managed to establish a connection with the freighter to hold it in place. We hope that the fire will be under control or will die out and that we can get the vessel in a safe location, Versteeg said. But its all uncertain whats going to happen now. The coast guard said in a statement that salvage companies and water authorities were looking at the best ways to limit the damage as much as possible. Authorities in Germany were also on alert, German news agency dpa reported. We are monitoring the situation, a spokesperson for the German sea disaster command in the northern city of Cuxhaven said, adding that it had offered support to the Dutch authorities. He said rescue ships and task forces were ready to help if needed, but that no decision had been made on whether to send them. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 04:48 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the World Bank have launched a partnership the Resilient Asia Program (RAP) to accelerate transformational and collaborative climate action to respond to the urgency of climate change challenges in South Asia. The UK government has pledged up to 63 million (50 million) over the next seven years to finance research and analysis, build institutional capacity and expertise to adapt to climate change, strengthen stakeholder and institutional partnerships, and promote greater collaboration for transboundary climate actions and water resource management in South Asia. The World Bank will implement the program, which initially will focus on Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, but is expected to expand to parts of the wider Indo-Pacific. Tackling shared global challenges, such as climate change, environmental damage, and biodiversity loss, is a priority for the UK, as stated in our Integrated Review Refresh which defines our overall security, defense, development, and foreign policy, said Jenny Bates, Director General for Asia Pacific, Foreign, Commonwealth  Development Office. The UKs Resilient Asia Program partnership with the World Bank will develop climate resilience and improve natural resource management, benefitting many millions of people across South Asia and the wider Indo-Pacific. In the first year, the program will support collaborations to address air pollution, facilitate dialogue and knowledge exchange on thermal comfort and cooling solutions to build resilience to heat, and improve coordination on early warning systems, and weather and climate information among countries in South Asia. More than half of the population in South Asia has been impacted by one or more climate-related disasters in the last two decades, said Martin Raiser, World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region. The Resilient Asia Program, made possible through the generous contributions of the UK government, is critical and timely to help the countries of South Asia tackle the climate crisis and work together for a resilient future. The RAP will also support governments of India and Bangladesh to build community resilience, provide sustainable livelihoods, and preserve the delicate ecosystems of the Sundarbans regionthe largest mangrove forest in the world and a shared ecosystem between both countries. The program will also promote collaborations for transboundary water management between Bangladesh, Bhutan, and India in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna River basin. For South Asian countries, the impact of climate change is a shared concern as they are linked by common rivers, ecosystems, and weather patterns. Weather and climate hazards do not stop at national borders, and over 50 percent of the air pollution in major cities in the region moves across national borders, said Cecile Fruman, World Banks Director for Regional Integration and Engagement in South Asia. Cross-country collaborations can unlock more efficient and effective use of the financial, technical, and human resources required to strengthen climate resilience and ensure people in South Asia thrive on a livable planet. The RAP is part of the UK governments overall commitment of up to 348 million (274 million) to strengthen resilience against the impacts of climate change in the Indo-Pacific region under the Climate Action for a Resilient Asia (CARA) program. Other implementing partners for CARA include the UKs Met Office, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). -World Bank",

        "date": "July 26, 2023 05:33 pm",
        "content": "The Samagi Sevaka Sangamaya of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) has informed the President in writing, the reasons why they are against the sale of the state-owned shares in the national telecommunications services provider. The relevant letter points out that the SLT fulfills the majority of the communication needs of the country as a competitive state-owned company in the field of communication, while making a considerable contribution to the countrys economy. Furthermore, the letter has also drawn attention to the profit made by Sri Lanka Telecom during the period from the year 2012 to 2021. However, the Samagi Sevaka Sangamaya of SLT expresses that although the proposals of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have asked the government to restructure the state institutions that have become a burden, it doesnt mention that the profit-making institutions such as Sri Lanka Telecom need to be sold. The letter sent to the President also points out that Sri Lanka Telecom, which profitably provides communication services to the Sri Lankan people, should remain a state-owned institution for the Sri Lankan people. In addition, it added that an institution like SLT, comprising of several data protection centres as well as a maritime communication system connecting 16 countries and a cable maintenance centre, is a national treasure and therefore should not to be sold.",
