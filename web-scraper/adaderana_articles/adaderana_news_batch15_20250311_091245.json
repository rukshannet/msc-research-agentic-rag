        "title": "US urges UN Security Council to support cease-fire plan in Gaza announced by President Biden",
        "date": "June 4, 2024 02:15 pm",
        "content": "The United States urged the U.N. Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions, she said in a statement. The brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition. Hamas has said it views the proposal positively. When Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an enduring cease-fire and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israels goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesnt eliminate Hamas. Netanyahu told parliaments Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are gaps. Biden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. American hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza. In the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a cessation of hostilities permanently. About 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war. The draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation. The draft would also reiterate the councils unwavering commitment to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza. Council members should not let this opportunity pass by, she said. We must speak with one voice in support of this deal. On Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations  Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt  urged Israel and Hamas to consider Bidens proposal seriously and positively. The group of seven major industrialized nations  the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy  also backed the cease-fire plan. Source:The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case",
        "date": "June 4, 2024 02:21 pm",
        "content": "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case. In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated. Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022. The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now. The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce. The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister. Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics. During the February elections, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. However, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government. In the so-called cipher case, the prosecution argued that Khan had leaked a classified cable sent to Pakistans ambassador in Washington. At a rally in March 2022, the then prime minister appeared on stage waving a piece of paper that he said showed a foreign conspiracy against him. He didnt name the country - but was subsequently highly critical of the US. Washington and Pakistani officials denied the claim. Prosecutors said Khans actions amounted to leaking a classified document and damaging diplomatic relations. Khans foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. Both men were acquitted of the charges on Monday. Thank God, the sentence is overturned, PTI spokesman Naeem Panjutha, said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

        "title": "Modi claims victory for his alliance in Indias general election",
        "date": "June 4, 2024 09:08 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in Indias general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics. Modi told a crowd at his partys headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had shown immense faith both in his party and the coalition alliance. Todays victory is the victory of the worlds largest democracy he said. Still, for the first time since Modis Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the worlds largest democratic exercise. That would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies hes instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place. In the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a moral and political loss for Modi. This is publics victory and a win for democracy, Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed Indias political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved Indias standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the worlds fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal. The counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night. Some 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by Indias Election Commission showed Modis BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54. A total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99. The Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied. Exit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices  the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex  both down by more than 5. For Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and Indias vast number of people living in poverty. People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside, Payal said. This is a big deal for us. If we dont wake up now, when will we? If Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the countrys first prime minister. But if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation, said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister, he added. Before Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition. Extreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results. Outside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the partys campaign. Speaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people. The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India, he said. Over 10 years in power, Modis popularity has outstripped that of his partys, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modis enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election, said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. The countrys democracy, Modis critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. And economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on Modis guarantees, highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, India will become a developed nation by 2047, Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14 of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. The opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed theyve been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. In the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out. Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats, said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. Today it seems like that wont happen  people havent supported the BJP so much this time. Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

The current inclement weather has caused flooding in various parts of the country, resulting in damage to rural roads. Consequently, the President has directed the allocation of approximately Rs.03 billion for immediate reconstruction of roads damaged due to the floods. Furthermore, economic difficulties led to the abandonment of projects supported by the Asian Development Bank. However, development efforts are underway, and once debt restructuring is complete, work on high-risk roads and bridges is expected to commence. The public has trust in the current state of the country, and its crucial for everyone to collaborate in order to progress. It is worth noting that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the most capable leader to resolve the economic crisis and steer the country in the right direction. Thus, if he is re-elected with the peoples support, he will undoubtedly bolster the economy. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken numerous steps to address the issues faced by minority communities since assuming office. The President has also emphasized the need to fortify the provincial council system outlined in the Constitution. Therefore, I am confident that these initiatives will be implemented in the future. --PMD",

        "date": "June 5, 2024 01:19 pm",
        "content": "A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged support to him on Wednesday and was set to attend a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government, boosting Modis chances of a record-equalling third term in office. Modis Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict on Tuesday, and he will need support from partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the government. On Wednesday, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh which is in the alliance, said it stood firmly with Modi and his party. We are with the NDA, I will be attending the meeting in Delhi today, Chandrababu Naidu, the leader of the TDP, told reporters. The NDA won 293 seats in 543-member lower house of parliament, more than the 272 needed to form a government. Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was held back to 240 seats on its own, spooking investors and causing concerns about the governments reform agenda. The TDP won 16 seats and other allies won the rest of the NDA total. The weakened majority for Modis alliance could pose challenges for the more ambitious elements of the governments reform agenda, ratings agency Fitch said. However, it added: Despite the slimmer majority, we do expect broad policy continuity to persist, with the government retaining its focus on its capex push, ease of doing business measures, and gradual fiscal consolidation. Newspapers said Modis halo had dimmed, with the Indian Expresss banner headline reading India gives NDA a third term, Modi a message. Modis own victory in his seat of Varanasi, considered one of the holiest cities for Hindus, was subdued, with his margin of victory down from nearly 500,000 votes at the last general election in 2019 to a little over 150,000. But this reduced victory may not necessarily mean reform paralysis, the chairman of a government finance panel, Arvind Panagariya, said in an editorial in the Economic Times newspaper. Despite the reduced majority in parliament, the necessary reforms are entirely feasible. Delivering sustained growth at a accelerated pace can only strengthen the governments hand in the coming years, he said. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhis centrist Congress party won 230 seats, more than forecast. Congress alone won 99, almost double the 52 it won in 2019 - a surprise jump that is expected to boost Gandhis standing. The INDIA alliance was also expected to meet on Wednesday in New Delhi, and discuss a future course of action. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The team will be operated under DeSilva Holdings, specifically setup for this purpose. The majority stake in Sequoia Consultants is owned by Mr. Priyanga De Silva, a Chartered Civil Engineer, who is the CEO and President of Sequoia Consultants, Inc, said SLC in a statement. De Silva, a former first-class cricketer, played for Sri Lanka U19 in 1983 and currently represents the United States Masters Over 60 Cricket Team. He also volunteers his time as head coach of the not-for-profit Southern California Youth Cricket Association and owns several other businesses in the USA and Sri Lanka. My desire to get engaged in cricket, especially cricket in Sri Lanka, prompted me to purchase the Dambulla Sixers team, said De Silva. I have seen LPL grow as a league during the last four years, which is commendable for a small country like ours. I am excited to be a part of this growth and be able to contribute to the development of cricket in our country, he further added. With the new buyer, the team will be known as Dambulla Sixers. We are extremely happy to have the new owner taking over Dambulla, and Mr. De Silvas background as a former first-class cricketer definitely adds value to this ownership, as he understands the cricketing pulse of our nation, said Mr. Samantha Dodanwela, Tournament Director of the LPL. The new owner brings in the required stability for the Dambulla Sixers, and I am sure the new owners presence is going to make a huge difference to the franchise, said Anil Mohan, CEO and Founder of IPG Sports.

        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be sworn-in for a record-equalling third term on June 8, after key allies pledged their continued support a day after a humbling election result that saw his party lose its majority in parliament. Modi, a populist who has dominated Indian politics since coming to power in 2014, will for the first time need the support of regional allies whose loyalties have wavered over the years, which could complicate the governments reform agenda. On Wednesday, two allies in his National Democratic Alliance coalition, the Telugu Desam Party, a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (United) which rules the northern state of Bihar, pledged their support. The federal cabinet met on Wednesday morning and recommended the dissolution of parliament, a constitutional formality before Modi can form a new government. Modi and his new cabinet were scheduled to be sworn-in on Saturday, local media reported. The NDA won 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament, more than the 272 needed to form a government. Modis BJP won 240 seats on its own, a weakened verdict which could slow Indias fiscal tightening, ratings agency Moodys said. The weakened majority for Modis alliance could pose challenges for the more ambitious elements of the governments reform agenda, ratings agency Fitch said. However, it added: Despite the slimmer majority, we do expect broad policy continuity to persist, with the government retaining its focus on its capex push, ease of doing business measures, and gradual fiscal consolidation. With the party losing most ground in rural areas, investors say land and labour reforms, that had been expected to unlock value and growth, will probably fall by the wayside.

        "date": "June 5, 2024 05:25 pm",
        "content": "Months after Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis appointees agreed to end a protracted legal fight, the two sides are set to approve an agreement that could result in the company investing 17 billion into its Florida resort and opens the door to a fifth major theme park at Walt Disney World. The five DeSantis-appointed supervisors who oversee the Disney World district will vote Wednesday on a new development agreement that both sides had agreed to negotiate after a March settlement ended their state court lawsuits against each other. The agreement between Disney and the Central Florida Tourism and Oversight District would last for the next 15 years. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things. It was controlled by Disney supporters for most of its five decades until it was taken over by the DeSantis appointees last year. Under the deals terms, during the next decade or two, Disney would be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20. Disney would retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment. In exchange, Disney would be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney Worlds 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also would need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least 10 million on affordable housing for central Florida. The settlement in March ended almost two years of litigation that was sparked by DeSantis takeover of the district from Disney supporters following the companys opposition to a Florida law critics dubbed Dont Say Gay. The 2022 law bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades and was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign this year. As punishment for Disneys opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the companys free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. As part of the March settlement, Disney agreed to put on hold the appeal of the federal lawsuit. Before control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the eleventh-hour deals neutered their powers and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.

        "date": "June 5, 2024 07:31 pm",
        "content": "Congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the BJP-led NDAs historic achievement of securing three consecutive victories in the Lok Sabha elections, Sri Lankas Opposition Leader, Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday reaffirmed support for Indias permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Making a special speech in the Sri Lankan Parliament on Wednesday, Premadasa emphasised that India, with its status as the worlds most populous country and a significant global economic and military power, deserves this recognition. This is of utmost importance as India has the largest population in the whole world. Also, when you examine the worlds economic, security power configuration, I feel that this representation of India in the UNSC must be achieved and must be promoted, said Premadasa. We as parliamentarians, all 225, in this august assembly would like to propose that India be made a permanent member of the UN Security Council. I think it is long overdue and it should be implemented as quickly as possible, the Opposition leader said, expressing his confidence that the current permanent members of the UNSC would acknowledge Indias rightful place in the global power structure. I am pretty sure that the five members who are there right now would have no objection to establishing this world power reality in the UN structure, he stated. Premadasa also acknowledged the strong bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and India and expressed gratitude for Indias significant financial support including grants, loans, and other financial aid totaling approximately six billion USD. We have seen the brotherly neighborhood relationship between the two countries as India is the largest single donor to Sri Lanka with around 6 billion in grants, loans and financial support. We appreciate the support that India has provided to us when Sri Lanka has been suffering from a variety of challenges including economic bankruptcy, said Premadasa. Hailing his visionary leadership, practical policies, and effective governance, the SJB leader highlighted that Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to accomplish the feat of leading the country for the third time. Prime Minister Modi has been a remarkable person who commenced his work from humble beginnings. He came from a small family and didnt have a huge family background. He did not have a power base to commence work. But during his stint as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and later as the Indian PM, he has exhibited stupendous energy, charisma, hard work and the singular determination to make India number one in the world. This is at a time when most of the countries in the region are going through sluggish economic growth, said Premadasa while praising PM Modis achievement. We see India as a unique country that also extricated itself from the Covid-19 catastrophe. India has been a shining example of how you get out of desperate situations, despair and economic catastrophe and how you transform and translate a bad situation into a better one. I would like to congratulate honourable PM Modi on his remarkable achievement in almost all states. Of course, there have been states where he has done very well and there are certain states where the BJP-NDA is yet to make its imprint, he said in his speech. The Sri Lankan Opposition leader also reiterated his commitment to maintain cooperation between the two nations to ensure mutual prosperity and benefits. We would like to continuously have a very close relationship with India, our great and brotherly neighbour. We would like to have a strong productive and constructive relationship with them, he stated. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe also congratulated PM Modi on NDAs victory and re-election for the third term. I extend my warmest felicitations to the BJP-led NDA on its victory, demonstrating the confidence of the Indian people in the progress and prosperity under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. As the closest neighbour, Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthening the partnership with India, President Wickremesinghe posted on X. Modi tweeted in response: Thank you President Ranil Wickremesinghe. I look forward to our continued cooperation on the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "date": "June 5, 2024 10:21 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that Sri Lanka is committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040 while pursuing its economic goals. He noted that Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia to incorporate the global objective of zero carbon emissions into its national policy. He made these remarks during the World Environment Day celebrations held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (05). The President emphasized that Sri Lankas approach to climate change and environmental issues goes beyond traditional programs and is now integrated into the countrys economic and foreign policies. He also highlighted that the upcoming Climate Change Act and the establishment of the Climate Change Centre will create a comprehensive legal framework for addressing environmental and climate change issues, a framework that is unique compared to other countries. President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted Sri Lankas proactive role in recent COP Conferences on Climate Change and other international platforms. He announced a significant initiative: the draft for establishing the International University on Climate Change in Sri Lanka is expected to be enacted before June next year. The President expressed skepticism about the financial commitments from the Western world and developed countries to address climate change. He noted that the money spent by the US and Europe this year on the war in Ukraine could have funded climate change efforts for two years. President Wickremesinghe urged developed countries to provide relief to low-income African nations, while stressing that tropical countries must secure their own funding to manage climate change effectively. By doing so, tropical countries can contribute significantly to global climate control. President Ranil Wickremesinghe signed the gazette announcement declaring the Warnagalawatta Environmental Protection Zone in the Ratnapura District. He also symbolically awarded medals to eight students from four school environmental pioneer brigades. During the event, the first issue of Soba magazine was presented to the President. Additionally, mineral kits were distributed to schools, environment-friendly mining licenses were issued, and certificates and gifts were awarded to the ten best green railway stations. In conjunction with World Environment Day, a National Environment Week was announced starting from May 30, with numerous special programs organized across the island to increase the countrys forest cover. In his remarks, President Wickremesinghe emphasized that this years World Environment Day is being celebrated at a crucial time. He expressed optimism that focusing on global climate change will help achieve the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. The World Environment Day celebration, held at the Presidential Secretariat under the theme Effective Land Use is a Healthy Alternative, also saw the launch of the National Green Procurement Policy under the Presidents leadership. President Wickremesinghes speech: This year, we are celebrating World Environment Day at a very crucial time. When we focus on global climate change, it gives us hope that we can achieve the climate change goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Global temperatures have already risen beyond our expectations. While some developed countries are implementing various programs to combat climate change, nations such as India, China and Indonesia have indicated they need more time to achieve these goals. Additionally, there are also petroleum-producing countries. Amidst these challenges, small countries like Sri Lanka are struggling to address climate change. We must now take new measures to combat this issue. Limiting ourselves to the initiatives undertaken during the establishment of the Ministry of Environment is no longer sufficient. To achieve our goals, we need to implement several new programs, and we have already begun this work. The first step is to establish a new legal framework. We have already submitted the initial legislation to Parliament. The National Policy on Economic Transformation (a) II, as outlined in Section 3 of the Economic Transformation Bill, sets the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. With this commitment, we have become the first country in Asia to incorporate the goal of net zero carbon emissions into our national policy. We must reach this objective while also meeting the countrys economic targets. Our focus is on achieving this goal by 2040, a decade ahead of schedule, and we are progressing accordingly. Once this bill is passed, it will become national policy. All organizations, including those in the non-governmental sector, will be required to comply with it. Additionally, it is necessary to amend the environmental laws prepared by the Central Environment Authority. These laws, drafted in the 1980s, are now out-dated and need to reflect current conditions. We plan to make these amendments in the near future. Specifically, we are working on introducing the Climate Change Act and the Act establishing the Climate Change Centre. Once these drafts are enacted, Sri Lanka will have a fundamental legal framework addressing environmental and climate change issues. We have also planned to establish a dedicated unit within the Ministry of Finance focused on creating a green economy. This unit will be responsible for funding programs aimed at promoting a green economy, and we expect to have the entire system in place by the end of this year. Additionally, we have directed the implementation of the agricultural modernization program in alignment with our environmental policy. By integrating environmental policies with the agricultural modernization program, we ensure that these initiatives reach every village. This work will be implemented on a national scale. A country like Sri Lanka cannot remain silent at a time when the entire world is heavily impacted by climate change. Therefore, I have instructed the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Environment to actively engage in the Conferences on Climate Change (COP) and other international platforms to advocate for environmental issues. We are taking significant steps to establish the University of Climate Change as a key initiative. We have engaged in discussions with several countries and secured 600 acres of land in the Kothmale area for this purpose. The draft plan will be completed next month, followed by discussions with relevant international organizations. We aim to have this initiative legalized by June of next year. We aim to collaborate with these universities to conduct international-level research on addressing climate changes. However, challenges have emerged in securing the necessary provisions for this endeavour. Many developing countries are requesting financial assistance, citing a lack of funds. However, I believe not every country needs to take this approach. For instance, despite its current economic difficulties, Sri Lanka has not sought such financial aid. Moreover, we have requested the cancellation of existing debts for economically underdeveloped countries in Africa, and we are collaborating with many other nations to achieve this. Additionally, the promised funds from Western and developed countries have not yet been received. Notably, the money spent by the United States and Europe this year on the war in Ukraine would be sufficient to address climate change issues for two years. The expenditure by Russia is yet to be calculated. Furthermore, if the funds and weaponry costs associated with the Gaza conflict were redirected to climate change efforts, it could significantly impact the world. However, we cannot expect to receive this money. Therefore, Sri Lanka has proposed that as a tropical region, we should find the necessary funds ourselves. While advocating for developed countries to provide relief to low-income nations in Africa, we will seek to generate the needed money within our own countries. Several companies are actively working to obtain carbon credits, particularly in the environmental sector. We should initiate projects that can earn carbon credits within our borders. By leveraging our tropical region for this purpose, each country can secure a portion of the required funds. This approach will contribute to controlling a part of global climate changes. The Amazon River Valley in Brazil and the surrounding vast forests must be protected. Additionally, we are discussing the significance of the Indian Ocean in this context. Thus, Sri Lankas approach to addressing climate changes and environmental issues extends beyond traditional practices. We must advance further, integrating these efforts into both our economic and foreign policies. --PMD",

        "date": "June 6, 2024 10:00 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Joseph Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin joined leaders of more than 50 countries in congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that won the highest number of seats in the Lok Sabha election. During a telephone call, Mr. Modi also invited Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to his swearing-in due to be held this weekend, which he has accepted, the Sri Lankan Presidential Media Division said in a statement. All eyes are now on which other leaders the government would invite to the ceremony as Mr. Modi did in 2014 and 2019, when he invited SAARC leaders and BIMSTEC leaders, respectively. As a member of both groupings, Sri Lankas leaders were invited on both occasions. Officials did not rule out invitations to other regional countries, including the Gulf countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and Central Asian countries. The officials explained that much will depend on their ability to fly to India at short notice once the swearing-in details are finalised. However, hotels in Delhi had already been primed by security agencies last month to expect incoming high-level visitors. Among countries whose leaders extended their greetings on Wednesday were Israel, Singapore, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine. Leaders of regional countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Seychelles, and the UAE also joined in, while the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) conveyed its wishes at a briefing. Congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance on their victory, and the nearly 650 million voters in this historic election, Mr. Biden said, adding that the India-U.S. relationship had unlimited potential. The U.S. government, in addition to congratulating Mr Modi and the NDA, also congratulated journalists, civil society workers and others for the contributions to democracy. We commend Indian voters, poll workers, civil society, and journalists for their commitment and vital contributions to Indias democratic processes and institutions, the State Departments spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Mr. Putin was the first international leader to speak to Mr. Modi on the telephone. The Russian President warmly congratulated Narendra Modi on the success of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the recently concluded general parliamentary elections, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday. In a message echoing the Chinese MFA, Chinese Ambassador Xu Feihong wrote, Look forward to making joint efforts with the Indian side for a sound and stable China-India relationship, which is in line with the interests and expectations of both countries, the region and the world. President of the United Arab Emirates Mohammed Bin Zayed greeted PM Modi expressing interest in advancing deeply rooted strategic partnership. Mr. Modi is expected to travel to Italy for the G-7 outreach on June 13 and 14, where he will meet Mr. Biden, and other G7 leaders, as well as to Kazakhstan on July 3-4 for the SCO summit, where the Presidents of Russia, China, and Central Asian countries and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, are expected to be present. Meanwhile, a number of South Asian leaders, including from Bangladesh, Bhutan, and possibly Sri Lanka, are expected to visit India in the next few weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been urging Mr. Modi to travel to Switzerland next week for a Peace Summit right after the G-7, said, Everyone in the world recognises the significance and weight of Indias role in global affairs In this regard, we also look forward to seeing India attend the Peace Summit. India has not yet confirmed its level of participation at the conference, where Russia has not been invited, and Mr. Modi sidestepped Mr. Zelenskyys invitation, only saying in response that India will continue to support peace, security and prosperity for everyone in the region. On Tuesday, in an unconventional move, even before the counting of votes had ended, Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth had sent greetings over social media platform X. On Wednesday, as the results were finalised and NDA constituents met, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu issued statements greeting Mr. Modi on securing enough support for the third consecutive term. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is on a visit to China, has yet to convey his greetings. I look forward to working together to advance our shared interests in pursuit of shared prosperity and stability for our two countries, said Mr. Muizzu, whose statement was significant given the tensions between India and the Maldives this year on the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives southern atolls at the insistence of the Maldivian President.

        "date": "June 6, 2024 01:30 pm",
        "content": "MP Wasantha Yapa Bandara stated during todays parliamentary session (June 06) that a potential solution for the rescue of Sri Lankans held captive by Myanmar terrorists has been identified. Accordingly, he urged the Speaker of Parliament to communicate this development to the government. MP Bandara disclosed that after gathering information on Sri Lankans stranded in Myanmar and Russia, a viable course of action has been identified, following the discussions held with the authorities of Myanmar and Thailand regarding the matter. He revealed that talks with a specialized organization named the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), which is under Thailands Ministry of Justice, could lead to the rescue of the 49 Sri Lankans detained in Myanmar. Stressing the importance of conveying this information to the government, he highlighted ongoing efforts to rescue Sri Lankans in Russia as well. We believe that over 1,000 (Sri Lankans) are in Russia. We have submitted a detailed report of 220 Sri Lankans to both the consul general and the Ambassador in St. Petersburg. Our request to them is to provide their support in rescuing the Sri Lankans, he added. MP Bandara emphasized that with proper execution of the proposed actions, it would be feasible to provide information to families of the injured and hospitalized individuals and those missing during the Ukraine-Russia war. Three opposition party members, including MP Bandara, J. C. Alawathuwala, and Sujith Sanjaya Perera, travelled to Thailand on June 27. They engaged in discussions with officials from Myanmar and Russia during their five-day visits to each country, pertaining to the rescue of Sri Lankans held captive by terrorists at cybercrime camps in Myanmar and Sri Lankans fighting in the Russia-Ukraine warfront.",

        "date": "June 6, 2024 01:46 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Technology, Kanaka Herath, announced that the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has granted preliminary approval for Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in Sri Lanka. The State Minister emphasized that a two-week period has been allocated for a formal public consultation process regarding the approval of this internet service. Following this period, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission will take steps to implement the service in Sri Lanka. State Minister Kanaka Herath shared these remarks during a special media briefing held today (06) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). The minister emphasized that this initiative will deliver a fast internet service as well as to the education, research, tourism, fisheries, and agriculture sectors, while also providing global access via this internet facility. During his participation in the high-level session of the 10th World Water Conference in Indonesia, President Ranil Wickremesinghe held discussions with renowned businessman Mr. Elon Musk regarding expediting the application process to connect Sri Lanka with the Starlink network. Consequently, Starlink has received approval to provide internet services via satellite technology. Currently, approximately 2000 Starlink network centres are operational worldwide, providing high-speed internet access to 32 countries. State Minister of Technology, Kanaka Herath, further said, Starting today, we are collaborating with Starlink to provide internet facilities via satellite technology, marking a significant transformation in the technology sector. Unlike the limited internet facilities provided by towers, this satellite-based technology allows for internet connectivity from virtually anywhere. This represents a major advancement in the field of technology. This internet facility offers significant benefits to education, research, tourism, agricultural and fisheries sectors by delivering the fastest internet service through this innovative technology. The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka has approved Starlink to offer satellite-based internet services. A fourteen -day period has been allocated for public consultation, and action will be taken within two weeks following this consultation period. Under Section 22 of the Telecommunications Act, internet services will be provided via satellite technology. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed that a relief package be made available to school children, fishermen, and researchers to ensure they can access this internet service. Plans for implementing this relief package are currently being prepared. Director General of Sri Lanka Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, Madusanka Dissanayake, Starlink is not yet established as a telephone network company in Sri Lanka. However, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission has approved it under Sections 17 and 22 of the Telecommunications Regulatory Act, granting it a frequency license. The Act will be amended in the future to issue a Telecommunication Service provider license. The initial setup or the registration cost, for this service ranges between US 400 and US 600, with a monthly fee of US 99. The satellite technology allows for internet access anywhere in the world and offers speeds several times faster than the existing fibre technology in Sri Lanka. This will significantly enhance the technology sector in the country. Secretary of the Ministry of Technology and Research Dr. Dharma Sri Kumaratunga also attended the event.",

        "title": "Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30 people; Military claims it was being used by Hamas",
        "date": "June 6, 2024 01:51 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school. The strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Its the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israels nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory. Witnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said. Ayman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims, Rashed said. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israels creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gazas overwhelmed medical wards. Footage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity. Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside. The situation is tragic, he said. The Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a compound within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it did not immediately offer evidence. It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located. It said it took steps before the strike to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information. UNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territorys population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israels offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas. The United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it wont end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. The military said Wednesday that forces were operating both above and below ground in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a targeted daylight operation in both areas. Doctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes. The international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries. Gazas health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies. Israel has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territorys two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins. The military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza. Troops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles. Israel sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gazas southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "June 6, 2024 04:46 pm",
        "content": "A person with prior health complications who had contracted bird flu died in Mexico in April and the source of exposure to the virus was unknown, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. WHO said the current risk of bird flu virus to the general population is low. The 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico had been hospitalized in Mexico City and died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general discomfort, WHO said. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico, WHO said in a statement. It was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico, according to the WHO. Scientists said the case is unrelated to the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the United States that has so far infected three dairy farm workers. Mexicos Health Ministry also said in a statement the source of infection had not been identified. The victim had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals but had multiple underlying medical conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms, the WHO said. Mexicos health ministry said the person had chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Mexicos Health Ministry also said in a statement the source of infection had not been identified. The victim had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals but had multiple underlying medical conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms, the WHO said. Mexicos health ministry said the person had chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. That immediately puts a person at risk of more severe influenza, even with seasonal flu, said Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University. But how this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesnt really address thoroughly. In March, Mexicos government reported an outbreak of A(H5N2) in an isolated family unit in the countrys western Michoacan state. The government said the cases did not represent a risk to distant commercial farms, nor to human health. After the April death, Mexican authorities confirmed the presence of the virus and reported the case to the WHO, the agency said. Mexicos Health Ministry said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission in the case and farms near the victims home were monitored. Other people in contact with the person tested negative for bird flu, the health ministry and the WHO said. Bird flu has infected mammals such as seals, raccoons, bears and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists are on alert for changes in the virus that could signal it is adapting to spread more easily among humans. The United States has reported three cases of H5N1 human infection after exposure to cows since an outbreak was detected in dairy cattle in March. Two had symptoms of conjunctivitis, while the third also had respiratory symptoms. Although the death in Mexico was not the same strain as the one that is currently infecting cattle in the United States, they are both H5 avian viruses. Pekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans, Pekosz said. Australia reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, noting there were no signs of transmission. It has however found more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.

        "date": "June 6, 2024 04:56 pm",
        "content": "Nvidias rallied to record highs on Wednesday, with the artificial intelligence chipmakers valuation breaching the 3 trillion mark and overtaking Apple to become the worlds second most valuable company. Nvidia is preparing to split its stock ten-for-one, effective on June 7, a move that could increase its appeal to individual investors. The surge in Nvidias market value above Apples marks a shift in Silicon Valley, which the company co-founded by Steve Jobs has dominated since it launched the iPhone in 2007. Nvidias stock rose 5.2 to end the day at 1,224.40, valuing the company at 3.012 trillion. Apples market capitalization was last at 3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8. Microsoft based in Redmond, Washington, remained the worlds most valuable company at 3.15 trillion after its shares climbed 1.9. Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI, said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. It may be a foregone conclusion that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well. Theres a lot of retail money thats piling in on what they see as a straight shot up. Nvidias stock has surged 147 so far in 2024, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors far outstripping supply as Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet race to build out their AI computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology. It has rallied nearly 30 just since May 22, when Nvidia issued its latest stellar revenue forecast. Nvidia added nearly 150 million in market capitalization on Wednesday, more than the entire value of ATT. Optimism about AI lifted chip stocks broadly on Wednesday, with the PHLX chip index surging 4.5. Super Micro Computer which sells AI optimized servers built with Nvidia chips, climbed 4. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week was the subject of wall-to-wall coverage on Taiwanese television and was mobbed by attendees when he visited the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei, where he was born before moving to the United States. While Nvidia rides a wave of AI enthusiasm on Wall Street, Apple is struggling with weak demand for iPhones and tough competition in China, the worlds biggest smartphone market. Some investors also view Apple as lagging other technology heavyweights as they rush to build AI features into their products and services. Analysts projections for Nvidias future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains. Nvidia is trading at 39 times expected earnings, making it less expensive on that basis than a year ago, when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, LSEG data showed.

        "title": "Suzanne Collins to release new Hunger Games novel next year",
        "date": "June 6, 2024 06:01 pm",
        "content": "Inspired by an 18th century Scottish philosopher and the modern scourge of misinformation, Suzanne Collins is returning to the ravaged, post-apocalyptic land of Panem for a new The Hunger Games novel. Scholastic announced Thursday that Sunrise on the Reaping, the fifth volume of Collins blockbuster dystopian series, will be published March 18, 2025. The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original Hunger Games novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins most recent book, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Collins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier Hunger Games books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume. With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Humes idea of implicit submission and, in his words, the easiness with which the many are governed by the few, Collins said in a statement. The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question Real or not real? seems more pressing to me every day. Film rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay, the last of which came out in two installments. The first four Hunger Games books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of Mockingjay, writing in 2015 that it was time to move on to other lands. But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book. The film version of Songbirds and Snakes, starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena announced to the House this evening (06) that the third reading of the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill was passed in the Parliament with amendments. Meanwhile, the second reading of the draft bill was also passed in the Parliament with a majority of 44 votes. The Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, which incorporates the proposed reforms for the electricity sector, was presented to the parliament by Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera on April 25. It was published in the government gazette on 17 April. The Bill seeks to provide for the establishment of the National Electricity Advisory Council and make the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) the regulator for the electricity industry in terms of the proposed legislation. Further, it seeks to provide legislative measures applicable to the incorporation of corporate entities, in which all activities connected to the generation, transmission, distribution, trade, supply and procurement of electricity are vested. In addition, the Bill also provides for the repealing of the Ceylon Electricity Board Act, No.17 of 1969 and the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No.20 of 2009. However, several parties challenged the proposed bill before the Supreme Court, following which the court informed the Parliament that several clauses of the proposed Sri Lanka Electricity Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court determination stated that these clauses shall only be passed by a special majority of Parliament, and that one clause requires approval through a referendum, the Speaker informed the House. However, the countrys apex court has stated that these clauses could be passed with a simple majority if amended as specified in the Supreme Courts determination. On Wednesday (05), the government agreed to accept all the amendments proposed by the Supreme Court to the relevant draft bill.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka closes in on debt restructuring with bilateral lenders",
        "date": "June 6, 2024 07:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka and a group of creditors are in advanced talks over a deal aimed at restructuring the nations debt with bilateral lenders, according to people familiar with the matter. The government and members of the official creditor committee, which includes India, Hungary and the Paris Club, are exchanging draft versions of the accord, or memorandum of understanding, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. The documents are needed to finalize an agreement reached in November between the South Asian nation and the official creditor committee and hash out the few remaining issues before a deal is settled, one of the people said. The countrys notes due in November 2025 are trading at 59.6 cents on the dollar, while dollar-denominated bonds due in 2030 are trading around 58.6 cents on the dollar, continuing to recover after it failed to agree on a deal with bondholders back in April. Sri Lanka needs to reach deals with bilateral lenders and bondholders to keep receiving disbursements under its 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will evaluate the deals to ensure they provide enough relief to the island nation that it can meet its debt sustainability parameters. The country owes 10.6 billion to bilateral creditors, according to government data, with China representing over 40 of that debt. It also needs to restructure 12 billion in debt with overseas private creditors. Because it has middle-income status, the country is not part of the so-called Group of 20 Common Framework debt initiative, so talks with Chinese official creditors are conducted separately. The people declined to provide any updates on the negotiations between Sri Lanka and China, citing the fact that those talks are separate. Sri Lankas central bank governor and the secretary of the treasury didnt respond to queries from Bloomberg. Cabinet approval was sought for a debt restructuring matter, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardana said Tuesday, without elaborating, when questioned about whether bilateral creditor debt agreements were discussed. The Paris Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sri Lankas first round of talks with dollar bondholders failed to yield an agreement in mid-April, when the government said it had reservations regarding the structure of macro-linked bonds, an instrument proposed by international bondholders. The official creditor committee isnt requesting a structure similar to the macro-linked bonds in its the debt rework with the country, one of the people said. The payout for those securities would vary depending on the nations economic performance. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "title": "Health officials emphasize need for additional measures to combat spread of dengue",
        "date": "June 6, 2024 10:32 pm",
        "content": "Director of the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, emphasized that dengue disease extends beyond mere health implications, presenting significant economic and social challenges. He underscored that the Ministry of Health alone cannot effectively control the spread of dengue and requires full public support. Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, disclosed that within the last five months of this year, over 25,000 dengue cases and nine dengue-related deaths have been reported. Director of the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, a specialist, made this revelation while participating in a special news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today (06). He also emphasized the critical importance of effectively managing the spread of the disease, noting that the current flood situation could potentially escalate the dengue outbreak to an epidemic level. Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, further commented, Dengue is a preventable disease that can affect individuals of any age or socioeconomic status. While many individuals recover from dengue, it also poses a risk of mortality. This inherent risk underscores the importance of ongoing public education initiatives focused on dengue prevention. Particularly during the monsoon season, it is imperative to raise awareness about dengue and its prevention. In light of the epidemic situation observed towards the end of 2023, the number of reported cases surged to over 10,000 in January 2024. However, this figure gradually declined, with only 2234 cases reported by April. Nonetheless, the number of reported cases increased to 2647 in May. The recent floods may exacerbate the breeding of dengue mosquitoes, potentially leading to a further increase in dengue cases in the future. Dengue transcends being solely a health concern; it extends into economic and social realms. Consequently, effective dengue control cannot be achieved by the Ministry of Health alone; it necessitates the full support of the public. Preventing dengue requires a collaborative effort involving all government departments, the private sector, and the entire population. Chairman of the National Drug Regulatory Authority and a specialist at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, advises that during this period, individuals experiencing symptoms such as high fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, severe headache, and diarrhoea should consider the possibility of having contracted dengue disease. In such cases, it is crucial to prioritize physical rest. As previously mentioned, it is advisable to refrain from taking painkillers or other medications, except for paracetamol, as using other medications may lead to serious complications. If symptoms persist for more than two days, it is recommended to undergo a Full Blood Count (FBC) and seek medical advice from a government hospital. Hospitalization will be determined based on the severity of symptoms and medical assessment. During this time, it is essential to ensure adequate hydration by consuming water and liquids such as porridge, Jeevani, orange and lime. It is crucial to avoid liquids that are red in colour or contain artificial chemicals. Following medical advice is imperative for managing dengue disease and mitigating its severity. It is important to note that the reduction of fever does not signify the cure of dengue. Individuals who are particularly vulnerable to complications, including young children, diabetics, pregnant mothers, elderly individuals, and obese patients, should seek medical advice promptly. Community Medical Officer at the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Anoja Dheerasinghe reports that in the year 2024, Sri Lanka recorded a total of 25,417 dengue cases. Particularly in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Kandy, Kegalle, and Kurunegala, there has been a notable increase in reported cases. To prevent dengue transmission, the most fundamental measure is to eliminate mosquito breeding sites at home, school, or workplace. Additionally, individuals experiencing fever should promptly seek medical attention from the nearest hospital or qualified doctor within two days and follow their advice. It is crucial to adhere to medical guidance and only take the medication paracetamol to control fever. Consultant Community Physician and Regional Epidemiologist at the Colombo Regional Health Services Directorate Buddhika Mahesh, underscores the critical importance of dengue control efforts in the Western Province, particularly in light of current rainfall patterns. He emphasizes the need for additional measures to combat the spread of dengue. According to the mosquitos life cycle, which takes seven days from the larvae stage to adulthood, regular cleaning of the environment once a week can effectively control the spread of dengue. Special attention should be given to areas around relief camps to ensure they are mosquito-free zones. The local Medical Office of Health (MOH) offers complimentary medical advice for dengue and other infectious diseases. Despite fewer reported cases in the Western Province compared to previous years, continued public support is essential to further reduce dengue incidence. The Dengue Control Committee in the Western Province employs drone technology to identify mosquito larvae and administer insecticide spraying. Entomologist Sakuntala Janaki, along with Dr. N. Arif, Dr. Sunith Kumarapperuma, and Mr. R. K. S. E. Ranaweera, also participated in this event, demonstrating a collaborative approach to dengue control. --PMD--",

        "date": "June 7, 2024 09:02 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says there is a strong expectation that Sri Lanka will soon reach agreements with external commercial creditors consistent with program parameters. So overall we assess that there has been sufficiently strong progress on the debt restructuring front, Julie Kozack, Director of the IMF Communications Department, said during a press briefing on Thursday (06). On March 21st, IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities reached staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the second review of the economic reform program and also the 2024 Article IV Consultation. Kozack confirmed that on June 12th, the IMF Executive Board will meet to discuss Sri Lankas second review and the Article IV Consultation. In Sri Lanka, we do see macroeconomic policy reform starting to bear fruit. Commendable outcomes include rapid disinflation, robust reserve accumulation, and initial signs of economic growth, while preserving stability of the financial system, she said responding to questions on Sri Lanka. The IMF Spokesman said that the program performance is strong with most quantitative and structural conditionality for the second review met or implemented with delay, and reforms are still ongoing in some areas. The next steps on the debt restructuring are indeed to conclude negotiations with external commercial creditors and to implement agreements in principle with the official creditors. The domestic debt operations are largely completed. Debt restructuring discussions are continuing. More specifically, she said the authorities have been holding extensive discussions with external official creditors regarding an MOU with the official creditor committee and the final agreements with the Export Import Bank of China. Discussions with external bondholders continue with the aim of reaching agreements in principle soon, Kozack said, adding that negotiations with the China Development Bank are also at an advanced stage. There is a strong expectation that agreements with external commercial creditors consistent with program parameters will be reached soon. So overall we assess that there has been sufficiently strong progress on the debt restructuring front.",

        "date": "June 7, 2024 10:29 am",
        "content": "Newly elected Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Kangana Ranaut on Thursday alleged she was slapped and abused by a woman constable of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at the Chandigarh airport before she boarded a flight to Delhi. While officials did not comment on the motive of the alleged assault, Ranaut appeared to link it to extremism and terrorism in Punjab although a video of the suspect appeared to suggest she lashed out over the Mandi MP-elects stand on the farmers protest. I was hit on the face, abused. I am safe but concerned about terrorism in Punjab, Ranaut said in a video uploaded to her handle on X at 6.14pm with the caption Shocking rise in terror and violence in Punjab. The CISF constable, identified as Kulwinder Kaur, was immediately detained after the incident, and later suspended after Ranaut lodged a complaint with CISF officials on her arrival at the Indira Gandhi airport. The CISF was also in the process of filing a police complaint. The incident occurred around 3pm at the security checkpoint ahead of Ranauts flight. While some reports suggested the confrontation occurred after Ranaut did not heed Kaurs instructions to put her phone on the tray during the routine frisking, the BJP MP, in her video, alleged that the constable approached her from the side as she was waiting in the security check area, hit her and began hurling abuses at her, seemingly without any provocation. When Ranaut asked for the reason for her behaviour, Kaur allegedly told Ranaut that she was a supporter of the farmers protests. I am safe. I am perfectly fine. There was an incident at the Chandigarh airport during the security check. As I was leaving after completing security checking process, a woman CISF officer came from the side and hit me on the face. She began hurling abuses. When I asked her why she was doing this, she said she is a supporter of the farmers protest. I am safe but my question is how we end growing extremism and terrorism in Punjab, Ranaut said in the video. Airport authorities, on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Kaur was unhappy with the actor-turned-politicians stand on the farmers protest when she said that the agitators were people paid to demonstrate. Ranauts flight, Vistaras UK707 to New Delhi at 3.30pm, was delayed, eventually departing at 4.10pm. The BJP MP-elect was met by CISF officials from the airport and Delhi headquarters when she landed in the national capital, where she lodged an official complaint. The force is yet to issue a statement. But an official aware of the development in Chandigarh said, Constable Kaur was immediately detained after the incident. Kangana Ranaut proceeded to board her flight. Punjab police officials also reached the airport. Punjab police officers, including deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) KS Sandhu and HS Bal, checked the CCTV cameras and took the statements of the airport staff, said a police officer who asked not to be named. Kaur was being questioned by the authoritiesat the airport, a CISF officer in Chandigarh said, adding that a probe had been launched. A senior CISF officer in Chandigarh said they were also in the process of registering a First Information Report (FIR) against the constable. We have given a complaint at the local police station against the lady constable concerned. She has been suspended with immediate effect and an inquiry has been ordered into the matter, the officer said. Sandhu said that police are yet to register an FIR in the case. Several videos from the aftermath of the incident were being widely shared on social media. In one video, Kaur can be heard defending herself to bystanders, questioning the kind of statements Ranaut made during the farmers protest. She said that women had taken 100 to sit at the protest. Did she sit there? My mother was among the women protesters in the sit-in when she gave that statement, Kaur is heard saying in the video. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip. Kaur hails from Sultanpur Lodhi in Kapurthala district of Punjab and is a sister of farmer leader Sher Singh Malhiwal. Between November 2020 and December 2021, thousands of farmers from food-bowl states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan held a sit-in protest at the three borders of the national capital to protest the three farm laws proposed by the central government to liberalise agricultural markets. The laws were later repealed. Ranaut was on Tuesday was elected to Lok Sabha from Himachal Pradeshs Mandi constituency, defeating Congress heavyweight Vikramaditya Singh by a margin of over 74,000 votes. Farmers leader Sarvan Singh Pandher, one of the leaders of a second farmers agitation in January, on Thursday criticised Ranaut for speaking against farmers and disrespecting their mothers. He also condemned police and CISF for detaining Kaur. Terming the incident a serious matter, National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma called for serious action and said the panel had taken up the matter with the CISF.

        "title": "EU elections start with tight Dutch race - exit poll",
        "date": "June 7, 2024 11:35 am",
        "content": "Dutch voters have begun four days of voting across the European Union, with exit polls suggesting a tight race between a left-green alliance and the party of anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders. Right-wing and far-right parties are widely expected to make big gains in many of the EUs 27 member states, and that appears to have been borne out in the Netherlands, to an extent. Although the Green-Labour alliance is set to take more seats in the European Parliament according to the exit poll, Mr Wilders Freedom Party is on course for big gains. But he has not repeated the runaway victory of last Novembers general election. Under European law final results are not released until every country has voted, late on Sunday evening. Some 373 million Europeans are eligible to vote in the worlds second biggest democratic election after India. The next European Parliament will have 720 seats, with each country having seats proportionate to their population. Germany will have 96, France 81 and Italy 76, while the Netherlands has 31. The Dutch exit poll will be closely watched across Europe for potential trends that will emerge elsewhere on the continent, even though many voters tend to vote on national issues at least as much as on European policy. Ireland, Malta and the Czech Republic vote on Friday, and the rest of the EU votes over the weekend. A shift to the right has been widely expected in this election, with far-right parties eyeing victory in France, Belgium, Austria and Italy. Their opponents are likely to take some satisfaction from Thursday nights exit poll, because of the GreenLabour alliances performance. Geert Wilders party came first in Dutch national elections last November, and has secured a cabinet deal with three other parties, even though he will not be prime minister. Any substantial shift to the right in the make-up of the European Parliament could affect EU policies on climate change, agriculture and potentially defence. According to the Ipsos IO poll of 20-30,000 Dutch voters at 35 polling stations, the Dutch centre-left alliance under former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans is on course to win eight seats, one more than Mr Wilders Freedom Party. However, the margin of error is such that the race is too close to call. Turnout was estimated at almost 47, a five-point rise on five years ago. Before the vote there had been talk of voter fatigue after months of wrangling over the formation of a new government. Mr Wilders said he was delighted with the nice result. It was only an exit poll but it was clear that the Freedom Party was the big winner, he said, as his party had only one seat in the outgoing European Parliament. Another far-right party, which has been on the slide for months, is on course to lose all four of its seats. The exit poll is an indication of just how polarised the Dutch vote has become, with a pro-European party in favour of climate change policies in the lead, closely followed by Mr Wilders, who wants less Europe and promises a government with the strongest asylum policy ever. However, commentators pointed out that an estimated two-thirds of votes had been picked up by pro-EU parties, many of them centrist or liberal. Migration and asylum was the most important factor for Dutch voters, according to Ipsos, and that is likely to reflected in much of the rest of Europe. Voters the BBC spoke to at a variety of polling stations in The Hague on Thursday talked about security as well as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Many said a stronger EU was essential in the face of global insecurity. While a quarter of Dutch voters said they were motivated by European politics, 21 said it was domestic politics, and 48 said it was a combination of the two. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "ICC admits New York pitches at T20 World Cup not up to standard",
        "date": "June 7, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "The pitches used in the T20 World Cup matches played in New York have not been up to standard and ground staff are working on remedying them for the rest of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Thursday. The temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted two games so far, both of which were low-scoring encounters due to the nature of the drop-in pitch which has made batting extremely difficult due to the movement and bounce. Fans expecting a run-fest were left disappointed when Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77 -- their lowest ever score -- against South Africa, while India bowled out Ireland for 96 in Wednesdays one-sided contest. T20 Inc and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted, the ICC said in a statement. The world-class grounds team have been working hard since the conclusion of yesterdays game to remedy the situation and deliver the best possible surfaces for the remaining matches. The stadium is set to host six more matches, including Sundays blockbuster game between arch rivals India and Pakistan. Indias batting coach Vikram Rathour described it as a challenging wicket having also played a warm-up match at the venue. It is what it is. We need to find a way to deal with it and I think we have enough skills in the team and enough experience in the team to deal with it, he said. New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, whose team open their tournament against Afghanistan in Guyana on Friday, said the balance between bat and ball was important at any competition. Theyve been interesting-looking surfaces -- obviously first time being used, he said of the New York pitches. No doubt theres a little bit of work to do there. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The trade union action is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues, according to the Locomotive Operating Engineers Union. However, only locomotive drivers from two out of the 05 running sheds have joined the strike. As a result, the power set trains will not be in operation, the trade union said. It further stated that even though the morning office trains would experience minimal impact from the strike, there is a possibility that all the trains scheduled for this evening might be cancelled. However, Ada Derana learns that only 84 locomotive drivers are engaged in this trade union action based on their own promotion issues. President of the union Chandana Lal stated that the ongoing strike is not a result of a decision made by Locomotive Operating Engineers Union and that the strike has been initiated based on a decision taken by the unions secretary.",

        "content": "Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka said that an allowance of LKR 10,000 will be provided to every household affected by the flood. He stated that this financial assistance is intended for cleaning the houses. Additionally, once the assessment reports on all partially and fully damaged houses and buildings are received, the subsequent steps will be implemented promptly. Sagala Ratnayaka made these remarks while participating in an observation tour today (07) to assess the welfare of the residents in the Kolonnawa area impacted by adverse weather conditions. During the tour, Sagala Ratnayaka inspected the houses affected by the floods and visited a medical clinic organized at the Kolonnawa Sri Sambuddharaja Purana Vihara to oversee the assistance provided to the affected individuals. Following this, he participated in a discussion at the Kolonnawa Divisional Secretariat to assess the current progress and future initiatives of the governments relief program for the affected population. Following the events, Sagala Ratnayaka addressed the media, stating, After consulting with the Divisional Secretaries, it was decided to provide an immediate allowance of LKR 10,000 to each household affected by the floods. Additionally, plans are underway to assess the extent of damage to both partially and completely affected houses, with further compensation to be provided accordingly. Previously, as per the 2019 circular, compensation was only allocated to individuals sheltering in relief camps during flood disasters. However, this protocol has been revised, and measures have been taken to offer a LKR 10,000 allowance to every household impacted by the floods. This adjustment aims to facilitate the return of affected individuals to their homes and enable them to resume their daily activities. In accordance with the Presidents directives, efforts are underway to reconstruct all houses completely devastated by the disaster, with the government bearing the costs and assistance from the army. Concurrently, a program has been devised to distribute essential medicines to those in need. Following the abatement of the floodwaters, there is a heightened risk of disease outbreaks among the affected population, particularly among vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly. Preventative measures are being implemented to mitigate these risks, including initiatives to address potential outbreaks of diseases such as dengue. Collaboration between the Navy, the Red Cross Society, and unaffected community members is facilitating the distribution of aid to affected individuals. Additionally, initiatives are underway to restore the functionality of wells for safe water access. Medical clinics are being organized to address the healthcare needs of individuals in disaster-affected areas, with the support of foreign medical teams conducting clinic camps. Additionally, several medical clinics are being facilitated through Divisional Secretariats. The involvement of army medical teams is also poised to contribute to the improvement of the health conditions of those affected. President Ranil Wickremesinghe remains vigilant regarding the well-being of individuals in disaster-stricken regions and has instructed officials to ensure the provision of necessary relief measures. Efforts are underway to devise an effective program aimed at preventing the recurrence of such devastating floods, with a focus on addressing issues such as unauthorized construction and land reclamation, which have been identified as contributing factors to these disasters. It is anticipated that a Cabinet order will be sought to curtail illegal construction and land reclamation activities to mitigate future flood risks. In addition to these measures, plans are being formulated to establish a new city for residents residing along Kelani River bank. This city is envisioned to offer comprehensive facilities, including hospitals, schools and residential complexes. Given the presence of government institutions such as the IDH Hospital and Sri Lanka transport Board Depot in the area, discussions will be initiated with local residents to garner input and facilitate the implementation of future initiatives. The aim is to develop a comprehensive plan that receives consensus from all stakeholders and to realize the success of the program within the next decade. The tour was attended by Member of Parliament Premanath C. Dolawatta, Director General of the Trade Union Saman Ratnapriya, along with former members of the Kolonnawa Pradeshiya sabha, political representatives and government officials.",

        "date": "June 8, 2024 01:06 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  William Anders, the former Apollo 8 astronaut who took the iconic Earthrise photo showing the planet as a shadowed blue marble from space in 1968, was killed Friday when the plane he was piloting alone plummeted into the waters off the San Juan Islands in Washington state. He was 90. His son, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Greg Anders, confirmed the death to The Associated Press. The family is devastated, he said. He was a great pilot and we will miss him terribly. William Anders, a retired major general, has said the photo was his most significant contribution to the space program along with making sure the Apollo 8 command module and service module worked. The photograph, the first color image of Earth from space, is one of the most important photos in modern history for the way it changed how humans viewed the planet. The photo is credited with sparking the global environmental movement for showing how delicate and isolated Earth appeared from space. NASA Administrator and former Sen. Bill Nelson said Anders embodied the lessons and the purpose of exploration. He traveled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves, Nelson wrote on the social platform X. Anders snapped the photo during the crews fourth orbit of the moon, frantically switching from black-and-white to color film. Oh my God, look at that picture over there! Anders said. Theres the Earth coming up. Wow, is that pretty! The Apollo 8 mission in December 1968 was the first human spaceflight to leave low-Earth orbit and travel to the moon and back. It was NASAs boldest and perhaps most dangerous voyage yet and one that set the stage for the Apollo moon landing seven months later. Bill Anders forever changed our perspective of our planet and ourselves with his famous Earthrise photo on Apollo 8, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, who is also a retired NASA astronaut, wrote on X. He inspired me and generations of astronauts and explorers. My thoughts are with his family and friends. A report came in around 11:40 a.m. that an older-model plane crashed into the water and sank near the north end of Jones Island, San Juan County Sheriff Eric Peter said. Greg Anders confirmed to KING-TV that his fathers body was recovered Friday afternoon. Only the pilot was on board the Beech A45 airplane at the time, according to the Federal Aviation Association. The National Transportation Safety Board and FAA are investigating the crash. William Anders said in an 1997 NASA oral history interview that he didnt think the Apollo 8 mission was risk-free but there were important national, patriotic and exploration reasons for going ahead. He estimated there was about a one in three chance that the crew wouldnt make it back and the same chance the mission would be a success and the same chance that the mission wouldnt start to begin with. He said he suspected Christopher Columbus sailed with worse odds. He recounted how Earth looked fragile and seemingly physically insignificant, yet was home. Wed been going backwards and upside down, didnt really see the Earth or the Sun, and when we rolled around and came around and saw the first Earthrise, he said. That certainly was, by far, the most impressive thing. To see this very delicate, colorful orb which to me looked like a Christmas tree ornament coming up over this very stark, ugly lunar landscape really contrasted. Anders said in retrospect he wished he had taken more photos but mission Commander Frank Borman was concerned about whether everyone was rested and forced Anders and Command Module Pilot James A. Lovell, Jr. to sleep, which probably made sense. Chip Fletcher, a University of Hawaii professor who has conducted extensive research on coastal erosion and climate change, recalls seeing the photo as a child. It just opened up my brain to realize that we are alone but we are together, he said, adding that it still influences him today. Its one of those images that never leaves my mind, he said. And I think thats true of many, many people in many professions. Anders served as backup crew for Apollo 11 and for Gemini XI in 1966, but the Apollo 8 mission was the only time he flew to space. Anders was born on October 17, 1933, in Hong Kong. At the time, his father was a Navy lieutenant aboard the USS Panay, which was a U.S. gunboat in Chinas Yangtze River. Anders and his wife, Valerie, founded the Heritage Flight Museum in Washington state in 1996. It is now based at a regional airport in Burlington, and features 15 aircrafts, several antique military vehicles, a library and many artifacts donated by veterans, according to the museums website. Two of his sons helped him run it. The couple moved to Orcas Island, in the San Juan archipelago, in 1993, and kept a second home in their hometown of San Diego, according to a biography on the museums website. They had six children and 13 grandchildren. Their current Washington home was in Anacortes. Anders graduated from the Naval Academy in 1955 and served as a fighter pilot in the Air Force. He later served on the Atomic Energy Commission, as the U.S. chairman of the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. technology exchange program for nuclear fission and fusion power, and as ambassador to Norway. He later worked for General Electric and General Dynamics, according to his NASA biography. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Foreign Minister and Chairman of Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to examine the issues faced by Sri Lanka Cricket says that the countrys recent disappointments in the ICC World Cup 2023 and ICC T20 World Cup are not isolated incidents. They are stark indicators of the deep-rooted problems within our cricketing infrastructure. These issues cannot be resolved with temporary fixes. What we need is a bold, professional approach that frees our cricket from the control of those who have turned it into a personal enterprise, Minister Ali Sabry said, in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday. He pointed out that cricket is the heartbeat of Sri Lanka, a sport that has brought smiles, pride, and unity to our nation. Our triumphs, especially the World Cup victory, have etched unforgettable memories in the hearts of all Sri Lankans. Yet, today, our cherished sport is in crisis, suffering from a decline that calls for an urgent and comprehensive overhaul. Sabry stated that as the chairman of the cabinet sub-committee appointed to examine the state of cricket in the country, he can attest to the pressing need for reform. The report addressing issues in Sri Lankas cricket realm, prepared by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 01, 2024. The Minister said the report lays out a clear path forward, and that they are now on the brink of implementing these crucial changes through new legislation. He stressed that this is a decisive moment for Sri Lankan cricket. We must seize this opportunity and get the reforms enacted with a new sports law and constitution for Sri Lanka cricket, Sabry said. He added that cricket in Sri Lanka is not just a game or a business; and that it is a reflection of our national spirit. Our success should not be measured by financial metrics but by the victories we achieve on the field and the hope we inspire in our people. Currently, our performance is far from acceptable, and the time for change is now. He urged for everyone to unite and act decisively for the future of Sri Lankan cricket, making it stronger, fairer, and more successful than ever before. The time to reform is now. In accordance with the cabinet decision made on November 6th, the Cabinet Sub-Committee, chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Ali Sabri, PC, included other members: Minister of Power and Energy Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister of Public Security Mr. Tiran Alles, and Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Mr. Manusha Nanayakkara.

They will be among 9,000 guests, including foreign dignitaries and prominent people from around the world, who will be in the capital Delhi to attend Mr Modis oath-taking ceremony on Sunday. The Indian foreign ministry said that leaders from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and other neighbouring countries have accepted the invitation to attend Mr Modis swearing-in ceremony. The foreign ministry also released a video on know the esteemed guests from Indias neighbourhood and Indian Ocean region attending the ceremony. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Maldives president Mohamed Muizzu, prime minister of Mauritius Pravind Kumar Jugnauth and of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal will mark the event with their presence. Prime minister of Bhutan, Tshering Tobgay, and vice president of Seychelles, Ahmed Afif, will also arrive in India. The visit of the leaders to attend the swearing-in ceremony of prime minister Shri Narendra Modi for his third consecutive term is in keeping with the highest priority accorded by India to its Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision, the ministry said. Full results from Indias marathon election, which began in mid-April, were released on Wednesday. Mr Modis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of a majority in the elections winning only 240 seats, well below the 272 needed, in a stunning outcome. However, the BJP-led coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), won the election with 293 seats. Mr Modi was elected as the leader of the coalition after securing the support of the alliance partners. Opposition INDIA alliance led by the Congress party put up a stronger-than-expected fight, doubling its strength from the last election to win 232 seats. Its leader said that the opposition will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time. In his speech on Friday where he addressed his alliance members, Mr Modi said: This alliance of ours reflects Indias spirit in its true sense. We were neither defeated nor are we defeated ... it was an NDA government in the past, still is and will be, he added. The oath-taking ceremony of Mr Modi will be held at the presidential palace, or Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Times of India reported. It will begin at 6pm on Sunday as the capital remains on high alert with section 144 imposed to restrict gathering of people. Members from SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations have been invited to the event. The leaders will also participate in a banquet hosted by president Droupadi Murmu at her residence the same evening. More than 2,500 police personnel, including the polices SWAT (special weapons and tactics) team and National Security Guard commandos, have been deployed across the city while multi-layered security has been deployed around the presidential palace. Other special guests at the event will be labourers who were involved in the Central Vista redevelopment project and rat-hole miners who assisted in rescuing 41 trapped construction workers from a tunnel in Uttarakhand last year. One of the most significant foreign visits would be of Maldivian president Mr Muizzu. His visit comes amid Indias strained relations with the Maldives after the pro-China candidate won elections in the islands with his India out campaign. After coming to power in 2023, Mr Muizzu asked India to withdraw its military personnel from the island country and vowed to forge close ties with China. Meanwhile, in a news conference, the Congress partys main campaigner Rahul Gandhi demanded a parliamentary investigation into what he called the biggest stock market scam, alleging that Mr Modi and other top BJP ministers misled retail investors who ended up losing money. Indias two main benchmark stock indexes hit new highs on Monday after exit polls predicted a BJP sweep, but dropped sharply on Tuesday to close down more than 5 per cent as early vote figures trickled in.
