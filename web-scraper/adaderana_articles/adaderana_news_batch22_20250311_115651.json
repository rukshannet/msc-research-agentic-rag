        "date": "January 28, 2025 10:34 pm",
        "content": "The Department of Wildlife Conservation has reported that wild elephant deaths in the country decreased in 2024 compared to the previous year. According to the department, this reduction was made possible through various programs aimed at reducing wild elephant fatalities. In 2024, a total of 388 wild elephant deaths were reported, while 488 deaths were recorded in 2023. The Eastern Wildlife Zone had the highest number of elephant deaths last year, with 81 fatalities. Similarly, 78 wild elephant deaths were reported from the Polonnaruwa Wildlife Zone, 53 from the Anuradhapura Wildlife Zone, and 43 from the Uva Wildlife Zone. The department stated that these deaths were caused by various accidents, including poisoning, train accidents, road accidents, and elephanta falling into wells used for cultivation. Among the causes, there were 84 deaths from shootings, 56 from electrocution, and 52 from consuming Hakka Patas (a crude home-made explosive used for killing elephants and other wild animals). In 2024, a total of 155 human fatalities were reported due to wild elephant attacks. The highest number of deaths was reported in the Eastern and Anuradhapura Wildlife Zones. Meanwhile, 16 wild elephant deaths have occurred in the first few days of January this year (2025). The Department of Wildlife Conservation stated that the majority of these deaths were caused by shootings, with five fatalities.",

        "date": "January 29, 2025 08:03 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) of the Central Bank at its current level of 8.00 per cent. The Board has arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on this Tuesday (28), following a careful analysis of the current and expected macroeconomic developments on the domestic and global fronts. This decision was made with a medium-term view of ensuring that inflation converges to the target of 5 per cent, while supporting the economy to reach its potential, a statement said. The Board observed that the current period of deflation, as projected earlier, has largely been an outcome of administratively determined energy price reductions. This trend is expected to continue over the next few months before inflation begins adjusting towards the targeted level in the second half of 2025, it said. Meanwhile, Headline inflation is projected to remain negative in the near term, before converging to the target. Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), remained in the negative territory for the fourth consecutive month in December 2024. This was mainly driven by the previous downward revisions to electricity tariffs and domestic fuel prices, amidst subdued demand pressures, the CBSL noted.",

        "title": "Multiple people feared dead in crowd crush at Indias Kumbh Mela religious festival",
        "date": "January 29, 2025 08:38 am",
        "content": "Multiple people were feared dead in a crowd crush at the worlds largest religious festival in India on Wednesday, as tens of millions of devotees went to bathe in a river on one of the most sacred days of the Hindu festival. The crush at the Maha Kumbh Mela in the city of Prayagraj occurred after a barrier broke, according to Akanksha Rana, special executive officer for the festival. Indian authorities have not confirmed the number of casualties. Rana said early Wednesday that several people had been injured and taken to hospital but that officials were still assessing the extent of the damage. Reuters and local media reported witnesses seeing several dead bodies near the river bank where the incident occurred, and photos from Reuters showed bodies being carried from the site on stretchers. Video by the news agency showed ambulances racing through huge crowds of people and casualties being brought to a nearby hospital. Security personnel could be seen helping devotees as scattered blankets and belongings lay strewn on the ground. Speaking to local media, devotees said the incident took place around 1:30 a.m. local time and described chaotic scenes with people running in different directions and others falling over. Suddenly, there was a huge crowd and we got stuck somehow. People started pushing aggressively and we fell, one woman told local media from outside the hospital. The incident occurred as about 100 million Hindu devotees from around the world were expected to visit the site on Wednesday and take a holy dip in the sacred waters in Indias northern state of Uttar Pradesh, according to local media reports. Wednesday marks Mauni Amavasya, one of the most significant days of the Maha Kumbh Mela festival, when pilgrims come to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and the ancient mythical Saraswati rivers. Over six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks of Prayagraj. Crowd crushes at religious gatherings in India are not uncommon, and deadly incidents have occurred in the past, often highlighting a lack of adequate crowd control and safety measures. In 2013, dozens of people were killed and injured in a crowd crush at a railway station in Allahabad as pilgrims gathered for that years Kumbh Mela. Ahead of the festival in Prayagraj, officials said extra safety measures had been put in place to protect visitors, including a security ring with checkpoints around the city staffed by more than 1,000 police officers. The central government said over 2,700 security cameras powered by artificial intelligence would also be positioned around the city, monitored by hundreds of experts at key locations. Aerial drones were touted to provide surveillance from above and, for the first time, underwater drones capable of diving up to 100 meters were being activated to provide round-the-clock cover, the government added.

        "title": "Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump administration freeze on federal grants and loans",
        "date": "January 29, 2025 10:04 am",
        "content": "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a push from President Donald Trump to pause federal funding while his administration conducts an across-the-board ideological review to uproot progressive initiatives. The order capped the most chaotic day for the U.S. government since Trump returned to office, with uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline causing panic and confusion among states, schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from Washington. U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan blocked the funding freeze only minutes before it was scheduled to take effect. The administrative stay, prompted by a lawsuit brought by nonprofit groups that receive federal money, lasts until Monday afternoon. Another court hearing is scheduled that morning to consider the issue. The White House did not immediately comment on the order, which leaves unresolved a potential constitutional clash over control of taxpayer money. Democrats who have struggled to gain a foothold during Trumps second term unleashed on the Republican president, describing his actions as capricious and illegal. Administration officials said the decision to halt loans and grants was necessary to ensure that spending complies with Trumps recent blitz of executive orders. The Republican president wants to increase fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. But a vaguely worded memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget, combined with incomplete answers from the White House throughout the day, left lawmakers, public officials and average Americans struggling to figure out what programs would be affected by the pause. Even temporary interruptions in funding could cause layoffs or delays in public services. This sort of came out of the blue, said David Smith, a spokesperson for the Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas, one of countless districts that receive federal funding. Now theyre trying to figure out what it means based on zero information. Democrats argued that the president had no right to unilaterally stop spending money appropriated by Congress. Just minutes after AliKhan made her ruling, Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia filed their own lawsuit seeking to block and permanently prevent the administration from cutting off federal funding. There is no question this policy is reckless, dangerous, illegal and unconstitutional, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. AliKhan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, questioned how much the details of the funding freeze had been nailed down as she issued her order. It seems like the federal government currently doesnt actually know the full extent of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause, she said. Jessica Morton, an attorney for the National Council of Nonprofits, which brought the suit, said the group has tens of thousands of members around the country who could be affected. Our client members have reported being extremely concerned about having to shutter if theres even a brief pause, Morton said. Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei argued that the freeze shouldnt be put on hold because the plaintiffs hadnt specified anyone who would immediately lose funding if it does go into effect. Trump administration officials said programs that provide direct assistance to Americans would not be affected, such as Medicare, Social Security, student loans and food stamps. But they sometimes struggled to provide a clear picture. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially would not say whether Medicaid was exempted from the freeze, but the administration later clarified that it was. Although Trump had promised to turn Washington upside down if elected to a second term, the effects of his effort to pause funding were being felt far from the nations capital. Organizations like Meals on Wheels, which receives federal money to deliver food to the elderly, were worried about getting cut off. The lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos, spokeswoman Jenny Young said. She added that seniors may panic not knowing where their next meals will come from. The National Science Foundation postponed this weeks panels for reviewing grant applications. Officials in Prichard, Alabama, feared they wouldnt receive infrastructure funding to fix their leaking drinking water system. Republican leaders in Louisiana said they were seeking clarity to ensure nothing was jeopardizing financial stability of the state. Trumps actions would wreak havoc in red and blue communities everywhere, said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. We are talking about our small towns, our cities, our school districts. The full scope of the administrations review was spelled out in a 51-page spreadsheet sent to federal agencies and viewed by The Associated Press. Each line was a different government initiative, from pool safety to tribal workforce development to special education. Officials were directed to answer a series of yes or no questions for every item on the list, including does this program promote gender ideology? or does this program promote or support in any way abortion? Responses are due by Feb. 7. Trillions of dollars are potentially under review. Grants that have been awarded but not spent are also supposed to be halted if they might violate one of Trumps executive orders. The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve, wrote Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a memo distributed Monday. Vaeth wrote that each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the Presidents executive orders. He also wrote that the pause should be implemented to the extent permissible under applicable law. The pause on grants and loans was scheduled to take effect at 5 p.m. EDT, just one day after agencies were informed of the decision. Leavitt, who held her first White House briefing on Tuesday, said the administration was trying to be good stewards of public money by making sure that there was no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness. She denied that Trump was deliberately challenging Congress to establish his dominance over the federal budget. Hes just trying to ensure that the tax money going out the door in this very bankrupt city actually aligns with the will and the priorities of the American people, she said. The attempt to implement a funding pause is the latest example of how Trump is harnessing his power over the federal system to advance his conservative goals. Unlike during his first term, when Trump and many members of his inner circle were unfamiliar with Washington, this time hes reaching deep into the bureaucracy. For example, federal employees are being asked to report their colleagues if they try to continue diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. They are pushing the presidents agenda from the bottom up, said Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University. He also said there are risks in Trumps approach, especially with so many voters reliant on Washington. You cant just hassle, hassle, hassle, Light said. Youve got to deliver. Fears about interruption in government services were exacerbated as states reported problems with the Medicaid funding portal, where officials request reimbursement for providing healthcare to poor residents. Democrats condemned the Trump administration, connecting the issue to the funding pause. But Leavitt said the portal would be back online soon. We have confirmed no payments have been affected  they are still being processed and sent, she posted on social media. The White House did not provide an explanation for the problem.

        "date": "January 29, 2025 10:14 am",
        "content": "Thirteen Indian fishermen, who were arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy yesterday (28) for illegally entering Sri Lankan waters off Kankesanthurai, were remanded until February 10 by the Mallakam Magistrate today. Two fishermen from the group, who were reportedly injured, are currently hospitalized. Meanwhile, India, on Tuesday, lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over an incident of firing by the Sri Lankan Navy during the apprehension of 13 Indian fishermen in the proximity of Delft Island in the early hours of last morning (28). The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said Sri Lankas acting High Commissioner was called into the foreign office to lodge the protest. Our High Commission in Colombo has also raised the matter with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sri Lankan government, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said. In the incident, out of the 13 fishermen who were on board the fishing vessel, two sustained serious injuries and are currently receiving treatment at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Three other fishermen received minor injuries and have been treated for the same. Indian Consulate Officials in Jaffna have visited the injured fishermen at the hospital to seek their welfare and are extending all possible assistance to the fishermen and their families. The Government of India has always emphasised the need to treat issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, keeping in mind livelihood concerns. The use of force is not acceptable under any circumstances whatsoever. Existing understandings between the two Governments in this regard must be strictly observed, the MEA said. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Navy has issued a statement regarding the incident in question stating that the Northern Naval Command observed a cluster of Indian fishing boats poaching in the Sri Lankan waters off Valvettithurai, Jaffna in the dark hours of Monday (27 Jan). Subsequently, the Northern Naval Command mounted a special operation to send away those fishing boats from the island waters, deploying naval craft, it said. During this operation, the Navy seized an Indian fishing boat continued to remain in Sri Lankan waters, while marshalling illegal fishing activities and collecting the fishing harvest. The operation also led to the apprehension of 13 Indian fishermen aboard the fishing boat. The Sri Lanka Navy said its boarding team was compelled to conduct noncompliance boarding as the Indian fishing boat continued to maneuver aggressively, without complying with the Navys lawful orders and its duty, during the process of taking the boat into custody. On this occasion, the Indian fishermen have acted aggressively, maneuvering their fishing boat in a hostile manner and behaving confrontationally with the Navy. However, while boarding the fishing boat, in accordance with the authority vested in the Navy, the Indian fishermen, as an organized group, have attempted to assault naval personnel and made an attempt to snatch a firearm from a naval officer, endangering the lives of the naval personnel. In the process, an accidental fire has taken place, causing slight injuries to two Indian fishermen, the SLN said. Following the incident, the Navy provided initial first aid to the two injured fishermen and promptly transferred them to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital for further treatment. The hospital has confirmed that their condition is stable. Meanwhile, the Navy lodged a complaint with the Kankesanthurai Police regarding the incident. The seized Indian fishing boat and remaining fishermen have been brought to the Kankasanthurai harbour last morning and they were handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action, the statement said.",

Speaking during a press conference at the Defence Ministry today (29), Vice Admiral Kanchana Banagoda stated that naval personnel had boarded an Indian fishing trawler that was in Sri Lankan waters due to a suspicion after it did not respond to instructions to leave the area. However, as a navy officer and a sailor were heading towards the pilothouse of the trawler, the Indian nationals onboard had surrounded them and assaulted the navy personnel while attempting to disarm them, the navy chief said. He added that when they had attempted to grab the firearm it had accidentally discharged causing minor injuries to two Indian nationals who were immediately rushed to receive medical attention. There had been a discharge of weapon. However, the weapon discharge is at a lower angle.

        "content": "The number of adolescent pregnancies in Sri Lanka has risen to 213 in 2024, according to DIG Renuka Jayasundara, who heads the Bureau for the Investigation of Abuse of Children and Women. Speaking on Ada Deranas current affairs program Big Focus, she stated that child pregnancies had increased from 167 cases in 2023 to 213 in 2024. However, she noted that the overall incidents of sexual abuse of children has remained relatively unchanged between the two years. Looking at the data for the past two years, there is no significant decrease or increase. For example, sexual abuse is the most frequently reported in Sri Lanka. Among them, the rape of females under the age of 16 following romantic relationships is the most commonly reported offense, which, in most cases, occurs with consent. 1,237 cases were reported in 2023 and 1,254 in 2024. However, child pregnancies increased from 167 in 2023 to 213 in 2024. Just as the young mother becomes a victim, the child born as a result also becomes a victim. These children often drop out of the education system. This situation should be discussed in particular, she explained. Additionally, DIG Jayasundara reported a slight increase in incidents of cruelty towards children, which rose from 103 cases in 2023 to 123 in 2024.",

        "date": "January 29, 2025 07:06 pm",
        "content": "Dozens of people were killed in a pre-dawn stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela in northern India on Jan 29, as tens of millions gathered to take a dip in sacred river waters on the most auspicious day of a six-week Hindu festival. Bodies were still being brought to the local Moti Lal Nehru Medical College hospital morgue more than 12 hours after the tragedy at the worlds biggest gathering of humanity, though the government was yet to officially announce the casualty numbers. Nearly 40 bodies were brought to a hospital morgue. A Reuters witness counted 39 bodies inside the morgue. Police sources said all 39 were stampede victims. More bodies are coming in. We have nearly 40 bodies here. We are transferring them out as well and handing over to families one by one, one police source told Reuters. There were 15 ambulances outside the morgue and about half a dozen people looking inside for their loved ones. Senior police officer Vaibhav Krishna, when contacted for comment, said police could not give the official numbers because they were busy with crowd management. Distraught relatives queued to identify those killed by the stampede, which occurred after crowds surged towards the confluence of three rivers, where immersion is considered particularly sacred. Deadly crowd crushes are a frequent occurrence at Indian religious festivals and the Kumbh Mela, which attracts tens of millions of devotees every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj. As pilgrims rushed to participate in a sacred day of ritual bathing, people sleeping and sitting on the ground near the rivers told AFP they were trampled by huge swells of devotees coming towards them in the darkness. I was sitting near a barricade, and during the pushing and shoving, the entire crowd fell on top of me, trampling me as it moved forward, pilgrim Renu Devi, 48, told AFP. When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed, and no one came forward to help. Some witnesses spoke of a huge push that caused devotees to fall on each other, while others said closure of routes to the water brought the dense crowd to a standstill and caused people to collapse due to suffocation. There was commotion. Everybody started pushing, pulling, climbing over one another. My mother collapsed... then my sister-in-law. People ran over them, said Ms Jagwanti Devi, 40, as she sat in an ambulance with the bodies of her relatives. Rescue teams carrying victims from the accident site weaved through piles of clothes, shoes and other discarded belongings. Police were seen carrying stretchers bearing the bodies of victims draped with thick blankets. Dozens of relatives were anxiously waiting for news outside a large tent serving as a purpose-built hospital for the festival, around 1km from the accident. An official at Prayagrajs SRN Hospital, where some of the injured were taken, said those who died had either suffered heart attacks or had comorbidities like diabetes. People came in with fractures, broken bones... Some collapsed on the spot and were brought dead, said the official, who did not want to be named. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences to devotees who have lost their loved ones and said local officials were helping victims in every possible way, without specifying the number of dead. Please cooperate The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar. Jan 29 marks one of the holiest days in the festival, when saffron-clad holy men lead millions into a procession of sin-cleansing ritual bathing at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. Instead, officials were strolling the festival site with loudhailers, urging pilgrims to keep away from the disaster site and bathe at other locations. We humbly request all devotees do not come to the main bathing spot, said one festival staffer, his voice crackling through his megaphone. Please cooperate with security personnel. The Uttar Pradesh state government, responsible for staging the festival, said millions had already bathed in the waterways between midnight and early morning. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath told reporters that medical workers were treating those seriously injured in the crush, adding that the situation was under control. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi blamed the disaster on poor crowd management that prioritised the comfort of prominent pilgrims. Mismanagement and the administrations special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident, he wrote on social media. My family got scared Railway official Manish Kumar said numerous special train services scheduled to transport pilgrims had been halted due to massive crowding at Prayagraj. Some devotees decided to make an early exit from the city. I heard the news and saw the bathing site, attendee Sanjay Nishad told AFP .My family got scared, so were leaving. The Kumbh Mela is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality. Organisers have likened the scale of 2025s festival to that of a temporary country, forecasting up to 400 million pilgrims to visit before the final day on Feb 26. Mindful of the risk of deadly crowd accidents, the police in 2025 installed hundreds of cameras at the festival site and on roads leading to the sprawling encampment, mounted on poles and a fleet of overhead drones. The surveillance network is fed into a sophisticated command and control centre that is meant to alert staff if sections of the crowd get so concentrated that they pose a safety threat. More than 400 people died after being trampled or drowned at the Kumbh Mela on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in the northern city of Prayagraj. Source: AFPReuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 30, 2025 06:47 am",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at restricting gender care for people under the age of 19. In the order, Trump said federal support for such care would end. He called on the Health and Human Services secretary to take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children. The order said it was referring to treatments including puberty blockers, hormones such as oestrogen or testosterone, as well surgical procedures. It is likely to face legal challenges. The order directs federally-run insurance programmes to exclude coverage for treatments related to gender transition for minors. It also aims to stop medical institutions that receive federal grants providing such treatments More than 26 US states have already implemented restrictions on gender care for children and young people. Multiple American medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association have argued that this kind of care is needed. But the science on medical interventions in gender care, especially for children, is disputed. Several European countries have commissioned reviews. Last year, a review of gender identity services for under-18s in England and Wales said children had been let down by a lack of research and remarkably weak evidence on medical interventions in gender care. Transgender rights advocates quickly criticised the White Houses move. Todays order lays out a clear plan to shut down access to life-saving medical care for transgender youth nationwide, overriding the role of families and putting politics between patients and their doctors, said Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Unions LGBT and HIV Project. But conservative groups applauded the order. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy group, called it a refreshing return to sanity. Less than 1 of the population over the age of 13 in the US are transgender, according to a study by the UCLA Williams Institute, and the number seeking medical care is smaller. Earlier this week, Trump signed an order urging defence officials to re-examine the militarys policy on transgender troops. That has already been challenged in court. These executive orders fulfil a campaign pledge from Trump to his supporters to roll back policies around transgender people put in place by the Biden administration. Source: BBC --Agencies",

During the meeting, key discussions took place on various matters, including the allocation of land for an explosives warehouse in the Colombo District, the future development plan for local government institutions, community empowerment programs, and the execution of the Clean Sri Lanka initiative, the Prime Ministers Media Division reported. Additionally, attention was directed toward resolving issues related to paddy lands along the border between Maharagama and Kesbewa, the urgent removal of waste at the Colombo Main Bus Stand, and the cessation of unsafe garbage disposal into the Niripola paddy fields in Seethawaka. Prime Minister Amarasuriya reiterated that the public had voted in the last election with expectations of change, necessitating the governments commitment to fulfilling those aspirations. She emphasized that Clean Sri Lanka is not merely about environmental cleanliness, policy implementation, or legal enforcement but also about fostering quality in behavior and human relationships, the statement said. The change required must begin at an individual level. People must determine the difference they want to make in their own spaces. Sensitivity and quality service to the public are of utmost importance, ensuring satisfaction with the services provided. This is not a transformation that can be achieved solely through official directives or circulars, the Prime Minister stated. The government remains committed to ensuring the success of the Clean Sri Lanka program, engaging all stakeholders in fostering a cleaner, more organized, and community-driven future, she added.",

        "title": "Three Israelis and five Thai hostages expected to be freed next by Hamas",
        "date": "January 30, 2025 09:08 am",
        "content": "Three Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals are expected to be freed from Gaza by Hamas on Thursday, Israel has said. Two women, civilian Arbel Yehud, 29, and military observer Agam Berger, 20, have been named along with an 80-year-old man, Gadi Moses, as the Israelis set for release. If completed, it will be the third hostage release of the latest Gaza ceasefire deal. In exchange for the Israeli hostages, 110 Palestinians are being freed from Israeli jails. The Thai hostages names have not yet been made public. Their release would be a unilateral move by Hamas, and would not constitute part of the deal. They are reportedly agricultural workers who were abducted from Israel where they worked. Thailands government has said six of its citizens are still being held hostage in Gaza. Their names are Watchara Sriuan, Bannawat Seatho, Sathian Suwannakham, Nattapong Pinta, Pongsak Tanna and Surasak Lamnau. Thailand said two other Thai hostages - Sudthisak Rinthalak and Sonthaya Oakkharasri - are believed to be dead. The names of the 110 Palestinian prisoners set to be freed by Israel have not been released either, but its thought they include at least 30 women and children, as well as prisoners sentenced to life terms. Their release is part of the third such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect on 19 January. Seven women have already been freed alive in exchange for more than 290 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. A fourth hostage release involving three men is expected to take place on Saturday, the Israeli government said. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,310 people in Gaza have been killed since then in Israels offensive, the majority of them civilians, the territorys Hamas-run health ministry says. Arbel Yehud Arbel Yehud, 29, was taken from her home in Nir Oz in southern Israel during the 7 October attacks. She was abducted along with her partner, Ariel Cunio. He and his brother, David Cunio, remain in captivity according to The Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Arbels brother, Dolev Yehud, was initially believed to have been taken hostage, but was later declared dead by Israeli authorities after his remains were identified. Arbel worked at the Center for Technology, Science and Space at the Eshkol Regional Council. Gadi Moses Gadi Moses, aged 80, was also abducted from Nir Oz where he worked as an agricultural expert. His partner, Efrat Katz, was killed in the attack. In September, his family told the Times of Israel that they had not heard any information about him since December 2023, when he appeared in a Hamas propaganda video. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said he was a founding member of his kibbutzs vineyard, and helped look after its community vegetable garden. Agam Berger Soldier Agam Berger, 20, was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base on the border with Gaza. She was seen being taken away in videos released by Hamas. According to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, she was serving as an observer at the base, having arrived just two days before the 7 October attack. Hostages already freed in January ceasefire Agam was taken captive alongside her fellow observers Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy. The other four Israeli soldiers were released by Hamas on 25 January, in a swap that saw Israel free 200 Palestinian prisoners. They were handed to the Red Cross in Gaza City in the second such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect. The first release saw three women hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners freed on 19 January. Karina Ariev Karina Ariev, 20, was serving at the Nahal Oz army base when she was kidnapped on 7 October, 2023. Her sister Alexandra told the BBC she heard shooting as Karina called her during the attack, and later saw a video showing Karina being taken away in a vehicle. Alexandra then saw the video circulating on Telegram of Karinas kidnapping. We identified her, she had blood on her face, she was screaming. I would never wish anyone to feel this feeling, she told the BBC. Time has stopped. After her release, her family described her as a symbol of courage, heart, and determination, and we are proud of her beyond words. After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety  we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina, hear her voice, and see her smile that once again fills us with light, the statement read. Naama Levy Naama Levy, 20, was filmed being bundled into a jeep, her hands tied behind her back. The footage was released by Hamas and circulated widely on social media. According to her mother, the teenager had just begun her military service. But she had previously been part of an Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, and her family called her a peace seeker. In a video of her kidnapping from the Nahal Oz army base, she was heard to tell her captors in English: I have friends in Palestine. In May 2024 her brother, Amit, said her family released the footage to encourage all sides to get back to the table to solve an unbearable humanitarian issue. We feel like shes handling the situation like the true superhero she is, like a hero fighting for her life. Daniella Gilboa Daniella Gilboa, 20, was injured in the leg when she was kidnapped along with other female soldiers at Nahal Oz. She has been seen in several videos, and in one last year asked Israels government why she had been abandoned and discarded while war raged around her. Ms Gilboas mother, Orly, told the Jerusalem Post the video showed her daughter was strong and determined. However, she said she was concerned about her poor mental state. After her release, her family said she had survived 477 days in the hell of Gaza and has finally returned to our familys embrace. How weve prayed for this moment! the statement said. The family went on to thank Israelis for their prayers and support during this time, adding we couldnt have made it through without you. Liri Albag Liri Albag was 18 and had just started military training as an Army lookout when Hamas attacked the Nahal Oz base on 7 October 2023. Her cousin Aya Albag, a corporal in the army, said she had told her she was proud of her passing her observation course before she went to the base She was motivated and so happy that she was assigned to Nahal Oz, she told the Jerusalem Post. She began her role on Thursday, and a day and a half later, on Saturday morning, she was kidnapped. Her family say that she has managed to pass messages back to them through released hostages. In January 2024, footage of Albag was released by Hamas and she could be heard saying her entire life had been put on pause. The world is starting to forget about us. No one cares about us. Were living in a nightmare. First hostage release The hostages freed on 19 January - the first under this latest ceasefire deal - were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari. All three arrived back in Israel this month after being released by Hamas in Gaza, and were reunited with their families. Romi Gonen Romi Gonen, 24, was captured as she tried to escape the Nova music festival when it was targeted by the militant group as part of the 7 October 2023 attack. More than 360 people were killed at the festival when Hamas fighters crossed over the border, 2km (1.3 miles) to the west. The desert landscape offered partygoers limited cover and exit routes were blocked by gunmen. When sirens sounded as the attack unfolded, Romi called her family. Her mother, Meirav, recalled hearing shots and shouting in Arabic in the final call with her daughter. Romi was ambushed by Hamas militants as she tried to flee. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Romi had gone to the festival to do what she loved, to dance - something she had studied for 12 years, starring in solo performances and becoming an amazing choreographer. In a video clip shared by the Israeli military, Romis father was seen jumping in the air before breaking down in tears as he watched footage of his daughters release. Doron Steinbrecher Doron, 31, was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza - near Gazas north-western border - when Hamas attacked. The community, one of many Israeli villages along the border, was heavily targeted by armed militants during the 7 October attacks. Israeli officials said Hamas burned homes and killed civilians, including whole families, as well as taking hostages. When the assault began, Doron contacted her family and friends via WhatsApp to say she was hiding under the bed as militants advanced, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. In her last voice message, she was heard screaming theyve caught me as shouting and gunfire sounded in the background. Dorons family received no information about her whereabouts for nearly four months. After an unbearable 471 days, our beloved Dodo has finally returned to our arms, her family said in a statement released by the missing families forum. Emily Damari Emily, 28, was shot in the hand and taken into Gaza from her home during the attack, and also saw her dog shot and killed. Photographs after her release showed Emily with a bandaged hand and two missing fingers from that attack. Her mother, Mandy Damari, was also in the kibbutz in her separate home on 7 October. Mrs Damari hid in the safe room and was saved by a bullet hitting the door handle, making it impossible for attackers to get in. As the assault unfolded, Emily sent her mother a text message containing a single heart emoji - that was the last contact they had. Emotional images showed Emily reunited with her mother in Israel, hugging while on a video call with her brother. I want to thank everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily throughout this horrendous ordeal, and who never stopped saying her name, Mrs Damari said. Mrs Damari was born and raised in the UK, and met her husband on a holiday in Israel aged 20. Emily, the youngest of four children, has strong connections with the UK - she is a Tottenham Hotspur fan and would often visit to see relatives. More Israeli hostages due to be released Before the ceasefire, Israel said 94 hostages remained unaccounted for, but it believed only 60 to still be alive. There are 26 Israeli hostages due to be handed over in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Israel has said eight of them are dead, citing a list provided by Hamas that gave information on the status of the hostages. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Meta agrees to pay 25 million to settle lawsuit from Trump after Jan. 6 suspension",
        "date": "January 30, 2025 09:29 am",
        "content": "Meta has agreed to pay 25 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against the company after it suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to three people familiar with the matter. Its the latest instance of a large corporation settling litigation with the president, who has threatened retribution on his critics and rivals, and comes as Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have joined other large technology companies in trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration. The people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Two of the people said terms of the agreement include 22 million going to the nonprofit that will become Trumps future presidential library. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the settlement. Zuckerberg visited Trump in November at his private Florida club to try to mend fences with the incoming president, something other technology, business and government officials have done as well. At the dinner, Trump brought up the litigation and suggested they try to resolve it, kick-starting two months of negotiations between the parties, the people said. Meta also made a 1 million donation to Trumps inaugural committee, and Zuckerberg was among several billionaires granted prime seating during Trumps swearing-in last week in the Capitol Rotunda, along with Googles Sundar Pichai, Amazons Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, who now owns the platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Before Trumps inauguration, Meta announced it was dropping fact-checking on its platform  a longtime priority of Trump and his allies. Trump filed the lawsuit months after his first term ended, calling the action by the social media companies illegal, shameful censorship of the American people. Twitter, Facebook and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services own standards, so long as they are acting in good faith. The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post. But Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity  or at least have it curtailed. The Meta settlement comes after ABC News agreed last month to pay 15 million toward Trumps presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. The network also agreed to pay 1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trumps attorney, Alejandro Brito. The settlement agreement describes ABCs presidential library payment as a charitable contribution, with the money earmarked for a nonprofit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be-built library. The president has been litigious in arguing that he has been targeted with unfair coverage by legacy media companies. Trump has filed a lawsuit against CBS News over claims that the network aired a misleading interview with his 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on the program 60 Minutes that amounted to partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference intended to mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales. The program denied the claims. And he has a lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, the news outlets parent company, Gannett, and the Iowa newspapers pollster Ann Selzer, alleging they violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by releasing a poll days before the November election that significantly understated his support in the state. The paper and Selzer have denied wrongdoing. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "January 30, 2025 10:08 am",
        "content": "An American Airlines regional passenger jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed into the Potomac River after a midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said. The Washington Post said multiple bodies had been pulled from the water. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on social media that we know there are fatalities, though he did not say how many. An American Airlines source told Reuters that 60 passengers, along with two pilots and two crew members were scheduled to be on the flight. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, a U.S. official said. There has not been a fatal U.S. passenger airplane accident since February 2009, but a series of near-miss incidents in recent years have raised serious safety concerns. NBC reported that four people had been pulled alive from the Potomac River. A web camera shot from the Kennedy Center in Washington showed an explosion mid-air across the Potomac around 2047 ET with an aircraft in flames crashing down rapidly. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said a PSA Airlines regional jet collided midair with the helicopter while on approach to Reagan. PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, according to the FAA. Police said multiple agencies were involved in a search and rescue operation in the Potomac River, which borders the airport. Dozens of police, ambulance and recuse units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights. The airport said late on Wednesday that all takeoffs and landings had been halted as emergency personnel responded to an aircraft incident. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was gathering more information on the incident. American Airlines said on social media that it was aware of reports that American Eagle flight 5342, operated by PSA, with service from Wichita, Kansas (ICT) to Washington Reagan National Airport (DCA) has been involved in an incident. American Airlines said it would provide more information as it became available to the company. Over the last two years, a series of near-miss incidents have raised concerns about U.S. aviation safety and the strain on understaffed air-traffic-control operations. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker stepped down on Jan. 20 and the Trump administration has not named a replacement - or even disclosed who is running the agency on an interim basis. The last deadly major crash involving a commercial airliner in the U.S. was in 2009, when 49 people aboard a Colgan Air flight crashed in New York state. One person also died on the ground.

        "date": "January 30, 2025 10:13 am",
        "content": "Jaffna District Independent MP Ramanathan Archchuna, who was granted bail, stated that he respects the law and has no intention of continuing in politics, expressing dissatisfaction with the political landscape. Speaking to the media, Archchuna emphasized that he is a doctor and was never previously interested in politics. He explained that although he entered Parliament to serve the people, politics remains a field he strongly dislikes. I really dont like politics. I have never cast a vote for 38 years. I came into politics purely for the people. So I wont stay any longer. Politics is a field I dont like at all. But I will remain committed for as long as I am in it, he stated. Following his arrest in Jaffna, Archchuna was presented before the Anuradhapura forensic officer and later produced before Anuradhapura Chief Magistrate Alaka Sanjeewa Jayasuriya last night (29). He was released on bail with two sureties of Rs. 200,000 each, and the case is scheduled to be heard again on February 3. MP Ramanathan Archchuna was arrested last afternoon (29) by a special team of police officers in Jaffna, over allegedly obstructing the duties of police personnel in Anuradhapura. Police launched an investigation against the parliamentarian for allegedly obstructing the duties of traffic police officers in the Rambewa area in Anuradhapura on January 20 and facts related to the incident was presented before the court by Anuradhapura Police. On January 22, the Anuradhapura Magistrates Court ordered the adjournment of the case involving MP Ramanathan Archchuna due to a discrepancy in identifying the correct suspect. The case has been postponed until February 3. It was reported that a heated situation had occurred involving MP Ramanathan Archchuna and traffic police officers on duty in the Rambewa area, while the former was on his way to participate in parliamentary session. The MP reportedly had a heated confrontation with traffic police officers who had stopped and inspected his vehicle as the MP was allegedly driving a vehicle with VIP lights on, and in a manner that obstructed other vehicles.",

        "date": "January 30, 2025 11:26 am",
        "content": "A sleek, long-nosed Mercedes raced by Stirling Moss and five-times Formula One world champion Juan Manuel Fangio in 1955 could become the most expensive grand prix car of all time at an auction in Stuttgart on Saturday. The W196 R Stromlinienwagen (Streamline car), one of only four complete examples in existence, is being sold by RM Sothebys on behalf of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) at a target price of more than 50 million euros (52 million). If it meets the estimate, it would also be the second costliest car ever sold at auction after a 1955 Mercedes 300SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe sportscar that changed hands for 135 million euros in May 2022. The most expensive grand prix car sold at auction to date was another ex-Fangio 1954 Mercedes W196 that fetched 29.6 million at Goodwood in 2013. The IMS car is the first streamline-bodied W196 R to become available for private ownership and, in its open-wheel form, was driven to victory by Fangio at the non-championship Buenos Aires Grand Prix in 1955. Moss raced it with the streamline body at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, retiring after setting the fastest lap at an average speed of 215.7 kph. Mercedes withdrew from factory-sponsored motorsport in 1955 after a Le Mans 24 Hours disaster that killed 84 people, returning to Formula One as an engine maker in 1994. The car is presented in its Monza livery with full documentation. Without any doubt, its the most beautiful race car in the world and ever. Nothing can compare. Its simply a masterpiece of style and design, Marcus Breitschwerdt, head of Mercedes-Benz heritage, told Reuters Television. It is very fast. The top speed is actually above and beyond 300 kph. I wouldnt expect that its too much of an effort to get it back to driving condition. And we gladly will offer whoever buys the car to do it for them. The car, chassis number 0000954, was donated to the IMS by Mercedes in 1965 and is being sold to raise funds for the museums restoration efforts. The Indianapolis museum, which is aiming to become more U.S.-focused, is selling a total of 11 cars from its collection at three separate auctions this year. The Mercedes Silver Arrows dominated the immediate pre- and post World War Two era of grand prix racing with the W196 R a world-beater in 1954 and 1955. The streamlined bodywork with enclosed wheels was used at high-speed circuits, with the open-wheeled version favoured for more twisty tracks. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "18 bodies pulled from Washington river after plane collides with helicopter",
        "date": "January 30, 2025 05:00 pm",
        "content": "A passenger jet carrying 64 people crashed into Washingtons Potomac River Wednesday after colliding midair with a military helicopter, with US media reporting multiple bodies pulled from the dark, near-freezing water. A massive search and rescue operation was in progress, with divers visible in the glare of powerful lights as they plunged into the snow-lined Potomac to scour the wreckage of both aircraft. Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly told a press briefing that emergency crews, totaling about 300 people, were working in extremely rough conditions and gave little indication they expected to find anyone alive. Were going to be out there as long as it takes, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters. Citing local sources, CBS News said at least 18 bodies had been recovered, while NBC reported more than a dozen. US Figure Skating said several athletes, coaches and officials were aboard the flight, while officials in Moscow confirmed married Russian couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov -- who won the 1994 world pairs title -- were on the jet. We unfortunately see that these sad reports are being confirmed. Our other fellow citizens were there, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Bombadier plane operated by an American Airlines subsidiary was approaching Reagan National Airport at around 9:00 pm (0200 GMT) after flying from Wichita, Kansas, when the collision happened. US Army officials said the helicopter involved was a Black Hawk carrying three soldiers on a training flight. Witness Ari Schulman was driving home when he saw what he described as a stream of sparks overhead. Initially I saw the plane and it looked fine, normal. It was right about to head over land, he told CNN. Three seconds later, and at that point it was banked all the way to the right... I could see the underside of it, it was lit up a very bright yellow, and there was a stream of sparks underneath it, Schulman added. It looked like a Roman candle. - Trump criticizes traffic control - President Donald Trump said in an official statement that he had been fully briefed, and added of any victims, may God bless their souls. Less than four hours after the disaster -- and while other officials stressed they were waiting for investigations to unfold -- he took to social media to critique air traffic control. The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport. The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Why didnt the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didnt the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane. This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!! The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all planes at Reagan National and the airport was not due to reopen until 11:00 am (1600 GMT) Thursday. American Airlines chief executive issued a video statement in which he expressed deep sorrow, while US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas called the collision nothing short of a nightmare. - Crowded airspace - It was unclear how a passenger plane with modern collision-avoidance technology and nearby traffic controllers could collide with a military aircraft over the nations capital. The airspace around Washington is often crowded, with planes coming in low over the city to land at Reagan Airport and helicopters -- military, civilian and carrying senior politicians or officials -- buzzing about both day and night. The same airport was the scene of a deadly crash in January 1982 when Air Florida Flight 90, a Boeing 737, took off but quickly plummeted, hitting the 14th Street bridge and crashing through the ice into the Potomac River. Seventy-eight people died. Investigators concluded the pilot had failed to activate sufficient de-icing procedures. The last major fatal US air accident was in 2009, when Continental Flight 3407 from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York crashed and killed all 49 people aboard. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas Joint Chambers and associations propose solutions for port congestion crisis",
        "date": "January 30, 2025 06:04 pm",
        "content": "In light of the ongoing challenges faced at the Colombo Port, Sri Lankas Joint Chambers, along with key trade, maritime and logistics associations, have proposed several short-term and medium-term solutions to mitigate the impact of port congestion on the nations economy. Issuing a joint statement on Thursday (30), they emphasized that exporters are facing potential delays with imported inputs, missed shipping opportunities, and increased processing costs, undermining their competitiveness in the global markets and foreign buyer confidence in Sri Lanka. Reports indicate that ships are bypassing Colombo for more efficient neighbouring ports which would be a permanent shift, resulting in lost container volumes for the Colombo port and rising freight rates, along with additional costs for freight forwarders and shipping lines. Importers, transporters and all other stakeholders are also losing business opportunities due to these delays, contributing to higher prices for essential goods and an increased cost of living for the people of Sri Lanka, the statement warned. It further said that the manufacturing sector is struggling with material delays and finally this overall situation threatens Colombos status as a transshipment hub and poses serious risks to the overall economy. Accordingly, the Joint Chambers and associations recommend the Government urgently take up the following recommendations to meet the pressing concerns affecting port operations, trade efficiency, and economic growth: Short-term (within the next two weeks): 1. Swiftly implement Scanning and Screening Systems to address the backlog: Empower 247 operations for screening units to streamline container processing. Incorporate other border agencies like SLSI, Food Inspection, Plant Quarantine, Animal Quarantine etc. into this unit to fast track the approval process. Resulting containers to be released based on scanning reports, eliminating the need for additional physical examinations unless there is a serious observation. Ensuring work by officers occurs continuously during working hours including other government officers required for clearing. There could be shifts to cover the 24 hour requirement in the near-term to cover the backlog. 2. Leverage existing data on importers to expand the Green Channel: The risk management unit has extensive data on the companies which are registered with them for imports. Utilize this data to identify low risk cargo and expand the exemption facility along with the green channel facility to overcome the crisis. 3. Fast-track approvals for Authorized Economic Operators (AEO) and Customs Economic Operators (CEO)- allowing low-risk cargo to bypass excessive inspections. 4. Expand the Risk Management Processes: immediately correct the duplicating HS codes in the system which are subject to additional border agencies approvals. For example if SLSI approval is to be obtained in advance and if it is approved by SLSI, the Customs Asycuda system requires that particular HS code for RCT examination. Customs screening unit can based on the SLSI prior approval, releasing containers instead of directing them to RCT for Customs examination 5. Reconvene the Speedy Clearance Committee- In the past, there was a committee comprising public and private officials to fast-track clearance. Such a Public-Private committee can be established with representation from Chambers and related associations to streamline the approval process. 6. Expand the Customs Out Panel Examination Facility for a period or increase staff from Customs long room after office hours at RCT to increase the number of containers to be examined and released on the same day for a period. This action will immediately resolve the congestion until the medium-term solutions are met. Medium-term (within the next 3-6 months): 1. Expand Container Yard Capacity: Identify and utilize underutilized container yards near to the Colombo Port to ease space constraints. 2. Digitize Operations: Prioritize end-to-end digitalization of Customs processes, risk management systems, and approvals to reduce delays and enhance transparency. 3. Strengthen Manpower: Rehire experienced retired customs officials to address manpower shortages and improve operational efficiency. 4. Enhance Accountability: Introduce a structured framework for monitoring implementation and holding relevant parties accountable for operational lapses. 5. On-board a further 50 companies on the AEOCEO program: This will support in facilitating faster clearance. The above recommendations are proposed by the following Chambers and Associations: 1. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) 2. American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka (AMCHAM) 3. Association of Clearing  Forwarding Agents (ACFA) 4. Association of Container Transporters (ACT) 5. Association of Inland Container Depot Operators (ACDO) 6. Association of NVOCC Agents (SLANA) 7. Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) 8. Ceylon Freight and Logistics Association (CEYFFA) 9.

        "title": "Everyone aboard American Airlines jet that collided with Army helicopter feared dead",
        "date": "January 30, 2025 10:06 pm",
        "content": "Everyone aboard an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members that collided with an Army helicopter was feared dead in what was likely to be the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost a quarter century, officials said Thursday. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the midair collision Wednesday night when the helicopter apparently flew in the path of the jet as it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, officials said. Crews were still searching for other casualties but did not believe there were any survivors, which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation, said John Donnelly, the fire chief in the nations capital. We dont believe there are any survivors. The body of the plane was found upside down in three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also found. Donnelly said first responders on Thursday were searching an area of the Potomac River as far south as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, roughly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the airport. There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision, but officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet coming from Wichita, Kansas, with U.S. and Russian figure skaters and others aboard, was making a routine landing when the helicopter flew into its path. On final approach into Reagan National it collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said. At this time we dont know why the military aircraft came into the path of the ... aircraft. Three soldiers were onboard the helicopter during a training flight, an Army official previously said. Images from the river showed boats around the partly submerged wing and the mangled wreckage of the planes fuselage. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. I would just say that everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. That when you depart an airport, you get to your destination. That didnt happen last night and I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we have answers for the families and for the flying public. You should be assured that when you fly, youre safe. Reagan Airport will reopen at 11 a.m. Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced. The FAA previously said it would be closed until 5 a.m. Friday. Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, was asked if he could reassure Americans that the United States still has the safest airspace in the world. Can I guarantee the American flying public that the United States has the most safe and secure airspace in the world? And the answer to that is, absolutely yes, we do, he said. The night was clear, the plane and helicopter were both in standard flight patterns and there was standard communication between the aircraft and the tower, Duffy said. We have early indicators of what happened here, Duffy said, though he declined to elaborate further pending an investigation. It was not unusual to have a military aircraft flying the river and an aircraft landing at the airport, he said. Asked if the plane was aware that there was a helicopter in the area, Duffy said he would say that the helicopter was aware that there was a plane in the area. Asked about President Donald Trump suggesting in an overnight social media post that the collision could have been prevented, Duffy said, From what Ive seen so far, do I think this was preventable? Absolutely. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not appear at the Thursday morning press conference. He was expected to brief reporters at the Pentagon later. If everyone aboard the plane was killed, it will make it the deadliest U.S. airline crash since Nov. 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight just after takeoff crashed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, killing all 260 people aboard. The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo. Passengers on Wednesdays flight included a group of figure skaters, their coaches and family members who were returning from a development camp that followed the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims families closely in our hearts, U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement. Two of those coaches were identified by the Kremlin as Russian figure skaters Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the pairs title at the 1994 world championships and competed twice in the Olympics. The Skating Club of Boston lists them as coaches and their son, Maxim Naumov, is a competitive figure skater for the U.S. The FAA said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. EST in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the Capitol. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet (122 meters) and a speed of about 140 mph (225 kph) when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ. Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided. The planes radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet (732 meters) short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. The U.S. Army described the helicopter as a UH-60 Blackhawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The helicopter was on a training flight. Military aircraft frequently conduct training flights in and around the congested and heavily-restricted airspace around the nations capital for familiarization and continuity of government planning.

        "title": "Israel releases Palestinian prisoners after delay over chaotic hostage handover",
        "date": "January 31, 2025 08:40 am",
        "content": "Hamas freed three Israeli and five Thai hostages in Gaza on Thursday and Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners after delaying the process in anger at the swarming crowds at one of the hostage handover points. Arbel Yehoud, 29, abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz in the Hamas-led assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, looked fearful and struggled to walk through the crowd as armed militants handed her to the Red Cross in a tense scene in the southern city of Khan Younis. Another Israeli hostage, Gadi Moses, 80, was also released along with five Thai nationals who were working on Israeli farms near Gaza when the militants burst through the border fence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the sight of their chaotic handover was shocking and threatened death to anyone hurting hostages. He and Defence Minister Israel Katz said they had ordered a delay in the releases of the prisoners until the safe exit of our hostages in the next phases is assured. The prime ministers office said later that mediators had committed to ensuring the safe passage of hostages in future handovers. Later on Thursday, buses arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah carrying some of the 110 Palestinian prisoners to be freed as part of the phased agreement that halted more than 15 months of war in the coastal territory on Jan. 19. The prisoners were met by cheering crowds in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, with men chanting we sacrifice our souls and blood for you. Zakaria Zubaidi, one of the leaders of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas rival the Fatah group, was the most prominent Palestinian prisoner to be freed. He escaped prison in 2021 with three other inmates but was then recaptured. Zubaidi has always been known as the strongman of the West Bank city of Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation and site of frequent Israeli army raids, including a major operation just a week ago. Thank God who blessed me with the release today. May the souls of the martyrs of Gaza rest in peace, Zubaidi told jubilant crowds who had gathered to greet him in Ramallah. Asked about reports Israel would not allow him to return home to the Jenin refugee camp, Zubaidi replied, The dragon is the owner of the land and the hunter must leave. He is known in Jenin as the dragon. Clashes in Ramallah Palestinian health officials said at least 14 Palestinians were hurt by Israeli fire, some with live and rubber bullets, others from gas inhalation, as they gathered at the entrance to Ramallah to welcome the freed detainees. Video footage showed Palestinians throwing stones towards police and then running away as police began firing. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Some prisoners from East Jerusalem had arrived at their homes while others were taken to Gaza or deported to Egypt. Earlier, in Jabalia in northern Gaza, an Israeli soldier, Agam Berger, wearing an olive green uniform, was led through a narrow alley between heavily damaged buildings and over piles of rubble before being handed to the Red Cross. Our daughter is strong, faithful, and brave, a statement from her family said. Now Agam and our family can begin the healing process, but the recovery will not be complete until all the hostages return home. A video released by Netanyahus office showed a pale Berger crying and smiling while sitting on her mothers lap. Footage of 80-year-old Moses reuniting with his family showed him walking unaided. A doctor said Moses was in a relatively good condition but would continue to be monitored. Netanyahu has faced criticism in Israel for not having sealed a hostage deal earlier in the war after the security failure that enabled the Oct. 7 Hamas assault. Hamas Defiance Hamas, which Israel has vowed to obliterate, still has a strong presence in Gaza despite more than 15 months of heavy bombardment from the Middle Easts most advanced military and the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Al-Sinwar. The killing of leaders only makes the people stronger and more stubborn, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said of Sinwar, filmed by an Israeli drone badly wounded throwing a piece of wood at the device in his final defiance of Israel. The release in Khan Younis took place near the bombed ruins of Sinwars house. The Palestinian prisoners include 30 minors and some convicted members of Palestinian groups responsible for deadly attacks that have killed dozens of people in Israel. Israelis gathered in what has become known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, cheering and crying as they watched the release on a giant screen. The hostages will be taken to hospital for treatment. Some people cheered as U.S. President Donald Trumps Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the square, in apparent gratitude for his role in securing the ceasefire deal. He shook hands with family members of hostages and others. Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages were abducted in the Hamas attack in Israel, the bloodiest single attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Among the dead and abducted were dozens of Thai agricultural workers. Israels military response has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians and laid waste to the enclave of 2.3 million people, who face severe shortages of medicine, fuel and food. Around half the hostages were released in November 2023 during the only previous truce, and others have been recovered dead or alive during Israels military campaign in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans, most displaced repeatedly during the conflict, have returned to their neighbourhoods in the north, where the fighting was most intense. Many have found their homes to be uninhabitable and basic goods in short supply. Israel still lists 82 captives in Gaza, with around 30 declared dead in absentia. In the course of the war triggered by the Hamas attack, Israel has killed other leaders of Hamas as well as Lebanons Hezbollah, striking major blows against Irans network of proxies in the Middle East. The fall of Iran-backed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was also a boost for Israel. After the hostages were released, Hamas confirmed that military leader Mohammed Deif, who masterminded the Oct. 7 attack, had been killed, more than five months after Israel claimed in August to have killed him in a July airstrike.

        "date": "January 31, 2025 10:09 am",
        "content": "A settlement under which a New Zealand mountain has been granted the same legal right as a person has become law after years of negotiations. It means Taranaki Maunga Mt Taranaki will effectively own itself, with representatives of the local tribes, iwi, and government working together to manage it. The agreement aims to compensate Māori from the Taranaki region for injustices done to them during colonisation - including widespread land confiscation. We must acknowledge the hurt that has been caused by past wrongs, so we can look to the future to support iwi to realise their own aspirations and opportunities, Paul Goldsmith, the government minister responsible for the negotiations, said. The Taranaki Maunga Collective Redress Bill was passed into law by New Zealands parliament on Thursday - giving the mountain a legal name and protecting its surrounding peaks and land. It also recognises the Māori worldview that natural features, including mountains, are ancestors and living beings. Today, Taranaki, our maunga mountain, our maunga tupuna ancestral mountain, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate, said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, co-leader of political party Te Pāti Māori the Māori Party. Ngarewa-Packer is among one of the eight Taranaki iwi, on New Zealands west coast, to whom the mountain is sacred. Hundreds of other Māori from the area also turned up at parliament on Thursday to see the bill become law. The mountain will no longer be officially known as Egmont - the named given to it by British explorer James Cook in the 18th Century - and instead be called Taranaki Maunga, while the surrounding national park will also be given its Māori name. Aisha Campbell, who is also from a Taranaki iwi, told 1News that it was important for her to be at the event, and that the mountain is what connects us and what binds us together as a people. The Taranaki Maunga settlement is the latest that has been reached with Māori in an attempt to provide compensation for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi - which established New Zealand as a country and granted indigenous people certain rights to their land and resources. The settlement also came with an apology from the government for the confiscation of Mt Taranaki and more than a million acres of land from local Māori in the 1860s. Paul Goldsmith acknowledged that the breaches of the Treaty mean that immense and compounding harm have been inflicted upon the whānau wider family, hapū sub-tribe and iwi of Taranaki, causing immeasurable harm over many decades. He added that it had been agreed that access to the mountain would not change and that all New Zealanders will be able to continue to visit and enjoy this most magnificent place for generations to come. The mountain is not the first of New Zealands natural features to be granted legal personhood. In 2014, the Urewera native forest became the first to gain such status, followed by the Whanganui River in 2017. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "January 31, 2025 10:22 am",
        "content": "UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has launched a US500 million funding appeal for 2025, to address global human rights needs, according to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). From Gaza to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Ukraine, Sudan and Myanmar, among others, during the past year, my Office has raised the alarm over grave violations and abuses, warned of the risks of escalation, and called repeatedly for an end to civilian death and suffering, the High Commissioner said during the appeal launch in Geneva. At the same time, we have supported states, national institutions, regional bodies, the wider United Nations system and the private sector to deliver better through integrating human rights into their work. During conflicts and in peacetime; in developing countries and advanced economies; from historic grievances to emerging risks  my Office is holding the line for humanity, Türk said. Reflecting on the work of the UN Human Rights Office in 2024, he noted that 2,000 staff working in 92 countries undertook some 11,000 human rights monitoring missions and observed close to 1,000 trials, said UNHRC. They documented some 15,000 situations of human rights violations, supported over 10,000 survivors of contemporary forms of slavery, and more than 49,000 survivors of torture and their families. Over 100 detention centres and prisons reported improvements due to the Offices efforts. To promote a human rights economy, the Office supported projects using human rights-based approaches to taxation and public spending, from Cambodia to Jordan and Serbia, as well as contributing to 166 UN Country Analyses, 11 National Development Plans and 83 projects to support inclusive development. We are very grateful to the 95 partners that supported us, including 67 Member States. We hope for your continued and even stronger commitment in 2025, he said. This year, the Office will build on this vital work by bringing together governments, civil society, the private sector, philanthropies, the scientific community, academia and more. Last year, the Office asked for US500 million, of which US269 million was raised - four per cent less than in 2023. Human rights are a low-cost, high-impact investment to mobilize people for peace, security, and sustainable development; and to build social cohesion based on the contributions of every individual. But funding for human rights remains woefully inadequate, the High Commissioner said. I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in 2025, people who should otherwise be free may remain in prison. Women and girls may lose out on opportunities, ignored by the world. Violations and abuses may go undocumented, leading to a lack of accountability and increased impunity. And human rights defenders may lose the little protection they have, Türk warned. Human rights apply to everyone, and all sectors of society have a stake, he said. We need to make every effort to get the resources we need to continue our vital work, including through non-traditional donors and funding lines, the High Commissioner said. In this divided and polarized world, human rights assume even greater importance and must be one of the top priorities across the globe. That must be reflected in funding for human rights.",

The deportation list includes individuals from various countries who are residing in the U.S. illegally. Additionally, ICE has compiled a list of countries that oppose the deportation process, but Sri Lanka is not among them. According to a document released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), as of November 24, 2024, there are 1,445,549 noncitizens on ICEs non-detained docket with final orders of removal while this includes 3,065 Sri Lankans. The U.S. Government requests foreign governments take appropriate steps to confirm the citizenship of noncitizens suspected to be their nationals, which include conducting interviews, issuing travel documents in a timely manner, and accepting the physical return of their nationals by scheduled commercial or charter flights consistent with ICE andor foreign government removal guidelines. Lack of cooperation from countries in accepting the return of their nationals may lead to ICE classifying those countries as uncooperative or at-risk of non-compliance, it said. Currently, ICE considers 15 countries to be uncooperative: Bhutan, Burma, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Laos, Pakistan, Peoples Republic of China, Russia, Somalia, and Venezuela. ICE considers 11 countries to be at risk of non-compliance: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Gambia, Iraq, Jamaica, Nicaragua, South Sudan, St. Lucia, and Vietnam.

        "title": "Three Israeli hostages, including dual US citizen, set for release in Gaza on Saturday",
        "date": "January 31, 2025 07:24 pm",
        "content": "Palestinian militant group Hamas said on Friday it would free the father of the youngest hostages seized in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and two others including a dual U.S. citizen in the next exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Yarden Bibas is the father of baby Kfir, only nine months old when he was kidnapped, and Ariel, who was four at the time of the cross-border attack. There was no word on the fate of Kfir and Ariel, or on their mother Shiri, who was taken at the same time. Hamas said in late 2023 that they had been killed by Israeli bombardment, in the early months of the Gaza war. Video of their capture began circulating soon after they were seized. It showed a terrified Shiri clutching her small children in a blanket as they were bundled into captivity surrounded by militant assailants. The father, Yarden, 34 at the time of the attack, was also abducted and a clip circulated showing him bleeding from a head injury suffered from hammer blows. Israeli-American Keith Siegel, who was taken hostage with his wife Aviva, was seen in a video released by Hamas last year. His wife was released in the first hostage-for-prisoner exchange in November 2023. Ofer Kalderons two children Erez and Sahar, abducted alongside him, were also released in the first exchange. On Thursday, Hamas freed three Israeli and five Thai hostages in Gaza while Israel freed 110 Palestinian prisoners after delaying the process in anger at the swarming crowds engulfing one of the hostage handover points. Under the ceasefire deal that halted more than 15 months of fighting, 33 hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza are to be freed in the first six weeks of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of whom have been serving life sentences in Israel. Fifteen hostages, including the five Thai workers, and 400 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Ninety Palestinian prisoners, including nine serving life sentences and 81 serving long-term sentences, are to be swapped for the three Israelis on Saturday, Hamas prisoner information office said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn criticism in Israel for not having sealed a hostage deal earlier in the war after the security failure that enabled Hamas-led militants to burst across the border and storm nearby Israeli communities. But there has also been opposition to the current deal, which some critics in Israel have said leaves the fate of most of the hostages in the balance and Hamas still standing as Gazas dominant entity. Hamas, which Israel has vowed to obliterate, retains a strong presence in Gaza despite more than 15 months of heavy bombardment from the Middle Easts most advanced military and the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Al-Sinwar. The truce has enabled a surge in international humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians suffering dire supply shortages. But the fragile calm could be jeopardised if Israel prevents operations in Gaza by the U.N. Palestinian relief agency UNRWA after banning it from contact with Israel, UNRWA communications chief Juliette Touma told a briefing in Geneva on Friday. For now, the agencys work in Gaza was continuing, she said. PALESTINIAN PRISONERS INCLUDE MINORS The Palestinian prisoners and detainees include 30 minors and some convicted members of Palestinian groups responsible for deadly attacks that have killed dozens of people in Israel. Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages were abducted in the Hamas attack in Israel, the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust. Among the dead and abducted were dozens of Thai agricultural workers. Israels military response has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas health ministry, and laid waste to the enclave of 2.3 million people, who face severe shortages of medicine, fuel and food. Israel has killed several leaders of Hamas and another ally of Iran, Lebanons Hezbollah movement, in parallel conflicts. Around half the hostages were released in November 2023 during the only previous truce, and others have been recovered dead or alive during Israels military campaign in Gaza. More talks on the implementation of the second stage of the deal, due to begin by Feb. 4, are meant to open the way to the release of over 60 other hostages, including men of military age, and a full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza. If that succeeds, a formal end to the war could follow along with talks on the mammoth challenge of reconstructing Gaza. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A medevac plane crashed in Philadelphia on Friday with a child and five others on board, the air ambulance company that operated it said, adding that it had not confirmed any survivors. Jet Rescue Air Ambulance said its aircraft crashed with four crew members, one pediatric medical patient and the patients escort on board. At this time we cannot confirm any survivors, the company said in a statement. State and local officials said late on Friday they could not yet confirm how many people may have died on the ground after the plane slammed into a heavily populated portion of the city. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told a press conference at the crash scene that we know there will be loss in this region. We want to offer our thoughts and our serious prayers for those that are grieving at this moment, Shapiro said. President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was so sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost. Our people are totally engaged. First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job. The crash follows this weeks collision of an American Airlines jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter over Washington, D.C., which killed 67 in the deadliest airplane crash in the U.S. since 2009. The Federal Aviation Administration said six people were on the Learjet 55 that crashed around 6:30 p.m. (0030 GMT) on Friday. Local media reported it was near the Roosevelt Mall in northeast Philadelphia and that there were multiple injuries on the ground. Video aired on local TV stations showed the plane in a sharp dive before hitting the ground and exploding in a massive fireball. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker told a press conference at the scene that several houses and cars had been engulfed in flames. She said the situation is all hands on deck, thats where we are right now. Officials said it was not clear what led to the crash. The weather was cold and rainy and with low visibility when the plane went down. The air ambulance had left Northeast Philadelphia Airport and was headed to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri, about 1,100 miles (1,800 km) to the southwest, the FAA said in a statement. A large fire and several fire trucks were visible at the crash scene in images broadcast by the Philadelphia CBS affiliate. About two hours after the crash the fires were mostly out, according to TV images. Neither the Philadelphia police department nor the fire department immediately responded to requests for comment.

        "date": "February 1, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "An official with Meta Platforms popular WhatsApp chat service said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions had targeted scores of its users, including journalists and members of civil society. The official said on Friday that WhatsApp had sent Paragon a cease-and-desist letter following the hack. In a statement, WhatsApp said the company will continue to protect peoples ability to communicate privately. Paragon declined to comment. The WhatsApp official told Reuters it had detected an effort to hack approximately 90 users. The official declined to say who, specifically, was targeted. But he said those targeted were based in more than two dozen countries, including several people in Europe. He said WhatsApp users were sent malicious electronic documents that required no user interaction to compromise their targets, a so-called zero-click hack that is considered particularly stealthy. The official said WhatsApp had since disrupted the hacking effort and was referring targets to Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. The official declined to discuss how it determined that Paragon was responsible for the hack. He said law enforcement and industry partners had been informed, but declined to give details. The FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton said the discovery of Paragon spyware targeting WhatsApp users is a reminder that mercenary spyware continues to proliferate and as it does, so we continue to see familiar patterns of problematic use. Spyware merchants such as Paragon sell high-end surveillance software to government clients and typically pitch their services as critical to fighting crime and protecting national security. But such spy tools have repeatedly been discovered on the phones of journalists, activists, opposition politicians, and at least 50 U.S. officials, raising concerns over the unchecked proliferation of the technology. Paragon - which was reportedly acquired by Florida-based investment group AE Industrial Partners last month - has tried to position itself publicly as one of the industrys more responsible players. Its website advertises ethically based tools, teams, and insights to disrupt intractable threats, and media reports citing people familiar with the company say Paragon only sells to governments in stable democratic countries. Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at the advocacy group Access Now, said Paragon had the reputation of being a better spyware company, but WhatsApps recent revelations suggest otherwise. This is not just a question of some bad apples  these types of abuses (are) a feature of the commercial spyware industry. AE did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

        "date": "February 1, 2025 02:55 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL), Indika Sampath Merenchige, has highlighted that the main reason for the rise in the price of Japanese vehicles is the governments decision to allow the importation of vehicles that are 2 years old instead of the previous limit of 5 to 7 years from the year of manufacture. Speaking about the governments decision to remove import restrictions starting today (01), Merenchige expressed his concerns, stating that this move would make it impossible for an ordinary citizen to purchase a vehicle for less than Rs. 10 million. He further emphasized that if the government had maintained the 5-year limit, vehicles would have been priced between Rs. 6 million to Rs. 6.5 million, making them more affordable for the public. What will ultimately happen is that the ordinary people of this country will not be able to purchase a vehicle for less than Rs. 10 million. This is something that could have been bought for about Rs. 6 million to 6.5 million if it had been extended to 5 years, he said. He further explained, The increase in prices is significant because of the governments decision to allow only vehicles that are within 2 years old to be imported. Merenchige also revealed the current auction prices of 2-year-old Japanese vehicles and the subsequent increase in their prices after the addition of taxes in Sri Lanka. A Toyota Raize 1200cc could reach around Rs. 16 million. A Toyota Yaris could cost more than Rs. 11 million. A Honda Vezel 1500cc hybrid, priced around Rs. 19.5 million, is expected to go up to Rs. 24 million. Even a popular model like the Wagon R, which many in Sri Lanka favor, could exceed Rs. 10 million.",

        "content": "Auditor General W.P.C. Wickramaratne has emphasized that a proper audit of the governments assets has not been carried out effectively thus far. He attributed the crisis surrounding government asset management to the failure of government officials to effectively perform their duties. Wickramaratne made these remarks while addressing a workshop organized by the Ministry of Industries in Colombo. Speaking further on the issue, Wickramaratne raised several concerns, stating: Who can give a guarantee that the governments assets can be obtained from one place? There are no politicians or ministers involved in this. These accountings are carried out by state officials themselves. So why are they not in one place? Can you at least tell how many government vehicles there are? Why is it that if accountings were done, that should have been done but that has not happened? He continued, Recently, a large amount of information has emerged from our audit reports. There are no vehicles in various institutions. We checked in a very simple way.",

        "title": "Israeli hostages, Palestinian prisoners released in latest Gaza exchange",
        "date": "February 1, 2025 06:54 pm",
        "content": "Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages on Saturday, and dozens of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released in exchange, in the latest stage of a truce aimed at ending the 15-month war in Gaza. Ofer Kalderon, a French-Israeli dual national, and Yarden Bibas were handed over to Red Cross officials in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis before being transferred to Israel. Israeli-American Keith Siegel was separately handed over at the Gaza City seaport. Hours later, 183 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released in the exchange. Among them, 150 arrived in Gaza while 32 got off a bus in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, where they were greeted by large crowds. One freed prisoner will be exiled to Egypt, according to the Hamas prisoners media office. I feel joy despite the journey of pain and hardship that we lived, said Ali Al-Barghouti, who was serving two life sentences in an Israeli jail. The life sentence was broken and the occupation will one day be broken, added Barghouti, as the crowd around him in Ramallah chanted Allah Akbar (God is the most great). At the newly reopened Rafah crossing on the southern border, children suffering from cancer and heart conditions were among the first Palestinian patients to be allowed to leave Gaza for medical treatment in Egypt. Mohammad Zaqout, a senior official in Gazas health ministry, however, criticised the limited number of patients allowed to travel for treatment, saying that around 18,000 people needed better healthcare. In Israel, crowds gathered at the location in Tel Aviv known as Hostage Square to watch the release in the morning of the Israeli hostages on giant outdoor screens, mixing cheers and applause with tears as the three men appeared. Kalderon, whose two children Erez and Sahar were released in the first hostage exchange in November 2023, and Bibas both briefly mounted a stage in Khan Younis, in front of a poster of Hamas figures including Mohammad Deif, the former military commander whose death was confirmed by Hamas this week, before being handed over to the Red Cross officials. Ofer Kalderon is free! We share the immense relief and joy of his loved ones after 483 days of unimaginable hell, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. Saturdays handover saw none of the chaotic scenes that overshadowed an earlier transfer on Thursday, when Hamas guards struggled to shield hostages from a surging crowd in Gaza. But it was once again an occasion for a show of force by uniformed Hamas fighters who paraded in the area where the handovers took place in a sign of their re-established dominance in Gaza despite the heavy losses suffered in the war. NEGOTIATIONS ON RELEASE OF REMAINING HOSTAGES The total number of hostages freed so far is 18, including five Thais who were part of an unscheduled release on Thursday. After Saturdays exchange, Israel will have released 583 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks as well as some detained during the war but not charged. As the fighting has abated, diplomatic efforts to build a wider settlement have stepped up. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday with the ceasefire in Gaza, and a possible normalisation of relations with Saudi Arabia as part of a postwar deal likely to be a focus. During the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 children, women and older male hostages as well as sick and injured, were due to be released, with more than 60 men of military age left for a second phase which must still be worked out. Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of the remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal, which is intended to lead to a final end of the war in Gaza. The initial six-week truce, agreed with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, has mostly remained intact despite incidents that have led both sides to accuse the other of violating the deal. Netanyahus government, which has hardliners who opposed the ceasefire deal, and Hamas say they are committed to reaching an agreement in the second phase. But prospects for a durable settlement remain unclear. The war started with a Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, and saw more than 250 taken as hostages. The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians. Gaza is in ruins and a deep legacy of bitterness and mistrust remains. Israeli leaders continue to insist that Hamas cannot remain in Gaza, but the movement has taken every opportunity to demonstrate the control it continues to exert despite the loss of much of its former leadership and thousands of fighters during the war.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should return his current residence to the government, assuring that a suitable house will be provided for him if necessary. Speaking at a public meeting in Galgamuwa, President Dissanayake emphasized that he will not allow Rajapaksa to retain the current residence under any circumstances. Commenting on the recent lifting of vehicle import restrictions, the President said: Vehicles have not been imported into this country for many years. Permission has been granted to import vehicles for personal use from today. However, this is a difficult and cautious task. If everyone rushes to import vehicles in February, the demand for dollars will surge. Therefore, we are releasing vehicles cautiously. He further explained that vehicle prices have risen due to the increase in the dollar value and newly imposed taxes. If demand spikes all at once, a crisis will be created. Initially, prices will rise, but we expect a reduction over time. These are the significant changes we are making in the economy. President Dissanayake highlighted the governments efforts to curb wasteful spending, including cutting his own budget by 50. People asked us to stop politicians theft and waste. We did it. How much waste did we stop? My budget has been slashed by 50. I will save that amount this year. We will not waste public funds. Referring to Rajapaksas official residence, the President criticized its massive size and the expenses incurred on renovations. We told former presidents to make sacrifices. We said the house you live in is too big30,500 square feetlike a vast field. Isnt it empty for just two people? Rs. 470 million was spent on renovations in the past. We said its too large, too expensive. Now they claim we are trying to throw them out and take revenge. This is not revengedont waste public money. Reiterating his stance, President Dissanayake urged Rajapaksa to return the residence. So we say, please give back the house. If you dont have a place to live, we will provide you with one. During his entire presidency, the salary was deposited into the bank account for 10 years and was not withdrawn. The personal secretary who was there managed expenses with that salary. Even his son did not take the salary that was credited to the bank account. The salary is forgotten. Imagine the wealth they have. And now they say they dont have a house to live in? I will give you one if you dont have a place. But I wont let you keep the current residence, he added.",

        "date": "February 1, 2025 09:57 pm",
        "content": "An attack on an open market in the Sudanese city of Omdurman by a paramilitary group killed 54 people and wounded at least 158, health authorities said Saturday. The attack by the Rapid Support Forces on the Sabrein Market was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the escalated civil war that has wrecked the northeastern African country. There was no immediate comment from the RSF, which has been battling the military since April 2023. Khalid al-Aleisir, minister of culture and government spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying that the casualties included many women and children. He said the attack caused widespread destruction. This criminal act adds to the bloody record of this militia, he said in a statement. It constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. Sudans Doctors Syndicate said one mortar shell hit meters (yards) away from Al-Naw Hospital, which received most of the market casualties. It said most of the bodies were of women and children, adding that the hospital has a significant shortage of medical teams, especially surgeons and nurses. A video posted on social media by correspondent Nezar Bogdawi from Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV showed multiple body bags numbered and placed next to each other outside the hospital. The wounded being treated, some on the hospital floor, included a man with a chest wound, another with a leg injury, and a man with a head wound. Last week, about 70 people were killed in a RSF attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in the western region of Darfur. The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, has forced millions to flee their homes and has left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The U.S. has accused the RSF and its proxies of committing genocide in the war. In recent months the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capitals sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces. The military also regained control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and the countrys largest oil refinery. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka has raised concerns over a rise in HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among Sri Lankas youth, attributing the trend largely to improper social media use. Speaking at a media briefing held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Auditorium in Colombo, Specialist Dr. Vindya Kumarappelli emphasized that individuals aged 15 to 24 are particularly at risk. Young people are the most affected when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. The 15 to 24 age group faces the highest risk, Dr. Kumarappelli stated. A major contributing factor is the use of social media, where many young people connect with partners through various platforms, including dating apps. In some cases, this has led to risky behaviors such as substance abuse, which further increases the likelihood of STDs, HIV transmission, and unprotected pregnancies, she added.",
