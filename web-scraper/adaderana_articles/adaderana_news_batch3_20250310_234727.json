        "title": "Three survivors pulled alive from rubble in Turkey, more than 248 hours after earthquake",
        "date": "February 17, 2023 02:31 pm",
        "content": "(CNN) - At least three more people, including two minors, have been incredibly pulled alive from the rubble of a devastating earthquake, 10 days after it struck parts of Turkey and Syria. A 17-year-old Aleyna Ölmez was dubbed the miracle girl when she was pulled alive from the rubble in Turkey on Thursday, 248 hours after the Feb. 6 quake, as rescue efforts shift to recovery operations ten days on from the disaster. Her rescue was later followed by that of Neslihan Kilic, 30, and a 12-year-old boy named Osman, who told rescuers that there were more people buried nearby. At least 43,885 people have died across Turkey and neighboring Syria following the powerful 7.8 magnitude quake, according to authorities. Efforts to retrieve survivors have been hampered by a cold winter spell across quake-stricken regions, while authorities grapple with the logistical challenges of transporting aid into northwestern Syria amid an acute humanitarian crisis compounded by years of political strife. Amid recriminations in Turkey over the scale of damage, at least 54 people have been arrested in the country in connection with buildings that were destroyed or damaged from the earthquake, according to Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ on Thursday. Earlier Thursday, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres announced an appeal for 1 billion in aid towards earthquake relief efforts in Turkey over the course of three months. It came two days after the UN launched a flash appeal for 397 million in earthquake aid for Syria, also covering a three-month period as humanitarian bodies stress the need for psychological and mental health services in the affected regions. Turkeys state news channel TRT Haber crew visited teenager Aleyna Ölmez in the hospital room after the rescue operation and talked to her and her doctors and family members. Speaking from her hospital bed, TRT Haber cameras showed Aleynas eyes open, her body covered up to her neck, and tubes inserted for oxygen supplements. Alyena was taken directly to Kahramanmaraş Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Medicine after the rescue operation on Thursday. A video showed Aleynas aunt and grandmother next to her bedside, touching her face and kissing her hands. When the TRT Haber correspondent reached out to Aleyna with a microphone asking how she was doing, Aleyna shook her head and smiled. Aleynas doctor Prof. Dilber said he was very surprised by Aleynas good health condition and told TRT Haber: She couldnt eat anything and drank nothing the whole time (when she was under the rubble), but she was still in a good condition. Dr. Dilber added that since she couldnt move under the rubble at all, we could say that her inactivity has protected Aleyna a little and she needed energy and she has endured during this time, but I guess we cant explain it that way. The moment Aleyna was brought into the hospital, she was conscious and talking to the doctors. We have made the necessary interventions. Body imaging was done, and blood tests were taken. She was in a very good condition, Dr. Dilber told TRT Haber. There was no hypothermia. Blood tests also showed very good kidney functions. Muscle enzymes werent too high. Fluid therapy started immediately. After the fluid therapy, Aleyna still spoke to us very well, he added. Hacer Atlas, a member of the search and rescue team who saved the young quake victim told Turkeys state-run news agency Anadolu that they were able to reach Aleyna after long and tiring efforts. First we held her hand, then we took her out. She is in very good condition, and she can communicate. I hope we will continue to receive good news about her, Atlas said about the moment when they found Aleyna. TRT Haber reported later that Aleyna was brought to the Turkish capital of Ankara by plane. Kilic, the 30-year-old woman who was rescued on Thursday, 258 hours after the quake, was also found in Kahramanmaras, where she and her family used to live on the seventh floor of the Ebrar apartment complex, according to her brother-in-law Gazi Yildirim. Yildirim told CNN Turk that her husband and two children  two and five years old  were still under the rubble. Despite the violence of the earthquake and the long wait to be rescued, Kilic was able to talk and tell rescuers her name when they pulled her out of the rubble, he said. Yildirim started crying when he told the CNN Turk reporter that they had already prepared Kilics grave. May Allah save others. She has two children and a husband who is still under the rubble, Yildirim said. Hours later, a 12-year-old boy named Osman was also rescued in southern Hatay province. According to CNN Turk, Osman too appeared to be in relatively good condition, and was found in a sitting position in a hole surrounded by the beams and rubble. He was taken to a hospital for medical check-up. Osman told the rescue team that there was another person in the same location. Police searched the area with guide dogs after Osman was rescued and they intensified their operations looking for the second person. The three join a small group of quake survivors who have defied predictions that the time for survival had passed earlier this week. On Tuesday, a 77-year-old woman was pulled alive from the rubble in the city of Adiyaman some 212 hours after the earthquake struck, Anadolu reported. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana has informed the National Election Commission of the difficulties in funding the 2023 Local Government polls. The election body says that the Treasury Secretary has cited the current adverse financial situation and the administrative decision taken by the government to allocate funds only for essential services as the reasons for the inability to release the funds required for the election. The Treasury Secretary conveyed this to the election bodys chairman, Nimal G. Punchihewa during a meeting held today (Feb 17) between the Election Commission and Finance Ministry officials on funding the upcoming LG polls. Earlier this month, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policy, instructed the Treasury Secretary to provide funds only for essential public services. Accordingly, the list of expenditures to be funded includes salaries, debt servicing, pensions, medical supplies for hospitals, subsidies for low-income groups, scholarships, farmers pensions, school nutrition programs, payments for war heroes and disabled soldiers, utility payments, food supplies for hospitals and prisons, and others. The government stated that this move is expected to have a significant impact on the economy, as it will prioritize the most important needs of the people while also preventing the misuse of funds. Finance Ministry officials, during todays meeting, have pointed out that the permission of President Wickremesinghe, needs to be obtained in order to release funds to public institutions that are not listed under the essential services category.",

        "date": "February 17, 2023 05:16 pm",
        "content": "Permission has been given to import eggs to Sri Lanka, however, these stocks will only be available for the bakery industry, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says. His remarks came during a discussion held at the Agriculture Ministry on Thursday (Feb 16) during which the focus fell on importing eggs and the measures that need to be taken for livestock development. Amaraweera stresses that imported eggs will not be sold at stores for general consumption. According to him, the decision was taken as a preventive measure in a bid to avert bird flu from entering the country. Further, Amaraweera has given directives to the ministerial officials to expeditiously prepare a series of guidelines on how imported eggs should be used in the bakery industry. He has put emphasis on using gloves when handling imported eggs in the bakery industry and safely discarding eggshells and ensuring that the remaining eggshells are not released to the environment under any circumstances. The government decided to import eggs in a bid to address the recent shortage of eggs in the market and to bring down the soaring prices. However, the Department of Animal Production  Health initially refused to allow egg imports from certain countries including India, citing the risks of the spread of bird flu. Taking into account the shortage and need of eggs in the country, the Animal Production and Health Department has given permission to temporarily import eggs.",

        "title": "Spain approves menstrual leave, teen abortion and trans laws",
        "date": "February 17, 2023 08:19 pm",
        "content": "The Spanish parliament on Thursday approved legislation expanding abortion and transgender rights for teenagers, while making Spain the first country in Europe that will entitle workers to paid menstrual leave. The driving force behind the two laws was Equality Minister Irene Montero, who belongs to the junior member in Spains left-wing coalition government, the United We Can Party. The changes to sexual and reproductive rights mean that 16- and 17-year-olds in Spain can now undergo an abortion without parental consent. Period products will now be offered free in schools and prisons, while state-run health centers will do the same with hormonal contraceptives and the morning-after pill. The menstrual leave measure allows workers suffering debilitating period pain to take paid time off. In addition, the changes enshrine in law the right to have an abortion in a state hospital. Currently, more than 80 of termination procedures in Spain are carried out in private clinics due to a high number of doctors in the public system who refuse to perform them  with many citing religious reasons. Under the new system, state hospital doctors wont be forced to carry out abortions, provided theyve already registered their objections in writing. The abortion law builds on legislation passed in 2010 that represented a major shift for a traditionally Catholic country, transforming Spain into one of the most progressive countries in Europe on reproductive rights. Spains constitutional court last week rejected a challenge by the right-wing Popular Party against allowing abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. A separate package of reforms also approved by lawmakers on Thursday strengthened transgender rights, including allowing any citizen over 16 years old to change their legally registered gender without medical supervision. Minors between 12-13 years old will need a judges authorization to change, while those between 14 and 16 must be accompanied by their parents or legal guardians. Previously, transgender people needed a diagnosis by several doctors of gender dysphoria. The second law also bans so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ people and provides state support for lesbians and single women seeking IVF treatment. The center-left coalition government is currently under fire for another of Monteros star projects, a new sexual consent law that was intended to increase protection against rape but has inadvertently allowed hundreds of sex offenders to have prison sentences reduced. The Only Yes Means Yes Law makes verbal consent the key component in cases of alleged sexual assault. The government is now struggling to come up with an amended version and end the controversy ahead of elections later this year. The three initiatives have met strong opposition from the right-wing parties that form Spains main opposition bloc. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "February 17, 2023 11:10 pm",
        "content": "A special delegation from Israel visiting Sri Lanka has assured the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara, that their country will offer 2000 job opportunities for female caregivers from Sri Lanka, this year. The delegation comprising Shiely Raisin Sason, director of Israels Population and Migration Institute and members Zindani Mary, Yaccow Kabilau, Margarita Gaorodnitsky among others met Minister Manusha Nanayakkara today. The minister, during the meeting, requested the delegation to provide more job opportunities to caregivers from Sri Lanka and in response, the delegation assured the Minister that their country would recruit 2000 female caregivers from Sri Lanka this year. The delegation pointed out that according to the existing culture in Israel, women have more opportunities for patient care, and the number of opportunities for male caregivers is very limited, and accordingly, the delegation also requested the Minister to give priority to females when providing training in the caregiver sector in the future. The delegation also pointed out the importance of accelerating the recruitment process for caregiver jobs. Accordingly, the Minister assured the delegation that only those who meet the relevant qualifications will be recruited for training. Here, the Israeli delegation informed the minister that Sri Lankan workers with English language proficiency, who have received professional training, will always get the opportunity for Israeli employment opportunities. The delegation said their country is ready to give opportunities up to 8000 qualified workers on an annual basis. Both parties pointed out the importance of recruiting workers through a transparent process. The minister pointed out that some private recruiters are acting like a mafia in the process of recruiting caregivers to work in Israel. The minister also clarified the facts about the allegations against some Sri Lankans in Israel regarding the recruitment process. The Minister also mentioned that there are allegations that some people are taking money for providing Israeli jobs. The Minister also presented to the Israeli representatives the requests to open up the opportunities to hire caregivers for jobs in Israel by the private sector as well. Responding the delegation said that the process of recruiting caregivers should be carried out only with the intervention of the Foreign Employment Bureau. The delegation from the Population and Migration Institution of Israel requested that any information regarding people who are taking money to provide caregiver jobs in Israel should be given to them to take necessary action. They also assured that the security and confidentiality of the persons giving such information will be fully protected. The delegation also assured that maximum action would be taken according to Israeli law against people who take money through the recruitment process. The minister also mentioned that the safety of workers who leave for work abroad is always a high priority and added that there have been no allegations of harassment of workers who have left for work in Israel. The minister expressed his thanks to Israel in that regard. In this discussion, the minister also asked the Israeli delegation that since there are many trained professionals in the country for jobs in the agricultural sector, it would be better if they were given an opportunity for that as well. Here, the Israeli delegation stated that they are not able to open jobs in the agricultural sector at this time, and that necessary steps will be taken in the future.",

        "title": "IMF said to discuss Sri Lanka loan approval even as China stalls",
        "date": "February 17, 2023 11:23 pm",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) - The International Monetary Fund is considering approving Sri Lankas bailout even without the formal assurance of debt-restructuring support from China, the nations biggest bilateral creditor, according to people familiar with the discussions. Under a rarely used policy on lending into official arrears, the IMF may consider approving Sri Lankas loan because Chinas assurance is the only prerequisite missing, according to the people who declined to be identified because the information isnt public. This provision is aimed at preventing a creditor from blocking assistance to a country in dire need of financing and has shown commitment to meet loan conditions. An IMF spokesperson said that its premature to discuss the precise IMF policies that could be applied to lending to Sri Lanka, and that the nations authorities continue to seek financing assurances so that the funds executive board can consider their request for a loan. IMF staff also continue to engage with the Sri Lankan authorities who are working on completing upfront policy measures, the spokesperson said. IMF Policy The IMF can use the policy on lending into official arrears if it deems prompt financial support is essential and sees the country pursuing appropriate policies and making good-faith efforts to reach an agreement with creditors, according to an explanation on the funds website. Moving forward with loan approval would be a shift from its position earlier this month, when it said the approval of Sri Lankas 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility will depend on whether the nation can secure assurances from all bilateral creditors. The development comes as World Bank President David Malpass said Thursday that long extensions of debt are among the options that G-20 nations and others are considering to help ease the burden for poor countries. The IMF, World Bank and Group of 20 nations chair India separately held virtual discussions Friday on global sovereign debt ahead of the finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Bangalore next week. Sri Lanka and Pakistan count on IMF loans to provide immediate relief by shoring up their foreign-currency reserves and unlocking more funding. Pending Chinas creditor assurance, Sri Lanka is trying to meet other reform conditions set by the IMF, including increasing electricity tariffs and clearing a new monetary law for parliament approval. The government may also loosen its grip on a currency band to meet the funds requirements. The Paris Club  an informal group of rich, mostly western creditors  and India have provided formal support to Sri Lankas loan recast, leaving China as a holdout. China, which accounts for about 52 of the bankrupt nations bilateral debt, has instead offered term extensions via the state-owned Export-Import Bank. Debt negotiations have dragged since Sri Lanka defaulted in May, causing severe supply shortage, depleting its foreign-currency reserves, sending inflation and borrowing costs soaring and pushing the economy into a recession. While the nation has repurposed some funds to ease the shortage and damp price pressures, it would need IMFs bailout and other funding to turn the situation around. Source: Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "title": "China declares decisive victory over COVID-19",
        "date": "February 18, 2023 08:10 am",
        "content": "Chinas top leaders declared a decisive victory over COVID-19, claiming the worlds lowest fatality rate, although experts have questioned Beijings data as the coronovirus tore across the country after largely being kept at bay for three years. China abruptly ended its zero-COVID policy in early December, with 80 of its 1.4 billion population becoming infected, a prominent government scientist said last month. Though there were widespread reports of packed hospital wards and mortuaries, China recorded only about 80,000 COVID deaths in hospitals in the two months after dropping its curbs. Some experts say the actual toll was far higher, as many patients die at home and doctors were widely reported to have been discouraged from reporting COVID as a cause of death. With continuous efforts to optimise COVID-19 prevention and control measures since November 2022, Chinas COVID-19 response has made a smooth transition in a relatively short time, Chinas Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) said in a meeting on Thursday. A major decisive victory in epidemic prevention and control has been achieved, it said, adding that Chinas efforts led to more than 200 million people getting medical treatment, including nearly 800,000 severe cases. However, leaders cautioned that while the situation is improving, the virus is still spreading globally and continues to mutate, according to state media. The meeting stressed that China will increase the vaccination rate for the elderly, and strengthen the supply and production of medical goods. The PSC, Chinas most powerful leadership body, urged all localities and departments to strengthen the medical service system, according to the report from the official Xinhua news agency. The statement did not say how many had died from COVID, and comes weeks before China holds its annual parliamentary session and as policymakers look to revive an economy battered by three years of COVID restrictions. In December, China suddenly dismantled President Xi Jinpings signature zero-COVID policy following historic protests, unleashing the coronavirus across a population that had been largely shielded from the disease since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. Many countries and the World Health Organization have speculated China was underreporting deaths for months, with some experts predicting earlier that COVID could lead to at least one million deaths in the country this year. Despite fears that the massive migration of travellers during the Lunar New Year would lead to an explosion of cases, the government recently said the COVID situation was at a low level after the holidays.

        "content": "The Election Commission has decided to file a special motion before the Supreme Court detailing the difficulties it is facing during the preparations for the 2023 Local Government Election on March 09. Chairman of the election body, Attorney-at-Law Nimal G. Punchihewa says inadequate funds, inadequate supply of fuel for transportation, the delays in ballot paper printing by the Government Printer and several other issues stand in the way of LG election preparations. Punchihewa also noted that adequate security measures are not in place for the Department of Government Printing to ensure that ballot paper printing work is carried out smoothly. The Election Commission, recalling the recent undertaking it gave before the Supreme Court to hold the Local Government Election on March 09 as scheduled, said it expects to brief the top court about not being able to uphold its pledge. On Friday (Feb 17), Punchihewa disclosed that the Treasury Secretary has informed the Election Commission that funding the Local Government Election at the moment is challenging. Meanwhile, Government Printer Gangani Liyanage mentioned that the printing work for the Local Government Election continues to face hindrances without adequate security measures. Against this backdrop, the Election Commission was compelled to indefinitely postpone the postal voting of the Local Government Election, which was scheduled to be held on February 22, 23, 24 and 28. Several protests were also staged in many parts of the country against the governments attempts to defer the election.",

        "content": "At least four people were killed and 14 were injured after militants stormed the police headquarters in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, according to officials. Militants attacked the police station with hand grenades and shots were fired, an eyewitness told CNN. Pakistans Taliban, known as Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack, according to spokesman Mohammad Khorasani. Two policemen, two rangers and one civilian were killed in the attack, according to Murtaza Wahab Siddiqui, a senior leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, the ruling party in Sindh province where Karachi is located. Of the 14 injured, one is in critical condition, he added. The siege was brought to an end on Friday, and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah later said the three militants responsible for the attack were killed. Three attackers were behind the attack on the Karachi Police office. All three are now dead. The police force, rangers and army helped in resolving this situation. I commend them for their bravery, he said in a video statement. During the attack, multiple shots could be heard ringing through the area where the headquarters is located, according to footage from the scene, and eyewitnesses described hearing multiple explosions. The attack prompted the Sindh provincial government to declare a state of emergency in Karachi, according to its spokesperson, Sharjeel Memon. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned the attack. Terrorists may have forgotten that Pakistan is the nation which defeated terrorism with its bravery and courage, he tweeted. Pakistans Taliban have been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department since September 2010. Pakistani authorities have yet to confirm any groups involvement. Rescue teams have reached the site of the attack, according to video released by Chhipa Ambulance Service, in which gunfire could be heard. Source: CNN -Agencies",

He affirmed that all government decisions would be based on these priorities. In his address, President Wickremesinghe stated that democracy depends on the maintenance of public order which requires law and order.

The President lauded the Rotary District 3220 for its invaluable assistance during past crises, such as the anti-polio campaign, tsunami, and medicine shortages. He also stated that following the countrys economic recovery, next year it would be in a position to decide on the future it wants, with the use of the ballot.

        "date": "February 18, 2023 07:19 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed its deep concern about the recent attempts by state authorities to disrupt the Local Government Elections, scheduled to be held on March 09. In a press release, the BASL stressed that elections must not be hindered as they are a vital part of Sri Lankas democratic process. The association said it is of the view that attempts to interfere with the electoral process must not only be defeated but all those responsible for such interference must be dealt with in accordance with the law. Calling on the government and all state officials to respect the Constitution and the law, and to ensure that the Local Government Elections are as scheduled without any further attempts to disrupt or interfere with the process, the BASL noted that it is the sacred duty of the government to make sure that funds are provided for conducting the elections. Recalling several decisions taken by the government in recent weeks, purportedly aimed at managing public funds, have had the effect of preventing the Election Commission from conducting the polls, the BASL said these include a demand by the Government Printer for the release of funds prior to the printing of ballot papers and the Treasury Secretary claiming that there are no funds available for the elections. This is despite a budget allocation of Rs. 10 billion for the purpose of elections. The association, calling the conduct of the Treasury Secretary, the Government Printer and other government officials and institutions over the last few weeks a clear demonstration of a concerted effort to bring the elections to a halt, the BASL said this undermines the franchise of the people and endangers the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka. Such attempts to prevent elections mandated by the law represent an unprecedented attack on democracy and the rule of law and pose a grave threat to the electoral process in the future. The BASL warned that such actions could set a dangerous precedent for an unpopular executive or legislature to obstruct the allocation of resources for an election and prevent the people of Sri Lanka from choosing their representatives and leaders. The BASL also pointed out that Articles 104 B (2) and 104 GG (1) of the Constitution make it clear that all state authorities are duty-bound to cooperate with the Elections Commission and that refusing or failing to do so is a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment. In terms of Article 33 (c) of the Constitution, the President, too, is empowered to ensure the creation of proper conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections, at the request of the Election Commission.",

        "content": "The historic Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy will host a Janaraja Perahera today (Feb 19), after a gap of 34 years. The procession, organized to coincide with the 75th independence celebration, will be inaugurated under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. According to the Coordinating Officer and the Cultural Officer of the Temple of the Tooth Relic, the procession will begin from the Magul Maduwa premises at 6.30 p.m. today. It will parade Dalada Street, Yatinuwara Street, Kanda Street, Raja Street, and return to the temple, marking the end of the event. The organizers have made preparations to make the Janaraja Perahera colourful, with cultural performances, including dancing troops, and caparisoned elephants, similar to the annual Esala Perahara. However, unlike the Kandy Esala Perahara, the Dalada Karandwa (the casket containing the sacred relics) will not be carried on a tusker at the Janaraja Perahera. Instead, the national emblem of Sri Lanka will be carried, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) mentioned. The Janaraja Perahera aims to promote the tourism industry, according to the PMD. The Janaraja Perahera was first organized in 1875 to celebrate the arrival of the Duke of Wales, the son of Queen Victoria, to Ceylon. The procession was also held in 1954 when Queen Elizabeth II, the then-Head of State of Sri Lanka, visited the country. The Queen watched the Janaraja Perahera from the Patthirippuwa. In 1981, a similar procession was held, and Queen Elizabeth II watched the procession from a special platform built in the Maha Maluwa, the main courtyard. The Temple of the Tooth Relic only organizes special processions like the Janaraja Perahera at the request of the government on significant occasions in the country. The last time the Janaraja Perahera was held was in 1987 by the then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. Meanwhile, a special traffic arrangement is in place in Kandy this evening in view of the Janaraja Perahera. As per this traffic plan, implemented from 5.00 p.m. tomorrow until the end of the procession, traffic will be diverted away from Dalada Street, Yatinuwara Street, Raja Street and Kanda Street.

        "date": "February 19, 2023 10:58 am",
        "content": "North Korea on Saturday fired a long-range missile from its capital into the sea off Japan, according to its neighbors, a day after it threatened to take strong measures against South Korea and the U.S. over their joint military exercises. According to the South Korean and Japanese militaries, the missile was fired on a high angle, apparently to avoid reaching the neighbors territories, and traveled about 900 kilometers (560 miles) at a maximum altitude of 5,700 kilometers (3,500 miles) during an hourlong flight. The details were similar to North Koreas Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile test flight in November, which experts said demonstrated potential to reach the U.S. mainland if fired on a normal trajectory. Japanese government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said no damage was reported from the missile, which landed within Japans exclusive economic zone, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Oshima island. Oshima lies off the western coast of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido. North Koreas Foreign Ministry on Friday threatened with unprecedently strong action against its rivals, after South Korea announced a series of military exercises with the United States aimed at sharpening their response to the Norths growing threats. While the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory, or its allies, the White House National Security Council said it needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region. It only demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people, it said, calling it a flagrant violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said his national security director, Kim Sung-han, presided over an emergency security meeting that accused the North of escalating regional tensions. It denounced North Korea for accelerating its nuclear arms development despite signs of worsening economic problems and food insecurity, saying such actions would bring only tougher international sanctions. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul over the launch, which he called an act of violence that escalates provocation toward the international order. The launch was North Koreas first since Jan. 1, when it test-fired a short-range weapon. It followed a massive military parade in Pyongyang last week, where troops rolled out more than a dozen ICBMs as leader Kim Jong Un watched in delight from a balcony. The unprecedented number of missiles underscored a continuation of expansion of his countrys military capabilities despite limited resources while negotiations with Washington remain stalemated. Those missiles included a new system experts say is possibly linked to the Norths stated desire to acquire a solid-fuel ICBM. North Koreas existing ICBMs, including Hwasong-17s, use liquid propellants that require pre-launch injections and cannot remain fueled for prolonged periods. A solid-fuel alternative would take less time to prepare and is easier to move around on vehicles, providing less opportunity to be spotted. It wasnt immediately clear whether Saturdays launch involved a solid-fuel system. North Korean missile firings are often tests of technologies under development, and it will be notable if Pyongyang claims progress with a long-range solid-fuel missile, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. The Kim regime may also tout this launch as a response to U.S. defense cooperation with South Korea and sanctions diplomacy at the United Nations. North Korea is coming off a record year in weapons demonstrations with more than 70 ballistic missiles fired, including those with potential to reach the U.S. mainland. The North also conducted a slew of launches it described as simulated nuclear attacks against South Korean and U.S. targets in response to the allies resumption of large-scale joint military exercise that had been downsized for years. North Koreas missile tests have been punctuated by threats of preemptive nuclear attacks against South Korea or the United States over what it perceives as a broad range of scenarios that put its leadership under threat. Kim doubled down on his nuclear push entering 2023, calling for an exponential increase in the countrys nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting enemy South Korea and the development of more advanced ICBMs. The North Korean statement on Friday accused Washington and Seoul of planning more than 20 rounds of military drills this year, including large-scale field exercises, and described its rivals as the arch-criminals deliberately disrupting regional peace and stability. South Koreas Defense Ministry officials told lawmakers earlier that Seoul and Washington will hold an annual computer-simulated combined training in mid-March. The 11-day training will reflect North Koreas nuclear threats, as well as unspecified lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Heo Tae-keun, South Koreas deputy minister of national defense policy. Heo said the countries will also conduct joint field exercises in mid-March that would be bigger than those held in the past few years. South Korea and the U.S. will also hold a one-day tabletop exercise next week at the Pentagon to sharpen a response to a potential use of nuclear weapons by North Korea. North Korea has traditionally described U.S.-South Korea military exercises as rehearsals for a potential invasion, while the allies insist that their drills are defensive in nature. The United States and South Korea had downsized or canceled some of their major drills in recent years, first to support the former Trump administrations diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang and then because of COVID-19. But North Koreas growing nuclear threats have raised the urgency for South Korea and Japan to strengthen their defense postures in line with their alliances with the United States. South Korea has been seeking reassurances that United States will swiftly and decisively use its nuclear capabilities to protect its ally in face of a North Korean nuclear attack. In expanding its military exercises with South Korea, the United States has also expressed commitment to increase its deployment of strategic military assets like fighter jets and aircraft carriers to the Korean Peninsula in a show of strength. In December, Japan made a major break from its strictly self-defense-only post-World War II principle, adopting a new national security strategy that includes preemptive strikes and cruise missiles to counter growing threats from North Korea, China and Russia.

        "date": "February 19, 2023 12:09 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand climbed to 11 on Sunday as thousands of people remained missing a week after the storm struck the countrys North Island. The cyclone hit the islands northernmost region on Feb. 12 and tracked down the east coast, inflicting widespread devastation. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has called Gabrielle New Zealands biggest natural disaster this century. On Sunday, police said two more people had died in hard-hit Hawkes Bay in circumstances related to the cyclone. More fatalities are possible, Hipkins told reporters in the capital Wellington, as 6,431 people remained missing, while 3,216 had been reported safe. Lives had been turned upside down by the disaster and recovery was a steep mountain ahead, he said, pointing to disrupted telecommunications, shortages of fresh water and damaged roads still restricting access to some areas. Supply chains were disrupted causing problems moving goods, many crops had been destroyed, and 28,000 homes were still without power, he said. The true extent of the devastation and loss become clearer with every passing day, the prime minister said. A team from Fiji would leave for New Zealand in coming days to assist with recovery, one of 12 offers of international aid received so far, Hipkins said. Twenty-seven emergency workers from Australia are assisting with the relief effort. Recovery efforts continued on Sunday, with teams from Auckland Council carrying out rapid building assessments on damaged homes in the coastal areas of Muriwai and Piha, about 60 km (40 miles) west of the nations largest city, Auckland. Emergency authorities and the military have been dropping critical supplies via helicopter to communities stranded since the cyclone, which washed away farms, bridges and livestock and inundated homes. Police have sent an extra 100 officers to Hawkes Bay and nearby Tairawhiti, including to isolated areas, amid reports of looting. The police are working to maintain law and order, Hipkins said.

The NWSDB says it has to bear high costs for these activities due to the huge electricity tariff hike and as a result, the water tariffs will also be increased. However, the NWSDB also emphasized that no decision has been taken at the administrative level to increase the water tariffs.

        "title": "Roald Dahl books rewritten to remove language deemed offensive",
        "date": "February 19, 2023 03:38 pm",
        "content": "Roald Dahls childrens books are being rewritten to remove language deemed offensive by the publisher Puffin. Puffin has hired sensitivity readers to rewrite chunks of the authors text to make sure the books can continue to be enjoyed by all today, resulting in extensive changes across Dahls work. Edits have been made to descriptions of characters physical appearances. The word fat has been cut from every new edition of relevant books, while the word ugly has also been culled, the Daily Telegraph reported. Augustus Gloop in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is now described as enormous. In The Twits, Mrs Twit is no longer ugly and beastly but just beastly. Hundreds of changes were made to the original text  and some passages not written by Dahl have been added. But the Roald Dahl Story Company said its not unusual to review the language during a new print run and any changes were small and carefully considered. In The Witches, a paragraph explaining that witches are bald beneath their wigs ends with the new line: There are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. In previous editions of James and the Giant Peach, the Centipede sings: Aunt Sponge was terrifically fat  And tremendously flabby at that, and, Aunt Spiker was thin as a wire  And dry as a bone, only drier. Both verses have been removed, and in their place are the rhymes: Aunt Sponge was a nasty old brute  And deserved to be squashed by the fruit, and, Aunt Spiker was much of the same  And deserves half of the blame. References to female characters have disappeared. Miss Trunchbull in Matilda, once a most formidable female, is now a most formidable woman. Gender-neutral terms have been added in places  where Charlie and the Chocolate Factorys Oompa Loompas were small men, they are now small people. The Cloud-Men in James and the Giant Peach have become Cloud-People. Puffin and the Roald Dahl Story Company made the changes in conjunction with Inclusive Minds, which its spokesperson describes as a collective for people who are passionate about inclusion and accessibility in childrens literature. Alexandra Strick, a co-founder of Inclusive Minds, said they aim to ensure authentic representation, by working closely with the book world and with those who have lived experience of any facet of diversity. A notice from the publisher sits at the bottom of the copyright page of the latest editions of Dahls books: The wonderful words of Roald Dahl can transport you to different worlds and introduce you to the most marvellous characters. This book was written many years ago, and so we regularly review the language to ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today. A spokesperson for the Roald Dahl Story Company said: When publishing new print runs of books written years ago, its not unusual to review the language used alongside updating other details including a books cover and page layout. Our guiding principle throughout has been to maintain the storylines, characters, and the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text. Any changes made have been small and carefully considered. Source: The Guardian -Agencies",

The KDU says its Alumni Association, on the request and guidance of Vice Chancellor Major General Milinda Peiris, accomplished the noble endeavour of establishing the monument at the university premises in Ratmalana as a tribute to the war heroes for their immeasurable sacrifice. Over the last 41 years of its proud history, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) has produced a large number of tri-service officers of very high calibre, and they have extended an invaluable service to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. Among them were 109 KDU officers who sacrificed their lives, valiantly fighting against threats posed against the motherland, the KDU said in a statement. KDU Chancellor General (Retd.)

        "date": "February 19, 2023 05:35 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he has given his consent to several requests made by the Maha Nayaka Theras of the Malwatu and Asgiri Chapters, during a discussion held today (19) between the Sanga Committee members and the President at the Presidents House in Kandy. The President stated that he will urgently work to appoint a competent authority to the Pali and Buddhist University and to turn it into an International Centre of Buddhist Studies. This proposal made by the Sangha Committee members is essential and will definitely be implemented to raise the quality of Piriven education. During the discussion, the President also accepted the invitation by the Maha Nayaka Theras of the Malwatu and Asgiri Chapters to hold the 2023 Vesak festival under the governments sponsorship in a way that would bring about Buddhist revival in the country. The President also mentioned that all possible solutions would be provided for the issues of the Buddhist monks and the temples, which were discussed at length during the meeting. The President emphasized his commitment to creating economic stability in the country within the next year and a half. He stated that he will build an economy in the country that can provide relief to the people before the end of this year. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; In 2019, the governments tax revenue, which was 15 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, had decreased to 9 per cent. Therefore, the economy of this country was in a bad state. The International Monetary Fund informed us that our income has been lost. The International Monetary Fund also noted that if we expect other countries to give us money earned by taxing their people, we should also ensure that our countrys income is also increased. When I took office as President, the countrys inflation was rising and the rupee had collapsed. But at the beginning, we negotiated with the International Monetary Fund to find a solution. As a result, many of the problems that people faced back then have now been resolved. I requested to go to the International Monetary Fund even during Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksas regime. And I also intervened in that regard. Unfortunately, the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund were called off due to the incident of May 9th. Following that, President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa invited Mr. Sajith Premadasa to become Prime Minister and he had also invited other members of the opposition to attend. Only the United National Party and the Tamil National Alliance attended Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksas call for discussions to go to the International Monetary Fund by establishing political stability. Others did not participate in these discussions and did not accept the position of Prime Minister because they were aware of the countrys situation. Nevertheless, despite the peoples accusations, I accepted President Gotabhaya Rajapaksas request because I had a strong belief that the countrys economy could be improved. As a result, Im working hard to get the countrys economy back on track within the next year and a half. After that, well get into politics. However, everyone must contribute to this nation-building effort. We intend to prepare an economy that will be able to provide relief to the people by the months of May, June, and July of this year. Despite the difficulties, Sri Lanka has the potential to become an economically strong country with everyones help during this difficult period. Meanwhile, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President, Mr. Sagala Ratnayake stated, At a glance that we are attempting to forcefully implement an International Monetary Fund-imposed tax policy. However, what has actually occurred is a realignment of state revenue streams that were not completed at the appropriate time. People are suffering today as a result of having to implement all these at once. We would not be in this situation today if previous governments had implemented these policies. This is, in fact, a program that will kick-start massive economic development in Sri Lanka. It is not a difficult task to bring about the countrys economic development if the program is carried out properly. Most Ven.

        "content": "Twelve cheetahs have arrived in India as part of efforts to revive the species after decades of extinction in the country. The feline predators from South Africa were flown in on Saturday from Johannesburg, the Indian Air Force announced. The cheetahs will next be airlifted in helicopters from the India Air Force, and be released in their final destination, the Kuno National Park, in central Madhya Pradesh state. They will join eight cheetahs relocated from Namibia in September last year. The cheetahs are part of an initiative by India and South Africa to reintroduce the cheetah in India, according to a joint statement from Indias Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, South Africa. The initiative would expand the cheetah meta-population and reintroduce cheetahs to a former range state following their local extinction due to overhunting and loss of habitat in the last century, the statement said. Cheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, it added. The 12 cheetahs are all wild-born, according to the statement, and familiar with their natural predators. Other big cats and eagles are known to prey on cheetahs. In January, South Africas environmental department said there was a plan to further relocate 12 cheetahs annually for the next eight to 10 years. Cheetahs are found in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania, with less than 7,000 left in the wild, according to the World Wide Fund (WWF). But the animals used to live much more widely. Historically, cheetahs roamed throughout the Middle East and central India as well as most of sub-Saharan Africa. Habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans have greatly reduced their populations. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "February 19, 2023 07:09 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that discipline and commitment are required in order to take charge of a countrys future, and plans will be implemented from next year to take Sri Lanka to a new dimension through a disciplined society. The President stated that, while the people are currently experiencing economic difficulties, this should only be expected for a short time period, and that he will work to improve the countrys economy before year end. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated this while participating in the ceremony held today (Feb. 19) at Rantambe National Cadet Training Centre for the awarding of the Presidents Colours and Corps Colours to the National Cadet Corps, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Presidents and Corps Colours to the National Cadet Corps, which has a 142-year history. Following the presentation of the Presidents and Corps colours, the President also joined in observing the Cadet Corps parade, the PMD said. The President stated that a strong economy and a new society should be created in the country, and he expects the Cadet Corps to provide disciplined leadership for the new society that will be created for the countrys youth, according to the PMD. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: Today is a special day for you. We recognize the national value of the National Cadet Corps. The Presidents Colours and the Corps Colours were awarded to the National Cadet Corps in recognition of this achievement. This is a very old force. The Royal College established a cadet unit when the Sri Lankan Infantry was formed. The Cadet Corps that began since then, has a 142-year history. The military officers who emerged from it took part in the First World War. Officers from this Cadet Corps served in the subsequent World War II as well as the countrys internal wars. Also, the members of the Cadet Corps have also made significant contributions to the armed forces. We are here today to show our appreciation on behalf of those activities. The Cadet Corps evolved from the Ceylon Infantry to the Ceylon Defence Force and then to the Sri Lanka Army. As the then Minister of Education, I proposed to Parliament to name this force as the National Cadet Corps. And today I have the honour of presenting the Presidents and Corps Colours to the National Cadet Corps. The people needed for the countrys future are trained by this Cadet Corps. In addition to the Cadet Corps who joined the army, there are many people who have served in various sectors but are not in the army. Our Prime Minister, Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena, is the most prominent member of that group. I recall him attending those trainings in the evenings during the school days. Today, as we confer this presidential colour on you, it is our duty to express our appreciation to those who founded this Cadet Corps, as well as those who contributed to its success, and to the entire Cadet Corps. Today the Cadet Corps operates in many schools. I expressed the Defence State Minister and the Secretary of the Defence Ministry, that Cadet Corps should be established in every Central College. We must continue to develop this further. I believe that this will produce the disciplined citizens that this country needs. It is also the governments responsibility to ensure that the students in this Cadet Corps have a bright future. While the Minister of State is here, I suggest that the children in the cadet groups should be given a quota for training in government institutions. We must secure their future. We should be dedicated to provide training for you who move forward with discipline. Also we have focused on your future. I am well aware of the difficulties that you, your parents, and the people of the country are currently facing. Economically, we all have to bear a heavy burden. We have no other option. People are experiencing difficulties today, but this should be expected to last only a short period of time. This situation will not only change before the end of the year, but we will also need to build a new economy. We must build both a strong economy and a new society for the benefit of the countrys youth. To build such a new social system, a disciplined leadership is required. I am hopeful that the Cadet Corps will provide the required leadership. To take on the future requires discipline and commitment. It should be noted that we are committed to developing this cadet force with qualified personnel and improving everyones future. I offer my best wishes to everyone receiving the Presidents and Corps colours on this occasion of the National Cadet Corps, which has served this country for 142 years.

        "date": "February 19, 2023 07:31 pm",
        "content": "The Janaraja Perahera, organized to coincide with Sri Lankas 75th independence anniversary, kicked off this evening (Feb 19) under the aegis of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The historic Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy is hosting the Janaraja Perahera following a gap of 34 years. The procession commenced from the Magul Maduwa premises at 6.30 p.m. today and is parading Dalada Street, Yatinuwara Street, Kanda Street, and Raja Street before returning to the temple to mark the end of the event. The procession comprises cultural performances, including dancing troops, and caparisoned elephants, similar to that of the annual Esala Perahara. However, unlike the Kandy Esala Perahara, the Dalada Karandwa (the casket containing the sacred relics) is not e carried on a tusker at the Janaraja Perahera. Instead, the national emblem of Sri Lanka will be carried. The Presidents Media Division (PMD) noted that the Janaraja Perahera aims to promote the tourism industry. The Janaraja Perahera was first organized in 1875 to celebrate the arrival of the Duke of Wales, the son of Queen Victoria, to Ceylon. The procession was also held in 1954 when Queen Elizabeth II, the then-Head of State of Sri Lanka, visited the country. The Queen watched the Janaraja Perahera from the Patthirippuwa. In 1981, a similar procession was held, and Queen Elizabeth II watched the procession from a special platform built in the Maha Maluwa, the main courtyard. The Temple of the Tooth Relic only organizes special processions like the Janaraja Perahera at the request of the government on significant occasions in the country. The last time the Janaraja Perahera was held was in 1987 by the then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. Security in Kandy has been tightened while a special traffic arrangement is also in place from 5.00 p.m. until the end of Janaraja Perahera to divert the traffic away from Dalada Street, Yatinuwara Street, Raja Street and Kanda Street.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has met with a group of youth to discuss his policy statement and the governments plans for the countrys future on February 16. The group of young people expressed their views on the governments policies in a newspaper article and the President had invited them over for a follow-up discussion along with the two young journalists, Anoushka Jayasuriya and Shannon Salgadoe who had written the article. During the discussion, they had expressed what they expect from the government, and discussed a range of issues with the President, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. One of the major topics discussed was the shortcomings in the education sector, with the youth group highlighting the need for proper mental health education at the school level and a proper education mechanism for the inclusion of the differently abled. They asked, Will your government get some real mental health education in Sri Lanka, in schools especially? The President agreed that attention paid to mental health in schools was insufficient and acknowledged that much needs to be done with regard to those with mental health issues and those who are differently abled. He noted, however, that one of the main issues facing the country is the lack of trained personnel in this field, according to the PMD. The youth group also brought up the issue of taxes, adding that while taxes are not a novel concept in many other countries, it is not so in Sri Lanka. The President explained that the government budget can be examined by the Parliament to ensure they are adhering to it. He noted that there are many committees to examine the budget, such as the Committee on Public Enterprises, Committee on Public Accounts, and Public Finance Committee. He added that they are also bringing in the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill to strengthen the process further. They questioned, Transparency is a big question with the new taxes. People are feeling it because suddenly they are forced to pay a huge portion of their salary. The transparency is there because in a big budget we have line items. If you read it, you can never say what it is. Its in any budget, its the parliament that ensures the money is spent wisely, and it takes 2 to 3 years. So the parliament must exercise the powers now. Last time, I think the Opposition didnt fill their quota of Chairman in the oversight committees. So all that went by board, even this time for selection, they hadnt come to Parliament to the selection committee. But I think the remaining people just got some opposition names into it. So that is where the transparency comes in and nowhere else. You can ask them as to why you spend and all, the President explained. The President also discussed the countrys economic situation and the challenges the government faces, noting that Sri Lanka was in an abnormal economic situation and had to restructure debts to get out of it. He added that the government had to cut down on some expenditure and find money in other areas, such as raising the electricity tariff. The President acknowledged that it is not an easy job, but someone has to do it, it added. Sri Lanka was in a very abnormal economic situation, and we had to get out of it. But to get out of it, we have to restructure debts. To restructure the debts we had to cut down our expenditure or find money for it. In some areas we have cut down, but for other areas, we have to find money. Like yesterday we had to raise the electricity tariff, but then there is a Rs. 230 billion loss. So if you dont raise it, you wont have power. We are all paying for the past sins. This is how we get out of it fast and this is what we have to do. I dont think theres any other way out. Its not a job, that anyone would like to do, but someone has to do it. The youth group also raised the issue of individual accountability and suggested that parliamentarians should have some degree of education. The President agreed but noted that it will take some time for this to happen. He explained that many younger people either have a degree or business experience and it is up to the voters to choose the type of member they want to elect, said the PMD. When the individual accountability is concerned, the members of Parliament, well you have a system where you can give a preference. If you dont want any of them, you vote for the party and you can choose whom you want. However, its a very expensive procedure. So I want to appoint Committee to look into how we can have a better system of elections without spending all the money that we spend. In a parliamentary election, the bulk of the money is spent by the individual candidates, not by the parties. The youth also asked the President Why does everyone shout in parliament? Do you think they shout to avoid responding to questions posed to them? In response, the President said that it is done to get media attention and is not appropriate. He noted that he has seen similar behaviour in other countries and that it is not unique to Sri Lanka. That is bad. Now its done to get media attention. There are people when they argue, may shout at each other. But, not like this, they just keep shouting. Now, its bad and setting a bad example to the country. There is a price. When we look at the UK, it is not so. There are times when people cheer but this is just being done. I think we have to bring some control over it, he added. Overall, the meeting was an opportunity for the President to hear the views of the youth and discuss the governments plans for the future. The youth group expressed their concerns and ideas, and the President listened and responded to their questions and comments, the PMD said.",

        "content": "New Zealand kept their Womens T20 World Cup hopes alive with a 102-run rout of Sri Lanka at Boland Park in Paarl on Sunday. Suzie Bates and Amelia Kerr hit half-centuries as the White Ferns scored 162 for three on a slow pitch. Sri Lanka could only manage 60 in reply. New Zealand moved into second place in Group One behind defending champions Australia, but could still be overtaken by hosts South Africa, who play Bangladesh on Tuesday. Sri Lanka, who won their first two matches, finished the group stage level on points with New Zealand but were eliminated on net run rate. Ms. Bates followed up her unbeaten 81 against Bangladesh on Friday with 56, while Ms. Kerr hit 66. Bernadine Bezuidenhout set the tone for New Zealand, hitting 32 off 20 balls in an opening partnership of 46 in 5.4 overs with Ms. Bates. Ms. Kerr joined Bates and the pair added 110 for the second wicket before Bates was stumped in the last over. Ms. Kerr was run out off the penultimate ball of the innings. The New Zealand batters went for their shots and ran hard between wickets. It was a performance that was in stark contrast to an earlier match on the same pitch when neither West Indies nor Pakistan could achieve a scoring rate of a run a ball. Sri Lanka wilted under the pressure. Bezuidenhout and Bates were both dropped and there were numerous misfields. Set to score more than eight runs an over, Sri Lankas chances evaporated rapidly. They lost three wickets in the six-over powerplay before Amelia Kerr delivered a killer blow by trapping Sri Lanka captain and star player Chamari Athapaththu for 19 in the eighth over. New Zealand used six bowlers and they all took wickets, with Lea Tahuhu and Amelia Kerr taking two each. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "Authorities in the Brazilian state of São Paulo say at least 36 people have been killed in heavy flooding and landslides, forcing some cities to cancel annual Carnival celebrations. Video showed neighbourhoods under water, flooded motorways and debris left after houses were swept away. Rescue teams have been struggling to reach survivors and unblock roads. More than 600mm (23.6 inches) of rain fell in some areas on Sunday, twice the expected amount for the month. Search and rescue teams are not managing to get to several places; it is a chaotic situation, said Felipe Augusto, the mayor of the hard-hit town of São Sebastião. We have not yet gauged the scale of the damage. We are trying to rescue the victims. Dozens were missing in the town and about 50 houses had collapsed and washed away, Mr Augusto added, saying that the situation remained extremely critical. The state government reported at least 35 deaths in São Sebastião and the mayor of Ubatuba, some 80km (50 miles) north-east, said a young girl had been killed. Hundreds have been displaced and evacuated. Unfortunately, we are going to have many more deaths, a civil defence official told newspaper Folha de São Paulo. Meanwhile, officials say another 228 people have been left homeless, with 338 more evacuated from coastal regions north of São Paulo. A 180-day state of calamity was declared in six towns in the state: São Sebastião, Caraguatatuba, Ilhabela, Ubatuba, Guarujá and Bertioga. State Governor Tarcísio de Freitas said he had released the equivalent of 1.5 million (1.2 million) in funding to aid in disaster relief. Carnival events were cancelled across the northern coastline, which is a popular destination for wealthy tourists looking to avoid huge streetside festivities in the big cities. The festival usually lasts for five days in the run-up to the Christian festival of Lent and the colourful celebrations are synonymous with Brazil. Latin Americas largest port in Santos was also shut as wind speeds exceeded 55kmh (34mph) and waves rose to over a metre, local media reported. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was spending the carnival weekend in the north-eastern state of Bahia, said he would visit the affected areas on Monday. In a post on Twitter, he sent his condolences to those who had lost loved ones and promised to bring authorities together to provide healthcare, search for those missing and restore transport and communication infrastructure. We are going to bring together all levels of government and, with the solidarity of society, treat the wounded, look for the missing, restore highways, power connections and telecommunications in the region, Mr da Silva wrote. My condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this tragedy. He added that the entire federal government was available and working to help with whatever is necessary and to join efforts with the government of São Paulo and city halls in helping the victims. More heavy rains are expected in the area, threatening to make conditions even worse for emergency teams. Extreme weather events such as the floods are expected to become more common as the impacts of climate change took hold. Last year, torrential rains in the south-eastern city of Petropolis saw more than 230 people killed. Source - BBC -Agencies",

Bidens visit comes at a critical moment in the 12-month conflict, with Russia preparing for an expected spring offensive and Ukraine hoping to soon retake territory. The United States and other western nations have been rushing arms, tanks and ammunition to Ukraine in the hopes of changing the trajectory of the war. By visiting in person, Biden is offering a singular image of American support for Zelensky, who has spent the past year attempting to rally the world behind his home nation and appealing for greater levels of assistance. Zelensky himself traveled to Washington in December to meet Biden in the Oval Office and speak to a joint session of Congress  his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began. The Ukrainian leader invited Biden to visit Kyiv months ago, saying he believed it was important for the US leader to see the situation up close. I think hes the leader of the United States, and thats why he should come here to see, Zelensky said in April during an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper. As recently as last week, Zelensky said his invitation for Biden to visit Ukraine remained open, even as he acknowledged there were other means for them to speak. President Biden and I meet occasionally. You know that we have invited the President. I think he will be happy to visit Ukraine if he has the opportunity. That would be an important signal to support our nation, Zelensky said on February 15. The trip  which was not announced until Monday  comes ahead of Bidens planned two-day visit to Poland. The President is scheduled to be in Warsaw on Tuesday where he will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the White House said Sunday. Biden has been itching to visit Ukraine for months, particularly after several of his counterparts in Europe all endured lengthy train journeys to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as well as former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have all made visits to the country to demonstrate their support. Several of Bidens top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have also visited the Ukrainian capital to pledge new assistance. Senior administration officials, including CIA Director Bill Burns and top White House officials, visited Kyiv last month. Even Bidens wife, Dr. Jill Biden, paid a surprise visit on Mothers Day last year to a small city in the far southwestern corner of Ukraine. She met with Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska at a former school that was converted into temporary housing for displaced Ukrainians, including 48 children. Yet security precautions had prevented Biden from making a similar trip. When he visited Poland in April last year, the White House did not even explore the potential for a trip across the border, even though Biden said he had voiced interest. They will not let me  understandably, I guess  cross the border and take a look at whats going on in Ukraine, he said at the time. Now, with the war nearing its one-year mark on February 24, Biden is hoping to demonstrate to the world his commitment to Ukraine, even as it remains unclear how much longer US and western resolve can last. US officials have privately voiced hope the massive influx of weaponry to Ukraine  which includes new vehicles, longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems  can help Ukraine prevail on the battlefield and put Zelensky in a stronger position to negotiate an end to the war. But it remains unclear what parameters Zelensky might be willing to accept in any peace negotiations, and the US has steadfastly refused to define what a settlement may look like beyond stating it will be up to Zelensky to decide. Bidens visit to Ukraine also comes as US concerns grow over Chinas support for Russias military. American officials told CNN on Saturday the US has recently begun seeing disturbing trends and there are signs that Beijing wants to creep up to the line of providing lethal military aid to Moscow without getting caught. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in Chinas posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the last several days. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue when he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said. Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinpings top foreign policy adviser last month, is expected to arrive in Moscow this week, in the first visit to the country from a Chinese official in that role since Russias invasion of Ukraine. According to Chinas Foreign Ministry, Wangs visit will provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and exchange views on international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest  a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics including the war in Ukraine.

        "date": "February 20, 2023 05:06 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that an Economic Commission will be formed as early as possible to approve investment opportunity in order to provide more opportunities to local and foreign investors. The President also stated that it has the potential to significantly boost the countrys economy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks today at the opening of the countrys first migratory bird park and eco-tourism zone in Hanthane, Kandy (Feb. 20). President Wickremesinghe further said: I remembered another bird park when I arrived here. President J.R. Jayawardene established the parliament on the bird park that was constructed during the reign of King Parakramabahu VI. There are now various types of birds, as well as crows. Mr. Kottegoda spoke about the 20 years of hardship that went into building this bird park. However, Mr. Kottegoda has bestowed the country an International Bird Park today. According to him, this international practice was inspired by Singapores Jurong Bird Park. Singapores Jurong City was created as an investment zone. More investment opportunities are necessary for Sri Lanka to embark on a new economic path. It takes ten years to approve a firm after an investor arrives in Sri Lanka. This situation should be changed. Production, export economy and technical sectors should be developed under a new economic plan. More chances for domestic and international investment should be provided for that. The economy wont grow if it takes a foreign investor ten years to arrive and begin investing in Sri Lanka. President J.R. Jayawardena passed the Greater Colombo Economic Plan in a short period of three months and Sri Lanka got its economic benefits. President Premadasa approved the 200 garment industries program in three weeks. In this way, if the investment opportunities are not increased, it is not possible to strengthen the economy of Sri Lanka. Instead of the Board of Investment and the Board of Exports, we should appoint an Economic Commission and come to a system of giving approval for investments through one agency. Minister Dilum Amunugama has been assigned to arrange that. The report will be available within the next two to three weeks. Accordingly, we hope to implement it in the future. I would like to thank you for donating this bird park to the nation by providing value to the tourists. Chairman of the Migratory Bird Park and Ecotourism Zone Mr. Nishantha Kottegoda said: There is also a unit to treat and release injured birds in the park, which consists of birds native to foreign countries, migratory birds, etc. The park also has a unit for breeding and exporting exotic birds, an educational and recreational centre for school students and a study of natural birds. This project was started under the Yali Pubudamu Sri Lanka program. The first phase could be completed this year amid various obstacles from the government officials. To move this project forward, the government officials asked for a super luxury bus that could run in Colombo as a bribe. This project had to be stopped many years ago because it could not be provided. Anyway, we have been able to declare open the first phase today. Adjacent to the Hantane Tea Museum premises, this 27-acre exotic bird park and eco-tourism zone is home to over a hundred species of migratory birds. Established at a cost of Rs. 490 million, exotic birds are housed in large cages and the animals are cared for by a group of nearly one hundred workers. This park has been established based on a study of birds that are not native to Sri Lanka for a period of 40 years. It is also special that many exotic birds can be bred in this country. In the first phase of the Bird Park and eco-tourism zone, facilities for local and foreign tourists to see migratory birds, an educational training centre for zoology students, a bird orphanage, a bird home and a quarantine unit has been established. State Ministers Dilum Amunugama, Lohan Ratwatte, Anuradha Jayaratne, Member of Parliament Nalaka Kottegoda, Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Presidents Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Central Province Governor Lalith U. Gamage, Chairman of the Migratory Bird Park and Ecotourism Zone Mr. Nishantha Kottegoda and other officials participated in this event. --PMD--",

        "content": "Japanese companies like Mitsubishi Corp. and Taisei Corp. are closing offices and canceling contracts in Sri Lanka as its devastating economic crisis makes doing business difficult. Trading house Mitsubishi says it will close its Colombo office at the end of March, citing changes in the economic environment. The office was set up to gather information and to serve as a liaison with the headquarters in Japan. The company handles engineering, procurement and construction for power plants and trades in steel and chemical products in Sri Lanka. Projects already in progress will continue and be managed by staff in neighboring countries. In March 2020, engineering group Taisei won a contract worth 62 billion yen (462 million at current rates) for the construction of a four-story passenger terminal building, an elevated bridge and more for the second phase of the expansion of Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo. As the economic turmoil deepened, the Japan International Cooperation Agency stopped lending to state airport operator Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka), drying up funds for the project. The engineering company is negotiating with the airport operator to cancel the project and is in the process of liquidating the project. It has apparently booked losses on the project. We will refrain from commenting on individual projects, the company said. JICA is not expected to withdraw funding for the airport construction itself and will likely look for another company to take over. Sri Lankan media have reported that a Chinese company was interested in the project, but the JICA loan is conditioned on participation by Japanese companies. In addition to the countrys current-account deficit, Sri Lankas tourism industry, its main source of foreign currency, has been devastated by the prolonged effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The country went into default in May 2022. After Russias invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living increased, especially in prices of imported goods. Mass protests triggered by the crisis forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had handed key government positions to relatives, to resign in July. Ranil Wickremesinghe, a former prime minister, replaced him and worked out a deal for a 2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, but its fiscal woes continue.

        "date": "February 20, 2023 07:06 pm",
        "content": "The Export-Import Bank of China has provided Sri Lanka with a debt extension, Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Monday, noting that China is willing to negotiate a medium- and long-term debt disposal plan with the country in a friendly manner, and do its best to promote Sri Lankas debt sustainability. The remarks come as Bloomberg reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering approving Sri Lankas bailout, even without the formal assurance of debt-restructuring support from China, citing people familiar with the discussions. In response, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a press conference on Monday that China has already provided Sri Lanka with a letter supporting the sustainability of Sri Lankas debt, expressing its willingness to extend the debt due in 2022 and 2023. During the period, Sri Lanka will not have to repay the loan principal and interest of the Export-Import Bank, helping Sri Lanka to ease short-term debt pressure, the official said. We are willing to use this window to negotiate a medium- and long-term debt disposal plan with Sri Lanka in a friendly manner, and do our best to promote Sri Lankas debt sustainability, Wang said. The IMF, World Bank and Group of 20 nations chair India separately held virtual discussions Friday on global sovereign debt ahead of the finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Bangalore this week. The roundtable included officials from countries that have requested debt treatments under the G20 framework - Ethiopia, Zambia and Ghana - as well as middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka, Suriname and Ecuador, which have faced their own debt problems, Reuters reported. The roundtable comes amid growing frustration over the slow pace of discussions on debt relief for some nations. Rather than seeking a global resolution, some have tried to blame China. Chinese observers have urged developed countries to take more responsibility in addressing the debt risks faced by some nations, rather than using China as an excuse to shirk blame. They pointed out that there are many reasons why some countries become mired in debt - the US Feds interest rate hikes, the global energy and food crises and other issues, warning some in the West to share the responsibility and seek a more fair and just solution.

        "date": "February 20, 2023 08:24 pm",
        "content": "Gunfire erupted between Afghanistan and Pakistan border forces on Monday after Taliban authorities shut the countrys busiest crossing with its eastern neighbour, officials said. Relations between the two countries have been testy since the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021, with Islamabad accusing its neighbour of harbouring armed groups that have carried out strikes on its soil. There have been frequent flare-ups along the mostly mountainous border splitting the countries -- which no Afghan government has ever recognised -- including sporadic gunfights and crossing closures. Officials on both sides, who asked not to be named, said Afghan authorities closed the border late Sunday after Pakistani officials imposed new rules preventing entry to attendants of medical patients without certain documentation. Its such a pity, Pakistanis and Afghans are Muslim brothers, said Pakistani citizen Riwayat, stuck on the Afghan side of the border. I have all the necessary documents but it is still closed over a small issue. Mohammad Sediq Khalid, the commissioner for Torkham on the Afghan side, said Pakistan was not fulfilling its promises. Islamabad did not respond to a request from AFP to clarify the new rules. The clash broke out at around 7:30 am Kabul time (0300 GMT) on Monday, with both sides blaming each other for initiating the violence. The firing was initiated by the Afghan side and our forces retaliated, Irshad Mohmand, a senior Pakistani government official at the border, told AFP by phone. Afghan official Harfat Muhajir, however, said Afghan forces had only shot in response to Pakistani forces. The border crossing at Torkham -- 177 kilometres (110 miles) from the capital of each country -- is a key trading waypoint, where Afghanistan exports truckloads of coal and receives food and other supplies from Pakistan. Both nations are in dire economic crisis, with Afghanistan reeling from a drop-off in aid following the end of the US-backed occupation, and Pakistan crippled by a domestic downturn and foreign exchange crisis that has left it on the brink of default. In the year-and-a-half of Taliban rule, Pakistan has witnessed a dramatic uptick in attacks on its soil, mainly in the regions bordering Afghanistan. In January, a suicide bomber killed more than 80 police officers at a mosque in the northwestern provincial capital of Peshawar. On Friday, a suicide bomber squad stormed a police headquarters in the southern port city of Karachi, killing five. Both attacks were linked to the Pakistani Taliban, which has deep ties with the Afghan Taliban. I think that the Afghan state has to deliver on terrorism, Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Theres a whole alphabet soup of terrorist organisations that have and still do base themselves out of Afghanistan. Late on Sunday, Kabuls foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said Zardaris remarks asserting that terrorist groups operate from Afghanistan... are untrue. Source - AFP -Agencies",

        "content": "A German remake of anti-war classic All Quiet on the Western Front was the big winner at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, triumphing in the key categories at the ceremony seen as an indicator for next months Oscars. Based on the 1928 novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque about the horrors of World War One from the perspective of a young German soldier, the Netflix drama had led nominations, with 14 nods, making it one of the most recognised films not in the English language in BAFTAs history. It won seven awards overall: best film, adapted screenplay, film not in the English language, director for Edward Berger, cinematography, sound and original score. German language film, weve been blessed with so many nominations and winning this is just incredible, producer Malte Grunert said in his acceptance speech for best film. All Quiet on the Western Front tells a story of a young man who, poisoned by right-wing political nationalist propaganda, goes to war thinking its an adventure, and war is anything but an adventure. That is one of the messages of Remarques seminal novel and when we started embarking on this... that seemed a relevant message even 100 years after the book was published. Austin Butler won the leading actor prize for his portrayal of Elvis Presley in Elvis. He thanked the Presley family in his acceptance speech. I hope Ive made you proud, this means the world to me, he said. Cate Blanchett won the leading actress prize for her portrayal of a gay conductor of a Berlin orchestra whose career comes tumbling down due to an abuse scandal in Tár, an undertaking she described as very dangerous and career-ending potentially. Banshees, about two feuding friends on an island off the coast of Ireland, won outstanding British film, both supporting acting categories for Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan as well as original screenplay. Navalny, about jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, won the documentary category. Filmmakers dedicated the award to the Navalny family and Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev. The journalist, whom Russia put on a wanted list in December, said on Friday he had been banned by British police from attending the BAFTAs for security reasons. In response, London police said they did not and could not ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions on attendance were for event organizers, it said. Sandy Powell became the first costume designer to get the BAFTA Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the Academy. The BAFTAs also remembered Britains late Queen Elizabeth, who died in September. Actress Helen Mirren, who won both a BAFTA and an Oscar for her portrayal of Elizabeth in 2006 film The Queen, led a tribute. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "ANTAKYA, Turkey  A 6.4-magnitude earthquake was recorded Monday in Turkeys southern province of Hatay, the hardest hit by a February 6 tremor which left more than 41,000 dead in the country, the disaster response agency AFAD said. The quake hit the town of Defne at 8:04 pm (1704 GMT) and was strongly felt by AFP teams in Antakya and Adana, 200 kilometres (300 miles) to the north. AFP teams felt the tremor also in Lebanon and Syria. The disaster management agency said on Twitter another 5.8-magnitude tremor followed three minutes later and its epicentre was Samandag district in Hatay. An AFP journalist reported scenes of panic in Antakya, adding that the new tremors raised clouds of dust in the devastated city. The walls of badly damaged buildings crumbled while several people, apparently injured, called for help. On a street in Antakya, Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP: We were with AFAD who were looking for the bodies of our family when the quake hit. You dont know what to do we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall. It felt like the earth was opening up to swallow us up. Mazlum, who has lived in Antakya for 12 years, was looking for the bodies of his sister and her family as well as his brother-in-law and his family. A few metres away, a digger was clearing a road was covered with rubble after the new quake.  Aftershocks  This one just fell, a rescuer said, referring to a collapsed building. Hatay province is on the Mediterranean Sea and the disaster agency said the sea level could rise by 50 centimetres, warning people to stay away from the coast. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Twitter urged people to stay away from damaged buildings and to follow officials warnings. According to AFAD, more than 6,000 aftershocks have been recorded since the 7.8-magnitude hit Turkey and Syria, leaving millions homeless. Officials said after the February 6 quake that aftershocks would be felt for a year because of the force of the first tremor. AFP correspondents in the city of Aleppo, Syrias second city, said people flocked to the streets after the new quake. An AFP photographer in the city of Azaz, further north, said that of buildings that had been damaged in the previous quake collapsed. The February 6 earthquake killed 41,156 people in Turkey and 3,688 in Syria, but experts expect the toll to rise as the rubble is cleared and rescue operations come to an end. Eleven provinces were hit by the previous tremors and on Sunday, officials said rescue operations continue only in two: Hatay and Kahramanmaras. The quake two weeks ravaged swathes of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, damaging more than 118,000 buildings. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday promised to build nearly 200,000 new homes within a year that were more sturdy and no more than four-storeys high. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "3 dead, over 200 injured as new quake hits Turkey, Syria",
        "date": "February 21, 2023 07:49 am",
        "content": "A new 6.4 magnitude earthquake on Monday killed three people and injured more than 200 in parts of Turkey laid waste two weeks ago by a massive quake that killed tens of thousands, authorities said. More buildings collapsed, trapping some people, while scores of injuries were recorded in neighboring Syria too. Mondays earthquake was centered in the town of Defne, in Turkeys Hatay province, one of the worst-hit regions in the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck on Feb. 6. It was felt in Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Israel and as far away as Egypt, and followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 temblor. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said three people were killed and 213 injured. Search and rescue efforts were underway in three collapsed buildings where six people were believed trapped. In Hatay, police rescued one person trapped inside a three-story building and were trying to reach three others inside, HaberTurk television reported. It said those trapped included movers helping people shift furniture and other belongings from the building that was damaged in the massive quake. Syrias state news agency, SANA, reported that six people were injured in Aleppo by falling debris. The White Helmets, northwest Syrias civil defense organization, reported more than 130 injuries, most of them non-life threatening, including fractures and cases of people fainting from fear, while a number of buildings in areas already damaged by the quake collapsed. The Feb. 6 quake killed nearly 45,000 people in both countries  the vast majority of them in Turkey, where more than a million and a half people are in temporary shelters. Turkish authorities have recorded more than 6,000 aftershocks since. HaberTurk journalists reporting from Hatay said they were jolted violently by Mondays quake and held on to each other to avoid falling. In the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets in their cars. Malaver said everyone is really scared and no one wants to get back into their houses. Mehmet Salhaoglullari, from a village near Samandag, said he was eating at a restaurant when the building began to shake. We all threw ourselves outside and we continued to shake outside, he said. In the Syrian city of Idlib, frightened residents were preparing to sleep in parks and other public places, while fuel lines formed at gas stations as people attempted to get as far as possible from any buildings that might collapse. The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria, said it had treated a number of patients  including a 7-year-old boy  who suffered heart attacks brought on by fear following the new quake. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Hatay earlier on Monday, and said his government would begin constructing close to 200,000 new homes in the quake-devastated region as early as next month. Erdogan said the new buildings will be no taller than three or four stories, built on firmer ground and to higher standards and in consultation with geophysics, geotechnical, geology and seismology professors and other experts. The Turkish leader said destroyed cultural monuments would be rebuilt in accordance with their historic and cultural texture. Erdogan said around 1.6 million people are currently being housed in temporary shelters. The Turkish disaster management agency AFAD on Monday raised the number of confirmed fatalities from the Feb. 6 earthquake in Turkey to 41,156. That increased the overall death toll in both Turkey and Syria to 44,844. Search and rescue operations for survivors have been called off in most of the quake zone, but AFAD chief Yunus Sezer said earlier that search teams were continuing their efforts in more than a dozen collapsed buildings  mostly in Hatay province. There were no signs of anyone being alive under the rubble since three members of one family  a mother, father and 12-year-old boy  were extracted from a collapsed building in Hatay on Saturday. The boy later died. Authorities said more than 110,000 buildings across 11 quake-hit Turkish provinces were either destroyed or so severely damaged by the Feb. 6 quake that they need to be torn down. The European Unions health agency warned Monday of the risk of disease outbreaks in the coming weeks. The Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls said that food and water-borne diseases, respiratory infections and vaccine-preventable infections are a risk in the upcoming period, with the potential to cause outbreaks, particularly as survivors are moving to temporary shelters. A surge of cholera cases in the affected areas is a significant possibility in the coming weeks, it said, noting that authorities in northwestern Syria have reported thousands of cases of the disease since last September and a planned vaccination campaign was delayed due to the quake.

        "content": "The government is going to reduce the number of individuals eligible to receive social welfare benefits through surveys conducted across the country, says the Development Officers Service Union. The secretary of the union, R.M. Ranjith Bandara mentioned that the government is carrying out a survey by deploying their officials stating that it is for the selection of qualified candidates. He also expressed that the union has launched a strike protesting against the relevant survey which has been named Selection of welfare beneficiaries  2022. Furthermore, Mr. Bandara pointed out that the government is further forcing the officials to carry out the survey, stressing that the chairman of the Social Welfare Board has also made it very clear during a discussion with them that a large number of welfare beneficiaries are going to be deducted. They are trying to cut all the social benefits or the social welfare allowances that are currently being provided to our people, especially the Samurdhi subsidies, elderly allowance and cancer allowance, based on the directives of the World Bank. But they interpret this procedure as providing social benefits. Mr. Ranjith Bandara further stressed that there will be a huge deduction in welfare benefits in the country, once this survey is completed, highlighting that it could be up to 70 - 80.",

The difference between the current state of Provincial Councils and that following the implementation of the 13th Amendment is the devolving of police and land powers. Where are these police and land powers now? They are within the constitution, but cannot be implemented as the people do not want this, the JVP MP stated. Both the Sinhalese and Tamil communities have historically opposed the 13th Amendment, with the former claiming that the legislature devolved too great an extent of powers, while the latter countered that not enough powers were devolved. Meanwhile, speaking on the upcoming Local Government election, the MP stated that they are contesting the election not just as the JVP, but as a coalition of parties. The National Peoples Power (NPP) is not proposing ideals in line with their 1979 policies, but they have new manifestos for 2023.

        "content": "Sri Lanka is tangled in the worst financial crisis in over seven decades, triggered by a severe shortage of foreign exchange that forced the country to annouce a suspension of foreign debt repayments in April 2022. Sri Lankas cabinet has approved loan repayments worth 2.6 billion in the first half of this year, in line with its debt suspension plans, its cabinet spokesperson said on Tuesday. The island of 22 million people is tangled in the worst financial crisis in over seven decades, triggered by a severe shortage of foreign exchange that forced the country to annouce a suspension of foreign debt repayments in April 2022. However, Sri Lanka will continue to repay multilateral loans from several organisations including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, cabinet spokersperson and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana told reporters. The loan repayments will include 2 billion in foreign loan repayments and 540 million in interest payments. Repayments will also include 709 million in dollar-denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds and 46 million in interest payments, Gunewardana added. Sri Lanka signed a preliminary agreement for a 2.9 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last September but has to put its debt on a sustainable path before disbursements can begin. Talks with the IMF are at the final stage but they have not been concluded so it is imperative that public finances are handled carefully. These debt repayments will be done within the borrowing limits set in the budget for 2023, Gunawardana said. India and Paris Club members have declared support to help Sri Lankas debt restructuring but the island is still in negotiations with China, which is the largest bilateral lender, for simmilar financing assurances, Gunawardana said.

Thus, president Wickremesinghe also mentioned that if the proposal is rejected, the relevant parties should submit alternative proposals to the IMF. The President made these remarks while delivering the keynote speech at the Tax Forum 2023, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The forum held at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo yesterday (Feb. 21) was organized to discuss the taxation policies introduced by the government in the 2023 budget. Speaking at the event, the President also highlighted that the current tax policy in Sri Lanka is not a normal tax policy, but rather a rescue operation. He warned that if this process is disrupted, Sri Lanka will not be able to join the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and may lose the opportunity to do business with foreign countries, according to the PMD. In addition to his comments on the tax policy, President Ranil Wickremesinghe also stated that the budget presented for the year 2023 in Sri Lanka is not an ordinary budget, but rather an operation to rescue the economy. The President highlighted that, apart from the Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce, no other party, person, or institution has submitted any proposals or alternatives to the IMF. Commenting on the debt restructuring process with the main creditors of Sri Lanka, the Paris Club, India and China, the President said that the Paris Club has guaranteed its financial support for Sri Lanka, and India is following its own method, but China has not expressed agreement about its method so far.

        "content": "Sri Lankas National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) eased year-on-year to 53.2 in January, after a 59.2 rise in December, the statistics department said on Tuesday. Food prices were up 53.6 in January from a year ago, while non-food inflation was 52.9 higher, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement. Sri Lanka hiked power prices by a hefty 66 last week, part of efforts to nail down a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as the island struggles to find a way out of its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades. The power tariff increase is the second in six months and is expected to slow the pace of inflation reduction, which has been easing since last September. This is broadly in line with expectations as there is a high base effect, said Udeeshan Jonas, chief strategist at equity research firm CAL. Power has become a small component of the overall inflation basket so there will be indirect impact but a significant increase is unlikely as many businesses will be unable to pass on the cost increase to consumers. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is expected to keep interest rates steady next week after it raised them to the highest point in nearly two decades last year to fight soaring inflation. CBSL predicts that inflation will reach single digits at the end of this year. The NCPI captures broader retail price inflation across the island nation and is released with a lag of 21 days every month. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), released at the end of each month, eased to 54.2 in January, data showed.",
