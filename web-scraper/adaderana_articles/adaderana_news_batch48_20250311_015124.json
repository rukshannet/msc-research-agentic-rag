A Spokesman of the Ministry of Defence stated that the approval was granted on request by NARA and the Foreign Ministry. China had requested permission for a research ship to dock in Sri Lanka, following a visit by a spacecraft-tracking vessel last year that sparked security concerns from neighbouring India. However, the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN calls the Shi Yan 6 a scientific research vessel crewed by 60 that carries out oceanography, marine geology and marine ecology tests. Last year, India raised concerns over a Sri Lanka port call in Hambantota by Chinese research vessel Yuan Wang 5, which specialises in spacecraft tracking and which New Delhi described as a spy ship. India is suspicious of Chinas increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and its influence in Sri Lanka, seeing both as firmly within its sphere of influence. Sri Lanka is strategically placed halfway along key east-west international shipping routes. Meanwhile, China last year said it was completely unjustified for certain countries to cite security concerns to pressure Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "August 27, 2023 01:28 pm",
        "content": "The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is to halve the 200 daily fee it charges tourists in an effort to boost a sector still struggling to recover a year after the end of COVID-19 restrictions. Bhutan raised its Sustainable Development Fee to 200 per visitor per night, from 65, when it ended two years of COVID restrictions in September last year saying the money would go to off-set the carbon generated by visitors. The new rate of 100 per night would come into effect from September and last for four years, the government said in a statement late on Friday. This is in view of the important role of the tourism sector in generating employment, earning foreign exchange ... and in boosting overall economic growth, it said. Isolated for generations, Bhutan opened to tourists in 1974 when it received 300 visitors. The number soared to 315,600 in 2019, up 15.1 from a year earlier, official data showed. Bhutan has always been wary of the impact of mass tourism and it bans mountain climbing to preserve the sanctity of its peaks. The tourist fee has limited arrivals to bigger spenders who make up a fraction of the numbers that visit nearby Nepal. Nevertheless, Bhutan hopes to raise the contribution of tourism to its 3 billion economy 20, from about 5. Dorji Dhradhul, director general of the Department of Tourism, said the halving of the fee could boost arrivals in the September-December peak tourist period, which includes many religious and cultural events in the mainly Buddhist country. In June, the government eased rules on length of stay and fees for tourists but numbers have not picked up as expected. Dhradhul said more than 56,000 tourists had visited Bhutan since January but about 42,000 were Indian nationals, who only have to pay a fee of 1,200 Indian rupees (14.5) a day. About 50,000 Bhutanese are employed in tourism which earned about 84 million a year in the three years before the pandemic in foreign exchange. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 27, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "After successfully landing spacecraft on the moons South Pole, India is now aiming for the Sun. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is now gearing up for its maiden solar mission, Aditya-L1. ISRO chief S Somanath on Saturday shared major updates on the mission, saying that Aditya-L1 is ready and will be launched in the first week of September. We are planning to launch in the first week of September, said ISRO chairman S. Somanath. On August 14, Aditya-L1s satellite arrived at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC-SHAR) in Sriharikota from UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) in Bengaluru, where it was developed. ISRO shared the update on X (formerly Twitter). Initially, Aditya-L1 was slated to launch on August 26, but as per the latest update, the mission will now be launched in the first week of September. What Aditya-L1s mission is all about? Aditya-L1 will be Indias first space-based mission to study the Sun. The spacecraft of Aditya-L1 will be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange Point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km from the Earth. Lagrange Points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of a two-body system the Sun and Earth produce enhanced regions of attraction and repulsion. These points are used by spacecraft as parking spots in space to remain in a fixed position with minimal fuel consumption. It aims to study solar winds, which can cause disturbance on Earth and are commonly seen as auroras. When will Aditya-L1 mission be launched? The satellite is ready and has already reached Sriharikota, but the final date for the launch of Aditya-L1 will be announced in two days, ISRO chief S Somanath has said. The event is expected to take place in the first week of September, with the space agency targeting a September 2 launch. What are the objectives of Aditya-L1? With Aditya-L1, ISRO aims to observe solar activities more closely and their effect on space weather in real-time. The mission will study the solar upper atmospheric dynamics of the corona and chromosphere. The spacecraft will carry seven payloads to observe the photosphere, chromospheres and the outermost layers of the Sun using electromagnetic particle and magnetic field detectors. Using the special vantage point L1, four payloads directly view the Sun and the remaining three payloads carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1, thus providing critical scientific studies of the propagatory effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium. --Agencies",

        "title": "Russias investigators confirm Wagner mercenary chief Prigozhin died in plane crash",
        "date": "August 27, 2023 04:37 pm",
        "content": "Russian investigators said on Sunday that genetic tests had confirmed that Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the Wagner mercenary group, was among the 10 people killed in a plane crash last week. Russias aviation agency had previously published the names of all 10 people on board the private jet which crashed in the Tver region northwest of Moscow on Wednesday. They included Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, his right-hand man who helped found the Wagner group. As part of the investigation of the plane crash in the Tver region, molecular-genetic examinations have been completed, Russias Investigative Committee said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. According to their results, the identities of all 10 dead were established. They correspond to the list stated in the flight sheet, it said. There had been some speculation, especially on pro-Wagner Telegram channels, about whether Prigozhin - who was known to take various security precautions in anticipation of a possible attempt on his life - had really been on the doomed flight. Authorities have yet to say what they believe caused his private jet to fall from the sky. STAB IN THE BACK The crash came two months to the day after Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries staged a mutiny against Russian military commanders in which they took control of a southern city, Rostov, and advanced towards Moscow before turning around 200 kilometres from the capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the June 23-24 mutiny as a treacherous stab in the back, but later met with Prigozhin in the Kremlin. He sent his condolences on Thursday to the families of those believed to have died in the crash. Western politicians and commentators have suggested, without presenting evidence, that Putin ordered Prigozhin to be killed as punishment for the mutiny, which also represented the biggest challenge to Putins own rule since he came to power in 1999. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that such suggestions were an absolute lie. Asked whether Putin might attend Prigozhins funeral, Peskov said it was too early to say and also noted the presidents busy schedule. Wagner fighters played a prominent role in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, especially in the months-long siege of the city of Bakhmut, despite Prigozhins frequent, profanity-laced attacks on Russias military high command over their conduct of the war that culminated in the failed mutiny. The Wagner fighters have now left Ukraine and some have relocated to neighbouring Belarus under the terms of a deal that ended their mutiny. Some are expected to be absorbed into Russias armed forces but many will be angry over the sudden demise of the groups founder who inspired a high degree of loyalty among his men. Putin paid a mixed tribute to Prigozhin on Thursday, describing him as a talented businessman but also as a flawed character who made serious mistakes in life. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The arrested accused have been identified by the police as Anbazhagan, a resident of Viveknagar in Bengaluru and Mansoor, who hails from Chennai. Police claim that the two had assisted the Sri Lankan nationals in fleeing their country after they were charged with murder cases. While raiding a citybased rowdy-sheeter, Jai Paramesh, 42, the CCB sleuths stumbled upon three suspects who turned out to be Sri Lankan nationals identified as Kasan Kumara Sanka, 36, Amila Nuwan, 36, and Ranga Prasad, 36. It was revealed that Paramesh had arranged accommodation for the trio in Yelahanka. All four were arrested by the police immediately. Sources from the police said that following an interrogation with the arrested accused, it was revealed that they were a part of a drug racket which was allegedly run by another Sri Lankan national identified as Jalal alias Siddique. Jalal was operating from an island nation and was allegedly dealing with Heroin mainly. The police found that Jalal had a case filed against him in Chennai 20 years ago following which he started running an LED bulb factory on the outskirts of Bengaluru where Jairam Paramesh was working as a driver earlier. The investigation officers have also received information that Jalal had assigned the safekeeping of the three accused to Jai Paramesh in Bengaluru until he organises a transit for them to move to Nepal. In a latest development, the police found that Mansoor was tasked to provide the trio Rs 50 lakh for the journey and Anbazhagan was tasked with creating fake passports with new identities for the accused. However there are rumours that Jalal is currently in the custody of the local police in Oman. --Agencies",

        "title": "Libya suspends foreign minister after meeting with Israeli foreign minister",
        "date": "August 28, 2023 07:44 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Libyas prime minister suspended Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush on Sunday and referred her for investigation after Israel said its Foreign Minister Eli Cohen had met her last week despite the countries not having formal relations. Israels statement on the meeting, in which it said the ministers had discussed possible cooperation, prompted small protests in Libya, which does not recognise Israel. Libyas Foreign Ministry said Mangoush had rejected a meeting with representatives of Israel and that what had occurred was an unprepared, casual encounter during a meeting at Italys Foreign Affairs Ministry. The Libyan ministrys statement said the interaction did not include any discussions, agreements or consultations and added the ministry renews its complete and absolute rejection of normalisation with Israel. Since 2020 Israel has moved to normalise ties with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan through the so-called Abraham accords brokered by the United States. I spoke with the foreign minister about the great potential for the two countries from their relations, Israels Cohen said in a statement. The meeting was facilitated by Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, Israels foreign ministry said, adding they had discussed possible cooperation and Israeli aid in humanitarian issues, agriculture and water management. Cohen said he had spoken to Mangoush about the importance of preserving Jewish heritage in Libya. Libyan foreign policy is complicated by its years of conflict and its bitter internal divisions over control of government and the legitimacy of any moves made by the Tripoli administration. The Government of National Unity was installed in early 2021 through a U.N.-backed peace process but its legitimacy has been challenged since early 2022 by the eastern-based parliament after a failed attempt to hold an election. Previous foreign policy moves by the GNU, including agreements it has reached with Turkey, have been rejected by the parliament and subjected to legal challenges. The Presidency Council, which functions as head of state, issued a statement on Sunday asking GNU Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah for clarification on what had taken place. The High State Council, which holds an advisory role in Libyan politics, voiced its surprise at the reports of the meeting and said those responsible should be held accountable.

        "date": "August 28, 2023 12:46 pm",
        "content": "Thailand and Sri Lanka expect to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) in early 2024 as the two parties aim for three more rounds of talks this year to conclude the negotiations, according to the chief of the Trade Negotiations Department. Auramon Supthaweethum, director-general of the department, speaking at the sixth round of negotiations for the Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA held from Aug 21-23 in Bangkok, said the talks have advanced beyond the halfway point. Both sides aim to conclude negotiations in 2023, paving the way for the trade ministers of both countries to sign the agreement early next year, she said. The sixth round comprised the trade negotiating committee overseeing overall progress and seven technical working groups covering trade in goods, rules of origin, trade in services, investment, technical barriers to trade, trade remedies, and legal issues. We are more than halfway there, and both sides plan to hold three more rounds of negotiations in October, November and December to conclude all matters, said Mrs Auramon. Then both sides will proceed with internal processes to raise awareness among the public and relevant stakeholders, presenting the negotiation outcomes for the consideration and approval of their respective cabinets for approval. She said studies determined that despite Sri Lankas small size and population of only 22 million, it has an important geographic position in the Indian Ocean, making it a hub for maritime transport. It also possesses abundant natural resources such as precious minerals and seafood. A Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA is projected to expand the Thai economy by 0.02, equivalent to US80 million. This includes the expansion of investments and the value of Thai exports to Sri Lanka. The potential beneficiaries of this agreement include automobiles and auto components, machinery, electrical appliances, metals, sugar and plastics, according to the department. Industries in which Thailand could expand its investments in Sri Lanka include processed foods, beverages, textiles, garments and jewellery. During the first six months of this year, two-way trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka amounted to 179 million. Thailand exported goods worth 120 million to Sri Lanka and imported goods worth 59.4 million. Sri Lanka and Thailand first began considering an FTA in 2016 when Somkid Jatusripitak, the former deputy prime minister, made an official visit to the island nation. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation, a letter of intent on cooperation in the area of small and medium-sized enterprise development, and a joint programme on tourism for 2016-18. The Thai cabinet approved the negotiation framework for the FTA talks with Sri Lanka on May 8, 2018. The framework covers trade in goods, services, investment and comprehensive economic cooperation.

        "content": "Tropical Storm Idalia could strengthen into a hurricane on Monday, bringing high winds and storm surges to Cuba and Florida later this week. The storm has sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and could reach Category 2 strength with sustained winds of 96 to 110 mph when it is forecast to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday, according to Governor Ron DeSantis. The governor said the hurricane could make landfall in northern Floridas Big Bend area - where the panhandle transitions into the peninsula. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Sunday that the storm is currently near the Yucatan Channel about 145 miles (235 km) south of the western tip of Cuba. Idalia could cause scattered flash and urban flooding from heavy rains along parts of Floridas west coast, the Panhandle and southern Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. Idalia is likely to be near or at major hurricane intensity when it reaches the Gulf coast of Florida, the NHC added. DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 33 Florida counties on Saturday. If you are in the path of this storm, you should expect power outages, so please prepare for that, DeSantis said during a Sunday briefing with Floridas Division of Emergency Management. The governor said power company workers were preparing ahead of the storm and that 1,100 members of the National Guard were mobilized with 2,400 high-water vehicles and a dozen aircraft for rescue and recovery efforts. Duke Energy (DUK.N) is closely monitoring the approach of Idalia and preparing crews and equipment to respond if customers lose power. President Joe Biden had been briefed about Idalias forecast path and will be kept up to date as the storm moves, the White House said on Sunday. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Japans space agency on Monday postponed for the third time the launch of its Moon Sniper lunar mission due to poor weather. The H2-A rocket due to blast off from the southern island of Tanegashima was also carrying a research satellite developed with NASA and the European Space Agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) gave no new date for the start of the mission, which comes after India successfully landed a probe on the Moon last week. MHI Launch Services, the rocket co-developer, said on the social media platform X that the mission was called off because it was confirmed that the upper wind does not satisfy the constraints at launch. Last week India landed a craft near the Moons south pole, a historic triumph for the country and its low-cost space programme. Previously, only the United States, Russia and China had managed to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface, and none on the south pole. Indias success came days after a Russian probe crashed in the same region, and four years after a previous Indian attempt failed at the last moment. Japan has also tried before, attempting last year to land a lunar probe named Omotenashi, carried on NASAs Artemis 1, but the mission went wrong and communications were lost. In April, Japanese start-up ispace failed in an ambitious attempt to become the first private company to land on the Moon, losing communication after what the firm called a hard landing. The Moon Sniper is so called because JAXA is aiming to land it within 100 metres (330 feet) of a specific target on the Moon, far less than the usual range of several kilometres. Japan has also had problems with launch rockets, with failures after liftoff of the next-generation H3 model in March and the normally reliable solid-fuel Epsilon the previous October.

Accordingly, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) will continue to monitor the situation until the FFSL elections are held on 29 September 2023, according to FIFA. In a circular to member associations, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura stated that as a result of the decision taken by the Bureau of the FIFA Council on 21 January 2023, the FFSL had been suspended until further notice in accordance with article 16 of the FIFA Statutes, due to government interference. Thereby, the FFSL lost all of its membership rights, as defined in Article 13 of the FIFA Statutes, until further notice. The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) on December 25, 2022, had issued a red notice to Sri Lankan Football authorities, raising concerns over the Electoral roadmap of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka. Against this backdrop, the FIFA and the AFC approved and included Sri Lanka in the official World Cup draw on a strict conditional basis. Thereby, the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) was required to conduct its election at least 10 days prior to this World Cup match. Later on, the FFSL decided to hold the elections of the federation in September, in order to allow Sri Lanka to participate in the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) World Cup qualifiers. Accordingly, the election is expected to be held before 16 September, in line with the recommendations proposed by FIFA. Meanwhile, on 25 July, Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe appointed a three-member committee to call for, and hold the FFSL elections.",

The Minister also pointed out that the police department is working on a non-political agenda and is always committed to protecting the law and order of the country at the highest level, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. These statements were made by the Minister of Public Security, Tiran Alles, during his presence at the press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (28) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles further stated; Currently, the Police Department is working on a non-political agenda. All the necessary facilities have been provided. It has been about a year since the current government took office, so not everything can be accomplished within a year. However, the Police Department has undertaken a significant amount of work. The Police Department currently comprises around 85,000 officers. The ministry has developed a special program to eradicate narcotic drugs from the country. Underworld activities in the South have been on the rise consistently. Due to this, the Special Task Force, the police and other security forces jointly started special operations in such areas. As a result, it has been possible to eliminate to some extent the underworld activities in the southern province. At present, there are a number of reports of shootings between groups of underworld gangs. They murder each other. Necessary measures have already been taken to stop such activities of the underworld gangs. Security forces have also been instructed to shoot if necessary. As a responsible government, no activity that harms the lives of the people will be tolerated. Following President Ranil Wickremesinghes instructions, we provided the Catholic Church with a copy of the complete investigation report concerning the Easter attack. The Catholic Church should also extend its support to the police investigations into the Easter attack. In the Department of Immigration and Emigration, which falls under my ministry, we have initiated the process of issuing passports through an online system. In the past, various types of scams occurred. Now through this new online system, we have completely stopped the possibility of such fraudulent activities. There are 51 centres that have already been established island-wide to facilitate necessary fingerprint scanning for new passports. Therefore, people can have their passports delivered to their doorstep within a few days. We have taken the necessary steps to enhance the facilities related to the efficient operation of the department. In some cases, system errors and crashes may occur. Therefore, we must implement modern technology to prevent such issues. We have taken steps to register all NGOs with the National Secretariat for NGOs and measures will be taken to prohibit any NGOs that are not registered.",

He stated this during a meeting held at the Temple Trees on Monday (28) to discuss the unresolved issues of Samurdhi officials, the PMs Office said. The trade unions stated that there is a delay in the implementation of the decisions taken during the discussions regarding these issues that arose with the absorption of the Samurdhi Authority into a department. The trade unions further stated that the decision to charge an additional 4 percent interest fee in the payment of the 60 percent provident Fund contribution owed to the government by the officers who expressed their preference under Section 44E (11) while being absorbed into the Samurdhi Department is unfair. Special attention was paid to several issues such as approval of the carder of Samurdhi Development Department, establishment of Samurdhi officers in M N 02 salary scale, setting up of a promotion system, addition of Samurdhi regulator service period to Samurdhi development service period and payment of 4 percent surcharge with interest to Samurdhi development officials in payment of arrears for widows and orphans funds. The officials explained the issues related to the ordinances, circulars and cabinet decisions that have hindered the resolution of these issues and the Prime Minister stated that at this moment of crisis, everyones commitment is required to resolve these contemporary situations. The Secretary to the Prime Minister Mr. Anura Dissanayake said that as Samurdhi officials were absorbed into the Samurdhi Department, other authorities have been absorbed into the department, taking precedents of such cases and act to solve these problems promptly. He also pointed out that non-settlement of the problems of the government employees is a reason for the poor performance. Member of Parliament Jagath Kumar, Secretary of the Public Administration Ministry K. D. N.

However, after communicating the details of the meeting, the said group of persons has informed the CBSL through the Colombo Fort Police Station of their inability to participate at the meeting, the statement said.

        "date": "August 29, 2023 09:54 am",
        "content": "Indias Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka over the coming weekend, Indian newspaper The Hindu reported citing defence sources. Two defence sources have confirmed that the Indian Defence Minister is scheduled to go on a two-day visit to the island nation. As per media reports, Mr. Singh is expected to visit Trincomalee where India is jointly investing in the joint development of Oil Tank farm, under an agreement signed in January 2022. The visit comes at a time when the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry is considering a fresh request from China to allow the visit of a research ship. Last week, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry acknowledged receiving a request from the Chinese Embassy. The research vessel Shiyan-6 is expected to arrive in October. This request comes after a Chinese warship docked at the Colombo Port from August 10 to August 12, exactly a year after the visit of a Chinese vessel Yuan Wang-5 which caused a major diplomatic showdown between New Delhi and Colombo. Entry into Indian Ocean Region Later in November, another vessel Yuan Wang-6 had entered Indian Ocean Region coinciding with a planned Indian long range missile launch but the launch was then deferred and the vessel had re-entered the IOR in December when the missile test was rescheduled. Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Air Chief Marshal V. R. Chaudhari was on an official visit to the island nation in May. During the visit, he donated AN-32 transport aircraft propellers to Commander of Sri Lanka Air Force at Katunayake Air Base. Meanwhile, on August 15, Indian Envoy to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay ceremonially handed over the Indian Navy Dornier aircraft to the Sri Lankan Air Force, a year after the first was handed over, following Sri Lankas request in 2018 for two Dornier Reconnaissance Aircraft to enhance the maritime surveillance capabilities of the island nation. The induction of state-of-the-art Indian Navy Dornier Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft would exponentially increase the surveillance capability of Sri Lanka and would be force multiplier for the Sri Lanka Air Force, the Indian High Commission said in a statement. In June, the Indian mission organised the first India-Sri Lanka Defence Seminar and Exhibition in Colombo to promote and identify newer areas of cooperation and collaboration between the two countries in the defence sector. Last year, the neighbours signed two pacts for Sri Lanka to receive a floating Dock Facility from the Government of India at no cost and the provision of Dornier Reconnaissance Aircraft by India to Sri Lanka free of charge. While neither side had officially announced the signing of the deals, a media clarification by Sri Lankas Ministry of Defence brought the development to light. -with inputs from The Hindu",

        "date": "August 29, 2023 10:50 am",
        "content": "Asias top refiner, Sinopec Corp, is not interested in acquiring Shells refinery or petrochemical plant in Singapore although it is keen on participating in a shale gas project in Saudi Arabia, the Chinese companys president said on Monday. Sinopec President Yu Baocai was speaking after sources last week told Reuters that Shell had hired Goldman Sachs to advise on a potential sale of its Singapore assets and that Sinopec was among the companies reviewing them. However, Yu, speaking at a briefing in Hong Kong after the state-run oil and gas giant reported a 20 decline in interim earnings, said that Sinopec is interested in participating in Saudi Arabias Jafurah shale gas project. This is in line with an earlier Reuters report saying Sinopec and TotalEnergies were in separate discussions with state-run Saudi Aramco to invest in the Jafurah project, the largest shale gas development outside the U.S., with reserves estimated at 200 trillion cubic feet of raw gas. Yu also said that Sinopec was one of the international companies invited by the Sri Lankan government to build a refinery there, and that it was evaluating the matter. Sri Lanka shortlisted Sinopec and commodities trader Vitol to become potential investors in a proposed export-oriented refinery in Hambantota. Separately, Sinopec is set to start operating a retail fuel business in the island nation next month. Yu also said that Russian oil makes up a small fraction of Sinopecs international crude purchases and that it will make dynamic adjustment in future buying based on the global market situation. Chinese refiners have benefited from cheap crude oil supplies from Iran, Venezuela and Russia as Western sanctions have forced those producers to sell oil at deep discounts to keep revenue flowing. Although Chinese state majors have shied away from Iranian and Venezuelan oil, Sinopec has been taking in Russian supplies, traders have said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Export Development Board (EDB) says Sri Lankas earnings from merchandise exports increased by 2.18 in July 2023 compared to June 2023. As per the provisional data released by Sri Lanka Customs, merchandise export earnings in July 2023 have surpassed the USD 1 billion mark, recording a total of USD 1,027.2 million. However, this is a decline of 11.79 as opposed to the value recorded in July 2022, the EDB says. This decline in merchandise exports is due to the reduced demand shown in export products, especially in apparel and textiles, rubber- and rubber-based products and coconut- and coconut-based products. For the period of January to July 2023, overall merchandise exports decreased by 10.26  to USD 6,898.34 million, compared to the corresponding period of 2022. Further, the EDB mentioned that out of top 10 export markets, only UAE has shown strong performance during the month of July 2023 and the period of January to July 2023 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. In addition, India, the UAE and France have shown strong performance during the month of July 2023 compared to July 2022. Exports to the USA, Sri Lankas single largest export destination, decreased 15.60  to USD 253.79 million in July 2023 compared to July 2022.

Accordingly, the Transference of Acknowledgement and the Loan Agreement related to the purpose have been signed by Dutch State Secretary Gunay Uslu and Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayaka and the Director General of the Department of National Museums on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. Six historical objects that are currently on display in the collection of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam in the Netherlands, including the Lewkes cannon, a Golden Kasthane, a Silver Kasthane, a Sinhalese Knife and two Guns that were confirmed to belong to Sri Lanka, will be returned through these ownership transfer documents, according to the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs. Commenting at the event, Minister Wickramanayaka expressed that the relevant artefacts will be brought back to Sri Lanka by December, adding that a special procedure has already been prepared for the safekeeping of these artefacts in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Wickramanayaka mentioned that measures are underway to incorporate the details of such Sri Lankan relics into the school curriculum, with a view to disseminating knowledge about cultural heritage and raising awareness among the students. In 2021 the Dutch government approved the policy for the return of cultural heritage objects that are in the possession of the Dutch State. The indigenous populations of colonial territories were served an injustice through the involuntary loss of objects that formed part of their cultural heritage, said the Dutch government. Therefore Dutch government says it is keen to help rectify this historic injustice by returning cultural heritage objects to their country of origin and by strengthening international cooperation in this area. The official delegation, which arrived in Sri Lanka on Sunday (27), will be staying in Sri Lanka until August 31. It consists of Barbera Wolfensberger, Director General of Culture and Media in the Netherlands; Lilian Gonçalves-Ho Kang You, Chairperson of the Dutch Colonial Collections Committee; and Dr. Alicia Schrikker, a Member of the Committee.",

        "date": "August 29, 2023 12:52 pm",
        "content": "A county in eastern China is offering couples a reward of 1,000 yuan (137) if the bride is aged 25 or younger, the latest measure to incentivise young people to get married amid rising concern over a declining birth rate. The notice, which was published on Changshan countys official Wechat account last week, said the reward was to promote age-appropriate marriage and childbearing for first marriages. It also included a series of childcare, fertility and education subsidies for couples who have children. Concerned about Chinas first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, authorities are urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities. Chinas legal age limit for marriage is 22 for males and 20 for females, but the number of couples getting married has been falling. That has driven down birth rates due to official policies which make it harder for single women to have children. Marriage rates hit a record low in 2022 at 6.8 million, the lowest since 1986, according to government data released in June. There were 800,000 fewer marriages last year than in 2021. Chinas fertility rate, already one of the worlds lowest, is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, state media reported. High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Low consumer confidence and growing concerns over the health of Chinas economy are also key factors cited by young Chinese for not wanting to get married and have children.

Khan was imprisoned on Aug.5 after being sentenced to three years in jail for unlawfully selling state gifts during his tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. As a result of the conviction, and with a national election expected in the coming months, Pakistans Election Commission also barred Khan from contesting elections for five years. Khan had filed an appeal against the conviction. Our application has been accepted, and the sentence has been suspended, Panjutha said on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter. The uncertainty over whether Khan would be automatically released as a result of the High Courts decision is due to other court orders allowing for his arrest in other cases.

        "date": "August 29, 2023 03:00 pm",
        "content": "Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it has suspended operations at all 14 of its assembly plants in Japan due to a production system malfunction, bringing domestic output to a standstill at the worlds biggest-selling automaker. The glitch is preventing Toyota from ordering components and its cause is under investigation, though it is likely not due to a cyberattack, a spokesperson said. Toyota suspended 12 plants in its home market from Tuesday morning and added the final two from the afternoon, the spokesperson said. It was unclear how much output would be lost. The plants together account for about a third of the automakers global production, Reuters calculations showed. Toyotas domestic production had been on the rebound after a series of output cuts it blamed on semiconductor shortage. Output was up 29 in January-June, the first such increase in two years. Its Japan output averaged about 13,500 vehicles daily in the first half of the year, Reuters calculations showed. That excludes vehicles from group automakers Daihatsu and Hino. Operations were halted for a day last year when a supplier suffered a cyberattack, hampering Toyotas ability to order parts. Toyota resumed operations using a back-up network. Tuesdays incident is having a knock-on effect. Group firm Toyota Industries said it has partially suspended operations at two engine plants due to the automakers glitch. Toyota is a pioneer of just-in-time inventory management, which keeps down costs but means supply chain snarls put production at risk. While the cause of the latest malfunction was unclear, corporate Japan has been on alert in recent days as businesses and government offices reported harassing phone calls. The government said the calls were likely from China and related to Japans release of treated radioactive water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. Toyotas share price was up 0.12 at 2,439 yen in afternoon trade after spending much of the morning in negative territory. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "August 29, 2023 03:29 pm",
        "content": "Minister of State for Finance, Shehan Semasinghe, said that among the 2 million Aswesuma beneficiary families, phased payments have commenced for 1.5 million families. In the first phase, a total of Rs. 4.395 billion have been successfully transferred to the bank accounts of 689,803 beneficiaries. Semasinghe stated that the second categorys monetary provision will be enacted starting next week. He conveyed these updates during a press conference held today (29) at the Presidential Media Center under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Highlighting that around Rs. 15 billion is earmarked for assisting the 1.5 million shortlisted beneficiary families, the State Minister emphasized the prompt release of necessary funds for their support. Queries concerning fund matters can be directed to the hotline number 1924 on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Moreover, allowances for disabled individuals, the elderly and kidney patients have already been disbursed, it added. Minister Semasinghe underlined that if Aswesuma benefits were acquired through fraudulent means, legal action would be initiated against such persons and in such cases, efforts to reclaim the disbursed funds will not be hesitated upon. State Minister Semasinghe further said; The government has initiated the disbursement of funds for the initial group entitled to benefits. Presently, 689,803 beneficiary families have received a total of approximately Rs. 4.395 billion in their bank accounts. Among the beneficiaries, 1.5 million families qualify for relief, with an additional 1 million families having submitted applications. Approximately 100,000 families are engaged in protests. In light of these considerations, a collective total of 2 million beneficiary families are selected for relief. Parliament has granted approval to provide benefits to these 2 million low-income families through the Aswesuma relief program. Currently, funds for the first batch have been released, with plans to distribute funds to the second group in the upcoming week. For inquiries or information related to this matter, individuals can contact the hotline at 1924. The funds being disbursed pertain to the month of July, with future arrangements to provide funds for August. The program ensures consistent and guaranteed benefits without any gaps. Notably, these relief measures are provided alongside elderly and disability allowances. The Samurdhi Institute plays a pivotal role in uplifting these families, especially the most vulnerable among them. This empowerment is crucial as beneficiaries will need to reapply for insurance next year. The Aswesuma program aims to assist those who genuinely require support, ensuring the allocation of benefits to families in need. With the empowerment of individuals, the necessity for continuous benefits diminishes. Concurrently, investigations are underway to identify instances of false information submission for illegitimate gains. The Aswesuma Act includes provisions for recovering funds obtained through false means. Recovered funds are then redirected to beneficiaries on the waiting list. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Aswasuma Welfare Benefit Board Mr. Jayantha Wijayaratne, said: The endeavour is underway to extend benefits to eligible families through the Aswasuma program. A sum of Rs. 5 billion has already been deposited into the accounts of 791,000 out of the current 1.5 million qualifying families. Presently, over 683,000 of these families have successfully received their funds. The remaining 111,000 beneficiaries are scheduled to receive their payments in the coming days.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the go-ahead to a proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister, with a view to ensuring an uninterrupted supply of liquefied petroleum (LP) gas in the country from January 2024. Thereby, at its meeting on Monday (Aug. 28), Cabinet approval was granted to purchase 50 of the total supply of the existing contract from the current supplier of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. as a reorder, pursuant to the provisions of government procurement guidelines, for an uninterrupted gas supply after December 21, 2023 until the completion of the companys restructuring process. The Government Information Department said the contract for the supply of 280,000 metric tons of LP gas to Litro Gas Lanka is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023. Thus, the company has called for bids for the supply of LP gas for the period 2024-2025. However, restructuring process of the company is already underway and it appears that entering into new agreements may adversely affect the restructuring process. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the approval to the Presidents resolution to purchase 50 of the total supply of the existing contract from the current supplier of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. as a reorder in a bid to ensure an uninterrupted LP gas supply from January 2024.",

Rajakumari has been placed behind bars on remand until September 11, on the orders of Colombo Magistrates Court. The Sub-Inspector attached to Welikada Police, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), was produced before the court earlier today. Rajakumari, 41, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on May 11 based on a complaint made by her employer, famed producer Sudharma Nethicumara, claiming that she had stolen gold jewellery belonging to her. She had later died while in the custody of the Welikada Police. Her relatives raised suspicions, alleging that she had been subjected to assault. On August 25, the Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala ordered the CID to arrest the suspects linked to the housemaids death. The verdict was delivered after careful examination of evidence and the findings in the post-mortem report submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer. Accordingly, the cause of death was ruled as hemorrhagic shock caused by damage to the deceaseds muscles after being attacked with a blunt weapon or similar force. Further investigations into the incident are conducted by the CID under the supervision of its Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Meryl Ranjan Lamahewa.",

        "date": "August 29, 2023 10:28 pm",
        "content": "In a world first, scientists say an 8cm (3in) worm has been found alive in the brain of an Australian woman. The string-like structure was pulled from the patients damaged frontal lobe during surgery in Canberra last year. It was definitely not what we were expecting. Everyone was shocked, said operating surgeon Dr Hari Priya Bandi. The woman, 64, had for months suffered symptoms like stomach pain, a cough and night sweats, which evolved into forgetfulness and depression. She was admitted to hospital in late January 2021, and a scan later revealed an atypical lesion within the right frontal lobe of the brain. But the cause of her condition was only revealed by Dr Bandis knife during a biopsy in June 2022. The red parasite could have been alive in her brain for up to two months, doctors said. The woman, who lived near a lake area in south-eastern New South Wales state, is recovering well. Her case is believed to be the first instance of a larvae invasion and development in the human brain, researchers said in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal which reported the case. The neurosurgeon who found the worm said she had only begun to touch the brain part that had shown up strangely in the scans when she felt it. I thought, gosh, that feels funny, you couldnt see anything more abnormal, said Dr Bandi. And then I was able to really feel something, and I took my tweezers and I pulled it out and I thought, Gosh! What is that? Its moving! Everyone was shocked. And the worm that we found was happily moving, quite vigorously, outside the brain, she said. She then consulted her colleague Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases expert, on what they should do. Everyone in that operating theatre got the shock of their life when the surgeon took some forceps to pick up an abnormality and the abnormality turned out to be a wriggling, live 8cm light red worm, said Dr Senanayake. Even if you take away the yuck factor, this is a new infection never documented before in a human being. Researchers warn the case highlights the increased danger of diseases and infections being passed from animals to people. The Ophidascaris robertsi roundworm is common in carpet pythons - non-venomous snakes found across much of Australia. Scientists say the woman most likely caught the roundworm after collecting a type of native grass, Warrigal greens, beside a lake near where she lived. The area is also inhabited by carpet pythons. Writing in the journal, Australian parasitology expert Mehrab Hossain said she suspected the woman became an accidental host after using the foraged plants - contaminated by python faeces and parasite eggs - for cooking. The invasion of the brain by Ophidascaris larvae had not been reported previously, writes Dr Hossain. The growth of the third-stage larva in the human host is notable, given that previous experimental studies have not demonstrated larval development in domesticated animals, such as sheep, dogs, and cats. Dr Senanayake - who is also an associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University (ANU) - told the BBC the case is a warning. The ANU team reports that 30 new types of infections have appeared in the last 30 years. Three-quarters are zoonotic - infectious diseases that have jumped from animals to humans. It just shows as a human population burgeons, we move closer and encroach on animal habitats. This is an issue we see again and again, whether its Nipah virus thats gone from wild bats to domestic pigs and then into people, whether its a coronavirus like Sars or Mers that has jumped from bats into possibly a secondary animal and then into humans. Even though Covid is now slowly petering away, it is really important for epidemiologists and governments to make sure theyve got good infectious diseases surveillance around. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "August 30, 2023 11:51 am",
        "content": "A group of senior Gabonese military officers appeared on national television in the early hours of Wednesday and said they had taken power, after the state election body announced President Ali Bongo had won a third term. Appearing on television channel Gabon 24, the officers said they represented all security and defense forces in the Central African nation. They said the election results were canceled, all borders closed until further notice and state institutions dissolved. Loud sounds of gunfire could be heard in the capital Libreville, a Reuters reporter said, after the television appearance. There was no immediate comment from the government of the OPEC-member nation. In the name of the Gabonese people  we have decided to defend the peace by putting an end to the current regime, the officers said. If successful, the coup would represent the eighth in West and Central Africa since 2020. Coups in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger have undermined democratic progress in recent years. Last month, the military snatched power in Niger, sending shockwaves across the Sahel and sucking in global powers with strategic interests at stake. The announcement came just hours after the Gabonese Election Centre (CGE) said on Wednesday that Bongo had won in the presidential election with 64.27 of the vote, after a delay-plagued general election that the opposition has denounced as fraudulent. Announcing the result in the early hours, CGE head Michel Stephane Bonda said Bongos main challenger, Albert Ondo Ossa, had come in second place with 30.77. Bongos team have rejected Ondo Ossas allegations of electoral irregularities. Tensions are running high amid fears of unrest after Saturdays presidential, parliamentary, and legislative vote, which saw Bongo seeking to extend his familys 56-year grip on power while the opposition pushed for change in the oil-rich but poverty-stricken Central African nation. A lack of international observers, the suspension of some foreign broadcasts, and the authorities decision to cut internet service and impose a nighttime curfew nationwide after the poll has raised concerns about the transparency of the electoral process. Bongo, 64, who succeeded his father Omar as president in 2009, had contested against 18 challengers, six of whom backed a joint nominee, former minister and university professor Albert Ondo Ossa, in an effort to narrow the race. In 2016, the parliament building was torched when violent street protests erupted against Bongos contested re-election for his second term. The government shut down internet access for several days at the time. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

It was revealed that the patient is a 49-year-old man residing in the Ja-Ela area, and an employee of an institution in the Ratmalana Medical Officer of Health (MOH) Division. He has been admitted to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defense University (KDU) Hospital, due to an illness, where he was referred to the Colombo National Hospital for some medical tests and further treatment, the Medical Officer of Health in Ratmalana Dr. J.M. Gunathilake said. Dr. Gunathilake further emphasized that about 30 close contacts of this person have been tested at his workplace and measures were taken to provide them with antibiotics. Meanwhile, the Media Spokesman of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe mentioned that identifying at least one person infected with the meningococcus bacteria is also quite alarming. We are requesting the Director of Health Services in charge of the Western Province, as well as the Director of Health Services in charge of the Southern Province, to take the measures to control the spread of brain fever in the Western and Southern provinces, since the schools are scheduled to open in a few days. We also urge them to prepare a proper program to raise awareness among the public since parents may have undue fear regarding the matter, he added. However last week, the Epidemiology Unit emphasized that the general public should not have undue fears about the meningococcal meningitis bacterial disease, since patients suffering from the same illness are reported in Sri Lanka every year, adding that it is not an uncommon occurrence. Earlier in August, two inmates at the Galle Prison died while over a dozen others were hospitalized due to an illness that initially remained unknown. The cause of death and hospitalization was later attributed to meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial form of meningitis caused by meningococcus bacteria.",

Four institutions have initiated a joint investigation into the matter, and a report is slated to be expeditiously submitted within the next few days.",

In late July, a three-member committee was appointed by Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Roshan Ranasinghe to call for and hold the FFSL elections. The electoral committee has accepted the nominations of 08 remaining candidates from Sumathipalas camp while accepting all nominations submitted by his rival faction led by former president Jaswar Umar, who vies for the FFSL presidency. Accordingly, Jaswar Umars camp has gained more chances to win the election, scheduled to be held on September 29. It is reported that the nominations of Dacshitha Sumathipala who was proposed for FFSL presidency, T.L. Udunuwara (Wattala League) who sought FFSL vice presidency, and Nalaka Dissanayake (Sri Lanka Schools), Nihal Perera (Wattala League) and Heshini Ariyaratne (Deniyaya League) who had nominated themselves for the federations executive committee have been rejected, after considering the inactivity of their affiliated leagues for 4 years. They have been given the opportunity to file appeals against the nomination rejection before September 03. If the appeals of Sumathipalas faction too face rejection, Jaswar Umar will be elected as FFLS president unopposed. The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) on December 25, 2022, had issued a red notice to Sri Lankan Football authorities, raising concerns over the Electoral roadmap of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka. Against this backdrop, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) approved and included Sri Lanka in the official World Cup draw on a strict conditional basis. Thereby, the FFSL was required to conduct its election at least 10 days prior to World Cup match. Later on, the FFSL decided to hold the elections of the federation in September, in order to allow Sri Lanka to participate in the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) World Cup qualifiers. On August 28, the world football governing body decided to lift the suspension imposed on the FFSL, however, it will continue to monitor the situation along with AFC until the FFSL elections are held.",

        "date": "August 30, 2023 06:16 pm",
        "content": "An extraordinary combination of a supermoon and a blue moon will be visible tonight (Aug 30) in the sky, Chairman of the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies Prof. Chandana Jayaratne said. Meanwhile, as the full moon occurs when the moon is at its closest to the Earth in its orbit, the moon will be 14 bigger and 30 brighter than some of the other usually occurring full moons, according to the professor. When a full moon takes place while the moon is near its closest approach to Earth, it is called a Super Full Moon or a Supermoon. On 2023 August 31st at 7.05 a.m., the moon will be closest to the Earth with a distance of 357,344 km from the Earth, he said. Furthermore, Prof. Jayaratne pointed out that the moon would not get any closer to the Earth until November 2025. Size and brightness of the full moons on Poya days vary slightly from month to month because of the non-circular but elliptical shape of the moons orbit around the earth with the closest distance of the moon to the earth (perigee) being about 50,000 km closer than the furthest distance (apogee), the professor emphasized. Commenting further regarding the matter, Prof. Jayaratne, Head of the Physics Department of University of Colombo said: When two full moons fall on the same month, the second full moon is called the blue moon. This is just a name and the moon actually does not appear in blue colour. Though you can see the full moon from the 30th dusk after the sunset in the eastern skies, the best time to observe this super blue moon is August 31 predawn period before sunrise, on the western skies to see the big moon with ringed bright Saturn, which is at opposition these days, closer to the moon. If you miss this opportunity, youll have to wait until January and March 2037 for the next super blue moons. There will be somewhat high tide on this day due to the closeness of the moon but no earthquakes or other natural disasters have been reported in the past on similar occasions, though there are rumours spreading about the onset of natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones.",

        "date": "August 31, 2023 11:32 am",
        "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to skip a summit of G20 leaders in India next week, sources familiar with the matter in India and China told Reuters. Two Indian officials, one diplomat based in China and one official working for the government of another G20 country said Premier Li Qiang is expected to represent Beijing at the Sept. 9-10 meeting in New Delhi. Spokespersons for the Indian and Chinese foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment. The summit in India had been viewed as a venue at which Xi may meet with U.S. President Joe Biden, who has confirmed his attendance, as the two superpowers seek to stabilise relations soured by a range of trade and geopolitical tensions. Xi last met Biden on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia last November. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already announced that he will not be travelling to New Delhi and will send Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov instead. One senior government official from host India told Reuters that we are aware that the premier will come, in place of Xi. In China, two foreign diplomats and a government official from another G20 country said that Xi will likely not be travelling for the summit. The sources in China, two of whom said they were informed by Chinese officials, said they were not aware of the reason for his expected absence. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Anticipation of a meeting between Xi and Biden has been fuelled by a stream of top U.S. officials visiting Beijing in recent months, including a trip by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo earlier this week. Another upcoming summit mooted for face-to-face talks between the two leaders is an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders Meeting in San Francisco on Nov. 12-18. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as leader last October, has made few overseas trips since China abruptly dropped strict pandemic-induced border controls this year. He did, however, attend a meeting from leaders of the BRICS group of major emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - in South Africa last week. Several G20 ministerial meetings in India ahead of the summit have been contentious as Russia and China together opposed joint statements which included paragraphs condemning Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine last year. Xi and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a rare conversation on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting in Johannesburg and discussed reducing tensions in the bilateral relationship that soured after clashes along their Himalayan frontier in 2020 left 24 soldiers dead.

        "content": "Sinopec, a Beijing-based leading international petroleum company, has officially kicked off its business operations in Sri Lanka, by supplying fuel at its first filing station on the island established in Mattegoda, Colombo. Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka, the local subsidiary of the Chinese petroleum giant began its retail operations on Wednesday (Aug. 30), with a market promotion campaign. Accordingly, petrol and diesel are pumped at a discount of Rs. 3.00 per liter. Last year, the Sri Lankan government decided to open up Sri Lankas fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations in a bid to address the foreign exchange crisis. The Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill also received the approval of ministerial consultative committee on power  energy, paving way for the new suppliers to enter the local fuel market as importers, distributers, and retail operators for petroleum products. In March 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to award licenses to Chinas Sinopec, Australias United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell PLC, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka. Subsequently, negotiations were completed with Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka and its parent company for a long-term contract on the importation, storage, distribution and sale of petroleum products across the island nation. Later in May 2023, a contract agreement was inked between Sri Lankan and Sinopec representatives, marking a crucial step in ensuring a steady and uninterrupted fuel supply in the country. Under this deal, Sinopec is granted a 20-year license to operate 150 filling stations in Sri Lanka, and will also be able to invest in 50 new filling stations. Sri Lankas fuel retail market remained a state monopoly under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) until 2003 when the Indian Company (IOC) commenced operations here.",

        "title": "SriLankan Airlines on expansion spree, Kerala to get topmost priority",
        "date": "August 31, 2023 01:51 pm",
        "content": "SriLankan Airlines is all set to expand its operations in Kerala. The airline is likely to add one more flight to Thiruvananthapuram during the coming winter schedule. At present, the airline operates six flights a week from Thiruvananthapuram and 10 flights from Kochi. The airline is also looking forward to starting service from Kozhikode airport based on the availability of aircraft. V. Ravindran, the national carriers regional manager of India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, told TNIE that SriLankan Airlines is on an expansion drive and will start more flights to various destinations in India. Priority is being given to Kerala, as many people from the state are travelling to Sri Lanka as tourists. Sri Lanka has cheaper hotels and accommodation facilities. Compared to other countries, including the Maldives, Sri Lanka has better destinations with cheaper packages. So we are getting frequent passengers from Kerala. That is why we decided to expand our operations in Kerala. As an immediate plan, we will start one more service from Thiruvananthapuram during the winter schedule, Ravindran said. He pointed out that the business prospects of the Vizhinjam port will be immense, as it will enhance the connectivity of air cargo between Colombo and Thiruvananthapuram in the future. There has been a steep rise in passengers from India to Sri Lanka in the past seven months. It indicates that Sri Lanka has become a preferred tourist destination for people from India, especially from Kerala, Ravindran added. As part of increasing air connectivity from Thiruvananthapuram to Colombo, the SriLankan airlines have appointed Sandun Jayasinghe as an area manager in Thiruvananthapuram. Ravindran also said that the Sri Lankan government is in talks with many private airlines, including Tata, Adani, and Emirates, to privatise the airline. The crisis in Sri Lanka last year prompted the airlines to depend on Thiruvananthapuram airport for refuelling purposes and for technical landings. Ravindran said that things are getting normal in Sri Lanka, and hence, the business of the airline is also picking up. Launched in 1979, SriLankan Airlines is currently expanding and further diversifying its wide range of products and services to drive the countrys ongoing boom in tourism and economy. The airlines hub is located at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo, providing convenient connections to its global route network of 112 destinations in 58 countries. SriLankan Airlines has a global workforce of approximately 6,000 employees based in Sri Lanka and abroad. The airline has training programmes in all aviation-related fields in order to cater to its own expansion and the constant need to replace its staff as they are in high demand in the aviation sector.

        "title": "ICRC reminds Sri Lankan authorities of missing persons",
        "date": "August 31, 2023 03:50 pm",
        "content": "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says that the authorities, community and society should acknowledge at large that when people go missing, it causes anguish and uncertainty for their families who continue to live in a state of ambiguity, not knowing whether their loved one is alive or dead. Issuing a statement on the International Day of the Disappeared, which falls on August 30, the ICRC mentions that for many families of missing persons, knowing what has happened to their relatives is the most pressing need. In most situations, the missing person is often the breadwinner of the family, and their absence exacerbates the economic, legal and administrative challenges of families who struggle with the multiple consequences that they are faced with, it added. The ICRC which expresses that time does not heal, and only the answers do, further emphasizes that people have the right to know what happened to their missing relatives and authorities have an obligation to provide information and assist efforts to ascertain the fate and whereabouts of missing persons. This is enshrined in international humanitarian law, which also requires parties to a conflict to take measures to ensure that people do not go missing in an armed conflict, the statement highlighted. Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross claims that increased and continuous efforts are needed to search for missing persons and to provide individualized answers on their fate and whereabouts to their families. These include, amongst many others, the strengthening of national frameworks and systems, including medico-legal ones; putting in place or improving existing processes and mechanisms dedicated to establishing the fate and whereabouts of missing persons; and the collection and processing of information on missing persons and the events in which they went missing, as well as on human remains and possible human remains sites, it said. The ICRC, which mentions that Sri Lanka has not been spared from this humanitarian tragedy, also pointed out that in 2023, thousands of families of missing persons from all communities across the country continue to suffer due to the uncertainty surrounding the fate of their missing loved ones. It further stated that it is important that they receive answers on the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives, adding that while every effort must be made to establish the fate of missing persons, their relatives must also be enabled to live in dignity. In Sri Lanka, the ICRC implements an island-wide support programme that addresses the emotional, economic, legal and administrative needs of families of missing persons. Concurrently, the ICRC has been working with authorities and relevant stakeholders to build their capacities to address the multifaceted needs of families, including their need to know. In addition, the ICRC stands ready to continue sharing its global expertise with relevant stakeholders in Sri Lanka, in order to contribute to the process of clarifying the fate and whereabouts of missing persons, in accordance with its humanitarian mandate. Last week, the Office of the Missing Persons in Sri Lanka asserted that justice will be served for the families of Sri Lankas missing persons within a period of 06 months. There, the Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons, Attorney-at-Law Mahesh Katulanda emphasized that they have fast-tracked the tracing mechanism with regard to the missing persons and that the process is being carried out transparently. However, Katulanda expressed that the Office on Missing Persons will end the preliminary investigations of the first phase regarding the missing individuals before December, adding that once the investigations of the first phase are completed, the relatives of the missing persons who are willing to obtain the missing persons certificates Certificates of absence for missing persons relatives or death certificates will be provided with the relevant certificates. He further asserted that those relatives, who are willing to obtain revival payments, will accordingly receive the relevant payments through the Office for Reparations, based on recommendations by the Office on Missing Persons. Katulanda also highlighted the mechanism of the Office on Missing Persons includes supporting the rebuilding of the economy of any family that has been broken down due to missing persons.",

        "date": "August 31, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella has instructed the ministrys officials to urgently take measures for recruiting 3,000 more nurses to the nursing service in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the minister has directed the ministrys secretary to prepare a cabinet paper in this regard, if any issue prevails pertaining to the matter. Rambukwella had issued these instructions during a discussion which was held recently (29) at the Health Ministry with the participation of the officials related to the nursing service in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it has been targeted to recruit around 2,500 nursing trainees who were recruited for nursing training in the year 2018, and 500 nursing graduates to the service. Moreover, the Health Ministry has planned to publish the gazette notification related to the calling of applications for nursing training in the 20192020 Advanced Level category by mid-September. The selected applicants will be referred for three-year nursing training. Last July, a total of 3,315 individuals were enrolled for nursing training from the 20182019 Advanced Level category, bringing the tally of training nurses in Sri Lanka up to 6,700. During the discussion, Minister Rambukwella has further directed the officials that even if there were some disruptions in the recruitment process of nurses, during the global pandemic situation of Covid-19, steps must be taken to carry out the process in a timely manner in the future. Rambukwella pointed out that the youth continue to work for opportunities like this with great hope, following the completion of G.C.E. Advanced Level, adding that the relevant officials should work positively towards the matter by properly understanding such situations. The Health Minister has also drawn the attention of the officials to several other issues pertaining to the nursing service while directing them to follow a proper transfer procedure for transfers in the nursing service. He has further expressed that in some instances, people who have been working in the same hospital for multiple years are severely affected, while instructing them to follow more positive measures such as directing the nursing officers who have completed a certain service period for transfers in a proper procedure.",

        "date": "August 31, 2023 04:06 pm",
        "content": "Another 52 were injured, some suffering from smoke inhalation, and were taken for treatment at local hospitals, Emergency Management Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said. We have now 73 fatalities and 52 people injured who were transported to various healthcare facilities for further medical care, Mulaudzi said. At least seven children were among those killed by the flames, in what is on track to become one of the deadliest fires worldwide in recent years. The youngest victim was less than two years old, he said. Some were left burned beyond recognition. Firefighters at the scene have put out the flames and are busy with damping down, while search and recovery operations are ongoing, Mulaudzi said. We are moving floor by floor conducting these body recoveries, he told local broadcaster ENCA. An AFP reporter at the scene said emergency services were continuing to bring charred bodies out of the building, laying them down under blankets and sheets on the street outside. It is indeed a sad day for the city of Johannesburg... over 20 years in the service, Ive never come across something like this, Mulaudzi said. It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, which broke out overnight. Mgcini Tshwaku, a member of the citys mayoral committee in charge of public safety, said candles used for lighting inside the structure were a likely cause. The building, which has been evacuated, is located in a deprived area of what used to be the business district of South Africas economic hub and was used as an informal settlement, Mulaudzi said, suggesting many may have been squatting there illegally. Inside the building itself there was a (security) gate which was closed so people couldnt get out, said Tshwaku. Many burned bodies were found stashed at that gate. Fire trucks and ambulances were parked outside the red and white building with burned-out windows which has been cordoned off by police, as a small crowd of onlookers gathered in the area. Illegal occupation of disused buildings in the city centre is widespread, with many said to be under the control of criminal syndicates who collect rent from occupants. Authorities estimated more than 80 shacks were set up inside. The fire spread very quickly affecting different levels of the building because of the combustible materials used, said Mulaudzi. The blaze was the deadliest in South Africa in recent years and one of the worst worldwide. In December last year, a fuel tanker blast near Johannesburg killed 34 people, while in June, flames ripped through a dilapidated building in the city and killed two children under 10 who were locked in an apartment.

The 23-year-old was taken into custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Colombo today (Aug. 31). A moneylender, 44, was shot in Korawa, South Thalangama last Friday (Aug. 25) by a gunman who arrived on a motorcycle with an accomplice. He succumbed to injuries after being admitted to the Colombo National Hospital. The duo had fled the scene after opening fire at the victim in broad daylight. It is reported that Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in charge of Nugegoda Police Division J.P.S. Jayamaha had received a tip-off about the accomplices attempt to flee the country. While the suspect was boarding a flight destined for Singapore, the police managed to secure an overseas travel ban against him. After being briefed about the situation, Singaporean authorities deported the suspect to Sri Lanka soon after he landed there. Upon his return, the youth, identified as a resident of Athurugiriya area, was placed under arrest by Sri Lankan law enforcement authorities. Further investigations revealed that the perpetrators had carried out the shooting on the instructions of a criminal gang member operating under the alias Athurugiriye Ladiya. The suspect, who is slated to be produced before Kaduwela Magistrates Court, will be further interrogated after the police secure a detention order on him.",
