        "content": "The Cyber Crime wing of Indias Cuddalore police have arrested a Sri Lankan national for allegedly swindling INR 60 lakh (approximately LKR 23.5 million) from an IT professional in Cuddalore by offering online part-time jobs. According to the Cyber Crime police, the complainant S. Sampath, 32 of Kurunjipadi, received a message offering an online part-time job through the Telegram app. He was lured by an unidentified person offering money for completing certain tasks online. Sampath was promised good returns for a small investment for reviewing the app. Sampath was then moved to a bigger Telegram group where he continued to perform tasks and made payments to the tune of 60 lakh to a bank account. He eventually lost the money to the fraudsters, following which he lodged a complaint with the Cyber Crime police. On the directions of Superintendent of Police R. Rajaram, a thorough investigation was conducted by the Cyber Crime wing. The team traced the last transaction of 6 lakh made to an account holder and obtained the KYC of the suspected bank account. The details of the account-holder and linked mobile number were collected from the bank. It was found that the account belonged to Salman Mohammed Farook, 26, a Sri Lankan national, residing at Ambattur in Chennai. Police said the kingpin of the online scam was from China. The police arrested Salman in Chennai on Tuesday and brought him to Cuddalore. He was produced before a local court here and remanded to custody in the Cuddalore Central Prison.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that even in the face of the countrys economic crisis, the current government protected the public servants. He said all government employees have been able to continue their services despite the economic crisis. Speaking at the Gampaha District Progress Review Meeting of the National Integration Participation Development Program Aluth Gamak - Aluth Ratak held at the Gampaha District Secretariat on Wednesday (06), the Prime Minister mentioned that the Grama Niladhari Service Minute will be implemented within the next few months. Speaking on this occasion the Prime Minister stated that; Last year we faced an unprecedented economic and financial problem. Though it is politically good or bad, the government has admitted that our country has confronted with a financial crisis. Accordingly, discussions were held with international organizations. This is not the first time that Sri Lanka has gone towards IMF and World Bank. Every government worked with them. Malaysia faced this kind of economic collapse. Today there is a developed economy in Malaysia, which revived the economy by developing the entire Government sector. Likewise even European countries collapsed. I remember the first decision made there. Initially Greece sent half of its public servants to their homes. They informed pensioners that they could not pay for them. But we didnt do that. We informed IMF and the World Bank strongly as a government that we are not moving towards that solution. Accordingly, all government employees have been able to continue their services. There are 14,000 Grama Seva Divisions. We are taking necessary steps to bring the Grama Niladhari Service Minute in a few months. Let us work together with the priority of leading the country to continuous economic growth. There are several government officers in a Grama Seva division. They are bound to implement the development committee plan as a district under the Government Agent in accordance with the instructions given by the development committee leaders of the government. It is necessary to establish a rural development plan. Many important facts were revealed here. We hope that every Grama Seva Divisions will increase the production compared to last year. Investments can be done in the fields of food production, other industrial crops, raw materials or assembling industries. We are sure that this year 2024 will definitely be a year of economic growth. We must now enter into the preparation of development plans by collecting the information of each village. A new country, a new village (Aluth Gamak - Aluth Ratak) program was introduced to increase production, create new and diverse fields as the main focus of a development plan. We have started to become self-sufficient in terms of food. Every village cannot be self-sufficient in every aspect. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to allocate a special allocation for the elderly. There should be a continuous increase in allowances for the elderly. It is for this purpose that the expenditure headings in the budget have been increased. We are committed to cover the elderly and those who are suffering from other illnesses. The Government Agent can bring the information from every district and consolidate the information. Therefore, with this information, we should intervene to cover all the disabled, elderly, diseased and disabled people in the district. We are in the public service. Financial provision has been allocated in the budget to ensure lifelong career and training for the children who leave after completing their education. The need to identify and deal with those programs is recalled again. The Government sector cannot cover all the aspects. So the support of the private sector is required. The joint ventures that can be created by inviting foreign investments can further develop the economy. Government officials should intervene to act carefully. Ministers Prasanna Ranatunga, Nalin Fernando, Western Province Governor Roshan Gunathilaka, State Ministers Janaka Wakkumbura, Ashoka Priyantha, Indika Anuruddha, Sisira Jayakodi, Prasanna Ranaweera, Members of Parliament Sahan Pradeep, Kokila Gunawardena, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksa, Milan Jayathilaka, Yadamini Gunawardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration Ranjith Ashoka, Western Provincial Secretary Pradeep Yasaratne, Gampaha District Secretary Saman Darshana Padi Korala and other government officials participated in this event, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division.",

        "date": "December 7, 2023 03:46 pm",
        "content": "The Road Development Authority (RDA) has informed the street food vendors at Kimbulawala to remove their stalls and vacate the location by Friday (Dec. 08), according to the vendors. The Kimbulawala street food vendors further stress that although a written notification has been given in this regard, the reason for the decision to vacate the area has not been specified. Earlier in August, the RDA had asked the Kimbulawala street food vendors to remove their stalls within a period of 14 days, citing that the stalls had been built without permission, in a way that obstructs vehicular movement on the roads. The RDA further emphasized that the decision was arrived at in consideration of the increasing number of complaints received daily, expressing concerns about road accidents that have occurred in the area as a result of these mobile street food establishments. Previously, the Urban Development Authority had decided to remove these stalls, but later gave permission to continue to run their businesses after an agreement was reached between the food stall venders and the relevant authorities. At the time, the venders had agreed to move the stalls slightly back from the main road, but some of the stalls are still blocking the road, as per previous statements made by the RDA. Against this backdrop, the Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), who carried out inspections in the street food stalls established in Kottawa and Thalawathugoda areas last week, had taken legal action against 14 food stalls, while 06 other stalls were warned over selling unhealthy food that were unfit for human consumption.",

        "content": "Supun Shashendra Pathirage, the former chairman of Central Environment Authority (CEA) has filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition against his arrest over the alleged soliciting of a bribe. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), its chairman Eva Wanasundera and the commissions members have been named as the respondents of this petition. Petitioner says he had rejected an application seeking the renewal of a license in respect of a marine fuel refining operation, based on six reasons. H claims that he was subjected to pressurization from politicians and several other parties urging him to clear the said application. Pathirage says he was later arrested on bribery charges accusing him of soliciting a bribe of Rs. 10 million to issue the relevant application. Thus the former CEA chairman has requested the Supreme Court to deliver an order determining that the Bribery Commissions move to arrest him was done with malicious intent and that his fundamental rights were violated. Two days after his arrest, Pathirage was suspended from service on November 12. He was, however, released on bail the following day.",

        "title": "Japan to legalise cannabis-based medicines",
        "date": "December 7, 2023 05:27 pm",
        "content": "Japans parliament has passed a bill to legalise cannabis-based medicines in a landmark revision of its stringent drug laws, while toughening its ban on recreational use of marijuana. The changes to Japans cannabis and narcotics control laws passed on Wednesday in the upper house will pave the way for the lifting of a ban on medical products derived from cannabis. Cannabis-based medicines, produced with the active ingredient cannabidiol, or CBD, are already used overseas to treat various conditions such as severe epilepsy. This is a win for patient groups that have campaigned for access to these medicines. However, the changes amount to a tightening of Japans already tough cannabis policy. Marijuana consumption was criminalised, closing a loophole that officials partly blamed for a recent rise in cannabis-related arrests. Prior to the revisions, inhaling marijuana had been technically legal, whereas possessing it was punishable by a jail term of up to five years. The loophole was originally introduced to prevent farmers from being arrested for accidentally inhaling psychoactive smoke when growing hemp. But alarmed by the recent spike in arrests over cannabis, especially among young people including teens, authorities decided to take things up a notch. Under the revised laws, those caught using or possessing marijuana can face a prison sentence of up to seven years. Health ministry statistics show the number of arrests related to cannabis hit a record 5,783 in 2021, with a marked rise among teens and those in their 20s. And according to a 2020 police probe into 748 people arrested over marijuana possession, nearly 30 percent cited the lack of penalties against consumption as an emboldening factor. As more and more young people gravitate toward abusing marijuana, we hope this revision will put a brake on the trend, top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno said Wednesday after the bill cleared parliament. Japans CBD market has flourished in recent years, swelling from just 3 million in industry value in 2015 to an estimated 59 million in 2019, according to Tokyo-based research firm Visiongraph. The new rule against consumption will leave CBD products unregulated, as it will only target THC -- the psychoactive substance that makes people high, a health ministry official told AFP. Japans Cannabis Control Act was introduced in 1948 during the post-war US occupation, but it is not an outlier in Asia where tough penalties for drug use are the norm. Still, decades of a strident government crusade against illegal drugs, synonymous with the mantra of dame zettai (absolutely not), have led to marijuana being heavily stigmatised in Japan. Just 1.4 percent of people in Japan say they have tried marijuana, compared to more than 40 percent in France and around half in the United States, data compiled by the health ministry show. Japans tough anti-cannabis laws have ensnared international stars including Beatle Paul McCartney, who spent nine days in detention in 1980 after the drug was found in his baggage.

        "date": "December 7, 2023 06:49 pm",
        "content": "Italian opera singing has been added to the United Nations cultural heritage list. Unesco, the UN culture agency, announced it was including the four-centuries-old art, mixing costume, drama and music, under its category of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Italian opera developed in the late 1500s and early 1600s in Florence, at the court of the Medici family. It typically involves intricate plots, elaborate staging and virtuoso singing. Opera singing joins other famed Italian practices, such as pizza-making and the art of scaling the Alpine peaks. This is an official confirmation of what we already knew: opera singing is a world excellence, Italys Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said in a statement after Unescos decision. Unesco described Italian opera as a physiologically controlled way of singing that enhances the carrying power of the voice in acoustic spaces such as amphitheatres and churches. It added that the art promoted collective cohesion and sociocultural memory, as well as being a means of free expression and intergenerational dialogue. The first great composer of opera is considered to be Italys Claudio Monteverdi, who lived from 1567 to 1643. Italys La Repubblica newspaper points out that the accolade comes on the eve of the traditional inauguration of the 2023-24 season at the La Scala opera house. Today there are about 60 opera houses across Italy - a global record - while opera singers such as 20th-Century tenor Luciano Pavarotti have been venerated as major stars. Italian soprano Carmela Remigio told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that it was thanks to the opera and its librettos that Italian language was still known in the world. That something as alive is singing has entered the heritage of humanity is a great emotion, she said. The song fades as you listen to it, but it touches you deeply. Making the announcement at a meeting in Botswana on the safeguarding of cultural heritage, Unesco also listed Peruvian ceviche, Bangladeshi rickshaw painting, Uzbek ceramic crafts, loincloth weaving in Ivory Coast and several other customs and traditions as part of humanitys intangible cultural heritage. The Peruvian government cheered ceviches addition to the list, with the culture ministry saying it recognises all the people involved in the chain of this dish, including artisanal fishermen along the coast and in the Andes and the Amazon, and the farmers and chefs.

        "content": "Sri Lanka has won the respect of its international partners for maintaining neutrality in practising foreign policy and this helped the country in striking a much-needed bailout package with the IMF, the island nations Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Parliament on Thursday. Sri Lanka had succeeded in pursuing a policy of friendship to all and enmity to none, Sabry said. The challenge we faced was that we should not be drawn into any particular camp and seen as an extension of any particular country or any region or a particular alliance, the minister said, without naming any country. Sabry said President Ranil Wickremesinghe was able to communicate with many world leaders to articulate Sri Lankas vision. He visited India, he visited China, he visited Japan twice, he visited Germany, France, and went to the UN. I think because we have done that without getting entangled into any pro-country strategy and standing together as an independent sovereign state we have got the respect Sri Lanka richly deserves, Sabry said. Sabry said Sri Lanka remains committed to the Palestine cause. We have maintained our solidarity with Palestine. He said Sri Lanka is the current chair of the UN committee on Israeli practices in Palestine. Sri Lankas success in foreign policy was proved in many UN assembly votes where the island nations candidates had received favour of support in voting, the minister said. The non-aligned foreign policy was the key to Sri Lanka striking the bailout with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said. Many powerful countries had assisted in the ongoing talks for external debt restructuring, he added. Sabry said Sri Lanka would be formally out of its bankrupt status by later this month when the IMF will likely release its second tranche of the USD 2.9 billion facility. Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 which saw the ouster of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government mid-year. The island nation announced its first-ever sovereign default since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. The Rajapaksas and their fiscal hierarchy were found responsible for the economic downturn by Sri Lankas Supreme Court under a fundamental rights petition.",

        "title": "US criticizes Israel on Gaza civilian toll as UN to hear ceasefire demand",
        "date": "December 8, 2023 10:10 am",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in his strongest public criticism of Israels conduct of the war on Hamas in south Gaza, said there was a gap between the governments declared intentions to protect civilians and the casualties. As we stand here almost a week into this campaign into the south ... it remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection, Blinken said at a press conference following a meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron in Washington on Thursday. And there does remain a gap between ... the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that were seeing on the ground, Blinken said. Israel says it must wipe out the Hamas militant group after its attack on Israel two months ago and is doing everything possible to get civilians out of harms way, including warnings about military operations. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke separately by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordans King Abdullah on Thursday. Biden emphasized the critical need to protect civilians and to separate the civilian population from Hamas including through corridors that allow people to move safely from defined areas of hostilities, the White House said. More than 17,170 Palestinians have been killed and 46,000 wounded, according to the Gaza health ministry, since Oct. 7, when Israel began bombarding Gaza in response to a cross-border rampage by Hamas militants who control the enclave. The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people, with 240 people taken hostage, according to Israels tally. Ceasefire Demand at UN as Gaza Fighting Rages Hundreds more Palestinians were killed as Israel fought Hamas militants in the Gaza Strips biggest cities on Thursday - 350 people according to Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra. Israel said its forces killed a number of gunmen in Khan Younis, including two who emerged firing from a tunnel. Arab states have renewed their push for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and to that end, the United Arab Emirates has asked for the U.N. Security Council to vote on Friday morning on a draft resolution. The United States and ally Israel oppose a ceasefire because they believe it would only benefit Hamas. Blinken is due to meet top diplomats from Arab states, including Egypt, on Friday in Washington. The draft was amended to say both the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law and to demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. A resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, France or Britain - to be adopted. The U.S. does not support any further action by the council at this time. Kerem Shalom Border Crossing to Open In a development that should help smooth the way for more humanitarian aid to reach besieged Gazans short of basic needs, Israel agreed at the request of the United States to open the Kerem Shalom border crossing for the screening and inspection of trucks and their cargo, a U.S. official said on Thursday. Egypt, along with the United Nations, has been lobbying Israel to speed up an inspection process, which requires the vehicles to drive to Egypts border with Israel before looping back to Rafah. The number of trucks crossing daily has dropped to fewer than 100, from nearly 200 during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 truce, according to the United Nations. The humanitarian pause also allowed for the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for prisoners being freed from Israeli jails. In Israel, Colonel Elad Goren, head of the civil department at COGAT, the Israeli agency for civilian coordination with the Palestinians, told reporters: We will open Kerem Shalom just for inspection. It will happen in the next few days. Kerem Shalom sits at Gazas southern border with Israel and Egypt and the crossing was used to carry more than 60 of the truckloads going into Gaza before war erupted two months ago. With no end in sight to the fighting, a top White House national security aide, Jon Finer, said the United States had not given Israel a firm deadline to end major combat operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. There are many legitimate military targets remaining in south Gaza including much if not most of the Hamas leadership, Finer said at the Aspen Security Forum in Washington. Meanwhile, hostages still held by Hamas have been kept incommunicado in Gaza despite Israels calls on the Red Cross to arrange visits and verify their wellbeing. Marking two months since Hamas attack, the start of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah was a solemn moment for many in Israel. Idit Ohel, whose son Alon, 22, was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from an outdoor music festival where 364 people were killed, said she was hoping for a miracle. He doesnt know its Hanukkah. I dont think he knows the days, whats day, whats night, said Ohel. But hes in our hearts all the time. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The significant diplomatic encounter took place on Thursday (Dec.07), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Joint Himalayan Declaration, a collaborative effort between the Global Tamil Forum and the Buddhist delegation, advocates for a pluralistic Sri Lanka that actively promotes the well-being of all its communities. While emphasizing the importance of learning from the nations historical missteps, the declaration underscores the necessity for implementing measures that ensure accountability.

Global Tamil Forum, an influential Tamil diaspora group based in the UK was blacklisted in 2014 by then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, however, it was delisted by his predecessor Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. The ban was put in place again by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and was lifted by President Wickremesinghe in August 2022, as it was found to be no longer funding terrorist activities.",

        "content": "The Defence Ministry has granted permission to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to detain the two notorious underworld figures Harak Kata and Kudu Salindu for another 90 days. The CID has communicated this to the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. On December 06, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID to produce Harak Kata before a suitable Magistrates Court if the evidence against him is insufficient to keep him in custody on detention orders. Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu were arrested in Madagascar on March 01 this year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island on March 15 after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of 8 suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. The extradition process had been coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar. Following their extradition, the Defence Ministry issued an initial 90-day order to detain the two underworld figures under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicates in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar, had been wanted for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies, as well as transnational narcotics trafficking. Meanwhile, Kudu Salindu is accused of orchestrating at least 09 murders and fatally injuring four others. While in the custody of CID on detention, Harak Kata also attempted an escape bid at the CID premises in September, which was ultimately foiled by the officials. The police have offered a cash reward of Rs. 2.5 million for a tip-off about the Constable who aided and abetted the ill-famed underworld figures escape bid and remains in hiding to date. Thus far the mother and the brother-in-law of the said Constable, another police officer, and a former sniper of Sri Lanka Army have been arrested over Harak Katas failed attempt to flee.",

        "date": "December 8, 2023 03:11 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a USD 200 million concessional loan for Sri Lanka to help stabilize the countrys finance sector following the sovereign debt and economic crises that started in April 2022 after it suspended its external debt payments. The Financial Sector Stability and Reforms Program comprises two subprograms of USD 200 million each. In a statement, the ADB said subprogram 1 targets short-term stabilization and crisis management measures that were implemented in 2023, while subprogram 2 is planned to be implemented in 2024 and focuses on structural reforms and long-term actions to restore growth in the banking sector. The program will help strengthen the stability and governance of the countrys banking sector; improve the banking sectors asset quality; and deepen sustainable and inclusive finance, particularly for women-led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. According to the International Monetary Funds (IMF) latest review, Sri Lankas economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization, although a full economic recovery is not yet assured, the statement reads. The programs overarching development objective is fully aligned with the countrys strategy of maintaining finance sector stability, while ensuring that banks are well-positioned for eventual recovery, said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. The expected development outcome is a stable financial system providing access to affordable finance for businesses in various sectors of the economy. The program is a follow-on assistance from ADBs crisis response under the special policy-based loan that was approved for Sri Lanka in May 2023. It is aligned with the fourth pillar of the IMFs Extended Fund Facility provided to Sri Lanka to help the country regain financial stability. The program is also in line with the governments reform agenda, including strengthening the operational independence of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and its designation as the countrys macroprudential authority. In designing this subprogram 1 loan, ADB has maintained close coordination and collaboration with the IMF to design targeted regulatory reforms for the banking sectorincluding the asset quality reviewand with the World Bank on strengthening the deposit insurance scheme. The loan is accompanied by a USD 1 million grant from ADBs Technical Assistance Special Fund to provide advisory, knowledge, and institutional capacity building for Sri Lankas Ministry of Finance and CBSL. ADB says it is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.",

        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources  Sustainable Development has recommended that the use of lunch sheets be banned in Sri Lanka, in a bid to further develop the countrys recycling system. The recommendation was made at a Committee meeting held on 05 December, under the chairmanship of MP Ajith Mannapperuma, along with the participation of officials representing the Ministry of Environment, Central Environment Authority, Sri Lanka Customs and the Department of Agricultural Development. Accordingly, the environmental damage caused by the use of lunch sheets in this country as well as the effect of phthalates, a carcinogen, on human lives, was discussed at length, following which the Committee recommended that the use of lunch sheets be banned. It was recommended that use of lunch sheets be banned, and that a grace period of six months be allowed to remove it from use and introduce alternatives. The officials of the Ministry of Environment pointed out that lunch sheets are not used in any other country in the world, thereby highlighting to the Committee the importance of not using lunch sheets. The officials stated that the amendments currently presented for the purpose of being amended under the Environment Act were considered in the Committee and several special points have been proposed to reduce the use of polythene and plastic. The Committee suggested that the responsibility of re-collecting plastic bottles for recycling should be given to those who produce and distribute them. Accordingly, the officials stated that it is expected, by amending the Act, to prepare a system to find out whether the plastic bottles distributed for various consumption needs are recollected and added to the recycling process by using QR codes with the help of new technology. The Committee emphasized that in order to make the returning process of the plastic bottles for recycling more efficient, a considerable amount should be given to the empty bottles. Moreover, the Chair of the Sectoral Oversight Committee instructed the officials present to identify the single-use plastic equipment and materials currently being imported to Sri Lanka, list them and submit a report in this regard to the Committee. Members of Parliament Jayantha Ketagoda, Dr. Thilak Rajapakshe and Waruna Liyanage were also present at the meeting.",

        "date": "December 8, 2023 06:12 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo District Court on Friday (08 Dec.) issued an injunction against SLVLOG Pod Talks, a political and current affairs talk show aired by the SLVLOG YouTube channel. The relevant order was issued when a complaint filed by Power House Ltd, the parent company of the Derana Group of companies, against Hasalaka Thushara Sanjeewa, demanding a compensation of Rs. 500 million, was taken up in court this morning. The complaint was filed by the media conglomerate after an episode which aired on the SLVLOG Pod Talks programme criticised a news segment aired by Ada Derana on their prime time news bulletin at 06:55 p.m., on the arrest and subsequent granting of bail of Nathasha Edirisooriya, a stand-up comedian who found herself in hot water over certain remarks she had made, allegedly insulting multiple religions during her segment at a recent stand-up comedy show hosted at a leading school in Colombo. The complaint in question had deemed the relevant episode, hosted by Hasalaka Thushara Sanjeewa, baseless and defamatory, after the host had made several allegations against the media company, and had thus demanded a compensation of Rs. 500 million. The plaintiff further requested that the court issue a declaration stating that the defendant has no right to insult, or continue to insult, Ada Derana by way of campaigns, programmes or any other means of presenting facts that are defamatory to the media company. Ada Derana further requested that the court issue a permanent injunction restraining the respondent, his agents and all those working under him, from insulting the plaintiff and its staff in any way.",

        "date": "December 8, 2023 09:22 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has decided to establish an independent Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, marking a historic step towards transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation. According to the Presidents Media Division (PMD), this proposed Commission is planned to be established through an Act of Parliament, which is currently in the drafting process as a concept paper in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The concept paper, used to prepare the final draft of the Bill for Parliament, will soon be available for comments to ensure an inclusive process in developing legislation that strengthens and safeguards national unity through truth, transitional justice, reconciliation, reparation and social cohesion, the PMD added. A key objective of this process is to establish the truth regarding post-conflict grievances of Sri Lankan citizens, facilitating reconciliation, reparation and sustainable peace. The proposed Commission acknowledges every Sri Lankans inalienable right to ascertain the truth, a pivotal aspect for individuals and communities to heal from past conflicts, the PMD statement reads. Additionally, the Commission aims to ensure and strengthen national unity, peace, the rule of law, coexistence, equality, tolerance, respect for diversity and reconciliation among the people of Sri Lanka. This commitment extends to preventing any recurrence of disharmony and future conflict between the multi-ethnic and diverse communities. The Commission is expected to review, consider and facilitate the implementation of recommendations made by past Commissions related to Sri Lankas post-conflict reconciliation efforts, including the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). Findings from the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, established in 2006 by the Government of Sri Lanka, will also be considered. In its statement, the PMD further said: The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to ensuring that the proposed independent Commission acts impartially, free from any political influence. With a victim-centric ethos, the proposed Commission will be a sanctuary for voices to be heard, pain to be acknowledged and dignity to be reclaimed, providing a closure to victims and paving the path for national unity and social cohesion. Pending the enactment of the proposed new law, the government has initiated the establishment of an interim body, the Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism (ISTRM). The ISTRM is working to build the necessary legal and policy framework, operational procedures and guidelines for the Commission. The objective of the ISTRM is to lay the foundation for a home-grown solution for truth, reconciliation and national unity. The ISTRM is currently engaging with the public and stakeholders to ensure the Commission is built with their participation and consultation, shaping this transformative mechanism and ultimately paving the way for sustainable peace and national unity.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (Dec.08) advised the heads of plantation companies to engage in a collective agreement concerning the wage hike for plantation workers, aiming for a minimum of Rs. 1,700, as per their request. Alternatively, they were urged to reach a consensus on the increased wage amount before December 31st. This guidance was imparted during a discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday morning, where the President met with the heads of plantation companies. The purpose of the meeting was to explore how regional plantation companies could align their programs with the agricultural modernization initiative outlined in this years budget. The conversation also delved into the program designed to grant land rights to plantation workers. President Wickremesinghe expressed his intention to establish committees for future work, proposing one committee to address the housing needs of plantation workers and another to represent the interests of both workers and plantation companies. Emphasizing his confidence in an export-oriented economy for the countrys economic development, President Wickremesinghe stressed the collective contribution needed to ensure the success of the agricultural modernization program. He highlighted the growing demand for food due to the increasing population of Asian countries and urged the countrys export economy to prepare for this reality. The event, attended by Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Promotion Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of State for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S.

        "title": "Vladimir Putin announces presidential candidacy in 2024 elections",
        "date": "December 8, 2023 11:23 pm",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to prolong his repressive and unyielding grip on Russia for at least another six years, announcing his candidacy in the presidential election next March that he is all but certain to win. Putin still commands wide support after nearly a quarter-century in power, despite starting an immensely costly war in Ukraine that has taken thousands of his countrymens lives, provoked repeated attacks inside Russia  including one on the Kremlin itself  and corroded its aura of invincibility. A short-lived rebellion in June by mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin raised widespread speculation that Putin could be losing his grip, but he emerged with no permanent scars. Prigozhins death in a mysterious plane crash two months later reinforced the view that Putin was in absolute control. Putin announced his decision to run in the March 17 presidential election after a Kremlin award ceremony, when war veterans and others pleaded with him to seek re-election. I wont hide it from you  I had various thoughts about it over time, but now, youre right, its necessary to make a decision, Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin after the event. I will run for president of the Russian Federation. Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center noted that the announcement was made in a low-key way instead of a live televised speech, probably reflecting the Kremlins spin effort to emphasize Putins modesty and his perceived focus on doing his job as opposed to loud campaigning. Its not about prosperity, its about survival, Stanovaya observed. The stakes have been raised to the maximum. About 80 of the populace approves of Putins performance, according to the independent pollster Levada Center. That support might come from the heart or it might reflect submission to a leader whose crackdown on any opposition has made even relatively mild criticism perilous. Whether due to real or coerced support, Putin is expected to face only token opposition on the ballot. Putin, 71, has twice used his leverage to amend the constitution so he could theoretically stay in power until hes in his mid-80s. He is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953. In 2008, he stepped aside to become prime minister due to term limits but continued calling the shots. Presidential terms were then extended to six years from four, while another package of amendments he pushed through three years ago reset the count for two consecutive terms to begin in 2024. He is afraid to give up power, Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst and professor at Free University of Riga, Latvia, told The Associated Press this year. At the time of the amendments that allowed him two more terms, Putins concern about losing power may have been elevated: Levada polling showed his approval rating significantly lower, hovering around 60. In the view of some analysts, that dip in popularity could have been a main driver of the war that Putin launched in Ukraine in February 2022. This conflict with Ukraine was necessary as a glue. He needed to consolidate his power, said commentator Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speechwriter now living in Israel. Brookings Institution scholar Fiona Hill, a former U.S. National Security Council expert on Russian affairs, agrees that Putin thought a lovely small, victorious war would consolidate support for his reelection. Ukraine would capitulate, she told AP this year. Hed install a new president in Ukraine. He would declare himself the president of a new union of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia over the course of the time leading up to the 2024 election. Hed be the supreme leader. The war didnt turn out that way. It devolved into a grueling slog in which neither side makes significant headway, posing severe challenges to the rising prosperity integral to Putins popularity and Russians propensity to set aside concerns about corrupt politics and shrinking tolerance of dissent. Putins rule has spanned five U.S. presidencies, from Bill Clinton to Joe Biden. He became acting president on New Years Eve in 1999, when Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned. He was elected to his first term in March 2000. When he was forced to step down in 2008 by term limits, he shifted to the prime ministers post while close ally Dmitry Medvedev served as a placeholder president. When Putin announced he would run for a new term in 2012 and Medvedev submissively agreed to become prime minister, public protests brought out crowds of 100,000 or more. Although Putin has long abandoned the macho photo shoots of bear hunting and scuba diving that once amused and impressed the world, he shows little sign of slowing down. Photos from 2022 of him with a bloated face and a hunched posture led to speculation he was seriously ill, but he seems little changed in recent public appearances. Hes a wartime president, is mobilizing the population behind him, Hill said. And that will be the message around the 2024 election, depending on where things are in the battlefield.

Born in 1993, 30-year-old Haley was one of the two female giraffes at the Dehiwala Zoo, belonging to an endangered giraffe species. She had reportedly been suffering from an ailment and was having mobility issues. The veterinary surgeons of the zoo had administered antibiotics to the ailing giraffe while treating an infection on one of its hoops. This is suspected to have caused an allergic reaction which ultimately led to her death on Thursday (Dec.07). The postmortem was conducted by veterinary surgeons attached to the Wildlife Conservation Department and the Faculty of Animal Sciences at Peradeniya University. The authorities of the zoo are now awaiting the postmortem report to determine the actual cause of death of Haley. The investigation into the giraffes death was commenced on the instructions of the Dehiwala Zoological Gardens director Ranjan Marasinghe.",

        "date": "December 9, 2023 08:06 am",
        "content": "The United States kept up pressure on Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians during a fierce offensive against Hamas militants across Gaza, even as Washington vetoed a U.N. Security Council demand for an immediate ceasefire. Fighting escalated and the Palestinian death toll rose on Friday, with Israel pounding the enclave from north to south in an expanded phase of the two-month-old war against the Islamist group Hamas. Decrying a spiralling humanitarian nightmare, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared that nowhere in Gaza was safe for civilians, hours before the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution backed by the vast majority of its members calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The vote left Washington diplomatically isolated on the 15-member council. Thirteen members voted in favor of the draft resolution put forward by the United Arab Emirates, while Britain abstained. Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood told the council: We do not support this resolutions call for an unsustainable ceasefire that will only plant the seeds for the next war. The United States and Israel oppose a ceasefire, saying it would only benefit Hamas, which Israel has vowed to annihilate in response to the militants deadly Oct. 7 cross-border rampage. Washington instead supports pauses like the seven-day halt in fighting that saw Hamas release some hostages and the humanitarian aid flow increase. The deal broke down on Dec. 1. Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour told the council the vote means that millions of Palestinian lives hang in the balance. Ezzat El-Reshiq, a member of Hamas political bureau, condemned the U.S. veto as inhumane. Israels U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan said in a statement: A ceasefire will be possible only with the return of all the hostages and the destruction of Hamas. In Washington, the White House on Friday said more could be done by Israel to reduce civilian casualties and the U.S. shared international concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We certainly all recognize more can be done to try to reduce civilian casualties, White House national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sharpened Washingtons language, saying it was imperative that Israel took steps to safeguard Gazas civilian population. And there does remain a gap between...the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that were seeing on the ground, he told a press conference. Describing the situation as at a breaking point, Guterres said the collapse of Gazas humanitarian system could result in a complete breakdown of public order. Most Gazans are now displaced, hospitals overrun and food running out. Residents and the Israeli military both reported intensified fighting in both northern areas, where Israel had previously said its troops had largely completed their tasks last month, and in the south where they mounted a new assault this week. DEATH TOLL Gazas health ministry reported 350 people killed on Thursday, and on Friday it said the death toll from Israels campaign in Gaza had risen to 17,487. More strikes were reported on Friday in Khan Younis in the south, the Nusseirat camp in the centre and Gaza City in the north. On Friday evening, residents reported intensified Israeli tank fire in north Gaza, while health officials said at least 10 people were killed in an air strike on a house in Khan Younis. Israels military said 94 Israeli soldiers had been killed fighting in Gaza since its ground invasion of the densely populated enclave began in mid-October in retaliation for Hamas rampage in southern Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages. An Israeli commander, Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss, said in a video message recorded in Khan Younis that his forces were fighting house to house and shaft to shaft, a reference to tunnel shafts. As he spoke, gunshots rang out in the background. Since the Israeli military campaign began, most of Gazas 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, and residents say it has become almost impossible to find refuge. Israel says it is providing detail about which areas are safe and that Hamas is to blame for harm to civilians because it operates among them, an accusation the Islamist group denies. Hamas reported the most intense clashes with Israeli forces were taking place in the north in Shejaia, as well as in the south in Khan Younis, where Israeli forces reached the heart of the enclaves second-biggest city on Wednesday. Israels chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel had detained more than 200 suspects from Gaza in the last 48 hours and dozens were taken to Israel for questioning. Reuters journalists in southern Gaza have seen dead and wounded swamping the main Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where there was no room on the floor on Friday for arriving patients sprawled across blood-smeared tiles. With the fighting now going on in all directions, there was no place left to flee, said Yamen, sheltering at a school in central Gaza with his family. Inside the school is like outside it: the same feeling of fear of near death, the same suffering of starvation, he said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "A special commemorative postage stamp was issued on Wednesday (Dec. 08), on the occasion of the celebration of the 75th Anniversary of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Türkiye. Addressing the event, Demet Şekercioğlu, Ambassador of the Republic of Türkiye to Sri Lanka and Maldives, stated that it is worth mentioning that Türkiye was among the first countries to recognize Sri Lankas independence 75 years ago. Our relation gained a new dimension with the establishment of our Embassy here in Colombo 10 years ago, indeed serving as a true testament to our growing and flourishing partnership. Further, the Ambassador of the Republic of Türkiye to Sri Lanka said that as much as the deep-rooted connections between the two nations, the design and decorations on the sides of the commemorative postage stamp features the iconic regions of Cappadocia in Türkiye and Sigiriya in Sri Lanka symbolizing the intertwined histories. I must say that both are renowned for their unique geographical structures and rich heritage, making them prominent tourist destinations. I would like to shortly highlight the history behind the scenic beauty of Cappadocia, which might not be known to everyone in Sri Lanka, she added. The stamps were designed by Sri Lankan artist Vasantha Perera, well known for having designed 39 unique stamps for the Sri Lanka Philatelic Bureau, according to Şekercioğlu. The stamps showcase the cultural parallels between our nations, with traditional elements like tulip and the carnation as side decorations. The tulip and the carnation are also common elements in both of Turkish and Sri Lankan traditional designs. Last but not least, the stamps envelop reflects a drawing of the historic building Villa Stamboul, linking us to a shared past, the Turkish Ambassador said.",

        "date": "December 9, 2023 10:34 pm",
        "content": "In a historic announcement at the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Colombo Colts Cricket Club (CCC) yesterday (08 Dec.), President Ranil Wickremesinghe declared his commitment to depoliticizing and revolutionizing cricket in Sri Lanka by 2030. The President outlined a comprehensive plan, emphasizing the need for an independent trust to oversee the financial administration and development of school cricket, backed by a substantial budget allocation. Addressing the gathering at the CCC ground, President Wickremesinghe passionately expressed his vision for the future of Sri Lankan Cricket, asserting that the game should thrive beyond political influences. He underscored the importance of transparency and efficiency in utilizing funds earmarked for the development of school cricket, revealing a significant budget allocation of 1.5 billion rupees for the current year, with expectations of an annual increase to 2 billion rupees in the future. The Presidents commitment to abolishing the powers of interim committees and the sports minister in cricket affairs was a notable aspect of his speech. He highlighted the imminent introduction of new laws designed to keep the sport free from political interference, reinforcing his dedication to fostering a transparent and accountable cricket administration. During the celebration, President Wickremesinghe unveiled plans for an independent trust to manage the allocated funds and spearhead the development of school cricket. He stressed the importance of conducting all activities with utmost transparency, ensuring that the trust achieves its objectives in a manner that aligns with the vision for Sri Lankan cricket in 2030. The President also acknowledged the historical significance of the Colombo Colts Cricket Club, tracing its roots back to the early days of cricket in Sri Lanka when various ethnic groups formed clubs. He commended the clubs role in shaping the countrys cricketing history and recognized its contributions to the sport. As part of the celebration, members of the 1996 World Cup winning team and the 2014 T20 World Cup winning team were awarded with the lifetime membership of the Colts Cricket Club. President Wickremesinghe also received lifetime membership from the clubs president, Mr. Nishantha Ranatunga. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe reflected on the evolution of cricket in Sri Lanka, from its early days influenced by Englishmen to the present era of fast-paced, dynamic formats like T20 cricket. He acknowledged the changing landscape of the game, driven by advancements in technology and media. The Presidents commitment to the development of cricket at the school level was a central theme of his address. He outlined plans to allocate funds for the improvement of cricket infrastructure, including pitches and equipment, particularly in the less developed provinces such as the North Central Province, Eastern Province, and Uva. The President emphasized that this financial support would be sustained over the years, with the possibility of increasing the annual budget to 2 billion rupees. President Wickremesinghes vision extends beyond mere financial contributions. He expressed a desire to create a level playing field by ensuring that cricket is accessible to all schools across the country, irrespective of their location. His proposal aims to raise the standard of cricket in every corner of Sri Lanka, creating a vast pool of talent that can be tapped into for national representation. The Presidents vision also extends to gender inclusivity in cricket, with plans to support and encourage female students to actively participate in the sport. He sees cricket as a game that transcends gender boundaries and envisions a future where both male and female students contribute to the countrys cricketing success. To execute these plans effectively, President Wickremesinghe announced the formation of a group of expertise for managing the allocated funds. He has invited former cricketers Sidath Wettimuny and Aravinda de Silva to the group and also the Chamber of Commerce to nominate a representative. This group is tasked with ensuring that the allocated funds are utilized efficiently and contribute to the holistic development of school cricket. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe disclosed plans to transform the dilapidated Diyagama ground into a dedicated sports campus. This visionary project involves collaboration with the cricket board and other controlling bodies to develop the ground into a state-of-the-art facility. The aim is to create a hub where various sports can be nurtured and developed, aligning with Sri Lankas broader vision of becoming a prosperous nation excelling in both economic and sporting endeavours. President Wickremesinghes speech at the anniversary celebrations of the Colombo Colts Cricket Club marks a pivotal moment in the history of Sri Lankan cricket. His unwavering commitment to depoliticizing the sport, coupled with substantial financial support and visionary plans for grassroots development, sets the stage for a transformative journey toward cricketing excellence by 2030. The Presidents vision, if realized, promises to shape the future of Sri Lankan Cricket and position the country as a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. This grand celebration was graced by the esteemed presence of notable dignitaries, including First Lady Professor Maithree Wickramasinghe, Ministers Harin Fernando and Prasanna Ranatunga, and Western Province Governor Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Gunathilake. The event also saw the gathering of revered figures from the cricketing world, with former and present veteran cricketers and other distinguished guests in attendance.",

The island-wide power failures were attributed to a breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama. State-owned utility said it took step by step measures to ensure complete power restoration by around 11:00 p.m. Eng. Noel Priyantha, the CEBs media spokesman, said a comprehensive internal investigation would be initiated into the incident. However, the cause of the transmission line breakdown which caused the island-wide power outages is yet to be determined, according to the CEB. Against this backdrop, Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon had instructed all police stations to stay on high alert to ensure security across all areas. Meanwhile, the water supply in several areas was either disrupted or supplied at low pressure due to the power outages. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said it managed to restore the water supply in the affected localities within a few hours. Nevertheless, the Railways Department said train operations remained uninterrupted by the island-wide power outages. The Mahaweli Authority said several sluice gates of Polgolla, Victoria, Randenigala and Rantembe reservoirs were opened as a result of the situation. Such major power outages were first reported in March 2016. In August 2020, a 6-hour sudden power outage occurred due to a breakdown in the transmission lines in Kerawalapitiya. In addition, in December 2021, the electricity supply was disrupted due to a technical fault in the Kothmale - Biyagama transmission system. Following each of these cases, the authorities had taken steps to make recommendations on the measures to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such power failures. Regardless, there were sudden power outages of nearly 6 hours yesterday and State Minister Indika Anuruddha told Ada Derana that a special investigation would be conducted in this regard.",

The artists also pointed out the need to consider each art field separately as the issues and relevant matters are different, the statement mentioned. Addressing the artists, the Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakshe pointed out that he would give his best contribution to draft this new Act with the cooperation of all ministries and institutions related to arts. Accordingly, he informed the art organizations to prepare the relevant basic framework and provide it before January 10, 2024. Also, the minister said that the support of all parties is expected for this initiative taken for the betterment of Sri Lankan arts irrespective of political differences, it added. State Minister Anuradha Jayaratne and Member of Parliament Premnath C Dolawatta were also present on this occasion. Media Consultant to the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Harsha Abeykoon, coordinated the programme, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department",

        "content": "Initial data shows that lightning strikes on the Kotmale to Biyagama transmission line had caused the island-wide power breakdown yesterday (Dec. 09), a spokesman for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said. However, Speaking during todays parliamentary session, State Minister of Power and Energy Indika Anuruddha stated that two separate inquiries would be carried out by the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) into the island-wide power breakdown that occurred yesterday (09). Major power outages were reported across the island last evening, where the CEB, the countrys power monopoly attributed it to a breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama. Meanwhile, the water supply in several areas was either disrupted or supplied at low-pressure due to the power outages. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said it managed to restore the water supply in the affected localities within a few hours. Nevertheless, the Railways Department said train operations remained uninterrupted by the island-wide power outages. The Mahaweli Authority said several sluice gates of Polgolla, Victoria, Randenigala and Rantembe reservoirs were opened as a result of the situation. Such major power outages were first reported in March 2016. In August 2020, a 6-hour sudden power outage occurred due to a breakdown in the transmission lines in Kerawalapitiya. In addition, in December 2021, the electricity supply was disrupted due to a technical fault in the Kothmale and Biyagama transmission system. Following each of these cases, the authorities had taken steps to make recommendations on the measures to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such power failures.",

        "date": "December 10, 2023 11:50 am",
        "content": "Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says Value-Added Tax (VAT) would be imposed on 97 out of the 138 goods that were previously freed from the tax, in a bid to boost state revenue. Commencing debate on VAT amendments in Parliament this morning (Dec.10), the lawmaker said short message service (SMS) in fixed telephone networks will also be subjected to VAT, given the increased number of text messages sent. However, medicines, equipment used by disabled persons, rice flour, wheat flour, vegetables, fruits, liquid milk, and the Suwaseriya ambulance service will not be subjected to VAT, the state minister assured. Speaking further, Siyambalapitiya said the government has observed an increase in its revenue after revising the tax policies. By boosting the revenue, the government aims to increase its reserves to at least USD 5-6 billion from the current USD 3.8 billion. When that happens, Sri Lankan Rupee will appreciate and prices of goods will go down permanently. The parliamentary debate on the Second Reading of the VAT (Amendment) Bill and Finance Bill commenced earlier this morning (Dec.10). The Cabinet of Ministers in October gave the nod to increase the VAT from 15 to 18 starting January 01, 2024. In addition, some of the new tax proposals are also expected to be implemented effective from January 01, 2024, in order to enable the realization of tax revenue and primary balance targets as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government took the decision after observing that the tax collection targets agreed with the IMF are yet to be accomplished. Earlier, the government mentioned that state tax revenue of the first nine months of 2023 went up by 51 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 after various tax-based increases and developmental tax policy proposals were implemented from June last year for the state financial stability based on the income, to ensure loan sustainability. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, raising concerns about the proposed increase of the VAT to 18, has cautioned that the move could lead to a further decline in consumption.",

This years International Human Rights Day, which falls on December 10 (Sunday), is celebrated under the theme Freedom, Equality, and Justice for All. Accordingly, the HRCSL is slated to launch the following guidelines and recommendations, in the presence of representatives from the State, law enforcement authorities, governmental and non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations:  General Guidelines and Recommendations to the Sri Lanka Police on Prevention of Custodial and Encounter Deaths  General Guidelines and Recommendations on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders  Interim Report of the Fact-Finding Mission on Right to Health and Liberty of the Patients at the National Institute of Mental Health In his message for International Human Rights Day, the HRCSL chairman Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya called upon the State and all relevant authorities to uphold the fundamental and international human rights obligations of the State. Further, he called upon all individuals and organizations to take proactive steps to educate and enhance their knowledge of the rights that have been guaranteed to every person by the Constitution and other legislations of Sri Lanka. Coinciding with International Human Rights Day, Sri Lanka celebrates the 75th anniversary of the milestone achievement of adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It calls for a moment of reflection, to acknowledge and honour the significant developments the declaration has paved the way for, to protect and promote the universal rights of all persons, the HRCSL chairman said further in its statement. He said attention is also drawn towards the many challenges that hinder the full realization of the rights and values enshrined in the declaration. Among the many challenges, the HRCSL chairman said special attention is drawn to the global pandemic and the political and economic instability that unfolded in the country, which has left behind long-term and ongoing repercussions. According to him, these challenges brought to the surface the systemic inequalities that were prevalent over the years and also exacerbated injustices faced by many, in particular persons belonging to vulnerable communities. The HRCSL, building on the work that has been done over the years, places extra emphasis on addressing such systemic inequalities and creating an equitable environment, where all persons can fully realize the rights and values envisioned in the UDHR, Justice Dehideniya reiterated in his statement.",

        "date": "December 10, 2023 07:39 pm",
        "content": "The former chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says the Ministry of Power  Energy has neglected the gazetted orders aiming to prevent island-wide power outages. Janaka Ratnayake, in a statement, said the Extraordinary Gazette 229638, published in September 2022 when he was in office as the PUCSL chairman, had issued 7 recommendations to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Power  Energy Ministry pertaining to preventing major power failures. Ratnayake said the massive blackout experienced in the country last evening, which lasted for more than 5 hours, has resulted in a direct loss of Rs.6 billion to the CEB, adding that the current Minister of Power  Energy should be held accountable for this. A similar blackout happened in the country on December 03, 2021, and the demand of 10 gigawatt hours could not be met. It led to a financial damage of around Rs.1,500 crore (Rs.15 billion). Although last nights power outage was restored within a few hours, it has caused a loss of Rs. 6 crore (Rs. 6 billion). Ratnayake said the situation caused more damage as one generating unit of the Norochcholai power plant was left out of order amidst the power outage. If we get electricity from fossil fuel power plants as a result, a loss of Rs. 60 is incurred per unit. Therefore, the total loss incurred after yesterdays major power outges amounts to approximately Rs. 10 billion.",

        "date": "December 10, 2023 07:48 pm",
        "content": "Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi will go on a new hunger strike from her prison cell in Iran as the prize is awarded in Oslo on Sunday in her absence, her family said Saturday. Mohammadi, who has campaigned against the compulsory wearing of the hijab and the death penalty in Iran, will go on hunger strike in solidarity with the Bahai religious minority, her brother and husband told a press conference in the Norwegian capital on the eve of the Nobel award ceremony. She is not here with us today, she is in prison and she will be on a hunger strike in solidarity with a religious minority but we feel her presence here, her younger brother, Hamidreza Mohammadi, said in a brief opening statement. The 51-year-old activists husband, Taghi Rahmani, went on to explain that the strike was a gesture of solidarity with the Bahai religious minority, two of whose jailed leading figures, Mahvash Sabet and Fariba Kamalabadi, have started refusing food. She said that I will start my hunger strike on the day that I am being granted this prize, perhaps then the world will hear more about it, he explained. Irans largest religious minority, the Bahai community is the target of discrimination in many areas of society, according to its representatives. Mohammadi already went on a hunger strike for several days at the beginning of November to obtain the right to be transferred to hospital without covering her head. She was awarded the Nobel prize in October for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran. Arrested 13 times, sentenced five times to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes, Mohammadi has spent much of the past two decades in and out of jail. Narges Mohammadi is one of the women spearheading the Woman, Life, Freedom uprising, which included months-long protests across Iran triggered by the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested for allegedly flouting the Islamic republics strict dress rules for women. Mahsa Aminis parents and brother -- who were due to receive the Sakharov Prize, awarded posthumously to the young woman at a parallel ceremony in France on Sunday -- have been banned from leaving Iran, their lawyer in France told AFP on Saturday. In my heart Detained since 2021 in Tehrans Evin prison, Mohammadi will be represented at the Oslo ceremony by her 17-year-old twin children, Ali and Kiana, who have been living in exile in France since 2015 and have not seen their mother for almost nine years. They both dont know if they will ever see her alive again, but while Ali has faith, Kiana is doubtful. The cause of Woman, Life, Freedom, freedom in general and democracy are worth sacrificing yourself for and giving your life for, because in the end these three things are priceless, Kiana told reporters. As for seeing her again one day, personally Im rather pessimistic, she added, noting that the added attention of her mother receiving the Nobel prize would likely make the Iranian authorities curtail her freedom further. Maybe Ill see her in 30 or 40 years, but if not, I dont think Ill ever see her again, but thats OK because my mother will always be with me in my heart and with my family. On the other hand, Ali said he was very, very optimistic, even if it probably wont happen in two, five or ten years. I believe in our victory, he asserted, before quoting his mother: victory is not easy but it is certain. On Sunday, at the Nobel prize ceremony in Oslo, attended by the Norwegian royal family and other dignitaries, the twins will read a speech that their mother managed to smuggle out of her jail cell.

        "title": "Sri Lanka will be secured if India is secured - Gopal Baglay",
        "date": "December 10, 2023 10:01 pm",
        "content": "The Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay says that India has never responded to a crisis or supported a country in crisis with the swiftness and strength that it did during the unprecedented crisis in Sri Lanka. Joining the At Hydepark current affairs programme on Ada Derana 24, the outgoing Indian diplomat in Colombo also discussed the vision for the advancement in bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and India, with the anticipated economic growth of India. India played the role bilaterally, as well as internationally to support Sri Lanka. The leadership of India is very clear and committed to a strong India - Sri Lanka relationship, said the Indian Diplomat. In response to a question regarding the Indias concerns on the visit of Chinese vessels to Colombo, Gopal Baglay pointed out that both India and Sri Lanka are located in the Indian Ocean, adding that assuring the freedom of navigation is a shared responsibility of India and Sri Lanka. He further expressed that the maritime challenges which arise must be addressed together. There can be prosperity and peace, when there is security and stability. Ensuring the security of the region in which we both are situated is a shared responsibility. In that sense I would say that the security of India and the region is mutual and indivisible. Commenting on the matter, Baglay also stressed that the security of Sri Lanka would be secured if India is secured. When India is secured Sri Lanka is secured, and when Sri Lanka is secured, India is secured, he added. Expressing his views on the Indias vision of positioning itself in future, High Commissioner Baglay pointed out that India is currently the fifth largest economy of the world, highlighting that soon it will be within the top three. India is the most populated country and the largest democracy of the world. In 2047, India aims to achieve an economy of USD 30 trillion. The Indian envoy assured that Sri Lanka will be a key beneficiary of its prosperity as Indias leadership is committed to a stronger bond with Sri Lanka. We would like the region to grow together, because it is our fundamental belief that prosperity of the region is in the best interest of India. What is good for Sri Lanka is good for India. We consider the world is our family and in that family, neighbourhood is the first, he mentioned.",

        "title": "Australia plans to halve migrant intake, tighten student visa rules",
        "date": "December 11, 2023 08:02 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Australia on Monday said it would tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers that could halve its migrant intake over the next two years as the government looks to overhaul what it said was a broken migration system. The decision comes after net immigration was expected to have peaked at a record 510,000 in 2022-23. Official data showed it was forecast to fall to about a quarter of a million in 2024-25 and 2025-26, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels. Weve worked around the clock to strike the best balance in Australias migration system, Home Affairs Minister Clare ONeil said in a statement ahead of the formal release of the governments new migration strategy later on Monday. The governments targeted reforms are already putting downward pressure on net overseas migration, and will further contribute to this expected decline, ONeil said. ONeil said the increase in net overseas migration in 2022-23 was mostly driven by international students. Australia boosted its annual migration numbers last year to help key businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought tighter border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out of the country for nearly two years. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the weekend said Australias migration numbers needed to be wound back to a sustainable level, adding that the system is broken. Long reliant on immigration to supply what is now one of the tightest labour markets in the world, Australias Labor government has pushed to speed up the entry of highly skilled workers and smooth their path to permanent residency. Under the new policies, international students would need higher ratings on English tests. It will also end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay in Australia. A new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be set up with the processing time cut to one week, helping businesses recruit top migrants amid tough competition with other developed economies.

        "date": "December 11, 2023 11:45 am",
        "content": "Two trains crashed into each other at low speed in northern Italy late Sunday, injuring at least 17 people, none seriously, firefighters and the train operator said. The accident between a high-speed train and a regional train occurred on the line between Bologna and Rimini, specifically between the city of Faenza and the commune of Forli, the fire service announced on social media, saying at least 17 people were injured. But a spokesman for national train operator Trenitalia told AFP there were only minor injuries, saying most were bruised. It was a collision at very low speed, he said, adding that an investigation was underway into what happened. Photos published by firefighters showed the two trains had crashed head-on, but the front of the regional train was still intact. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, said he was following the situation and also confirmed the injuries were minor. He said he was seeking rapid information on what happened, and potential responsibility. The crash came three months after five railway workers died after being hit by a train during overnight maintenance on the Milan-Turin line on August 31. The previous deadly accident on Italys railways was in 2020, when two rail workers died and 31 passengers were injured when a train derailed before dawn near Lodi, south of Milan. In January 2018, three women died and about 100 people were injured when a packed train derailed near Milan, an accident blamed on poor track maintenance. Source - NDTV - Agencies",

        "date": "December 11, 2023 11:50 am",
        "content": "Two policy-based loans (PBLs) have been arranged following discussions between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Sri Lankan government, the Ministry of Finance revealed. Accordingly, the PBLs are slated to be used for the implementation of the Financial Sector Stability and Reform Program, in a bid to create a stable financial system that provides access to finance for businesses in various sectors of the economy. The program adopts a programmatic modality with two subprograms of USD 200 million each, and will support the implementation of multi-year policy reforms, including immediate reforms to enhance the crisis management regulatory framework and stabilize the financial sector under Subprogram 01 and reforms to build a resilient and inclusive financial system under Subprogram 02. The Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies (MOF) have been deemed the executing agency of the above programs and will therefore implement the policy actions in collaboration with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and other relevant institutions. Since the relevant agencies have successfully achieved all pre-policy actions related to Subprogram 01, the entire USD 200 million loan proceeds relevant to the subprogram will soon be disbursed to the Treasury, the Ministry stated, adding that the loan will be provided from ADBs concessionary Ordinary Capital Resources with a 25-year term, including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 2.0 per year. Accordingly, the PBL agreement for Subprogram 01 was signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the ADB at the Ministry of Finance, with K. M. Mahinda Siriwardana, Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, having placed the signature on behalf of the former, while Takafumi Kadono, Country Director, ADB Sri Lanka Residence Mission, placed the signature on behalf of latter.",

Responding to a claim raised by MP Roshan Ranasinghe in Parliament this morning (11 Dec.), the State Minister noted that all 252 army personnel stationed at Mihintale were not there for security purposes, and thus, their withdrawal has no effect on the security of the sacred site. There is no security threat as a result of the withdrawal of all 252 personnel. They were not placed there for security purposes. Security is being provided by Sri Lanka Police, and there are over 30 police personnel present at the site, Tennakoon said, adding that while the security of Mihintale is a responsibility undertaken by the Sri Lanka Police, personnel from the other defence forces including the army will be deployed if necessary.

        "date": "December 11, 2023 12:30 pm",
        "content": "For the first time in Hayao Miyazakis decades-spanning career, the 82-year-old Japanese anime master is No. 1 at the North American box office. Miyazakis latest enchantment, The Boy and the Heron, debuted with 12.8 million, according to studio estimates. The Boy and the Heron, the long-awaited animated fantasy from the director of Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and other cherished anime classics, is only the third anime to ever top the box office in U.S. and Canadian theaters, and the first original anime to do so. The film, which is playing in both subtitled and dubbed versions, is also the first fully foreign production to land atop the domestic box office this year. Though Miyazakis movies have often been enormous hits in Japan and Asia, theyve traditionally made less of a mark in North American cinemas. The directors previous best performer was his last movie, 2013s The Wind Rises, which grossed 5.2 million in its entire domestic run. Its really a resounding statement for what animation can be, said Eric Beckman, founder and chief executive of GKIDS, the North American distributor for Studio Ghibli films. American audiences have been ready for a lot more than what theyve been getting, and I think this really points to that direction. The Boy and the Heron for years was expected to be Miyazakis swan song. But just as it was making its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, Junichi Nishioka, Studio Ghibli vice president, said the previously retired Miyazaki has begun working toward another film. The Boy and the Heron, has been hailed as one of the best films of the year. The film, featuring an English dub voice cast including Robert Pattinson, Christian Bale, Dave Bautista and Mark Hamill, follows a boy who, after her mother perishes in World War II bombing, is led by a mysterious heron to a portal that takes him to a fantastical realm. In Japan, its title translates to How Do You Live? The Boy and the Heron earlier collected 56 million in Japan despite zero promotion. Studio Ghibli opted to release the film without production stills, trailers, ads or billboards. The U.S. and Canadian release included conventional advertising but was similarly handled with the care of something truly special as a Miyazaki movie. Throughout this year, all 10 of Miyazakis films with Ghibli were rereleased in theaters by GKIDS, which was founded in 2008 as way to bring ambitious animation to wider audiences. Working on a Hayao Miyazaki film is a huge honor but also kind of terrifying, Beckman said. Were really just trying to do justice to the film. Last weeks top film, Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, dropped steeply in its second weekend. The concert film, the second pop star release distributed by AMC Theatres following Taylor Swifts The Eras Tour, collected 5 million in its second weekend, a decline of 76 from its 21 million opening. That allowed Lionsgates still-going-strong The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds  Snakes to take second place, with an estimated 9.4 million in its fourth weekend of release. The Hunger Games prequel has a domestic haul of 135.7 million. The Boy and the Heron wasnt the only Japanese film that ranked among the top movies in theaters over the weekend. Godzilla Minus One followed up its stellar debut last weekend with 8.3 million for Toho Studios. Takashi Yamazakis acclaimed kaiju movie dipped just 27 in its second weekend of release, bringing its total to 25 million. Several potential awards contenders got off to strong starts in limited release. Yorgos Lanthimos warped fantasy Poor Things, starring Emma Stone, opened with 644,000 from nine theaters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin, Texas. Poor Things expands in more theaters next week. Ava DuVernays Origin, played an Oscar-qualifying run in two theaters in New York and Los Angeles with a per screen average of 58,532 for Neon. It stars Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as the author Isabel Wilkerson while she investigates race and inequality for her book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Origin opens wide Jan. 19. Wonka, one of the holiday seasons most anticipated releases, kicked off its overseas run with 43.2 million from 37 international markets. The film, starring Timothée Chalamet and directed by Paddington filmmaker Paul King, is expected to lead U.S. and Canada ticket sales next weekend. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. The Boy and the Heron, 12.8 million. 2. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds  Snakes, 9.4 million. 3. Godzilla Minus One, 8.3 million. 4. Trolls Band Together, 6.2 million. 5. Wish, 5.3 million. 6. Renaissance, A Film by Beyoncé, 5 million. 7. Napoleon, 4.2 million. 8. Waitress: The Musical, 3.2 million. 9. Animal, 2.3 million. 10. The Shift, 2.2 million. Source - AP News - Agencies",
