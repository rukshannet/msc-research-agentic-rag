        "title": "Thousands believed to have lost out to crypto trading app",
        "date": "March 18, 2023 01:36 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of people are believed to have lost their savings after investing in a cryptocurrency trading app called iEarn Bot. Experts who have investigated the company say it could be one of the largest crypto scandals to date. Trading in cryptocurrencies has become popular, with people often promised large rewards over short periods. But law enforcement agencies warn of a growing number of scams and recommend investors conduct due diligence. The money just disappeared Roxana, not her real name, is from Romania. She says she lost hundreds of euros when she invested in iEarn Bot. She asked not to have her identity revealed as she fears her professional reputation might be damaged. Customers buying the bots - like Roxana - were told their investment would be handled by the companys artificial intelligence programme, guaranteeing high returns. I invested in a bot for one month, Roxana tells the BBC. You could see in the app how many dollars the app was creating: there were graphics showing how the investment was progressing. It looked quite professional until, at some point, they announced maintenance. At that point, for some time, withdrawals from the app were frozen. Some people started to say I cannot withdraw... what is happening, explains Roxana. I made the request to withdraw and the money just disappeared. The portfolio became zero - but I was never credited on my wallet with any money. In Romania, dozens of high-profile figures, including government officials and academics, were persuaded to invest via the app because it was sponsored by Gabriel Garais, a leading IT expert in the country. Mr Garais says he too was fooled into investing his own savings in the app and lost his money. But Roxana insists, had it not been for Garaiss sponsorship, she would have never considered investing. We had the knowledge to think this might be a scam, she says, but the fact that, in between us and the company there was a reputable teacher, meant that we didnt check too much - we didnt doubt too much. What happened in Romania is not an isolated incident. Nor is it unique to Romania. When Silvia Tabusca, a Romanian organised crime expert from the European Center for Legal Education and Research, began looking into iEarn Bot, she discovered that many people in other countries had also lost their money in the scheme. What surprised her most was the scale of the operation. From what we have seen, the number of investors is quite high, she says. In Indonesia, for example, they iEarn Bot claim they had 800,000 customers. At first the app works very well, says Ms Tabusca. When they have enough investors and enough money invested in a specific country, they dont allow that country to withdraw any more - and they open other countries. iEarn Bot presents itself as a US-based company with excellent credentials, but when the BBC fact-checked some information on its website, it raised some red flags. The man whom the site names as the companys founder told us he had never heard of them. He said he has made a complaint to the police. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, alongside companies such as Huawei and Qualcomm, are all named as strategic partners of iEarn Bot, but they too said they have no knowledge of the company and they are not working with it. On the website, the company does not provide any contact information. When the BBC checked the history of its Facebook page, we learned that until the end of 2021, the account was advertising weight-loss products. It is managed from Vietnam and Cambodia. iEarn Bot places a big emphasis on pushing investors to recruit more people to join the app. The way people in this company operate is more similar to a Ponzi scheme, than an actual business, says Ms Tabusca. The BBC has also seen chat conversations where people, who claim to be from iEarn Bots customer service, told investors that in order to withdraw their money, they must pay a 30 fee. Some people were quite desperate to get their money back, so they paid the fee - but they still couldnt withdraw, says Ms Tabusca. The BBC has repeatedly approached iEarn Bot for comment but so far it has not responded. Recruitment events In some countries, such as Nigeria and Colombia, local leaders were pushed by iEarn Bot mentors - with whom they only ever communicated on Telegram - to organise recruiting events. Andres, from Colombia, said he actively recruited people to join the app. He still believes the company is legitimate. They had their registration in the US that showed they were legit, he says. And they were paying. In his country, withdrawals were stopped in December. People were told the company was transforming investment in USDT - a well-established cryptocurrency - into a new coin called iBot, which had the same value. Investors were asked to be patient until March, when the new coin was expected to be officially launched. But people are still waiting to access their money. People took loans to invest. They used money from other sources, many people were affected, says Andres. As the local leaders did not have answers, people started to get angry. With the help of an analyst, the BBC managed to identify one main crypto wallet that received payments from about 13,000 potential victims, for a profit of almost 1.3m (1m) in less than one year. But we could not track down where and to whom the money went. For investigators, this is a common issue. One of the challenges is to identify and attribute who the illicit actor is, where the value is going, and then being able to take investigative steps and law enforcement action, says John Wyman, chief of the FBIs new Virtual Assets Unit. Investigations in this sort of scheme, he says, go global quickly. Such investigations require international co-operation and may take longer, but he insists that those responsible are eventually brought to justice. The FBI set up the Virtual Assets Unit last year in order to respond to the growing number of crimes using virtual currencies. It invites people who have been victims of scams to make a complaint on the FBIs dedicated page. But law enforcement agencies maintain the best way to fight scammers remains prevention. Knowledge - and doing some due diligence before the investment - its critical, says Mr Wyman. Its like everything else: if it sounds too good to be true, it often is. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Government Printer insists that the already-printed ballot papers of the postal voting in 2023 Local Government Election cannot be handed over to the Election Commission until the required payments are made. According to Government Printer Gangani Kalpana Liyanage, the Printing Department has spent more than Rs. 200 million thus far to print ballot papers, despite receiving an initial payment of just Rs. 40 million. Printing of ballot papers for 17 electoral districts is completed and they need to be proofread under the police security, Liyanage explained, noting that the Printing Department is yet to receive the remaining payments for the election-related work it has done so far. In light of this matter, Liyanage said the Printing Department would not be able to hand over the postal voting ballot papers to the Election Commission on Monday (March 20) as planned. Meanwhile, election chief Attorney-at-Law Nimal G. Punchihewa said the Local Government Election can be held on the scheduled date if the election body receives the ballot papers over the next few days. The 2023 Local Government Election, which was initially planned to be held on March 09, was later rescheduled for April 25.

        "title": "Lance Reddick: The Wire and John Wick star dies at 60",
        "date": "March 18, 2023 03:33 pm",
        "content": "Lance Reddick, a character actor who specialized in intense, icy and possibly sinister authority figures on TV and film, including The Wire, Fringe and the John Wick franchise, has died. He was 60. Reddick died suddenly Friday morning, his publicist Mia Hansen said in a statement, attributing his death to natural causes. No further details were provided. Wendell Pierce, Reddicks co-star on The Wire paid tribute on Twitter. A man of great strength and grace, he wrote. As talented a musician as he was an actor. The epitome of class. John Wick  Chapter Four director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves said they dedicating the upcoming film to Reddick and were deeply saddened and heartbroken at the loss. Reddick was often put in a suit or a crisp uniform during his career, playing tall, taciturn and elegant men of distinction. He was best known for his role as straight-laced Lt. Cedric Daniels on the hit HBO series The Wire, where his character was agonizingly trapped in the messy politics of the Baltimore police department. The Wire creator David Simon praised Reddick on Twitter: Consummate professional, devoted collaborator, lovely and gentle man, loyal friend. Could go on, but no, I cant go on. This is gutting. And way, way, way too soon. Im an artist at heart. I feel that Im very good at what I do. When I went to drama school, I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a Black man and I wasnt pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be, and to be noticed, Reddick told the Los Angeles Times in 2009. Reddick also starred on the Fox series Fringe as a special agent Phillip Broyles, the smartly-dressed Matthew Abaddon on Lost and played the multi-skilled Continental Hotel concierge Charon in Lionsgates John Wick movies, including the fourth in the series that releases later this month. The world of Wick would not be what it is without Lance Reddick and the unparalleled depth he brought to Charons humanity and unflappable charisma. Lance leaves behind an indelible legacy and hugely impressive body of work, but we will remember him as our lovely, joyful friend and Concierge, Lionsgate said in a statement. Reddick earned a SAG Award nomination in 2021 as part of the ensemble for Regina Kings film One Night in Miami. He played recurring roles on Intelligence and American Horror Story and was on the show Bosch for its seven-year run. His upcoming projects include 20th Centurys remake of White Men Cant Jump and Shirley, Netflixs biopic of former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. He was also slated to appear in the John Wick spinoff Ballerina, as well as The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial. The Baltimore-born-and-raised Reddick was a Yale University drama school graduate who enjoyed some success after school by landing guest or recurring roles CSI: Miami and Law  Order: Special Victims Unit. He also appeared in several movies, including I Dreamed of Africa, The Siege and Great Expectations. It was on season four of Oz, playing a doomed undercover officer sent to prison who becomes an addict, that Reddick had a career breakthrough. I was never interested in television. I always saw it as a means to an end. Like so many actors, I was only interested in doing theater and film. But Oz changed television. It was the beginning of HBOs reign on quality, edgy, artistic stuff. Stuff that harkens back to great cinema of the 60s and 70s, he told The Associated Press in 2011. When the opportunity for Oz came up, I jumped. And when I read the pilot for The Wire, as a guy that never wanted to be on television, I realized I had to be on this show. Reddick attended the prestigious Eastman School of Music, where he studied classical composition, and he played piano. His first album, the jazzy Contemplations and Remembrances, came out in 2011. He had a recurring role as Jeffrey Tetazoo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, on the CBS series Intelligence. On American Horror Story: Coven, he portrayed Papa Legba, the go-between between humanity and the spirit world. Reddick is survived by his wife, Stephanie Reddick, and children, Yvonne Nicole Reddick and Christopher Reddick. His death was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.com.

The Z-score obtained at the Advanced Level examination and the availability of employment opportunities for the subjects selected by the students will be taken into consideration when granting the interest-free student loan scheme. Loan repayment should begin following the completion of the course and a one-year grace period. The students should repay the loan during the tenure of their employment within a period of 12 years.",

        "title": "New IGP should have blemish-free, exemplary service: BASL writes to President",
        "date": "March 18, 2023 07:35 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) stresses that the next Inspector-General of Police (IGP) should be an officer whose service is exemplary and free of any blemish. The police chief should be able to restore public confidence the Sri Lanka Police, which saw a serious erosion over the last few decades, the BASL said in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Attributing the erosion of public confidence in the police to the lack of confidence, politicisation, police brutality, custodial deaths, and the lack of professionalism, the association said it is of the view that public confidence in the police is vital for the administration of justice and the rule of law. The post of IGP will be left vacant on March 23 following the retirement of the current police chief, C.D. Wickramaratne. The IGP is the Head of the Police Department and has security of tenure in terms of the Removal of Officers (Procedure) Act NO. 5 of 2002. Hence it is of utmost importance that the best possible appointment be made to that office. The BASL also noted that Sri Lanka Police has had a practice to withhold during the pendency the promotions of police officers who are named as suspects or accused in criminal matters, respondents in Fundamental Rights (FR) applications pertaining to illegal arrests and torture. Similarly, promotions of officers who have a blemished record in the Sri Lanka Police are regularly withheld, the association said further. The BASL said it is of the view that the same or higher standards must be adopted by the Executive in appointing the Inspector General of Police. Hence, the BASL urged the President not to appoint an officer who has pending FR or criminal cases against him or any allegations of involvement in unlawful activity to the post of the IGP. The association said it is of the view that prior to the approval of the appointment of the IGP that the procedures to be followed in regard to recommendations or approvals for appointments under Article 41B or 41C should be determined by the Constitutional Council as provided for in Article 41E(6) of the Constitution. Such procedures and processes should be in the form of rules relating to the performance and discharge of the duties and functions of the Council as provided for in Article 41G (3) of the Constitution, the letter read further, urging the Head of State that the appointment of the IGP (and all other appointments to key offices) be done in a transparent manner so as to establish public confidence in the appointment process. The BASLs letter comes after sources revealed that the President has made recommendations to appoint Senior DIG in charge of Western Province, Deshabandu Tennakoon as the next IGP following the retirement of Wickramaratne.",

        "date": "March 18, 2023 10:32 pm",
        "content": "A court in Pakistan has decided that a hearing into charges former Prime Minister Imran Khan sold state gifts could no take place due to clashes between his supporters and police. Police said Khans backers threw stones and fired tear gas near the High Court in Islamabad. The former cricketer-turned-politician has since set off back to his home in Lahore, which police raided in his absence and made arrests. He denies the charges against him. The chaotic scenes saw Khan unable to enter the court before the judge agreed that he could mark his attendance and return home. The ex-PM says the charges against him are politically motivated but says he is attending court because I believe in the rule of law. The government says the charges against him have nothing to do with politics. He told Reuters that he had formed a committee to lead his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), in the event of his arrest. About 4,000 security officials, including elite commandos and anti-terrorism squads, have been deployed in Islamabad, AFP reported. Police blocked the highway into Islamabad with shipping containers and large trucks to stop Khans convoy as it approached the city. Officers armed with sticks and tear gas cannisters let his vehicle through, but most of his supporters were turned away. Speaking to the BBC when the convoy was stationary, Khan said that the authorities were trying to put him in prison to keep him out of the general election race later this year. I wont be able to campaign - thats the whole thing, he said. Earlier this week he told the BBC: Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning. In a sign of the deep divisions within Pakistani politics, the current Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted that Khans antics of the last few days had laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies and accused him of using supporters as human shields. Earlier in the week Lahore police tried to arrest Khan after he missed a hearing, and officers clashed with supporters outside his home. On Friday, the court granted Khan protection against arrest on the assurance that he would appear in court on Saturday. On Saturday Lahore police used a digger to gain entry to Khans residence in an operation involving nearly 1,000 security personnel, according to local media. Police later said they had arrested Khan supporters who had been involved in violence against police earlier in the week, including for throwing petrol bombs. The Punjab police chief said some officers would remain outside Khans residence. Khan was ousted as prime minister last April in a no-confidence vote but has kept up pressure on his successor Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early. He blames Sharif for an assassination attempt at a rally in November in which he was wounded in the leg. Authorities have rejected the accusation. Khan faces multiple court cases, including terrorism charges. He has cited a variety of reasons - including security concerns and injury from the assassination attempt in November - for not showing up to hearings. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "March 19, 2023 08:17 am",
        "content": "At least 13 people died after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Ecuador on Saturday afternoon, according to government officials. The earthquake struck near the southern town of Baláo and was more than 65 km (nearly 41 miles) deep, according to the United States Geological Survey. At least 11 people died in the province of El Oro and at least one person died in the province of Azuay, according to the communications department for Ecuadors president said. In an earlier statement, authorities said the person in Azuay was killed when a wall collapsed onto a car and that at least three of the victims in El Oro died when a security camera tower came down. People who were injured were being treated at hospitals, the Presidency added, but did not provide further details. The USGS gave the tremor an orange alert, saying significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response, the USGS added. It also estimated damage and economic losses were possible. CNN afiliate Ecuavisa reported structural damage to buildings in Cuenca, one of the countrys biggest cities. The historic city is in the UN list of world heritage sites. There is no tsunami warning in effect for the area, according to the US National Weather Service. The airports of Guayaquil and Cuenca remained open and operational, the countrys statement said.

        "content": "The term of office of 340 out of the 341 local government bodies is set to expire at midnight today (March 19). Following the 2018 Local Government election, which saw the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) securing a majority of the seats, the next local elections were originally scheduled to be held last year. However, the local elections were postponed indefinitely due to the exacerbated economic situation and the political instability in the country. Thereby, the term of office of local government bodies was extended for a period of one year. Although the new members were supposed to be elected for the local government bodies prior to the expiration of the tenure, the elections have been rescheduled to April 25, after being initially scheduled for March 09. After the tenure of the local government bodies expires, the authority of 29 municipal councils will be transferred to the municipal commissioners, while the authority of the 36 municipal councils and the 275 local councils is transferred to the secretaries of relevant institutions. However, the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, which was established later than the other local government bodies, will not expire at midnight today. Meanwhile, all heads and members of local government bodies have been asked to return the official vehicles provided to them before the expiration of the term of office.",

        "date": "March 19, 2023 11:51 am",
        "content": "Trumps former vice president Mike Pence told ABC News Trumps possible indictment just feels like a politically charged prosecution here. Asked about Trumps call for people to protest if he is indicted, Pence said he thinks protesters will understand they need to do so peacefully and in a lawful manner. Braggs office earlier this month invited Trump to testify before the grand jury probing the payment, which legal experts said was a sign that an indictment was close. Trump declined the offer, the person familiar with the matter said. Bragg addressed in an email to staff on Saturday reported by Politico and confirmed by Reuters that we do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York ... We will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly and speak publicly only when appropriate. Braggs email did not mention Trump by name but cited ongoing press attention and public comments surrounding an ongoing investigation. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance violations tied to his arranging payments to Daniels and another woman in exchange for their silence about affairs they said theyd had with Trump, among other crimes. He has said Trump directed him to make the payments. The U.S. Attorneys office in Manhattan did not charge Trump with a crime. The probe is one of several legal woes Trump faces as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency. Trump is also confronting a state-level criminal probe in Georgia over efforts to overturn the 2020 results in that state. A special counsel named by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is currently investigating Trumps handling of classified government documents after leaving office, as well as his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden, a Democrat. Braggs office last year won the conviction of the Trump Organization on tax fraud charges. But Bragg declined to charge Trump himself with financial crimes related to his business practices, prompting two prosecutors who worked on the probe to resign. Trump, who was in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday and attended the NCAA wrestling championships, leads his early rivals for his partys nomination. He had the support of 43 of Republicans in a February ReutersIpsos poll, compared with 31 for his nearest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has not yet announced his candidacy. Trump in 2018 initially disputed knowing anything about the payment to Daniels. He later acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the payment, which he called a simple private transaction. Cohen, who served time in prison after pleading guilty, testified before the grand jury this week. Grand jury proceedings are not public. Outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan, he told reporters he did not testify out of a desire for revenge against Trump. This is all about accountability, he said. He needs to be held accountable for his dirty deeds. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, spoke with prosecutors last week, according to her lawyer. Trump founded his Truth Social media platform after being banned by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube following the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. He has since regained his accounts on those services, though he limited his Saturday statement to Truth. His messages on Truth Social are very concerning as he is declaring the entire justice system corrupt, said Jennifer Stromer-Falley, a senior associate dean at Syracuse University and an expert in social media use during elections.

Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay extended the support during a recent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, says the Ministry of Agriculture. The Indian High Commissioner has also held talks with Sri Lankas Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera regarding the matter. Accordingly, the Indian government has agreed to provide high-breed cows to Sri Lanka due to the lack of high-milk-producing cattle breeds on the island. Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture mentioned that the manufacturing of dairy and dairy-based products in Sri Lanka has dropped by 19 last year due to the setbacks faced by the industry amidst the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the countrys maize harvest in the 2021 Maha Season plunged to 90,000 metric tons, leading to a shortage of animal feed in the country, the ministry said further, adding that this was exacerbated as the importation of maize was hindered by the dollar shortage. However, by the end of 2022, the country managed to import 180,000 metric tons of maize and cultivate 60,000 hectares of maize during this season, the ministry said further.",

        "date": "March 19, 2023 03:17 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Council of England and Wales has urged the Sri Lankan government not to undermine the independence of the judiciary. The statement comes after an interim order issued by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on March 03, preventing the Finance Secretary and the Attorney General from withholding the budgetary allocations for elections was challenged by the lawmakers of the ruling party. The government MPs, who claimed that the powers and privileges of the parliament have been violated by this interim order, want the authorities not to act on the interim order until the inquiry carried out by the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges concludes. In reference to this, the Bar Councils chair Nick Vineall KC underscored that an independent judiciary is an essential and integral part of the rule of law. So too is the principle that governments comply with court orders. He said the Bar Council is hopeful that the parliamentary authorities in Sri Lanka will reconsider most carefully the appropriateness of questioning Supreme Court judges before a parliamentary committee. We similarly hope that the Sri Lankan government will consider most carefully whether it can be ever be right to encourage disobedience to court orders. Read the full statement below: Elections to Sri Lankas Local Authorities are supposed to have taken place by 19 March 2023. The Sri Lankan Parliament has allocated funds through the National Budget, but release of the funds has been blocked despite requests from the Elections Commission. On 3 March 2023 a three-judge bench of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court issued an interim order to the Attorney-General and to the Secretary to the Treasury to refrain from withholding funds for the elections to the countrys local authorities. The Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament has recently accepted a request to refer the conduct of the three Supreme Court judges to the Sri Lankan Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges, and on 10 March the Sri Lankan Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe told Parliament that it is a serious offence to implement the interim order before hearing the privilege issue by the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges. The Minister then requested the Deputy Speaker to advise all relevant authorities not to act on matters relating to the polls until the said Parliamentary Committee concludes its inquiry on the matter. The Parliamentary authorities have now written to the Court Registry asking for a copy of the interim order to be placed before the Committee on Privileges on 22 March 2023. The UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary state that it is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary and there shall not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process, nor shall judicial decisions by the courts be subject to revision. Chair of the Bar Council of England and Wales, Nick Vineall KC, said: An independent judiciary is an essential and integral part of the rule of law. So too is the principle that governments comply with court orders. We hope that the parliamentary authorities in Sri Lanka will reconsider most carefully the appropriateness of questioning Supreme Court Judges before a parliamentary committee, and we similarly hope that the Sri Lankan government will consider most carefully whether it can be ever be right to encourage disobedience to court orders.",

        "title": "Sri Lanka counts down to IMF bailout seen as just the beginning",
        "date": "March 19, 2023 04:24 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is counting the minutes to Monday, when the International Monetary Funds executive board is expected to approve a 2.9 billion bailout for the bankrupt island nation. For the first time in months, many are hopeful that the IMFs decision will kick-start the countrys recovery from its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Faced with deepening poverty under high inflation, scarce foreign reserves and dire shortages of essentials, Sri Lanka is on the cusp of the bailout after China offered additional financing assurances required by the fund, following months of tough negotiations. Beijings apparent hesitance to extend support drew comparisons to a more obliging India. But Sri Lankas ambassador to China, Palitha Kohona, strongly defended the countrys key bilateral lender, telling Nikkei Asia, The Chinese bureaucracy works according to its own rhythm. Experts stress just how crucial the final IMF approval is for stabilizing Sri Lankas economy, after the turmoil that brought down President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last year. Without fresh dollars to import essential goods, an economic turnaround is impossible, said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. In the medium term, implementing reforms under the IMF program and successfully restructuring debt should improve Sri Lankas outlook. In February, the countrys foreign reserves increased to 2.2 billion thanks to various factors such as higher remittances from overseas workers, though the sum is still far from sufficient. Talal Rafi, an economist at the Deloitte Economics Institute, believes that if Sri Lanka receives the IMF loan, it will allow the country to unlock more capital from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and bilateral partners. IMF approval certifies to the world that Sri Lanka is on the right path, he said. However, he cautioned, entering an IMF program is just the beginning. The reforms that come next will not be easy. Sri Lanka has gone to the IMF before, completing only nine of 16 such programs. So, implementing the right reforms is most important, or we would be at the IMF again, like Argentina, Rafi said. Dhananath Fernando, chief executive of the independent Advocata Institute policy think tank in Colombo, is skeptical in light of Sri Lankas track record. But he is also hopeful because, he said, the severity of the crisis leaves little space to deviate from the program. When we went to the IMF during the past 16 times, our debt was sustainable, but this time ... our debt is not sustainable, Fernando said, saying it would be next to impossible to deal with those obligations without the IMF. We need growth and we need to grow out of the crisis, and growth will take place only when we implement economic reforms, he said. In focus are Sri Lankas state-owned enterprises (SOEs), many of which have racked up huge losses. SriLankan Airlines loss in the first half of the 2022-2023 fiscal year came to over 100 billion Sri Lankan rupees (295 million), more than twice the amount the government spends on support for the most vulnerable citizens. Sri Lanka has a bloated public sector, where salaries and pensions took up 86 of government revenue in 2021, and many SOEs are making massive losses and do not even have annual reports for public reference, Rafi said. Analysts said that the country needs to redirect more money to the poor, and that SOE reforms are also essential in order to make doing business easier. Sri Lanka is ranked 99th in the World Banks index on the ease of doing business. But Fernando noted that many of Sri Lankas leaders have backpedaled away from promised reforms in fear of consequences at the ballot box. SOEs have been used as a political weapon by most political parties to provide employment for supporters to get more votes, he said. While President Ranil Wickremesinghes government attempts to put its own house in order, there are lingering questions about the potential geopolitical fallout of the crisis. India and China, strategic regional competitors and key lenders to Sri Lanka, have been in the spotlight lately. Last week, Sri Lanka asked the State Bank of India and the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka to extend a 1 billion credit line by half a year beyond the scheduled expiration later this month. Informed sources close to the Indian government told Nikkei Asia that the two sides are discussing the matter. Last year, India extended around 4 billion worth of support to Colombo. In mid-January, it offered assurances to the IMF that it was willing to support Sri Lankas debt restructuring. China, for its part, was seen as more reluctant to offer a similar pledge. Beijing did send help, but it mostly came in forms other than financial assistance. In 2022, China donated 10,000 tons of rice for more than 1 million students across 7,900 schools, along with 5 billion Sri Lankan rupees worth of medicine and health equipment. But when the Export-Import Bank of China followed India by sending a letter to Sri Lankas Finance Ministry in late January, offering a two-year debt moratorium, it was met with disappointment. China was expected to do more, Reuters quoted a Sri Lankan source as saying. This is much less than what is required and expected of them. In February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen criticized Beijings approach to distressed countries more broadly, saying, Chinas lack of willingness to comprehensively participate and to move in a timely way has really been a roadblock. In early March, the Ex-Im Bank sent another letter, promising to expedite debt treatment and finalize the terms in the coming months. This moved Sri Lanka over the line with the IMF. George I.H. Cooke, a Sri Lankan former diplomat, stressed that India and China had different priorities. He said a continued collapse in Sri Lanka would have been a bigger immediate problem for India, risking a refugee influx. On the other hand, Cooke noted that China lends to many countries, and that easily granting concessions could have led to many others tapping on their doors saying, Give us the same thing you gave Sri Lanka and help us too. Ambassador Kohona insisted that China has always been helpful, from countering terrorism to supplying COVID-19 vaccines. On debt, the envoy acknowledged that obtaining approvals was time-consuming but said, We had no doubt that China would take its time but would stand by Sri Lanka in its time of dire financial need. He added, Undoubtedly, we are also grateful that, as major bilateral creditors, India and Japan also have provided the requisite assurances. Source  Nikkei Asia -Agencies",

        "date": "March 19, 2023 07:35 pm",
        "content": "The police have uncovered a hidden cache of high-power explosive materials from Avissawella, following a confession made by contract killer Booru Muna who was arrested after fleeing police custody recently. Thereby, 662 grams of C-4 type high-power explosive materials were found hidden under a utility pole on Dasawella Road in Hanwella. The explosive material stash was recovered by the crimes division of the Western Province (South) Police. Accompanied by an attorney-at-law, Ravindu Sanka de Silva alias Booru Muna was arrested by the officers of Avissawella Police on Friday (March 17) while he was on his way to surrender to the court. Later, the investigators detained and interrogated Booru Muna for 72 hours in total following a detention order obtained from SSP Lalith Abeysekara in charge of the crimes division of Western Province (South) Police. Meanwhile, the crimes divisions of Galle, Negombo, Rathgama, Elpitiya, Hikkaduwa, Katunayake, Uragaha and Negombo police stations have also recorded statements from Booru Muna with regard to the murders and other criminal activities he was purportedly involved in. However, Booru Muna only admitted to two out of the nine murder allegations levelled against him, police sources revealed. Booru Muna who was the accomplice of Rathgama Vidura had been hired by organized Dubai-based criminal figure and drug trafficker Kannangarage Lalith Kannangara for a contract killing on the promise of a forged identity card and a passport. He had been tasked with orchestrating the murder of a restaurant owner in Hanwella who is said to have harassed the accomplices of Kannangara. During lengthy interrogations, Booru Muna has divulged he was planning to blow up the aforesaid businessmans residence and restaurant along with his brothers restaurant using these explosive materials. Reports revealed that the Dubai-based criminal figure Kannangara had provided this cache of explosive materials to Booru Muna. Following the murder of the restaurant owner on 18 December 2022, Booru Muna, on the instructions of Kannangara, had hidden the cache of explosive materials under a utility pole on Dasawella Road. On February 24, Booru Muna fled police custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake after he was barred from boarding a flight to Dubai owing to a travel ban previously issued by the court. Booru Muna had attempted to fly out of the country using a forged passport. However, two Buddhist monks had reportedly aided and abetted the suspects escape after he was taken into custody at the airport. Following his escape, Avissawella High Court on March 15 once again barred the foreign travels of Booru Muna after taking into the submissions presented by the Western Province South police division. Meanwhile, an active serving member of the Sri Lanka Navy, his wife and four others are currently under arrest for aiding and abetting Booru Muna following his escape last month.",

        "content": "More than a million Sri Lankan paddy farmers in all 25 districts will get vital assistance through a shipment of over 36,000 metric tons of fertilizer handed over today by the United States to the Ministry of Agriculture, says the United States Embassy in Sri Lanka. The shipment of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been procured by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for distribution free-of-charge to farmers. This second shipment of USAID-supported fertilizer is delivered on a promise USAID Administrator Samantha Power made last September in response to Sri Lankas food security challenges. It brings the total of USAID-supported TSP and urea fertilizer to more than 45,000MT over the last year, according to the US Embassy in Sri Lanka. U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung said, Farmers are working hard to maximize rice production and meet the countrys food needs under difficult circumstances, and the United States is committed to assisting. This year we celebrate 75 years of bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and the United States. Our story is one focused on people, progress, and partnership, and our commitment to supporting the people of Sri Lanka in good times and bad will not waiver. Todays fertilizer donation is a demonstration of Americas enduring goodwill and commitment to the people of Sri Lanka. It comes without strings attached and it is a testament to how the American people stand with the people of Sri Lanka, Ambassador Chung added. The United States, through USAID, provided 46 million in funding to procure essential fertilizer, providing much-needed nutrients to paddy crops, helping increase paddy production, and averting a food crisis. This funding also provided cash assistance to small-holder farmers who were affected by low yields over the past few agricultural seasons and on account of the prevailing economic crisis. The program is being implemented by UN FAO with oversight provisions to ensure transparency and accountability, the US Embassy in Sri Lanka added. Speaking at the handover Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera expressed his gratitude to the people of America and FAO for providing timely support to reinvigorate the local agricultural sector. Through this support, we are certain the yield of the upcoming harvesting seasons will improve steadily. Our eventual aim is to minimize dependency on rice imports and further empower Sri Lankan paddy farmers, Minister Amaraweera added. Fertilizer will help local farmers boost their production so that the country is food secure. Most importantly, this also can jump-start market-driven agricultural production and potentially lead to Sri Lanka becoming a food exporter, said USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Gabriel Grau. In the last year, the United States has provided more than 270 million in new support to Sri Lankans amid the ongoing economic crisis. In addition, the U.S. the largest donor to the UN Humanitarian Needs Plan for Sri Lanka. We thank the U.S. government for the support extended at a critical juncture, enabling this consignment of TSP fertilizer, the first to arrive in the country in two years, which will be distributed to all paddy farmers based on the extent of their cultivation and the advised application for each of the agricultural zones through the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, said FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Mr Vimlendra Sharan. Minister Amaraweera and FAO Representative Sharan joined Ambassador Chung and USAID Mission Director Grau at todays handover ceremony. This assistance is one component of the United States long-standing partnership with the Sri Lankan people to promote a healthy, educated, and employed population.

Speaking during a seminar held in the southern town of Weligama, Peiris said that the legal fraternity should now allow the executives to put the judges under stress. We have seen that the executive is unwilling to obey court orders and attempts are being made to systematically ignore court rulings, Peiris said. We must not allow the executive to put the judges under stress, Peiris further stressed in a reference to the ongoing spat over the non holding of the local council elections. The Supreme Court earlier this month issued an interim order asking the state officials not to hinder the election by not releasing the funds. At least two government parliamentarians had raised a privileges issue in parliament over the interim order which they claimed was an abuse of parliamentary privileges. Peiris said that the executive meaning the President Ranil Wickremesinghes decision to not conduct the election was unacceptable and the use of parliament to bring pressure on the judiciary was an unhealthy development. All of us must fight against it, Peiris was quoted as saying by PTI. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 20, 2023 09:34 am",
        "content": "Investors are betting that Sri Lanka will win final approval for about 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund on Monday, a key step for the bankrupt nation to revive its economy from the worst crisis in decades. The South Asian nations dollar bonds have returned 20 this year, the top performers in the world. The local currency surged 8 and stocks climbed 5 this month, beating their Asian peers on anticipation of billions of dollars in financing trickling in. The rupee fell 45 last year, while the CSE All-share index declined more than 30 in 2022. The funds are crucial to restore stability and debt sustainability for an economy mired in a recession. Through 2022, shortages of essential goods from fuel to medicines loomed large, stoking Asias fastest inflation and depleting funds. Since defaulting on its dollar debt in May, Sri Lanka has taken tough measures to put its economy back on a steadier path, including cutting subsidies, raising taxes and loosening its control on the currency. It also increased borrowing cost to the most since 2001. Sri Lanka also secured debt assurances from bilateral creditors including India, China and Paris Club nations and initiated good-faith negotiations with private bondholders as pre-requisites to getting the bailout. The pathway appears to have been gradually cleared for the IMF board to sign off on the program, said Esther Law, senior investment manager for emerging-markets debt at Amundi SA in London. One would expect the bonds move up slightly in price the moment the IMF program is announced. Debt due in 2030 has risen to about 36 cents on the dollar from 21 cents in November. The IMF bailout will help support bond prices at current levels while more gains will depend on how successful the nation is in raising revenue, said Edwin Gutierrez, London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at abrdn plc. Foreign investors are also expected to boost their holdings of Sri Lankas government bonds on bets a bailout would unlock more funding to stabilize the nations finances. You cant wait until the debt restructuring is over, after that the price points will be very different, said Bingumal Thewarathanthri, the chief executive officer for Standard Chartered Plc in Sri Lanka. The island nation has a long track record with the IMF. It secured 16 bailouts since the 1960s with the last one in 2016. Disbursements by the Washington-based lender are spread across the duration of the program and tied to reviews, while an initial amount is released subsequent to board approval. Debt Talks Focus will turn next to the debt talks, which Fitch Ratings said may drag on for a long time as creditors debate on whether to include local-currency sovereign borrowings in the restructuring. The rating company cut its score on rupee debt in December, as it viewed a default probable. The prospects for a deal with creditors remain unclear for now, said Sagarika Chandra, Hong Kong-based associate director. Fitch cited the case of Zambia, which received an IMF bailout in August and where debt restructuring talks are still ongoing. Tellimer expects the recovery value of Sri Lankas bonds to be at 40 cents, with some upside possible as the nations debt targets imply less need for small haircut, said Patrick Curran, a senior economist. Sri Lanka is showing some signs of a turnaround. Reserves rebounded 29 to 2.2 billion in the four months through February, inflation is easing and daily power cuts have ended. IMF aid will be a relief for the country, but the road ahead is not easy, said Ankur Shukla, an economist at Bloomberg Economics in Mumbai. Debt restructuring could take time to complete and this will keep the country locked out of markets. It will also not be politically easy to continue with harsh reforms demanded by the IMF.

        "date": "March 20, 2023 12:16 pm",
        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen drills simulating a nuclear counterattack against the U.S. and South Korea in a warning to the allies who are scaling up their joint military exercises, state media KCNA said on Monday. The Norths drills involved a short-range missile launch but - unusually - the missile flew from a buried silo, which analysts say would help improve speed and stability in future tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). KCNA said the exercises on Saturday and Sunday were designed to boost the countrys war deterrence and nuclear counterattack capability, accusing Washington and Seoul of making an explicit attempt to unleash a war against it. The drill also aimed to demonstrate our tougher will to make an actual war response and send a stronger warning to the enemy who expand their war drills for aggression, KCNA said. In the exercises, a ballistic missile equipped with a mock nuclear warhead flew 800 km (497 miles) before hitting a target under the scenario of a tactical nuclear attack, KCNA said. KCNA photos showed Kim attended the test, again with his young daughter, as flames roared from the soaring missile before it hit the target. Analysts said the photos suggested the launch involved a KN-23 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), but unlike past tests, the engine exhaust appeared to be vented either side at the moment of liftoff, which could mean that a silo was used. Until now, North Korea has preferred mobile launchers for everything from SRBMs to even huge ICBMs, but given its poor road and system conditions, it was difficult to guarantee the stability of the missile during actual operations, said Yang Uk, a fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. The latest launch might possibly serve as a test for future launches of larger missiles like the Hwasong-17 ICBM in a silo. South Koreas defence ministry spokesman said the North is making significant technological advances in its nuclear programme but did not elaborate. NUCLEAR WAR DETERRENCE Kim said the exercises improved the militarys war capability and urged the military to stand ready for any immediate and overwhelming nuclear counterattack anytime. The present situation, in which the enemies are getting ever more pronounced in their moves for aggression against the DPRK, urgently requires the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear war deterrence exponentially, KCNA quoted him as saying. Kim was using the acronym of his countrys official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. The nuclear force of the DPRK will strongly deter, control and manage the enemys reckless moves and provocations with its high war readiness, and carry out its important mission without hesitation in case of any unwanted situation, he added. South Korea and Japan reported a launch of a North Korean short-range ballistic missile off the east coast on Sunday, the latest in a series of missile tests in recent weeks. North Korea has reacted furiously to South Korea-U.S. combined military drills, calling them a rehearsal for invasion against it. The allies have been carrying out exercises this month, including air and sea drills on Sunday involving U.S. B-1B bombers. The U.S. and South Korea navies and marine corps are set to kick off their first large-scale Ssangyong amphibious landing exercises in five years on Monday for a two-week run until April 3. Last month, the two countries staged tabletop exercises simulating North Koreas nuclear attack amid South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeols push for more confidence in U.S. extended deterrence - its military capability, especially nuclear forces, to deter attacks on its allies. In another dispatch, KCNA said more than 1.4 million North Koreans have volunteered to join or re-enlist in the military to fight against Seoul and Washington, up from about 800,000 reported by a state newspaper just two days before.

Delivering the much-anticipated verdict after the widely publicised trial came to an end, the three-member judge bench had sentenced the 07 suspects to death and also ordered them to pay Rs. 1 million as compensation to the victims family. In addition to the death penalty, the suspects were also sentenced to a further 30 years in prison. Sivaloganathan Vidya, an 18-year-old schoolgirl from Punkudutivu, was abducted, gang-raped and murdered in Jaffna, whilst returning home from school on May 13, 2015. However, the appealing party seeks an order from the Supreme Court that the relevant death penalty be declared to have been imposed in violation of the law and to acquit them of the charges.",

        "date": "March 20, 2023 09:21 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is seeking a 10-year moratorium on its foreign debt, President Ranil Wickremesinghes office said on March 20, 2023 on the eve of a desperately needed 2.9 billion IMF bailout. Mr. Wickremesinghes office quoted him as saying the widely expected International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue will only give us a breathing space where they will say we are no longer bankrupt. All the money we have to repay this year, I hope we will be given at least 10 more years to repay it, Mr. Wickremesinghe told a meeting of students in Colombo on Sunday. He did not give details of his plans to restructure Sri Lankas 46 billion external debt. Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in April 2022 as the country plunged into its worst economic crisis, running out of cash to finance even the most essential imports and causing massive social unrest. Widespread protests over economic mismanagement, acute shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and runaway inflation forced Wickremesinghes predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign in July. The IMFs executive board was expected to sign off on Colombos bailout application later on Monday after a long delay in securing financial assurances from China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral lender. Beijing had said this year it was offering a two-year moratorium on its loans to Sri Lanka, but the concession fell short of IMF expectations for the sustainability of the islands debt. Mr. Wickremesinghe had said after China agreed to restructure its loans that he expected the first tranche of the 2.9 billion IMF package would be made available within the month. Officials involved in the negotiations said the terms of debt restructuring must be finalised and agreed by all parties before June, when the IMF was expected to review the bailout programme. Sri Lanka will not be able to draw down the second tranche unless a debt restructuring plan is agreed with all creditors, said one of the officials, who asked not to be identified. Colombo is also banking on the IMF deal to unfreeze billions of dollars in foreign aid for projects suspended since Sri Lanka defaulted on its loans last year. The government has already doubled taxes, increased energy tariffs threefold and slashed subsidies in an effort to meet the preconditions of the IMF bailout. The austerity measures have sparked widespread protests and led to strikes that crippled the health and logistics sectors last week. Wickremesinghe has said he had no alternative but to go with an IMF programme. Sri Lankas economy shrank by a record 7.8 last year as it grappled with its worst foreign exchange crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has authorized the Finance Ministry Secretary or the Treasurys Deputy Secretary to sign the Promissory Notes and other required documents as soon as Sri Lanka receives the IMF-supported Extended Fund Facility (EFF) approval from the IMF Executive Board. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting held this evening (20), according to Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardene. Sri Lanka is expected to receive final approval for about 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday, a key step for the bankrupt nation to revive its economy from the worst crisis in decades. The funds are crucial to restore stability and debt sustainability for an economy mired in a recession. Through 2022, shortages of essential goods from fuel to medicines loomed large, stoking Asias fastest inflation and depleting funds. Since defaulting on its dollar debt in May, Sri Lanka has taken tough measures to put its economy back on a steadier path, including cutting subsidies, raising taxes and loosening its control on the currency. It also increased borrowing cost to the most since 2001. Sri Lanka also secured debt assurances from bilateral creditors including India, China and Paris Club nations and initiated good-faith negotiations with private bondholders as pre-requisites to getting the bailout.

He further said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will make a special statement on this tomorrow (21). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced that the IMF Executive Board approved Sri Lankas program under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the Presidents Media Division also confirmed. The program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to US 7 billion from the IMF, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. This is a historic milestone for the country as the Government seeks to restore macroeconomic stability and achieve debt sustainability, the PMD reported. Earlier this month, Sri Lanka received IMF-compatible financing assurances from its official creditors, including Paris Club members, India and China, allowing the IMF to convene an Executive Board and consider Sri Lankas request for a loan. The program is expected to provide much-needed policy space to drive the economy out of the unprecedented challenges and instill confidence amongst all the stakeholders. Sri Lanka reached a Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF on a four-year program supported by the Extended Fund Facility on 1st September 2022. The program, amounting to US 3bn, is expected to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while protecting vulnerable groups and safeguarding Sri Lankas financial system. Since September, the Government of Sri Lanka has held official creditor meetings to update stakeholders on the countrys reform agenda and share information transparently as well as engaging with commercial creditors. Following the IMF Executive Board approval, the disbursement of the first tranche under this program is expected to take place in the coming days. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has welcomed the announcement: In the 75 years of Sri Lankas independence, there has never been a more critical period for our economic future. Our official creditors have declared their support following continuous and positive engagements over the last few months, and we are pleased that the IMF Executive Board approved our program, enabling Sri Lanka to access up to US 7 billion in funding from the IMF and IFIs. From the very start, we committed to full transparency in all our discussions with financial institutions and with our creditors. I express my gratitude to the IMF and our international partners for their support as we look to get the economy back on track for the long term through prudent fiscal management and our ambitious reform agenda. Since taking office last July, it has been my priority to stabilize Sri Lankas economy and achieve sustainable levels of debt. To do so, we have taken some tough decisions, but we did so with a commitment to widening our social safety nets, protecting the vulnerable, rooting out corruption and ensuring we can grow an inclusive and internationally attractive economy. The IMF program is critical to achieving this vision for our country, and we are committed to successfully completing the IMF program and achieving debt sustainability. We will continue to engage with all our creditors, and I encourage both our bilateral and commercial creditors to strengthen and foster coordination in the context of our forthcoming engagement. The IMF program will also be imperative to improving Sri Lankas standing in and access to international capital markets, and it will demonstrate that Sri Lanka is once again a country attractive to talent, investors and tourists.",

        "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today a 48month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about US3 billion), the international lender announced. Sri Lanka has been hit hard by a catastrophic economic and humanitarian crisis. The economy is facing significant challenges stemming from pre-existing vulnerabilities and policy missteps in the lead up to the crisis, further aggravated by a series of external shocks. The EFF-supported program aims to restore Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigate the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguard financial sector stability, and strengthen governance and growth potential, it said in a brief statement. The Executive Boards decision will enable an immediate disbursement equivalent to SDR 254 million (about US333 million) and catalyze financial support from other development partners, it said. Following the Executive Board discussion on Sri Lanka, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, issued the following statement: Sri Lanka has been facing tremendous economic and social challenges with a severe recession amid high inflation, depleted reserves, an unsustainable public debt, and heightened financial sector vulnerabilities. Institutions and governance frameworks require deep reforms. For Sri Lanka to overcome the crisis, swift and timely implementation of the EFF-supported program with strong ownership for the reforms is critical. Ambitious revenue-based fiscal consolidation is necessary for restoring fiscal and debt sustainability while protecting the poor and vulnerable. In this regard, the momentum of ongoing progressive tax reforms should be maintained, and social safety nets should be strengthened and better targeted to the poor. For the fiscal adjustments to be successful, sustained fiscal institutional reforms on tax administration, public financial and expenditure management, and energy pricing are critical. Having obtained specific and credible financing assurances from major official bilateral creditors, it is now important for the authorities and creditors make swift progress towards restoring debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported program. The authorities commitments to transparently achieve a debt resolution, consistent with the program parameters and equitable burden sharing among creditors in a timely fashion, are welcome. Sri Lanka should stay committed to the multi-pronged disinflation strategy to safeguard the credibility of its inflation targeting regime. As the market regains confidence, the authorities recent introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility will help to rebuild the reserve buffer. Maintaining a sound and adequately capitalized banking system is important. Implementing a bank recapitalization plan and strengthening financial supervision and crisis management framework are crucial to ensure financial sector stability. The ongoing efforts to tackle corruption should continue, including revamping anti-corruption legislation. A more comprehensive anti-corruption reform agenda should be guided by the ongoing IMF governance diagnostic mission that conducts an assessment of Sri Lankas anti-corruption and governance framework. The authorities should step up growth-enhancing structural reforms with technical assistance support from development partners.",

        "content": "Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena has assured that facts about the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will not be hidden from the public, emphasizing that a transparent procedure will be followed. Speaking at the Cabinet briefing this morning (21 March), the Minister said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe too, has assured that once the IMF agreement is signed, all related matters will be presented before the Parliament. Commenting on the EFF approved by the IMF to Sri Lanka last night (20 March), Gunawardena explained that as per the agreement, regardless of who comes into power within the next 48 months, the relevant Government must act in accordance with the terms of the agreement, despite being surrounded by political opinions, and must implement the programme. We have cheated the IMF 16 times before this by not acting in accordance with the conditions we agreed upon. If that happens again this time, the country will fall into a bigger abyss. Therefore, I believe that it is important to focus on creating a national consensus on working in compliance with the programme, as opposed to working in line with political agendas, he said. Moreover, the Minister also said that it is of his personal opinion that those political parties who are against the IMF deal propose their alternative suggestions and potential solutions in this regard before the Parliament, after which it can be debated or voted upon.",

        "content": "The proposal to Parliament that all courses and exams conducted at the Sri Lanka Law College should be held in English has been defeated. The proposal was defeated during a vote at this mornings (21 March) Parliamentary session, when 113 Members of Parliament (MPs) voted against the decision taken by the Sri Lanka Law College to make English the mandatory medium of examination, with MP Chandima Weerakkody being the only one who voted in favour of the proposal. During former President Gotabaya Rajapaksas tenure, a Gazette was passed on the proposal made by Minister Ali Sabry, who served as the Minister of Justice at the time, making it mandatory that all Law College exams be held in English. The relevant Gazette was issued by the Incorporated Council of Legal Education in December 2020. Subsequently, however, several parties including Ministers, MPs and the Law College Students Union criticized the move, deeming it unfair on a majority of the students. The Ministerial Consultative Committee on Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms also did not agree to the decision taken by the Council of Legal Education.",

        "date": "March 21, 2023 12:12 pm",
        "content": "Philadelphia will pay 9.25 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by racial justice protesters who accused police of abusing them at a 2020 rally following the killing of George Floyd, the city said on Monday. The Philadelphia city government said in a written statement the payment would be distributed among 343 plaintiffs who alleged physical and emotional injuries in the police response to protests ignited by the killing of Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. The city will also provide a grant of at least 500,000 to the Bread  Roses Community Fund for free mental health counseling for residents of West Philadelphia, a predominantly Black neighborhood, who have been victims of police violence, lawyers for plaintiffs said. Videos of the protest showed Philadelphia police using tear gas and pepper spray on a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered on a major highway on June 1, 2020. Plaintiffs also accused police of firing rubber bullets into the crowd. The 2020 protests in Philadelphia were among many that came after video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer pinning Floyds neck to the ground with his knee for about nine minutes. The Legal Defense Fund, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs, called the settlement one of the largest in the citys history. The Fund said police had agreed to meet with West Philadelphia residents every six months to provide data on its use of force and to take questions from the community. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the pain and trauma caused by a legacy of systemic racism and police brutality against Black and Brown Philadelphians is immeasurable but that he hoped the settlement would help bring about some healing. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her department is a learning organization and it would continue work to better protect the first amendment rights of protesters. New York City recently agreed to pay out millions to protesters who alleged police abuse during that citys demonstrations in the wake of Floyds death. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Wickremesinghe further stated that the loan facility serves as an assurance from the international community that Sri Lanka has the capacity to restructure its debt and resume normal transactions. Additionally, he noted that the government is working to gradually lift import restrictions on essential goods, medicines, and tourism-related goods, as the foreign exchange situation improves. The President expressed his gratitude to all the countries that supported the IMF agreement, as well as the heads of the IMF and the World Bank, and is scheduled to present a full statement on the matter in Parliament tomorrow (22 March), while the agreement with the IMF is also due to be tabled in Parliament. The Executive Board of the IMF approved the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Sri Lanka at its board meeting held yesterday (20 March). The program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to US 7 billion from the IMF, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. Meanwhile, 48-month extended arrangement with an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about USD 3 billion) was also approved under the EFF, with the aim of restoring Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigating the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguarding financial sector stability, and strengthening governance and growth potential, the IMF said in a brief statement. .",

        "date": "March 21, 2023 12:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka, with the help of its legal and financial advisors, must present a debt restructuring strategy before the end of April 2023 in order to reach the International Monetary Funds targets to achieve debt sustainability, Peter Breuer, the IMF Asia  Pacific Departments Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka said today. Addressing a special virtual press briefing this morning, Breuer pointed out that for the IMF to lend to a country, it usually requires a sustainable debt situation. However, in Sri Lankas case, debt is not sustainable yet, but with financial assurances provided by its creditors, it is seen to be sustainable on a forward-looking basis, Breuer said further. Using this strategy, Sri Lanka should set up talks with its creditors for negotiations on debt restructuring in order to reach the targets set by the IMF, Breuer said, explaining that doing so would mean the island nations debt is sustainable. The objectives of debt restructuring targets set by the IMF seek to ensure a high likelihood of debt reduction; to keep rollover risks manageable; to avoid a renewed build-up of external pressures from debt service needs in the post-program years; and to ensure that financing gaps during the program periods are closed. Joined by IMFs Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer and Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Masahiro Nozaki, the press briefing detailed the IMF-supported 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. As the executive board of the International Monetary Fund has green-lighted this extended arrangement on Monday (March 20), Sri Lanka will immediately receive an initial disbursement of USD 333 million (amounting to SDR 254 million) from the EFF arrangement, which is expected to catalyze new external financing including from the ADB and the World Bank. According to Breuer, the first tranche of the loan is expected to be released in the next couple of days and the disbursements would be subjected to reviews every 6 months.",

National Peoples Power MP Vijitha Herath put forward the petition, accusing Siriwardana of failing to comply with an order issued by the Supreme Court. On March 03, a three-member Supreme Court bench delivered an interim order preventing the Finance Ministrys Secretary from withholding the budgetary funds allocated for the Local Government election. In his petition, the parliamentarian has sought the Supreme Court to issue another order directing the Finance Ministrys Secretary to act on the previously issued interim order. The election, which was repeatedly postponed citing inadequacy of funds due to the ongoing economic crisis, is now rescheduled for April 25. MP Herath, recalling the Supreme Courts interim order previously which was issued after granting leave to proceed with a fundamental rights (FR) petition filed by SJBs general secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, noted that a second interim order was also issued on March 03 preventing the Finance Secretary from withholding the budgetary funds allotted for the printing of ballot papers. On March 07, the Election Commission chairman, in a written request, appealed to the Finance Secretary to fund the polls. The letter detailed that Rs. 460 million is required to settle the payments to the Sri Lanka Police, Rs. 400 million for the Printing Department and another Rs. 500 million for the Postal Department. Referring to the election bodys request, MP Herath noted that the Finance Secretary, who is named as the respondent in his petition, has not yet released the requested funds to go ahead with the election preparations. Stressing that the Finance Secretary has no authority to disregard the Supreme Courts interim order, the petitioner said Siriwardanas conduct is in contempt of court pursuant to Article 105(3) of the Constitution. He also sought a Supreme Court order directing the Attorney General to file indictments against the Finance Secretary.",

        "date": "March 21, 2023 11:20 pm",
        "content": "The Third Meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Associations (IORA) Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security (WGMSS) chaired by Sri Lanka was held in Colombo on Monday (March 20) with the participation of the 23 IORA member states. The Secretary General of IORA Secretariat Salman Al Farisi and representatives of the Secretariat participated in virtual mode from the IORA Secretariat in Mauritius. Inaugurating the meeting, Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane highlighted the importance of the IORA as a forum for enhancing maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. In the area of Maritime Safety and Security, the topic under discussion at the Colombo Working Group, Foreign Secretary Wijewardane noted that the growing importance of the Indian Ocean requires awareness among IORA member states on related issues as well as of agreed principles and regulatory frameworks. The Indian Ocean rim region faces many traditional and non-traditional safety and security challenges including piracy, armed robberies at sea, transnational organized crimes such as human smuggling, human trafficking and drug trafficking, as well as illicit trafficking in wildlife, IUU fishing, ocean pollution, over-exploitation of marine resources, and illegal transport of hazardous material. Climate change and the destruction of ocean biodiversity also challenge the safety and security of the Indian Ocean. Critical infrastructure connected to the ocean which is physically, digitally and environmentally vulnerable needs to be protected. Foreign Secretary Wijewardane highlighted that Sri Lanka will assume the Chair of IORA in the latter half of this year for the period from 2023  2025. In this role, Sri Lanka will build on the important work done by Bangladesh as the current Chair and the UAE as the past Chair. Sri Lanka remained confident that collaboration among IORA Member States would lead towards a safe, secure, prosperous and sustainable Indian Ocean for the prosperity of its member states and beyond. Secretary General of IORA Salman Al Farisi, connecting in virtual mode highlighted that it is important for Member States to continue strengthening their dialogue and efforts to seek solutions to address common safety and security challenges in the region since Maritime Security and Safety is a key development issue in the region. Heads of Mission of IORA member states and dialogue partner countries based in Colombo; Commander of Sri Lanka Navy; senior officials of relevant ministries and government agencies including Ministry of Fisheries, Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lanka Coast Guard, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Merchant Shipping Secretariat, Disaster Management Center (DMC) and Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), the Global Maritime Crime Programme (GMCP) of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes; and officials of the Max Planck Foundation, as well as representatives of the GIZ, attended the inauguration event. Representatives of the following IORA Member States from Australia, Bangladesh, Comoros, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Seychelles, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen were present.

        "content": "A powerful earthquake has been felt in parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, sending panicked residents into the streets, according to witnesses. Pakistans Meteorological Department said Tuesdays earthquake measured at magnitude 6.8, with the epicentre being in the Hindu Kush mountain range near the remote northern Afghan province of Badakhshan. Separately, the US Geological Survey (USGS) put the magnitude slightly lower, at 6.5, according to preliminary information. The USGS said the epicentre was 40 kilometres (25 miles) south-southeast of the Afghan town of Jurm, near the borders with Pakistan and Tajikistan. So far no casualties have been reported, including in Afghanistan which was the quakes epicentre. So far, thank God, there has been no bad news of casualties. We hope that all citizens of the country are safe, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. He added that health centres across the country had been put on high alert. The tremor was felt in Afghan capital, Kabul, as well as a number of Pakistani cities, including Islamabad and Lahore. Sarah Hasan, a resident of Islamabad, told Al Jazeera that the walls of her house vibrated as the earthquake hit the Pakistani capital. It started off slowly and then became strong, the 43-year-old said. The house was vibrating, things were shaking. It started slowing down, and after a few minutes, it felt like everything is calm again. Witnesses also reported feeling the shaking in Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as in Indias capital, New Delhi. Large parts of South Asia are seismically active because a tectonic plate known as the Indian plate is pushing north into the Eurasian plate. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 1,000 people last year. Source - Al Jazeera - Agencies",

        "date": "March 22, 2023 07:53 am",
        "content": "A magnitude 6.5 earthquake rattled much of Pakistan and Afghanistan on Tuesday, sending panicked residents fleeing from homes and offices and frightening people in remote villages. At least 11 people died in the two countries. More than 100 people were brought to hospitals in the Swat valley region of Pakistans northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in a state of shock, Bilal Faizi, a spokesman for Pakistans emergency services told The Associated Press. These terrified people collapsed, and some of them collapsed because of the shock of the earthquake, he said. Faizi said most were later discharged from the hospital. Faizi and other officials said nine people were killed when roofs collapsed in various parts of northwestern Pakistan. Dozens of others were injured in the quake, which was centered in Afghanistan and also felt in bordering Tajikistan. The earthquake triggered landslides in some of the mountainous areas, disrupting traffic. Taimoor Khan, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority in the northwest, said at least 19 mudbrick homes collapsed in remote areas. We are still collecting data about the damages, he said. The powerful tremors sent many people fleeing their homes and offices in Pakistans capital of Islamabad, some reciting verses from the Quran, Islams holy book. Media reports suggested cracks had appeared in some apartment buildings in the city. In Afghanistan, Sharafat Zaman Amar, Talibans appointed spokesman for the public health ministry said, so far at least two people died and around 20 others were injured in the earthquake in Afghanistan. Zaman Amar said Unfortunately, there could be more casualties as the quake was so powerful, in most parts of the country all hospitals and health facilities are ready to save lives of people, he added. The scene was repeated in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan. The quake was so strong and terrifying, we thought houses are collapsing on us, people were all shouting and were shocked, said Shafiullah Azimi, a Kabul resident. Aziz Ahmad, 45, another Kabul resident, said In my life this was first time I have experienced such powerful quake, everyone was terrified, He added he and all his neighbors stayed out of their homes for hours, afraid of aftershocks. We couldnt dare to get back homes. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter of the magnitude 6.5 quake was 40 kilometers (25 miles) south-southeast of Jurm in Afghanistans mountainous Hindukush region, bordering Pakistan and Tajikistan. The quake struck 188 kilometers (116 miles) deep below the Earths surface, causing it to felt over a wide area. Physician Rakhshinda Tauseed was at her hospital in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore when the earthquake hit. I quickly asked patients to go move to a safer place, she said. Khurram Shahzad, a resident in Pakistans garrison city of Rawalpindi, said he was having dinner with his family at a restaurant when the walls started swaying. I quickly thought that it is a big one, and we left the restaurant and came out, he told The Associated Press by phone. He said he saw hundreds of people standing on the streets. The situation was similar in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan, where people were seen standing outside their homes and offices. Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a statement said he asked disaster management officials to remain vigilant to handle any situation. Zabihullah Mujahid, the main spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, tweeted that the Ministry of Public Health had ordered all health centers to be on standby. The region is prone to violent seismic upheavals. A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2005 killed thousands of people in Pakistan and Kashmir. Last year in southeastern Afghanistan, a 6.1 magnitude quake struck a rugged, mountainous region, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. Afghanistans Taliban rulers put the total death toll from the quake at 1,150, with hundreds more injured, while the U.N. has offered a lower estimate of 770. Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka says latest bailout funds can be used for fiscal support",
        "date": "March 22, 2023 08:01 am",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lankas bailout by the International Monetary Fund will help the bankrupt nation lower its borrowing costs, thanks in part to a change in how the cash can be used, central bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said. The Washington-based lender for the first time will allow Sri Lanka to use funds from the 3 billion bailout to cover government spending, Weerasinghe said in an interview with Bloomberg late Tuesday in the capital Colombo. The countrys 16 previous bailouts only targeted balance-of-payment support. That will ease the government borrowing requirement from domestic markets, Weerasinghe said. This will help bring down the interest rates and ease the pressure on the domestic interest rates further. Currently, the yields for the one-year Sri Lanka treasury bills stand at nearly 26 Domestic bonds due July 2033 were steady on Tuesday after the IMF announced a 48-month program for the country. The first tranche of 333 million will be released soon and is expected to help restore stability and rebuild foreign exchange reserves in an economy battling recession. The IMF programs objective is to see headline inflation falling back to the target band of 4-6 by early 2025. The multilateral lender has recommended the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should stand ready to further adjust its stance over the coming monetary policy meetings. Earlier this month Sri Lanka raised its benchmark rate by 100 basis points to 16.5 to secure the IMF loan. Weerasinghe stuck by his projection of bringing inflation down to mid-single-digits by the end of 2023 from about 50 currently. This reduction, together with the IMFs loan and debt restructuring, will push market participants to reduce the uncertainty premium imposed on Sri Lanka, he said. While the IMF expects Sri Lanka to unveil a restructuring strategy by end-April, market participants fear a delay as all creditors may not agree on including local-currency borrowings. Sri Lankas local currency debt, including treasury bills, bonds, central bank advances and loans to state enterprises, stood at around 38 billion, or about 58.3 of its gross domestic product, by end of last year, according to the IMF. Weerasinghe declined to comment on whether local currency debt would be renegotiated. Its too early to discuss various scenarios, he said. We are targeting to restore debt sustainability based on the IMF debt targets. That process will continue. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "date": "March 22, 2023 09:50 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe tabled the IMF staff level agreement on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka in Parliament, a short while ago. President Wickremesinghe is currently in Parliament attending todays parliamentary proceedings and is delivering a special statement on the IMF Extended Fund Facility. He said that at a time when the country was in chaos in July last year, no one was willing to accept responsibility and that he was requested to take over. I had no power in Parliament, and no MPs from my Party to call my own. However, the President said his strength was his conviction that he was capable of rebuilding the country. He said that the IMF credit facility amounts to USD 3 billion over a period of 4 years, with the first tranche of USD 333 million already being received. Additionally, the country is expecting about USD 7 billion dollars more in rapid credit support from other parties, he said. He said the IMF facility is a step towards building a better future for the youth and uplifting the country. The President said the IMF Extended Fund Facility will restore Sri Lankas international recognition, ensure the country is not bankrupt and help banks regain international recognition. This will create opportunities for low interest credit, restore foreign investors confidence and lay the foundation for a strong new economy, he emphasized. The President says that the government plans to reduce existing tax exemptions on Value Added Tax (VAT) by 2024, remove the simplified VAT system, and expedite its reimbursement. He added that Estate Duty will be introduced as a property tax by 2025. He also said that the government aims to reduce the primary deficit to 2.3 of the GDP by 2025 and to increase revenue to 14 of GDP by 2026. He said the standard corporate income tax rate has been raised to 30, and that sectoral tax holidays have been eliminated. The PAYE tax rate has been raised from 12 to 15, while the tax exemption limit has been reduced from Rs. 300 million to Rs. 80 million. President Wickremeisnghe stated that fuel prices will be decided only by the 2018 Fuel Price Formula and that the electricity tariff will be adjusted every 06 months. He urged the Members of the Parliament to approve the agreement reached with the IMF. Only then can I start the second round of discussions, he said, addressing the House. This is not the end of the journey. This is the beginning of a longer journey. The President said that amidst numerous hardships, bearing all kinds of pressure and undergoing suffering with equanimity, the people of this country remained calm and patient. He said their commitment was a great strength in achieving the IMF Facility and therefore, he extended his gratitude to the people of the country. The Executive Board of the IMF approved the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Sri Lanka at its board meeting held on Monday (20 March). The program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to US 7 billion from the IMF, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. Meanwhile, 48-month extended arrangement with an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about USD 3 billion) was also approved under the EFF, with the aim of restoring Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigating the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguarding financial sector stability, and strengthening governance and growth potential, the IMF said.",

        "date": "March 22, 2023 11:18 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday it had reached a staff-level agreement with Ukraine for a four-year financing package worth about 15.6 billion, offering funds the country needs as it continues to defend against Russias invasion. The agreement, which must still be ratified by the IMFs board, takes into consideration Ukraines path to accession to the European Union after the war. The fund said its executive board was expected to discuss approval in the coming weeks. The overarching goals of the authorities program are to sustain economic and financial stability in circumstances of exceptionally high uncertainty, restore debt sustainability, and support Ukraines recovery on the path toward EU accession in the post-war period, IMF official Gavin Gray said in a statement announcing the agreement. IMF staff on Tuesday briefed board members on the agreement - which would be Ukraines biggest loan package since Russias full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 - and the board was supportive, a source familiar with the matter said. The global lender said the agreement was expected to help unleash large-scale financing for Ukraine from international donors and partners, but gave no details. Typically IMF loans unlock support from the World Bank and other lenders. Calculations have in the past estimated the cost of reconstruction in the hundreds of billions of dollars. A gradual economic recovery is expected over the coming quarters, as activity recovers from the severe damage to critical infrastructure, although headwinds persist, including the risk of further escalation in the conflict, said Gray. IMF staff currently expected the change in Ukraines real gross domestic product for 2023 to range from -3 to 1, Gray added. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal hailed the agreement and thanked the IMF for its support. In conditions of a record budget deficit, this program will help us finance all critical expenditure and ensure macroeconomic stability and strengthen our interaction with other international partners, he said in a message on Telegram. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who paid a surprise visit to Ukraine last month, welcomed the deal after months of pushing for the IMF to move forward with a new financing package for Ukraine. An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF program is critical to underpin Ukraines reform efforts, including to strengthen good governance and address risks of corruption, and provide much needed financial support, she said in a statement. The U.S. is the IMFs largest shareholder. If approved, as expected, the Ukraine program would be the IMFs biggest loan to a country involved in an active conflict. The fund last week changed a rule to allow new loan programs for countries facing exceptionally high uncertainty, without naming Ukraine. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Most probably, the 7,500 National College of Education Diploma teachers will receive the relevant appointments before the end of April, he added. Furthermore, applications have been called for the recruitment of 26,000 university graduates, and the relevant exam admissions have been sent so far, Minister Premajayantha emphasized, adding that the exam will be held this Saturday (March 25). 53,000 graduates are scheduled to sit for this exam. We have planned to carry out the examinations answer sheet evaluation activities for two weeks. The results will be handed over to the provinces, he said. The minister also mentioned that thereby, they will be appointed as teachers at the provincial level, following the structural interviews. Nearly 33,000 teachers can be appointed by the middle of May in both these categories from these two methods, he claimed. In addition, a survey is being carried out in order to calculate the shortage of teachers for Science, Mathematics and English subjects and for Advanced Level even after the recruitment, he mentioned, adding that graduates who have recently left the universities will be given the opportunity to obtain appointments at the provincial level in order to fill those gaps.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has stated that the salaries and pensions of public servants will be revised in the future, in line with the inflation rates. Speaking on the measure currently underway to manage government expenditure while addressing the Parliament this morning (22 March), Wickremesinghe stated that steps are currently being taken to increase the funds allocated for public expenditure and that pensions and salaries earned by government employees too will be revised in line with the inflation rates. He noted, however, that such revisions will be made within the primary balance of the Budget. Moreover, the Head of State noted that henceforth, fuel prices will be decided only by the 2018 fuel price formula, without the intervention of any political authorities. Electricity tariffs too adjusted accordingly every six months, the President stated, adding that the balance sheets of organizations currently running at large losses will be remade. The Road Development Authority (RDA), SriLankan Airlines, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) were amongst these companies.",

        "date": "March 22, 2023 03:04 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested for the Oppositions support towards rebuilding Sri Lanka from its ongoing crisis, despite their conflicting political views. Leave your personal political aspirations aside. Think of empowering the country before gaining power for yourself. You can follow your own agenda on other political matters. However, it is imperative that you act out of the box politically with regard to building the economy of the country. Help me in the process of strengthening the economy, the Head of State said while addressing the Parliament this morning (22 March). Thus, he reaffirmed that he seeks the valuable support of the Opposition for the implementation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, despite the accusations levelled against him by the Opposing parties in previous instances. Below is the relevant excerpt of the full speech made in Parliament by the President; When I became the Prime Minister I wasted no time in requesting the support of the Opposition towards the effort of rebuilding the economy of the country. However I did not receive that support. Subsequently, at the occasion of opening of Parliament as the President I once again requested their support but it was to no avail. During the Budget debate too I requested the same of the Opposition, but they did not come forward. Yet again, at the occasion of the opening of this Parliament Session too I sought their support. But that request too frittered away. They refused to extend their support citing various reasons. They said that my appointment was unconstitutional. They opined that Prime Ministers cannot be appointed from the National List. They even went to the extent of saying that my ambition was not to salvage the country from the economic crisis but to save the Rajapakses. They said that it was not Sri Lanka that I was trying to take across the obstacle course, but Namal Rajapaksa. However, now the international community has endorsed that I strove to reconstruct the Sri Lankan economy. It has now been proved beyond doubt that accusations of the Opposition are baseless. I do not intend to respond to those unfounded accusations. My task is not to criticize the past. My task is to build the future of the country. I am committed to building the nation by formulating laws to ensure that past errors would not recur",
