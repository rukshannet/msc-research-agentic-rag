        "content": "Sri Lankas China-backed Hambantota Port and Sinopec have announced the addition of High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) to their range of ship fuels. In a statement, the port said HSFO is stored in two tanks with a combined capacity of 6,000 cubic meters and can be transferred at a rate of 400 metric tonnes per hour. The facility is equipped with advanced monitoring and remote-control systems, ensuring precise and safe operations. According to the port, this addition will provide significant convenience to shipowners with vessels using scrubbers, allowing them to opt for HSFO as a cost-effective solution while complying with IMO 2020 sulfur cap regulations. Meanwhile, Sinopec Lanka Private Limited stated that the absence of shore-based HSFO storage at Sri Lankas ports has previously limited its availability to small quantities, restricting the shipping industrys ability to secure reliable fuel supplies and impacting maritime operations and efficiency. Alice Lee, Deputy General Manager of Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka, stated, By leveraging the storage capabilities in Hambantota, we ensure that vessels calling at Sri Lankan ports have access to consistent and high-quality HSFO supplies.",

CEB Chairman Dr. Thilak Siyambalapitya said that the decision will be communicated at 10.00 a.m. today. The CEB decided to implement island-wide power cuts on Monday (10) and Tuesday (11), as a result of an issue which arose at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, where the automatic protocol system has disconnected all three generators, while restoring the island-wide blackout that occurred on Sunday (09). Accordingly, one-and-a-half-hour outages were implemented between 3.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. affecting the entire island to manage the electricity demand effectively. However, no scheduled power cuts were implemented yesterday (12) as the CEB confirmed that it was possible to meet the Poya Day lower demand with the available generation capacity.",

        "date": "February 13, 2025 08:29 am",
        "content": "The United Nations human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister. In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services systematically engaged in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation. Citing various credible sources, the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and August 5  the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured were shot by Bangladeshs security forces, the report said. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13 of people estimated to have be killed - or as many as about 180 people  were children. In some cases, security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range, it said. UN human rights chief Volker TÃ¼rk cited signs that extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The UN fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the countrys interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity. The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, the system has not necessarily changed, Rory Mungoven, head of the rights offices Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function, he said. Such a situation creates a potential conflict of interest and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with imminent threat of death or serious injury. In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his governments commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the countrys law enforcement and justice sectors. I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens, he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the immediate trigger to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said.

        "date": "February 13, 2025 09:38 am",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Buddhika Hewawasam says that the government must focus on enhancing air connectivity to the nation in order to achieve its long-term tourism targets by 2030. He also urges the government to provide significant concessions on import duties for vehicles used in the tourism sector through the upcoming budget, highlighting that the restrictions on vehicle imports negatively impacted the overall quality of Sri Lankas tourism sector. Sri Lankas tourism target set for this year is three million tourists and USD 4 billion in revenue. So this target is going to be extended for the next five years of time. By 2030 were looking for USD 10 billion revenue and double our particular tourism numbers, at least 8 million to 10 million tourists. This is actually a possible target but a challenging one considering the particular factors that we need to be aligned with the budget as well as the governments strategic direction, Hewawasam noted. One is the air connectivity to the country. We have good air connectivity to some destinations but overall we need to improve. And on the other side, we need a lot of investments for tourism infrastructure development as well tourism hotels, accommodation sector and various other kind of entertainment amenities. Furthermore, he emphasized: So, we expect budgetary concessions as well as government support for such kinds of investments for continuous develop this particular sector. We actually acquire a lot of government lands and try to make them more investment friendly. We need more properties, more exclusive tourism accommodation as well as tourism attractions to attract tourists to Sri Lanka. Vehicle importation to Sri Lanka was restricted. That negatively affected tourism. One of the budget proposals we made is to be providing concessions. Were not asking for duty free or any other kind of a thing, but a reasonable concession on duty, which is in par with last year or year before in order for us to buy vehicles necessary for tourism industry, the tourism regulatory bodys chairman added. Last few year, the tourism industry had a lot of financial difficulties. Some of the hotels as well as properties... We expect the budget 2025 to positively consider that aspect, he said.",

        "content": "A Ryanair flight from Rome to Germany was grounded for two days after a cat was discovered onboard. The meowing stowaway was found just before takeoff, the New York Post reported. Maintenance workers later removed several panels from the aircraft, revealing an unexpected stowaway- a kitten that had been feasting on a gerbil-hiding in the electrical bay. Photos capture the black-and-white feline peering out from its hiding spot. However, the cat retreated deeper into the planes wiring, ultimately leading to the flights cancellation for safety reasons. Crew members continued removing panels to track down the elusive tabby, but the feline played a relentless game of hide-and-seek, shifting from one section of the aircraft to another- turning the situation into a high-stakes round of whack-a-meow. After an extended standoff, the stubborn stowaway finally decided to exit on its own, slipping through an open door, trotting down the stairs, and making a grand runway exit-literally turning it into a catwalk. As a result of the unexpected feline infiltration, the plane remained grounded for two full days before it was cleared to resume its journey. While this precaution may seem excessive, sources indicated that the unauthorised cat posed a serious risk at cruising altitude and could have cost the Irish budget airline thousands of dollars in damages.

Despite obtaining most approvals, the company cited delays, including unresolved environmental clearance and an ongoing Supreme Court case as reasons for the withdrawal. The company has informed Sri Lankas Board of Investment (BOI) of its decision to respectfully withdraw while remaining open to future projects. A new committee is set to renegotiate terms, but official statements from both Adani Group and Sri Lankan authorities are still pending. Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) has officially withdrawn from its proposed 1 billion renewable wind farm and transmission project in Sri Lanka, citing prolonged discussions and new government renegotiation efforts, Indian media reported today. In a letter to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, Adani Green confirmed that after two years of negotiations with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and government departments, and after 14 rounds of discussions, the company had secured most approvals. However, with a new Cabinet-appointed negotiations committee (CANC) and Project Committee (PC) being constituted to renegotiate the proposal, AGEL has decided to step away from the project. The project aimed to establish 484 MW wind farms in Mannar and Pooneryn, alongside a 220 KV and 400 KV transmission network expansion to support Sri Lankas energy infrastructure. The company had already spent 5 million on pre-development activities and had made progress on clearances and land acquisitions.

The two companies, along with their junior partner Mitsubishi Motors, agreed to terminate a memorandum of understanding to join forces, Nissan said in a statement on Thursday. Going forward, Nissan and Honda will collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximize the corporate value of both companies, it said. Nissan and Honda had announced in December that they would begin talks over the following six months on a possible merger, in a deal that would have given them more firepower to compete with growing competition from Chinese carmakers like BYD. The deal was motivated by the need to combine their resources to remain competitive as the industry transitions to electric vehicles. However, after just a few weeks of talks, negotiations appeared to stall. During the discussions, various options were considered regarding the structure of the business integration, according to the statement. Honda proposed changing the structure of the intended merger from a joint holding company, as agreed initially, to a deal with Honda as the parent company and Nissan its subsidiary through a share exchange. Both companies concluded eventually that it was best to cease discussions, the statement added. Nissan has struggled since the collapse of its long-standing alliance with French carmaker Renault. It faces severe financial problems that put it in desperate need of a larger partner. Some analysts had speculated Nissan could face bankruptcy as soon as 2026 when it has a huge amount of debt coming due. Nissans profits in the six months ending in September plunged 94 compared with the same period in 2023, as the company lost money on auto operations and reported only a narrow profit due to its financing business. In response, Nissan announced it would cut its manufacturing output by 20, laying off 9,000 workers as a result. It also slashed its forecast for full-year operating profit by 70. Intense competition Beyond its financial problems, Nissan  like most legacy automakers  faces huge research and development costs in the transition from making gasoline- to electric-powered vehicles required to comply with tougher environmental regulations around the world. The company has had some success with its EV offerings, such as the Nissan Leaf, an asset it brought to the table in merger discussions, despite its financial problems. EV development costs have created a powerful incentive for carmakers to explore mergers as a way to share the financial burden, according to analysts. Industry consolidation should be the theme for global automakers in 2025, James Hong, an energy transition and autos analyst at Macquarie Capital, wrote in a research note in December before Nissan and Honda confirmed they were in talks. We think Honda and Nissan need each other. Since 1999, Nissan has been in an alliance with Renault. The two agreed in January 2023 to restructure their partnership, with the French company whittling down its stake in the Japanese carmaker to 15  a significant milestone in their long collaboration. The carmakers had worked in tandem, alongside junior partner Mitsubishi Motors. The alliance had allowed them to share production and technology and ultimately save billions of dollars a year. But the grouping fell apart after the stunning downfall of its former chief Carlos Ghosn in 2018. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "February 13, 2025 04:08 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Courts determination on the petitions filed against the Local Authorities Elections (Special Provisions) Bill is expected to be presented in Parliament tomorrow (14), during a special Parliamentary sitting. The call on the said special Parliamentary Sitting has been announced through the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 242304, issued by the Speaker on February 10. Accordingly, the Parliament will convene at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, and the Speaker has informed all Members of Parliament to attend. This session is intended for the Speaker to inform the Parliament of the Supreme Courts determination on the petitions filed against the Local Authorities Elections (Special Provisions) Bill. The relevant Ministerial Consultative Committee is also scheduled to meet tomorrow to consider the Bill. Accordingly, based on that decision, the Second Reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Special Provisions) Bill will take place on Monday (February 17) from 2.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. If the bill is passed, the Election Commission will have the authority to re-call nominations for the LG elections the very next day. If the election is called within the minimum required number of days, it is likely to be held on April 11. However, several practical challenges could arise in conducting the election on that date. The process requires printing 340 different types of ballot papers, which may not be feasible within the available time frame. Additionally, the Sinhala and Hindu New Year celebrations could also pose logistical difficulties. Given these constraints, the Election Commission is likely to opt for the maximum possible timeframe for holding the LG Election. In that case, the election is expected to take place between April 20 and April 30, with the most suitable dates being either April 22 or April 25.",

        "title": "Over 250 foreigners including Sri Lankan freed from Myanmars scam centres",
        "date": "February 13, 2025 04:37 pm",
        "content": "More than 250 people from 20 nationalities, including a Sri Lankan national, who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmars Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand, the BBC reported. The report said the group includes a total of 260 workers including 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia. According to the BBC, one of the workers is a Sri Lankan national while the majority are Ethiopians (138). The workers, more than half of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking, it said. Last week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border. Her government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash. Some opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years. Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar. The scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese. They are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as pig butchering and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling. Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured. The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State. These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds. The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948. On Tuesday, Thailands Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. The warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams. The BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that online businesses should leave. But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one. Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military. Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories. The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. They included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia.

Authorities said it was believed to be an attack, and the suspect  an Afghan asylum-seeker  was arrested. Participants in a demonstration by the service workers union ver.di were walking along a street near downtown Munich at about 10:30 a.m. when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group. Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said. He added that at least 28 people were believed to be injured, some of them seriously. A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes. The suspect was a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, Huber said. It is suspected to be an attack  a lot points to that, Bavarian governor Markus SÃ¶der told reporters at the scene. The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germanys Feb. 23 election. Most recently, a two-year-old boy and another person were killed in a knife attack in Aschaffenburg, also in Bavaria. The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, opens on Friday. Bavarias state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said authorities do not believe the car ramming was connected to the conference, but they still need to determine the motive.

Kulasingam Dhileeban, a former MP belonging to Sri Lankas Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP), has now been lodged in Puzhal Central Prison in Tamil Nadu, the report said.

        "date": "February 14, 2025 07:01 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had offered to talk about easing tariffs, buying more U.S. oil, gas and combat aircraft, concessions that may deter a trade war. The agreements came as the two leaders huddled for White House talks hours after Trump unveiled a roadmap for reciprocal tariffs on every country that puts duties on U.S. imports, his latest trade salvo directed at American friends and foes that the White House says will strengthen economic and national security. Some of the goals were aspirational: India wants to increase by billions of dollars its purchases of U.S. defense equipment, including fighter jets, and may make Washington the number one supplier of oil and gas, Trump said at a press conference. And Delhi wants to double trade with Washington by 2030, Modi said. Were also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters, said Trump. The F-35 is the most expensive U.S. defense program and Lockheed Martins biggest revenue generator. The F-35 Lightning II was on display at an airshow in India this week. Whether the deals resolve trade issues between the countries is not yet clear. Although Trump had a warm relationship with Modi in his first term, he again on Thursday said Indias tariffs were very high and promised to match them, even after his earlier levies on steel and aluminum hit India particularly hard. We are being reciprocal with India, Trump said during the press conference. Whatever India charges, we charge them. But the two leaders agreed to trade talks to resolve those differences, and expressed optimism they could wrap up those talks soon. A senior Trump administration official said a deal could be reached as soon as this year. One thing that I deeply appreciate, and I learn from President Trump, is that he keeps the national interest supreme, Modi said earlier as he sat alongside Trump in the Oval Office. Like him, I also keep the national interest of India at the top of everything else. The two leaders also agreed to deepen security cooperation in the Indo Pacific, a thinly veiled reference to competition with China, to joint production on technologies like artificial intelligence and on nuclear energy. Asked before the meeting about the steps India was taking, one source described it as a gift for Trump designed to lower trade tensions. A Trump aide, meanwhile, said that the president sees defense and energy sales to India lowering the U.S. trade deficit. Its not clear whether the case of billionaire Gautam Adani came up in the talks after his indictment by the U.S. Justice Department in November over an alleged bribery scheme. Adani hails from Modis western state of Gujarat and his Adani Group runs several key infrastructure projects across the globe. Opponents and critics often allege the meteoric rise of Adanis ports-to-energy empire was partly due to his close relations with, and favorable treatment by, administrations run by Modis BJP and its allies. The duo have repeatedly denied impropriety. On Thursday, Modi said countries dont meet to discuss such topics. Tariffs will continue to dominate the two countries relationship, said Richard Rossow, head of the India program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Its going to be a boxing match, he said. India is willing to take a few hits, but theres a limit. The U.S. has a 45.6 billion trade deficit with India. Overall, the U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate has been about 2.2, according to World Trade Organization data, compared with Indias 12. What Trump Wants Trump wants more help from India on unauthorized immigration. India is a major source of immigrants to the United States, including a large number in the tech industry on work visas and others in the U.S. illegally. Modi met with Elon Musk on Thursday at Blair House, where the prime minister is staying opposite the White House. Musk is a key Trump ally and his Starlink companys bid to enter the South Asian market could come up for discussion. He also held a meeting with Tulsi Gabbard, Trumps newly installed director of national intelligence, and they discussed enhancing counter-terrorism and cybersecurity cooperation. India may prove critical to Trumps strategy to thwart China, which many in his administration see as the top U.S. rival. India is wary of neighboring Chinas military buildup and competes for many of the same markets. Modi also worries that Trump could cut a deal with China that excludes India, according to Mukesh Aghi, president of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum lobbying group. Trump said on Thursday that he hoped to be of help in resolving skirmishes on the India-China border. India has continued its ties with Russia as it carries out its war with Ukraine. India has remained a major consumer of Russian energy, for instance, while the West has worked to cut its own consumption since the war started. The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this whole process, said Modi. But this is not true. India has a side, and that side is of peace. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2025 07:44 am",
        "content": "The Minister of Power announced that there will be no daily power cuts from today (14 February) as power generated by one unit of the Norochcholai power plant has been added to the national grid. This comes as the previously inactive Norochcholai Power Plant has reached operational status. One of the three generators of the coal power plant has now been successfully reconnected to the national grid, supplying 300 megawatts of electricity. On Sunday (Feb 09), Sri Lanka faced a widespread power outage that affected the entire island from around 11.15 a.m. The cause of the outage was linked to an incident at the Panadura grid substation, where a monkey had reportedly entered the substation, triggering an imbalance in the power system. As a result, the electricity supply to the entire country was disrupted. The power restoration process faced difficulties due to low electricity demand, which was typical on a Sunday. However, while power was fully restored by 6.00 p.m., a subsequent issue arose at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, where the automatic protocol system disconnected all three generators. This disconnection caused a loss of 900 megawatts to the national grid, exacerbating the power shortage. By 6.00 p.m., the demand for electricity began to rise, which led to further power outages in various regions. To mitigate the shortfall, the CEB sourced additional electricity from thermal power plants. After a sustained effort, the power was fully restored to the island by 9.45 p.m. Despite these efforts, the CEB had stated that it would take about four days to restart the three generators at the Norochcholai plant and that the power cuts will be required until the Norochcholai plant is added to the national grid. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) announced island-wide power cuts on Monday (10) and Tuesday (11) that lasted one-and-half hours. No power disruption took place on Poya Day (12) due to low demand, however, a one-hour power cut was also imposed in different zones under 04 categories between 5.00 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. yesterday (13). The CEB had stated that the decision on future power cuts would be announced this morning (14).",

        "date": "February 14, 2025 11:05 am",
        "content": "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Thursday to temporarily lift a three-week funding freeze that has shut down U.S. aid and development work worldwide, citing the sweeping damage that the sudden shutdown has done to the nonprofits and other organizations that help carry out U.S. assistance overseas. The court ruling was the second to deliver a major setback for the Trump administration in what has been its dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, which President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk accuse of being out of line with Trumps agenda. Thursdays ruling by the U.S. district court in Washington is the first ruling that targets what aid groups and others say has been a sudden and absolute cutoff of USAID funds for programs abroad. The funding cutoff has left contractors, farmers and suppliers in the U.S. and around the world without hundreds of millions of dollars in pay for work already done and forced wide scale layoffs among those enterprises. Judge Amir Ali issued the temporary order Thursday in the U.S. in a lawsuit brought by two organizations, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations receiving U.S. funds for work abroad. In his order, Ali noted that the Trump administration argued it had to shut down funding for the thousands of USAID aid programs abroad to conduct a thorough review of each program and whether it should be eliminated. However, administration officials have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended contracts with thousands of nonprofit groups, businesses and others was a rational precursor to reviewing programs, the judge said. Lawyers for the administration had failed to show they had a rational reason for disregarding...the countless small and large businesses that would have to shutter programs or shutter their businesses altogether, the judge added. The ruling also bars Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump officials from enforcing stop-work orders that the Trump administration and Musk have sent to the companies and organizations carrying out foreign aid orders. The funding order applies to contracts that were in place before Trump issued his Jan. 20 executive order declaring a freeze on foreign assistance. Ali also rejected the Trump administrations argument that it was buffering the impact of the funding freeze, offering waivers to allow funding to keep flowing to some aid partners. Ali cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed and that the online payment system at USAID no longer functioned. He rejected a request from the health organizations to challenge Trumps executive order itself, limiting his ruling to temporarily blocking Rubio and other administration officials from enforcing it. Earlier Thursday, a judge in a separate case over the Trump administrations dismantling of USAID and U.S. aid programs abroad said that his order halting the Trump administrations plans to pull all but a fraction of USAID staffers off the job worldwide will stay in place for at least another week. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered the extension after a nearly three-hour hearing Thursday, much of it focused on how employees were affected by abrupt orders by the Trump administration and Musk, who leads Trumps Department of Government Efficiency, to put thousands of USAID workers on leave and freeze foreign aid funding. The judge said he plans to issue a written ruling in the coming days on whether the pause will continue. Nichols closely questioned the government about keeping employees on leave safe in high-risk overseas areas. When a Justice Department attorney could not provide detailed plans, the judge asked him to file court documents after the hearing. USAID staffers who until recently were posted in Congo had filed affidavits for the lawsuit describing the aid agency all but abandoning them when looting and political violence exploded in Congos capital last month, leaving them to evacuate with their families. The funding freeze and purge of top USAID officials meant agency staffers are now stranded in Washington, without homes or agency funding, and facing the loss of their jobs, staffers said in the affidavits. The judge handed the administration a setback last week by temporarily halting the plans that would have put thousands of workers on leave and given those abroad only 30 days to return to the United States at government expense. His order was set to expire by the end of Thursday. Two associations representing federal employees asked him to continue his stay, as well as suspend Trumps freeze on almost all foreign assistance. The presidents pause has shut down almost all of the thousands of U.S.-funded aid and development programs around the globe, USAID workers and humanitarian groups say. Nichols grilled lawyers for USAID unions in Thursdays hearing, probing how workers were being affected by the stoppage of funding for the agencys work. The judges questions probed the concept of legal standing  whether the unions can show the kind of legal harm that would justify a continued block on the Trump administrations plans. Standing is a legal technicality, but an important one. A different judge cited it when he sided with the Trump administration and allowed a Musk-backed plan to cut the federal workforce through deferred resignations, often known as buyouts. While the administration and DOGE, Musks cost-cutting initiative, have taken aim at other agencies, they have moved most destructively against USAID, asserting without evidence that its work is wasteful. In a court filing, deputy USAID head Pete Marocco argued that insubordination made it impossible for the new administration to undertake a close review of aid programs without first pushing almost all USAID staffers off the job and halting aid and development work. He did not provide evidence for his assertion. USAID staffers, in court filings, have denied being insubordinate. They said they were doing their best to carry out what they describe as vague and confusing orders, some of which were said to come from a Musk associate and other outsiders. Agency supporters told Democratic senators earlier this week that the shutdown  along with other administration steps, including revoking USAIDs lease on its Washington headquarters  was really about eradicating USAID before lawmakers or the courts could stop it. The employee groups, the Democratic lawmakers and others argue that without congressional approval, Trump lacks the power to shut USAID or end its programs. His team says the power of courts or lawmakers to stand in the way is limited at best. The Presidents powers in the realm of foreign affairs are generally vast and unreviewable, government lawyers said in court documents. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "A forest fire that broke out yesterday (13) in the Ella Rock area, near the popular Ella tourist town, has rapidly spread across an area of around 20 acres by this morning, according to reports. The Disaster Management Center (DMC) confirmed that around 10 acres of the forest reserve has already been destroyed in the blaze. The fire had broken out at around 4.00 p.m. yesterday in the Ravana Ella forest reserve, located within the Ella Police Division. However, authorities now suspect that the fire was set intentionally. There is growing concern that it could spread further across the Ella mountain range, exacerbated by dry weather, strong winds, and the steep terrain, making containment efforts extremely challenging. In response, Bandarawela Forest Conservation Officers, the Ella Divisional Secretariat, and personnel from the Air Force and Army in Diyatalawa have been working tirelessly since yesterday to control the flames. Firebreaks were created at the forest boundary to prevent the fire from reaching the protected forest conservation area above the wildlife zone. Additionally, Bandarawela Municipal Council fire trucks have been deployed to prevent the fire from spreading to the Ella-Wellawaya main road.",

        "date": "February 14, 2025 04:25 pm",
        "content": "The 50th anniversary celebration of Saturday Night Live is so big, its not even on Saturday.

Current cast member Kenan Thompsons appearance was also touted. Which notable hosts will appear on SNL50? Martin, who has left an indelible comedic mark on SNL over the years, will be among the many successful hosts returning for the shows 50th celebration. Other prolific and returning hosts range from actors like Tom Hanks, Martin Short, and Scarlett Johansson (who is married to current SNL cast member Colin Jost) to athletes like Peyton Manning. Former SNL writer John Mulaney will appear, as will Adam Driver, Ayo Edebiri, Kim Kardashian, Paul Simon, Pedro Pascal, Quinta Brunson, Robert De Niro and Woody Harrelson. Is there a regular edition of Saturday Night Live this week? No, the show is on a break this week. TimothÃ©e Chalamet hosted the most recent Saturday Night Live broadcast, on Jan. 25. He did double duty, performing Bob Dylan songs  Chalamet plays Dylan in the Oscar-nominated film A Complete Unknown and spent years preparing for the role. But fans tuning in Saturday night during the regular time slot can see the shows very first episode, from October 1975 and hosted by George Carlin, beginning at 11:30 p.m. Eastern and 8:30 p.m. Pacific. What musical guests will appear during the SNL 50th anniversary tributes? Music is a huge part of SNL and a mix of global artists are scheduled to make an appearance on SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration. Its important to note that NBC hasnt specifically said artists like McCartney, Cyrus, Bad Bunny and others will perform. Lovers of music on SNL have other chances to celebrate. NBC has scheduled SNL50: The Homecoming Concert for Friday night. Itll stream live on Peacock, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern and 5 p.m. Pacific. The Backstreet Boys, Lady Gaga, Post Malone, Bad Bunny, Jack White, Cyrus, Robyn, Bonnie Raitt are some of the planned performances. The musical legacy of SNL is also explored in the documentary Ladies and Gentlemen ... 50 Years of SNL Music, from Oscar-winner Questlove. Its currently streaming on Peacock.

The first Saturday Night Live cast was known as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players and consisted of Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Laraine Newman, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris and Jane Curtin. Radner and Belushi have since died. Aykroyds absence from the list of returning cast members was unclear, though he posted enthusiastically about the 50th anniversary on social media last week. Aykroyds publicist did not return the APs request for comment. As part of its anniversary celebration, Peacock is streaming a four-part documentary series, SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night, about the show. Will there be a red carpet?

Beginning at 7 p.m Eastern, the carpet show will be hosted by SNL alum Leslie Jones and NBC News Willie Geist.

        "title": "TikTok returns on Apple, Google US app stores as Trump delays ban",
        "date": "February 14, 2025 04:32 pm",
        "content": "TikTok returned to the U.S. app stores of Apple and Google on Thursday as President Donald Trump delayed a ban on the Chinese-owned social media app and assured the tech giants they would not be fined for distributing or maintaining it. The popular short video app used by nearly half of all Americans went dark briefly last month, before a law took effect on January 19 that requires its Chinese owner ByteDance either to sell it on national security grounds or face a ban. The following day, Trump signed an executive order seeking to delay the enforcement of the ban by 75 days, allowing TikTok to continue its operations in the U.S. temporarily. Although TikTok resumed service after Trumps assurances, Google and Apple kept the app removed from their U.S. app stores. TikTok, the second-most downloaded app in the U.S. last year, said on Thursday that its latest app was now available for download. The delay could have been because Google and Apple were awaiting assurances that they would not be prosecuted for hosting or distributing the app, according to analysts. Trumps directive said the companies, which run mobile application stores or digital marketplaces where users can browse, download and update apps, would not face penalties for keeping the TikTok app up and running. TikTok had more than 52 million downloads in 2024, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. About 52 of its total downloads were from Apple App Store, while 48 were from Google Play in the U.S. last year, Sensor Tower said. The law that requires ByteDance to sell TikToks U.S. assets or ultimately face a ban was signed by then President Joe Biden last April, triggered by national security concerns and fears that China could use the video-sharing app to spy on American users. The U.S. has never banned a major social media platform and the law that passed last year gives the government sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Trump said on Thursday that his 75-day deadline on TikTok could be extended. The turmoil at TikTok attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as 50 billion. Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikToks purchase and would likely have a decision on the apps future in February. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2025 07:21 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis was taken to hospital on Friday with bronchitis and he will skip several planned public events over the next three days, the Vatican said, after the 88-year-old pontiff was seen struggling to speak during one of his meetings in the morning. Pope Francis was admitted to the Policlinico Agostino Gemelli for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue his treatment for bronchitis, which is still ongoing, in a hospital environment, the Vatican said in a statement. The pope has been suffering from bronchitis for more than a week. Francis will not take part in a Mass in St. Peters Basilica on Sunday, the Vatican said later, adding that a planned public audience on Saturday and a visit on Monday to Romes famed Cinecitta film studios were cancelled. Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed a case of pleurisy and had part of one of his lungs removed, and in recent times he has been prone to lung infections. Earlier this month, Francis told pilgrims at a weekly audience that he was suffering from a strong cold, which the Vatican later described as bronchitis. The pope held several meetings on Friday before going to hospital. One was with Mark Thompson, CEO of the CNN news channel. The pope was mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties, CNN later reported. The pope also held meetings with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, senior Vatican official Cardinal Luis Tagle and with a Catholic philanthropy group that is based in Puerto Rico. Video of the popes meeting with Fico showed Francis sitting at a desk in his Vatican residence, smiling, and speaking in a soft tone. Francis has been suffering with respiratory issues since mid-December. He begged off reading statements at several of his public events in January and February, attending the occasions but asking aides to read his prepared remarks. The pope also had two falls recently at his Vatican residence, bruising his chin in December and injuring his arm in January. Despite his periodic health issues and reduced mobility, Francis has kept up a busy schedule, including foreign travel. In September he completed a 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania, the longest of his papacy. Romes Gemelli hospital, the largest in the city, has a special suite for treating popes. Francis spent nine days there in June 2023, when he had surgery to repair an abdominal hernia. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 14, 2025 10:23 pm",
        "content": "Saudi Arabia is spearheading urgent Arab efforts to develop a plan for Gazas future as a counter to U.S. President Donald Trumps ambition for a Middle East Riviera cleared of its Palestinian inhabitants, 10 sources said. Draft ideas will be discussed at a meeting in Riyadh this month of countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Proposals may involve a Gulf-led reconstruction fund and a deal to sideline Hamas, five of the people said. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies were aghast at Trumps plan to clean out Palestinians from Gaza and resettle most of them in Jordan and Egypt, an idea immediately rejected by Cairo and Amman and seen in most of the region as deeply destabilising. The dismay in Saudi Arabia was aggravated, sources said, because the plan would nix the kingdoms demand for a clear path to Palestinian statehood as a condition to normalise ties with Israel - something that would also pave the way for an ambitious military pact between Riyadh and Washington, shoring up the kingdoms defences against Iran. Reuters spoke to 15 sources in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and elsewhere to build a picture of the hurried efforts by Arab states to pull together existing proposals into a new plan they can sell to the U.S. president - even potentially calling it a Trump plan to win his approval. All the sources declined to be identified because the issue involves international or domestic sensitivities and they were not authorised to speak in public. One Arab government source said at least four proposals had already been drafted for Gazas future, but an Egyptian proposal was now emerging as central to the Arab push for an alternative to Trumps idea. THE EGYPTIAN PROPOSAL The latest Egyptian proposal involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas involvement, international participation in reconstruction without displacing Palestinians abroad, and movement towards a two-state solution, three Egyptian security sources said. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Palestinian representatives will review and discuss the plan in Riyadh before it is presented at a scheduled Arab summit on February 27, the Arab government source said. The role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MbS, is shaping up to be key. We are telling the Americans we have a plan that works. Our meeting with MbS is going to be critical. He is taking the lead, said a Jordanian official. The crown prince had a warm relationship with the first Trump administration and is increasingly central to Arab ties with the United States during the new Trump era. Long a major regional partner for the United States, the crown prince is expanding Saudi Arabias relationship through business and global power politics. Saudi Arabias sovereign wealth fund is holding a conference in Miami this month that Reuters revealed Trump is expected to attend. Riyadh is also expected to host his coming talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to end the Ukraine war. The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on this story. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking on Thursday, referred to the coming Arab meeting, saying: Right now the only plan - they dont like it - but the only plan is the Trump plan. So if theyve got a better plan, nows the time to present it. Spokespeople for Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Israel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. BUFFER ZONE Clear plans for Gazas post-war future have already proven hard to develop as they require positions on contentious debates regarding the territorys internal governance, security management, funding and reconstruction. Israel has already rejected any role for Hamas or the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, or ensuring security there. Arab countries and the United States have also said they do not want to put troops on the ground to do that. Gulf states, which have historically paid for reconstruction in Gaza, have said they do not want to do so this time without guarantees that Israel will not again destroy what they build. Jordans King Abdullah emphasised to Trump on Monday at their meeting in the White House that he was working with Saudi Arabia and Egypt on a Gaza plan that would work, a Jordanian official said. Abdullah said in televised comments after the meeting that the countries would review an Egyptian plan and we will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and the United States. Reuters could not immediately reach Jordans Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for comment. After Abdullahs meeting with Trump, Safadi said: We are now working on crystallising the Arab plan. Initial proposals shared by the three Egyptian security sources relating to reconstruction and financing appear advanced. A buffer zone and physical barrier would be erected to stop tunnels being built across Gazas border with Egypt. As soon as rubble is removed, 20 areas would be established as temporary living zones. Around 50 Egyptian and other foreign companies would be brought in to carry out the work. Financing would involve international and Gulf money, said a regional source with knowledge of the matter. A potential fund could be named the Trump Fund for Reconstruction, the Arab government official said. However, the most difficult issues around Gazas governance and internal security remain to be decided, the official said. Forcing Hamas out of any role in Gaza would be critical, said the Arab official and the three Egyptian sources. Hamas has previously said it is willing to cede government in Gaza to a national committee, but it would want a role in choosing its members and would not accept the deployment of any ground forces without its consent. The three Egyptian sources said that while nothing in the plan was very new, they believed it was good enough to change Trumps mind and that it could be imposed on Hamas and the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas. NOT PLEASED Saudi annoyance over Gaza had already been building before Trumps announcement. The kingdom had repeatedly said normalisation with Israel was conditional on a path to creating a Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. That stance hardened as Saudi public anger grew at the destruction and death in Gaza. In November, the crown prince publicly accused Israel of genocide during an Islamic summit and doubled down on the need for a two-state solution. Frustration was running high in the kingdom over the ongoing war, two regional intelligence sources said. Washington appeared ready to push past Riyadhs demand for two states. The day before his Gaza announcement, Trump was asked whether a normalisation deal could go ahead without a two-state solution. He said: Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful. Trumps Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had held meetings in Riyadh in late January. Two senior diplomats said Witkoff laid out a three-month timeline for the normalisation process. But Saudi frustration quickly turned into surprise and then anger when Trump announced his Gaza idea. He is not pleased, a source close to the Saudi royal court said of Prince Mohammeds reaction. The level of anger was quickly evident in state media broadcasts - which analysts say are often a measure of official Saudi viewpoints - with television news reports personally excoriating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They are outraged, said Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi analyst familiar with official thinking, describing the mood among senior Saudi officials. This is outrageous. More than frustration, this is on another level. Many experts say Trump may be using an old bargaining ploy from his diplomatic playbook, setting out an extreme position as an opening gambit for negotiations. During his first term, he often issued what were widely seen as over-the-top foreign policy pronouncements, many of which never came to fruition. Still, it has complicated the normalisation talks. Former Saudi intelligence head Prince Turki al-Faisal, who holds no current role in the government, said in a CNN interview last week that if Trump visited Riyadh, Im sure he will get an earful from the leadership here. Asked if he could see any prospect of normalisation talks advancing with Israel, he said: Not at all. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 15, 2025 09:02 am",
        "content": "The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women yesterday (14) has concluded its consideration of Sri Lankas ninth periodic report, with Committee Experts praising the States national action plan on women, peace and security, and raising questions about the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, which permitted child marriage, and domestic violence. A Committee Expert praised Sri Lankas national action plan (20232027) as a positive step in addressing the needs of women affected by conflict but questioned whether the Government planned to conduct a mid-term assessment of the plans implementation. Yamila GonzÃ¡lez Ferrer, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur for Sri Lanka, noted that although the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act was amended in 2022, concerns remained, particularly regarding child marriage. She asked whether the Government planned to further amend the law to include an explicit ban on child marriage. Another Committee Expert highlighted that one in five women in Sri Lanka had experienced violence from an intimate partner, with many cases going unreported. The Committee inquired about the timeline for adopting proposed amendments to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act and the specific protections available for victims. Introducing the report, Saroja Savitri Paulraj, Minister of Women and Child Affairs of Sri Lanka and head of the delegation, said the Sri Lankan Government was committed to upholding the rights of women and girls and advancing gender equality. This review held particular significance, as it was the countrys first engagement with an international human rights treaty body since the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2024, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ms. Paulraj said Sri Lankas first national action plan for women, peace and security for 2023 to 2027 had been launched. The Government was committed to realizing the full promise of the women, peace and security agenda. The delegation added that the action plan addressed displacement, and womens protection, security and participation in peacebuilding. The State party was planning to conduct a review of the implementation of the action plan. On the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the delegation said the Government had conducted consultations regarding its amendment. It was trying to strike a balance between womens and childrens rights and cultural rights. Ms. Paulraj added that the Womens Parliamentary Caucus had suggested setting a minimum age for marriage and establishing a multi sectoral committee to address this issue. On domestic violence, the delegation said the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act had been amended; the amended Act would come into force this year. The Assistance to Victims Act underlined the rights of victims to be treated with respect and privacy, and to request legal, medical and psychosocial assistance. A toll-free hotline operated by female officers was available for reporting domestic violence. In closing remarks, Ms. Paulraj said the Sri Lankan Government had undertaken significant efforts to strengthen womens empowerment. It was fully committed to addressing the issues that women faced in the State and would continue to engage with the Committee constructively, the statement said. In her concluding remarks, Nahla Haidar, Committee Chair, said that the State party had shared candidly and transparently the progress made and difficulties it was facing. She commended the State party for its efforts and encouraged it to implement the Committees recommendations for the benefit of all Sri Lankan women and girls. The delegation of Sri Lanka consisted of representatives from the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs; Attorney Generals Department; Sri Lanka Police; Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism; and the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Committee will issue its concluding observations on Sri Lankas report at the end of its 90th session on 21 February 2025.",

        "date": "February 15, 2025 09:53 am",
        "content": "In a major step forward for Sri Lankas efforts to boost its hydrographic capabilities, the Sri Lanka National Hydrographic Office (SLNHO) and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) inked a historic bilateral arrangement yesterday (14). The event took place at the Ministry of Defence, underscoring the commitment to strengthen collaboration in hydrography. The partnership will focus on knowledge sharing, capacity development, technical cooperation, and generating revenue by marketing Sri Lankas hydrographic products globally, according to Sri Lanka Navy. The arrangement was formalized by Rear Admiral Angus Essenhigh from the UKHO and Rear Admiral Kosala Warnakulasooriya of SLNHO, representing their respective governments. The signing event was attended by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha (Retd), and Chairman of the National Hydrographic Council, Rear Admiral Sisira Jayakody (Retd), alongside distinguished officials from the UK government, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and SLNHO. During his visit to Sri Lanka, Rear Admiral Angus Essenhigh also held discussions with the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Kanchana Banagoda and the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyacontha (Retd). The discussions mainly focused on enhancing strategic hydrographic collaboration and deepening bilateral ties between the two countries, the statement said. This bilateral arrangement underscores the United Kingdoms longstanding support for Sri Lanka in the field of hydrography. Currently, around 75 of the worlds international charts and Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) are distributed through the UKHO, a testament to its globally recognized reputation rooted in its colonial-era legacy. Given that SLNHO currently lacks the necessary infrastructure, facilities, and international standing to independently market its hydrographic products worldwide, the UKHO emerged as the ideal partner to spearhead this collaboration. Under the new agreement, the SLNHO expects a substantial boost in revenue by selling ENCs and other hydrographic products through the UKHOs vast global distribution network. This represents a significant upgrade from the previous practice of submitting raw data to the UKHO. Furthermore, the agreement sets the stage for Sri Lanka to eventually take over as the Primary Charting Authority, a responsibility currently managed by the UKHO, it added. This partnership marks a significant milestone for Sri Lanka, as it strengthens its role as a dynamic and forward-thinking participant in international chart production, a goal that has been a longstanding priority for the island nation. The Ministry of Defence and SLNHO have pledged to harness this collaboration to enhance hydrographic expertise, safeguarding the countrys maritime security and promoting sustainable management of marine resources. Additionally, the initiative aims to support global hydrographic efforts, underscoring Sri Lankas commitment to international cooperation.",

        "date": "February 15, 2025 10:39 am",
        "content": "An Alabama woman who said she was raped by rappers Jay-Z and Sean Diddy Combs when she was 13 withdrew her civil lawsuit against both men on Friday, according to court filings. The unidentified woman in December added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to a lawsuit she had filed against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party. The court document submitted by the womans attorneys announcing the voluntary dismissal did not include any reasons or explanation for the withdrawal. Jay-Z, who vehemently denied the claims and tried to get extracted from the lawsuit, called the womans decision to withdraw her claim a victory and said the fictional tale she and her lawyers created was laughable. The frivolous, fictious and appalling allegations have been dismissed, he said in a statement posted on social media. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by the plaintiffs lawyer, Tony Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs. Lawyers for Combs said dismissal of the lawsuit without a settlement confirmed that other lawsuits he is facing are built on falsehoods. For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit. Just like this claim, the others will fall apart because there is no truth to them, they said in a statement, adding that Combs has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone  man or woman, adult or minor. When asked for a response, Buzbee responded no comment in an email Friday night. Buzbees firm, which has set up a 1-800 number for accusers, has filed a wave of lawsuits against the hip-hop mogul. Buzbees lawsuits allege that many of the people he represents were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida where individuals were given drinks that were laced with drugs. Statements from both rappers derisively referred to Buzbee and his firm as the 1-800-lawyer. Jay-Z accused him of hiding behind Jane Doe for financial gain. When they quickly realize that the money grab is going fail, they get to walk away with no repercussions, he wrote. The system has failed. Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the worlds wealthiest rappers. The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z being featured on Combs debut album, No Way Out, and Combs appearing on Jay-Zs sophomore album, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Diddy launched his Bad Boy Records around the same time Jay-Z launched his Roc-A-Fella record label. The pair has been frequently photographed together at events. Jay-Z has won 25 Grammys while Diddy has collected three trophies. His Roc Nation company served as co-executive producer of the recent Super Bowl halftime show. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 15, 2025 10:44 am",
        "content": "OpenAI says its board of directors has unanimously rejected a 97.4 billion takeover bid by Elon Musk. OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musks latest attempt to disrupt his competition, said a statement Friday from Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAIs board. OpenAI attorney William Savitt in a letter to Musks attorney Friday said the proposal is not in the best interests of OAIs mission and is rejected. Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker nearly a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit. OpenAI has increasingly sought to capitalize on the commercial success of generative AI. But the for-profit company is a subsidiary of a nonprofit entity thats bound to a mission  which Musk helped set  to safely build better-than-human AI for humanitys benefit. OpenAI is now seeking to more fully convert itself to a for-profit company, but would first have to buy out the nonprofits assets. Throwing a wrench in those plans, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid Monday to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday further detailed the proposal to acquire the nonprofits controlling stake. Savitts letter Friday said that court filing added new material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients much-publicized bid is in fact not a bid at all. In any event, even as first presented, the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said. Musk has alleged in the lawsuit that OpenAI is violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about 45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said. He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAIs business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAIs for-profit conversion. Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musks request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week. Source: AP --Agencies",

He explained that the construction work has only been temporarily suspended. Dr. Gunasena further confirmed that the government has decided not to proceed with the construction of the expressway this year, as no financial allocation has been made for it in the current budget. The Ruwanpura Expressway, initially planned to span from Kahathuduwa to Ratnapura via Horana and Ingiriya, has been put on hold. The Deputy Minister explained that this decision was made as the current government is prioritizing other development projects based on a set priority list. As part of this prioritization, the government plans to begin construction on the Kurunegala-Galagedara section of the Central Expressway. The construction will be carried out in two phases: the Pothuhera-Rambukkana section and the Rambukkana-Galagedara section. Dr. Gunasena stated that the Pothuhera-Rambukkana section is expected to be completed by next year, while the Rambukkana-Galagedara section is anticipated to be finished within three years. In addition, the long-delayed Kadawatha-Mirigama section is now set to proceed with assistance from China. A group of representatives from the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) is expected to visit Sri Lanka to observe the ongoing construction work.

L. M. Udaya Kumara. The fire, which broke out around 4 p.m. on February 13, caused the rocks in the Ella Rock mountain range to heat up, posing a risk of explosions. As the rocks in the mountain range became exposed, there was also a concern regarding the potential for rocks to roll down the slopes. Assistant Director Udaya Kumara further emphasized that motorists traveling on the Ella-Wellawaya road should exercise extreme caution due to the ongoing risks in the area. The fire had spread rapidly by last night (14), advancing toward the Ravana Ella waterfall, said Ada Derana reporter. The rapid spread of the fire was attributed to the prevailing dry weather, strong winds, and steep terrain, which made it challenging to control the flames. An investigation into the delay in extinguishing the fire revealed that in previous incidents within this protected area, the assistance of an Air Force helicopter had been requested. However, it was reported that no such request was made this time. In response to an inquiry from Ada Derana, Major General (Retd) Udaya Herath, Director General of the Disaster Management Center, clarified that no request for helicopter assistance had been made. He also explained that the dangerous conditions in the area where the fire had spread made it impossible to utilize helicopter assistance.

Following the island-wide power outage on February 9, the Norochcholai Power Plants protocol system was activated, causing all three generators to shut down. This had resulted in a loss of 900 megawatts of electricity to the national grid. In response, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) imposed island-wide power cuts, lasting one-and-a-half-hours on February 10 and 11, and one-hour on February 12. However, by last morning (14), the third generator of the Norochcholai Power Plant was successfully reconnected to the system. Subsequently, the Ministry of Energy announced yesterday (14) that daily power cuts would be discontinued. With the first generator, which had remained idle, also connected to the national grid later in the afternoon, the Norochcholai Power Plant has now contributed 600 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.",

As a government, we prioritize education and are committed to introducing transformational reforms in the sector.

        "date": "February 15, 2025 08:24 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas headline inflation is expected to peak around 2 percentage points above the central banks target in the second quarter of 2026, the bank said in a monetary policy report on Friday. The comments come after the Central Bank of Sri Lanka took advantage of a steep decline in inflation to slash policy rates by 125 bps last year, as the island nation focuses on a robust rebound from a severe financial crisis. While headline inflation may edge above the target between late 2025 and mid-2026, projections indicate that this deviation will be short-lived, the bank said in its report. It attributed the increase to an unfavourable base effect, a faster increase in global food inflation and demand pressures. Sri Lankas inflation stood at minus 4 in January, having tumbled from a peak of 70 in September 2022, mainly due to a reduction of a fifth in power tariffs. It is expected to accelerate and approach the central banks target of 5 in the third quarter of 2025 and rise further afterwards, the bank said. Economic growth in the final quarter of fiscal 2024 is expected to be robust, driven by healthy industry activity, the bank said, with annual growth projected at about 5. The economy contracted 2.3 in 2023. In his first full-year budget on Monday, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will lay out the governments revenue and policy goals, as it seeks to extend the crisis recovery, and signal alignment with a 2.9-billion IMF bailout program. A severe drain in dollar reserves plunged the Indian Ocean island into turmoil three years ago, sent inflation soaring, depreciating the currency and forcing a 25-billion foreign debt default. The central bank report also projected a marginal current account deficit for 2025, mainly driven by an anticipated higher trade deficit, as vehicle imports resume. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 16, 2025 07:58 am",
        "content": "At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station. The incident occurred after a massive surge in passengers heading to Maha Kumbh and those waiting for the trains that had got delayed. A two-member high-level committee has been formed to investigate the matter and determine the cause of the stampede, executive director of information  publicity at the Railway Board, Dilip Kumar said. This comes after the recent stampede at Maha Kumbh due to sudden surge in devotees on Mauni Amavasya that led to the death of 30. The authorities have said that the unprecedented rush of passengers at two platforms- 13 and 14- led to chaos and panic ultimately causing the stampede. In an official statement, the deputy commissioner of police (railway) reported that platform number 14 was already heavily crowded as the Prayagraj Express awaited departure. Additionally, delays in the Swatantra Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express led to an increased passenger presence on platforms 12, 13, and 14, further contributing to the congestion. As per CMI, every hour 1,500 general tickets were sold by railways due to which the station got overcrowded and became uncontrollable. There was a stampede at platform no. 14 and near escalator near platform no. 16, the DCP said. DCP KPS Malhotra elaborated that the crowd surged within 15-20 minutes after the announcement of a special train, as passengers hurried to board. Two trains were delayed, and due to the increased footfall, the crowd grew massive. A few people sustained injuries. As of now, the situation is under control, he had said. An eyewitness recalled similar situation and said, The stampede broke out around 9.30pm... When people on platform number 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15 - they moved towards these platforms. The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled.... One of the passengers, Dharmendra Singh, recounted his experience, stating that he was traveling to Prayagraj but faced difficulties as many trains were either delayed or canceled. I was going to Prayagraj but many trains were running late or were cancelled. The station was overcrowded. There were far more people than I have ever seen at this station. In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers. Likewise, the railway ministry said, An Unprecedented rush situation developed today at about 10 pm in New Delhi railway station near platforms 13  14. Some of the passengers present there on the platforms fainted due to this sudden rush further leading to the rumours of stampede like situation. This led to the spread of panic. The railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has ordered a high level inquiry into the incident. Source: The Times of India --Agencies",

        "content": "Top executives from the Adani Group are set to reopen discussions with the Sri Lankan government next week, just days after the company announced its withdrawal from a major wind energy project in the island nation. Adani Green Energy, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, will engage in fresh negotiations to revive two 484-megawatt (MW) renewable energy wind farms in Mannar and Pooneryn, sources familiar with the matter told The Tribune. The project, which also includes a 220-kilovolt (kV) and 400 kV transmission network to deliver power to Sri Lankas southern regions, had been in the works for over two years. The Sri Lankan government had been pressing Adani Green Energy to lower its tariff rates, a key sticking point in negotiations. The group had pledged an investment of 442 million in the project, with 5 million already spent on predevelopment activities. On Wednesday, Adani Group formally announced its decision to exit the project. In a statement, the company said: We would respectfully withdraw from the said project. As we bow out, we wish to reaffirm that we would always be available for the Sri Lankan government to have us undertake any development opportunity, if it ever considers Adani Group to participate. We wish to convey our best wishes and gratitude to the government of Sri Lanka for the opportunity of engagement. Before withdrawing, the Adani Group had held over 14 rounds of discussions with Sri Lankan authorities and secured approvals for a 20-year power purchase agreement. However, the project remained stalled due to pending environmental clearance for the Mannar site and an associated Supreme Court case. Adanis withdrawal has raised concerns in Sri Lanka, as it marks the second major foreign investment exit in recent months. In December 2024, Australian firm United Petroleum also pulled out of its project in the country. With new talks on the horizon, both sides are expected to explore ways to keep the wind energy project alive, potentially addressing tariff concerns and regulatory hurdles.

        "content": "European leaders are set to gather next week for an emergency summit on the war in Ukraine, in response to concerns the US is moving ahead with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent. Sir Keir Starmer, who is expected to attend the summit in Paris, said it was a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security and it was clear Europe must take a greater role in Nato. It comes after Donald Trumps special envoy to Ukraine said European leaders would be consulted but not take part in any talks between US and Russia over ending the war. Senior White House figures, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are due to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia in the coming days. US officials said that Ukraine was also invited - although President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation. In remarks likely to raise concern in Ukraine and among European allies, special envoy Keith Kellogg said previous negotiations had failed because too many parties had been involved. It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest, he said on Saturday. Europe remains haunted by the Minsk agreements, a failed ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia reached in 2015. The talks, which were brokered by France and Germany, sought to end fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Sir Keir is understood to see his role as bringing US and Europe together to ensure a united approach to peace in Ukraine. The UK prime minister will discuss the views of European leaders when he visits US President Trump at the White House at the end of this month. A further meeting of European leaders together with Zelensky is expected after Sir Keir returns from Washington. Sir Keir said the UK would work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together, adding the two could not allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from external enemies. This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia, he said. Its clear Europe must take on a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraines future and face down the threat we face from Russia. Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Emmanuel Macron had called the summit of European leaders, which has not yet been announced by the French president. Sikorski said: President Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call reconnaissance through battle. You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond. Earlier on Saturday, Zelensky called for the creation of an army of Europe amid rising concern the US may no longer come to the continents aid. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, he said US Vice-President JD Vances speech at the event had made it clear that the old relationship between Europe and America was ending and the continent needs to adjust to that. But Zelensky also said Ukraine would never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to start peace talks. Earlier this week the US president announced he had a lengthy phone conversation with the Russian leader and that negotiations to stop the ridiculous war in Ukraine would begin immediately. Trump then informed Zelensky of his plan. Trump appeared confident that his leadership style could pave the way for a peace deal in Ukraine. His rapprochement with Putin brought to an end more than three years of silence between Moscow and Washington. Trumps shock announcement rekindled memories of his meeting with Putin in Helsinki back in 2018. The two men held nearly two hours of closed-door talks in the Finnish capital and went on to deliver a joint news conference, where Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US presidential election. His comments came despite US intelligence agencies concluding, in 2016, that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scale of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also held a phone call with Russias foreign minister building on the 12 February call between Trump and Putin. Senior officials from the Trump administration will start peace talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters news agency. McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he understood Zelensky had been invited to take part in the Saudi talks, which were aimed at arranging a meeting with Trump, Putin and the Ukrainian president to finally bring peace and end this conflict. A day earlier, Vance had launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but from within. In a speech at the Munich Security Conference, he repeated the Trump administrations line that Europe must step up in a big way to provide for its own defence. David Lammy has said the UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an existential question even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine. The UK foreign secretary told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday Putin will not go away, and that, while it was positive 23 Nato countries were now spending at least 2 of their GDP on defence, we all know we have to go upward.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya highlighted the critical role of teachers in shaping the future of children, emphasizing that the teacher-student relationship must be of the highest quality. The Prime Minister made these remarks yesterday (15) while participating in the 25th anniversary celebration of the National College of Education in Kopai, Jaffna, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further elaborated on her views during the event: A high-quality education system is essential to achieving our national aspirations and fostering a truly civilized and developed country. We have initiated the process of implementing qualitative reforms in the countrys education system. Every child, irrespective of gender, must have access to a high-quality education. This is the objective of our government. No child should be deprived of the right to education. Every student entering our education system must develop the confidence to integrate into society and face the challenges of the future world. We are tirelessly working to transform this vision into reality. Teachers play a crucial role in this journey. Ensuring a high-quality education and a conducive learning environment for children depends entirely on the competence, commitment, and attitudes of teachers, as well as the quality of the teacher-student relationship. Teachers have the power to significantly influence the lives of children. Whether they hinder or nurture a childs future is determined by their attitudes and actions, she stated. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya emphasized that all graduates of the college, as future educators, bear a profound responsibility. Teaching is not merely a profession but a noble vocation, and the future of childrenas well as the future of the nationrests in the hands of teachers.

        "date": "February 16, 2025 05:19 pm",
        "content": "French customs officers have found nine dinosaur teeth during a routine check near the Italian border. The discovery was made as the officers inspected a Spanish lorry on the A8 motorway on 28 January, officials say. They spotted the apparent fossils in two parcels and sent them to be examined by a prehistory museum in the nearby city of Menton. On Friday, an expert revealed the teeth had belonged to reptiles from the Late Cretaceous period - 72 to 66 million years ago - in Morocco, authorities said. Lorries travelling on the A8 motorway between Spain and Italy are regularly stopped. Agents open parcels at random as they sometimes contain illegal drugs, customs Samantha Verduron told AFP news agency. But the latest haul was unexpected. One of the teeth identified belonged to a Zarafasaura oceanis, a marine reptile measuring about 3m (10ft) and named in Morocco in 2011. Three belonged to a Mosasaurus, a large aquatic creature that measured up to 12m. Five other teeth are believed to have been those of a Dyrosaurus phosphaticus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles. The lorry driver told officers he had been delivering the parcels to people in the Italian cities of Genoa and Milan, French authorities said. Officials are working to identify the intended recipients of the packages. Collecting fossils is legal, but exporting them often requires a licence. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas vision for the Indian Ocean is one of shared destinywhere nations rise above rivalry to protect freedom of navigation and foster stable and sustainable prosperity based on cooperation, and find peaceful solutions to all issues, says Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath. He made these remarks on Sunday (16) while addressing the first plenary session of the eighth Indian Ocean Conference (IOC), which is being held in Muscat, Oman. During his speech, the minister also mentioned that the Colombo Port explores new horizons in maritime partnership and also emphasized that Sri Lanka is committed to strengthening maritime connectivity through port development, logistics, and maritime services, enhancing its position as a key hub in the Indian Ocean. Developed in partnership with key regional partners, today, the Port of Colombo which is strategically placed in close proximity to the worlds busiest shipping routes, is a hub that services and connects the Far East with Europe, Africa, and the eastern coasts of the American continents. Rated as one of the best-performing ports in the world today, it is expected to reach greater heights with the state-of-the-art Colombo West International Terminal that is expected to become operational early this year, he said. Sri Lankas Foreign Minister further emphasized that the country is also committed to the BBNJ Agreement on conserving marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. He continued, Given the Indian Ocean Regions strategic and ecological significance, this treaty ensures equitable access to marine resources while strengthening regional cooperation on sustainable ocean governance.  Minister Vijitha Heraths full speech: It is a great pleasure for me to be here today in this beautiful city of Muscat  a city which has deep and ancient roots that connect my country and Oman. At the outset, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of Oman, the India Foundation, and all the other partners who have worked hard to organize this important Conference. The Indian Ocean Conference which began in Singapore in 2016, has voyaged through Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Maldives, UAE, Bangladesh, and Australia, and now reached Oman. I commend the India Foundation for this visionary and critical initiative that was launched in 2016, and for steering it with exceptional commitment through the years. In partnership with governments and a range of stakeholders, the India Foundation has created a platform for all stakeholders to gather regularly to engage in a dynamic exchange of ideas and collaborative action, reinforcing our shared commitment to the prosperity of the Indian Ocean Region. By fostering such visionary dialogue, the India Foundation not only strengthens regional cooperation but also ignites innovative pathways for sustainable growth, security, and resilience across the Indian Ocean Region. Excellencies, It is the Indian Ocean that first brought Oman and Sri Lanka together centuries ago. In ancient times, traders from Oman sailed to my country which was then known in this part of the world as Serendib. Our two countries were both active hubs for trade along the ancient Silk Route. This laid a firm a foundation for our bilateral relations that exist today, encompassing trade, investment, cultural exchange and people-to-people connections. The cultural impact of this ancient connection is such that a particular sweet derived from Omani Halva that Sri Lankans call Muscat is a favourite among many in my country even today. Excellencies, The theme of this Plenary - Voyage of New Horizons of Maritime Partnership - is of particular significance to us in Sri Lanka. To our minds, the Port of Colombo is an excellent manifestation of new horizons in maritime partnerships. Developed in partnership with key regional partners, today, the Port of Colombo which is strategically placed in close proximity to the worlds busiest shipping routes, is a hub that services and connects the Far East with Europe, Africa, and the eastern coasts of the American continents. Rated as one of the best-performing ports in the world today, it is expected to reach greater heights with the state of the art Colombo West International Terminal that is expected to become operational early this year. Excellencies, Our regions prosperity and the worlds future prosperity lies in successful partnerships of this nature, and Sri Lanka remains committed to strengthening maritime connectivity through port development, logistics, and maritime services, enhancing its position as a key hub in the Indian Ocean. Distinguished Delegates, Oceans serve as the lifelines of international trade, carrying over 80 of global trade volume and underpinning economic interdependence. Yet, the maritime domain extends far beyond commerceit is a critical nexus for environmental sustainability, cultural exchange, and geopolitical stability. In this dynamic landscape, freedom of navigation stands as a cornerstone of international law, ensuring the unimpeded, secure movement of vessels across global waters. Upholding this principle is not just a legal duty but a strategic necessityone that preserves stability, strengthens economic resilience, and reinforces the rules-based maritime order essential for sustainable global prosperity. However, the global maritime landscape is fraught with challenges some of which affect the Indian Ocean as well. This includes, among others, maritime crimes and territorial disputes, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather and marine pollution. All these challenges urge collaboration and partnership to find solutions. For example, tackling marine pollution requires better waste management and recycling. Similarly, rising sea levels and climate related issues require better climate data, resilience, and adaptation measures. As a key shipping route, the Indian Ocean traffic must explore adopting cleaner fuels and cut emissions to balance growth with conservation. All these issues necessitate a collective approach rooted in mutual respect, cooperation, and adherence to international norms. Sri Lankas vision for the Indian Ocean is one of shared destinywhere nations rise above rivalry to protect freedom of navigation and foster stable and sustainable prosperity based on cooperation, and find peaceful solutions to all issues. The economic benefits of maritime partnerships within the Indian Ocean Region are vast, yet their full potential remains underutilized. From sustainable fisheries and tourism to maritime trade and energy resources, the ocean presents significant opportunities for growth and development. Realizing these benefits demands collaborative efforts to foster sustainable practices, protect marine ecosystems, and ensure the equitable distribution of resources. Excellencies, Regional security is intrinsically linked to the stability of the Indian Ocean. It is essential that we strengthen regional security architectures, enhance maritime domain awareness, and promote joint exercises and capacity-building initiatives. By doing so, we can create a resilient maritime environment that deters threats and fosters peace. The complexity of maritime challenges necessitates a collective response. Networking between countries and agencies is essential to build trust, share best practices, and coordinate responses to common threats. Enhanced information sharing and communication channels can significantly improve our ability to detect, deter, and respond to maritime threats. Excellencies, As a strategically located island nation, and developing Indian Ocean littoral state, Sri Lanka seeks to harness the oceans economic potential while benefiting from Asias rising prosperity. We are committed to playing a proactive role in regional maritime affairs, advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among Indian Ocean nations. We will engage with all stakeholders within and beyond the Indian Ocean Region on initiatives that promote peace, security, and stability in the Indian Ocean Region. We recognize the importance of networking between countries and agencies to address common challenges and seize opportunities. Enhanced information sharing and cooperative mechanisms are crucial for effective maritime governance. Therefore, as the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) we reiterate the significance of fostering partnerships with regional and international stakeholders, and aim to contribute to collective efforts in ensuring maritime security, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. Excellencies, Sri Lanka is committed to the BBNJ Agreement on conserving marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Given the Indian Ocean Regions strategic and ecological significance, this treaty ensures equitable access to marine resources while strengthening regional cooperation on sustainable ocean governance. Sri Lanka looks forward to leveraging this framework to enhance capacity-building, research, and technology transfer, reinforcing its commitment to protecting the high seas for future generations. By leveraging technology and intelligence-sharing, we can strengthen our collective response to regional challenges. South-South Cooperation offers a pathway to enhance trade, infrastructure, and shared development, fostering economic growth through the exchange of technology, knowledge, and best practices. Such collaboration may be strengthened through existing regional frameworks like IORA, IONS, BIMSTEC, and the IOC, ensuring a unified and strategic approach to regional progress. Distinguished Delegates, In conclusion, I want to reiterate that Sri Lanka stands ready to collaborate with all stakeholders in working towards realising the vision of a secure, stable, sustainable, and prosperous Indian Ocean Region for the benefit of all.",
