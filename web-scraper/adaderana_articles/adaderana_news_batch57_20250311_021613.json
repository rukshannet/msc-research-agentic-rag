        "title": "China stalling IMF relief for debt grip Sri Lanka: Report",
        "date": "October 4, 2023 10:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas is facing a big challenge from its largest bilateral lender, China to secure a concrete debt relief framework, as it is blocking access to desperately needed cash bailout of 3 billion US dollars from International Monetary fund, Nikkei Asia reported. Last months visit by IMF officials to the crisis-recovering nation seems like a hope for the country. But IMF which has insisted on financing assurances from bilateral lenders as a key pillar, gave Sri Lanka a failing grade in the first review of the bailout, denying it a second tranche of 330 million in aid. According to the Nikkei Asia, the chances of the relief for Sri Lanka is rising for an unexpected mid-october visit to China by Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to attend a 10th anniversary summit of the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijings regionwide infrastructure building program where he will meet the Chinese President to discuss debt relief. Meanwhile the IMF has said that the further relief aid requires the completion of financing reviews after analysing the countrys record since the first injection of 330 million US dollars, approved in late march. Nekkei Asia reported quoting IMF team, headed by Peter Breuer, senior mission chief for Sri Lanka said, These financing assurances reviews will focus on whether adequate progress has been made with debt restructuring to give confidence that it will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the programs debt target. China is one among other nations to join lendors like Japan and India early this year to offer initial financial assurances that met the IMFs conditions to approve the March bailout, an Asian diplomat revealed. Beijing offered a two-year moratorium for the Sri Lankan debt and talked of providing new loans to pay for existing debt, Nikkei Asia reported. Notably, Sri Lanka has invited China to join a committee of countrys bilateral creditors chaired by Japan, India and France, aimed at drafting an external debt restricting framework, which China rejected in April this year. And opted to directly deal with the Sri Lankan government. The other lenders were OK with this arrangement and were prepared to let Colombo deal with Beijing at a bilateral level, the diplomat added. But there cannot be any special deals favoring Chinese debt terms, such as no haircuts, yet expecting haircuts from the other countries. Sri Lankan President Wickremesinghe who assumed the charge after the former president had fled from the country amid protests driven by public anger over the collapsed economy has promised to deal with all the bilateral lendors to treat them equally. We will not have separate deals, Wickremesinghe told Nikkei Asia in an interview in Tokyo in May. We wont give advantage to one party, we will work on the same principles. A meeting of Sri Lankas creditor nations held online in May was attended by 26 countries. Many were from the Paris Club, a network of wealthy nations that have a history of resolving external debt crises in developing countries to which they have given loans. China stood by only as an observer. Within the group of countries besides China, diplomatic sources familiar with the talks revealed that concrete progress on a blueprint and timeline is still elusive. Nothing has moved concretely within the Japan-India-French creditor committee because of no progress from China, said one source. So we will be following President Ranils visit to China closely. Consequently, the scope of Sri Lankas debt to China remains under scrutiny. Sri Lanka ran out of foreign reserves at the end of 2021 to pay for its imports and faced pressure to service a 7 billion external debt the next year, pushing it to the brink of the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. By 2021, public debt stood at 114 of gross domestic product -- 47 of it in the form of foreign loans, with private creditors who had bought international sovereign bonds topping that list, followed by bilateral lenders led by China. In May 2022, Sri Lanka became the first Asian lower-middle income country to default on its sovereign debt this century. Chinese loans had financed a spree of large infrastructure projects, including highways, an airport and a port. China will have to play a major role in Sri Lankas debt restructuring process, with 7.4 billion or 19.6 of outstanding public debt owed to China at the end of 2021, wrote Umesh Moramudali and Thilina Panduwawala, two Sri Lankan economists, in Evolution of Chinese Lending to Sri Lanka since the mid-2000s -- Separating Myth from Reality. Chinese lending to Sri Lanka mainly came from two major policy banks, China Exim Bank, which accounted for 4.3 billion, and China Development Bank, which gave 3 billion. By contrast, interest-free loans provided directly to Sri Lanka as part of official aid from the Chinese government amounted to only 16 million by the end of 2021, said the Sri Lankan economists Moramudali and Panduwawala in an e-mail interview. We have not come across EXIM or CDB loans that are interest-free. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "content": "Several office trains are experiencing delays and cancellations this morning (Oct. 04) due to the unanticipated strike by railway under-guards. It was reported that railway under-guards had resorted to a strike yesterday by reporting sick leave. An assault of an under-guard by a security guard at the Maligawatta railway yard is said to be the reason behind this sudden trade union action. Accordingly, the commuters were afflicted as they were left stranded at railway stations due to train delays and cancellations. Against this backdrop, security forces personnel had been deployed to railway stations last evening to maintain peace and security.

        "title": "Central Bank reduces its policy interest rates",
        "date": "October 5, 2023 08:04 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 10.00 and 11.00, respectively. The first monetary policy review by the Monetary Policy Board under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 of 2023 (CBA) was held on Wednesday (Oct. 04). The decision to slash the SDFR and the SLFR was reached following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments, including low inflation and benign inflation expectations in the domestic economy, with the aim of stabilizing inflation at the envisaged 5 level in the medium term, thereby enabling the economy to reach its potential growth, a press release issued by the CBSLs Economic Research Department read. The Monetary Policy Board expects that this reduction of policy interest rates, along with the significant easing of monetary policy effected previously, including the directions issued by the Central Bank to licensed banks to reduce interest rates, and the significant reduction of risk premia on government securities, would accelerate the downward adjustment in market interest rates, particularly lending rates, in the period ahead. The financial sector has been urged to pass on the benefits of the continued easing of monetary conditions to individuals and businesses adequately and swiftly, thereby supporting the envisaged rebound of the economy.",

        "title": "Floods in Indias Sikkim kill 10; dozens including 23 army soldiers missing",
        "date": "October 5, 2023 08:15 am",
        "content": "At least 10 people have been killed in Indias state of Sikkim and 82 others, including 23 army personnel, are missing after heavy rainfall caused the glacial Lhonak Lake to overflow, spurring catastrophic flooding in the region. The northeastern state received 40.9mm (1.6 inches) of rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)  about five times its normal rate of 8.6mm (0.3 inches) for this time of the year. So far, 10 bodies have been recovered from different locations. At least 82 more are missing and 22 people are injured, some of them seriously, Sikkims Chief Secretary V B Pathak told Reuters news agency. A cloudburst  or an extreme amount of rain over a brief period of time  over Lhonak Lake triggered torrential flooding in the valley located about 150km (93 miles) north of Gangtok near the border with China. Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam and caused loss of life and caused further damage to roads and infrastructure, said Miriam Jackson, a senior cryosphere specialist at the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the worlds third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga, had shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size overnight, an area roughly equivalent to 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. Heavy rainfall hampered the search for the Indian troops reported missing, with the capital city of Gangtok cut off by road, defence officials said. Twenty-three personnel have been reported missing and some vehicles are reported submerged under the slush. Search operations are under way, a defence ministry spokesperson said. Indias weather department has warned of landslides and disruption to flights as heavy rain is predicted to continue over the next two days in some parts of Sikkim. Jackson warned that such extreme events have become more frequent as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory. The main highway linking Sikkim to West Bengal state had collapsed and Gangtok was totally cut off by road, according to army spokesperson Anjan Basumatary. About 15,000 people living in the vicinity are likely to be affected and at least eight major bridges have been washed away along the banks of the Teesta River, officials said. Media showed images of the river lashing through the hills and entering residential areas. Some army bases and facilities along the valley were affected and rising water submerged vehicles following the release of water from a dam, a defence ministry spokesperson based in the neighbouring city of Guwahati said. Intermittent rain and thunderstorms were hampering rescue operations in the area, an army official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modis office said in a statement that the government will support state authorities in meeting the challenges from the floods. Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with scientists on Wednesday warning the deadly flood was a taste of further extreme weather events to come. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in Indias Himalayan region during the June-September monsoon season. The region saw heavy monsoon rains this season, with experts saying climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August in Himachal Pradesh, also a Himalayan state. Record rains in July killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India, as roads were waterlogged and homes collapsed. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "date": "October 5, 2023 09:32 am",
        "content": "The level of gross official reserves of the country were estimated at around USD 3.5 billion as of the end of September 2023, according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). However, this includes the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China to the tune of USD 1.4 billion, which is subject to conditionalities on usability. In its latest monetary policy review, the CBSL said that during the eight months ending in August 2023, Sri Lankas trade deficit decreased notably, with a significant decrease in merchandise imports due to lower demand and import restrictions, and a relatively low decline in merchandise exports. Earnings from tourism and workers remittances improved considerably thus far in 2023 and are expected to improve further in the period ahead, it said. Net foreign investment inflows were recorded in the government securities market so far during the year despite some sizeable outflows in recent months. The Sri Lanka rupee recorded an appreciation of around 12 per cent against the US dollar thus far during the year, the central bank said. Following the settlement of the bilateral currency swap with Bangladesh Bank and the provision of liquidity to the domestic foreign exchange market to facilitate the restructuring of Sri Lanka Development Bonds as part of the domestic debt optimisation (DDO) operation, the level of gross official reserves was estimated at around US dollars 3.5 billion as at end September 2023, including the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China.",

        "date": "October 5, 2023 02:05 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinge has warned that humanity is facing an existential threat, drawing attention to the pressing climate concerns currently faced by the world. Addressing the 5th Forum of Ministers  Environment Authorities of the Asia Pacific held at the Shangri La Hotel in Colombo today (06 Oct.), President Wickremesinghe cited the alarming estimate from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stating that global warming is projected to reach a dangerous 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052. He highlighted the interlinked crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, emphasizing the devastating impact on individuals and communities worldwide. The Head of State then turned to Sri Lankas commitment to addressing these challenges, pledging to accelerate nature-based solutions, including renewable energy, through Sri Lankas Climate Prosperity Plan, which was launched at COP 27. Sri Lanka is in the process of renewing the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016 to 2022 to achieve the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Diversity Framework, he announced. Additionally, he unveiled an ambitious Net Zero 2050 roadmap for Sri Lanka, set to be launched at COP 28. President Wickremesinghe stressed that despite Sri Lankas minor global emissions contribution (0.03), the country is dedicated to significant reductions. Sri Lanka aims to achieve a 14.5 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, generate 70 of its electricity from renewable sources, attain a 32 forest cover, phase out coal power by 2042, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The President also expressed deep concern over the state of global biodiversity. He lamented that the world has already lost 8 of known animal species, with 22 at risk of extinction due to habitat destruction and invasive species. We are now losing biodiversity up to 10,000 times faster than it was disappearing 100 years ago, he warned. In conclusion, President Wickremesinghes speech outlined the urgent need for climate action, Sri Lankas commitment to sustainability and the critical biodiversity challenges the world faces. The Presidents call for collective action and his unveiling of ambitious climate plans underscored the gravity of the global situation.Countries unwilling to do their part to stop the climate crisis are guilty of committing genocide, he concluded. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 5th Forum of Ministers  Environment Authorities of the Asia Pacific; I join our Minister of Environment in welcoming you to Sri Lanka. Humanity is facing an existential threat. The interlinked and cascading effects of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollutionthe triple planetary crisisare demanding a heavy toll on individuals, communities and threatening life on our planet. We are putting extreme pressure on the planet. The triple planetary crisis is already exceeding the planetary boundaries. The world has already lost 8 of known animal species and 22 are at risk of extinction due to the destruction of their natural habitats and the introduction of invasive species. We are now losing biodiversity up to 10,000 times faster than it was disappearing 100 years ago. Declines in nature and biodiversity at the current trajectory will undermine the progress towards 35 out of 44 targets of the SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, weather, cities, climates, oceans and land. In terms of change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052. The other day, I read a blog by a young scientist, a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Her name is Sanjali De Silva. This is what she said: People of Sri Lanka feel the impact of climate change every day. Those effects are overwhelmingly caused by the self-serving command and irresponsible action of the fossil fuel industry and the nations unwilling to do their part to stop the climate paradigm. My people of Sri Lanka and my family deserve better. I agree wholeheartedly with her. Sri Lanka, her country and mine, has constantly been placed among the top risk of extreme weather events by the Climate Risk Index annually released by German Watch. Although Sri Lankas emissions are globally negligible, amounting to merely 0.03, we, in our ambitious NDCs, have set targets for 2030 to achieve a 14.5 reduction of GHG emissions, a 70 electricity generation through renewable sources, 32 forest cover, weaning off coal power by 2042 and reaching net zero by 2050. The Climate Prosperity Plan of Sri Lanka, launched at COP 27, aims at rapid augmentation of nature-based solutions, including renewable energy. The Net Zero 2050 roadmap for Sri Lanka will be launched at COP 28. Sri Lanka is in the process of renewing the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016 to 2022 to achieve the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Diversity Framework. Since Sri Lanka is one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots, I have instructed the Ministry of Environment to formulate a national policy on living entities to conserve pristine ecosystems. Sri Lanka has formulated the national policy on waste management, covering nine categories of general and hazardous waste. The national policy on chemical management was formulated to streamline chemical management in the country. Sri Lanka formulated the national policy on sustainable consumption and production in 2019. The Green Procurement Policy and the Green Labelling Framework will come into effect this year. My government will enact a new Climate Change Act and a National Environment Act to address the triple planetary crisis in the context of new knowledge and practices. We are starting our transition to a green economy. But there is a cost. The Climate Prosperity Plan, which spans from 2023 to 2042, will require 26.5 billion U.S. dollars. The implementation of the Net Zero 2050 roadmap will require over 100 billion U.S. dollars. The list is not over. Where are we going to source these resources from? We cannot source all this money from within our country. The problem is not confined to Sri Lanka. Developing countries require financing up to 5.9 trillion U.S. dollars to fulfil their NDCs up to 2030. A further 4 trillion U.S. dollars is required per annum for clean energy technology to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. At COP 27, there was an agreement to provide the lost and damaged funding for vulnerable countries hit by climate disaster. The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan, a transitional committee was established. The meetings of the committee and the discussions at the recent sessions of the UN during the UN General Assembly have not resolved key questions. a. Who will contribute? Is it the developed nations? EU, UK, Norway, among others, say all countries are liable to pay. b. The question of criteria. Who will receive the funds? c. Where to house the fund? At the World Bank or UNFCC? d. Where do you find the money for the fund? Is it re-channelling existing funds or new additional funds? Delegates, these discussions are getting nowhere and its unlikely that these issues will be resolved by the time of COP 28. The ability of global leaders to cooperate and provide a coordinated response to existential challenges such as climate change is missing in a scenario dominated by great power rivalries, geopolitical interests and in many cases domestic policy. For instance, it is not feasible to expect robust leadership of the United States in the global fight against climate change next year. The US will be caught up in an acrimonious election year and must first overcome domestic debates between climate deniers and those who are serious about addressing the issue. The Ukraine war will tie down Europe. The Indo-Pacific will witness further escalation of tension. Numerous global fora have attempted to address the issue of climate change. The Bridgetown Initiative, Paris Pact for People and Planet, and numerous initiatives by the UN Secretary-General. The issues and potential solutions have been well articulated at these events. What is missing is the money on the table, leadership and action. Therefore, we in Asia-Pacific and others in the global south will need to galvanize an alternative leadership mechanism. What is crucial is that geopolitics and great power rivalries take a second place when it comes to addressing climate issues such as climate change and global environmental degradation. We need a climate justice forum to ensure that the countries least responsible for climate change do not bear a disproportionate share of the loss. We need to raise our collective voice and say, lets get done with this. While the debate on the loss and damage fund continues, we should insist on the following: The money on the table is negligible, but lets at least start with the 100 billion SDI initiatives available to the IMF and convert that into actions and positive outcomes. The developed economies should be held accountable for meeting their net zero targets at least by 2040. If they fail to stay in line with these targets, such countries should be required to compensate the rest of the world. These funds can help with the financing requirements for climate mitigation, adaptation and climate prosperity of developing nations. The global ambitions regarding finance of combating climate change have so far been woefully inadequate. It is also not just public funds that can resolve the magnitude of the issue at hand. The Bridgetown initiative has clearly articulated the need for using the balance sheets of the NDBs to provide guarantees and leverage private funds to be channelled towards addressing climate change issues in developing nations. Additional volumes of concessionary financing at scale through the NDB are also a crucial requirement. Climate-related investments provide long-term returns, which cannot be financed by fragmented short-term high-cost private financing. The prevailing situation where global monetary tightening is pushing up market-linked lending rates of NDBs and the IMF is also an opportune moment to consider options of capping such rates or other means to avoid further fiscal burdens on borrowing nations. All three initiatives above would have been on the agenda in a serious manner long time ago had there been a greater voice of developing nations and the global south in the decision-making authorities of these global financial institutions. We must also press ahead with Kenyas call for debt relief for low-income countries. Parallel to these settings, we must finalize the loss and damage funds. In my view, all developed countries must contribute to the fund. We must also call for voluntary contributions by the developing countries, especially those exceeding the 2050 target. The Vanuatu Resolution has taken the issue of climate change before the International Court of Justice. This is the start of a process of recognizing climate justice as a human right. It is the core of the right to life. All other rights flow from the right to life. Countries unwilling to do their part to stop the climate crisis are guilty of committing genocide.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket has decided to provide prize money of Rs. 10 million to Tharushi Karunaratne, who won the Gold in the womens 800m event at the ongoing 19th Asian Games. The 19-year-old on Wednesday (Oct. 04) clocked a time of 2.03.20 minutes in womens 800m event to clinch the Gold medal at the continental multi-sport event being held in Hangzhou, China.

        "date": "October 5, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and the government has decided to maintain the inflation rate of around 5 in the future, in accordance with the new CBSL Act, Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said today. He mentioned this while addressing a special press briefing on the first monetary policy review by the Monetary Policy Board today (Oct. 05). Under the new Central Bank Act, we have a commitment now agreed with the government to maintain inflation at 5 over a medium to long-term period, he said. He pointed out that the current inflation rate of 1.3 is below the range that they are expecting to maintain in the medium to long-term. This we all understand, the reasons are mainly 12 months ago we had almost 70 inflation and came down sharply in the disinflation process that continued for the last several months. The CBSL governor said that in their view the end of the disinflation process has almost neared and that now inflation has stabilized coming to a lowest point of 1.3 in the last month. What we can expect under normal circumstances is that this trend, obviously we can expect that trend to turnaround and settle over a period of time around our target range between 4-6, around 5 medium. Earlier today, the CBSL published its latest monetary policy review, which revealed the banks decision to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 10.00 and 11.00, respectively. The decision to slash the SDFR and the SLFR was reached following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments, including low inflation and benign inflation expectations in the domestic economy, with the aim of stabilizing inflation at the envisaged 5 level in the medium term, thereby enabling the economy to reach its potential growth. Meanwhile, the level of gross official reserves of the country has been estimated at around USD 3.5 billion as of the end of September 2023. However, this includes the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China to the tune of USD 1.4 billion, which is subject to conditionalities on usability. In its latest monetary policy review, the CBSL said that during the eight months ending in August 2023, Sri Lankas trade deficit decreased notably, with a significant decrease in merchandise imports due to lower demand and import restrictions, and a relatively low decline in merchandise exports.",

Accordingly, the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed have been fixed for consideration on 23 January 2024 by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The relevant order was issued when the petitions were taken up before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, comprising of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, A. H. M. D.

The petitioners have taken issue with the decision to reduce the interest rates paid when investing the funds of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in government securities, under the DDO program. The EPF has active accounts of at least 2.5 million working people and their funds are largely invested in treasury bills and bonds, the petitioners added, noting that reducing the interest rate to 9 has violated the peoples fundamental rights. In addition, the petition claims that the CBSLs Monetary Board has not sought the views of the members of the EPF before allowing the Fund to participate in the DDO program.",

        "content": "Alphabet unit Google has agreed to change its user data practices to end a German antitrust investigation aimed at curbing its data-driven market power, the German cartel office said on Thursday. The German antitrust watchdog in January issued a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to Google over its data processing terms, saying that users were not given sufficient choice as to whether and to what extent they agree to the far-reaching processing of their data across the companys services. Tech giants rely on selling targeted advertising based on the massive amounts of data they gather about users, a lucrative business model now in regulators crosshairs around the world. The German regulator said Googles commitments would give users more choice on how their data is used across the companys platforms. In the future users of Google services will have a much better choice as to what happens to their data, how Google can use them and whether their data may be used across services, Andreas Mundt, president of the cartel office, said in a statement. This not only protects the users right to determine the use of their data, but also curbs Googles data-driven market power, he said. Googles commitment covers more than 25 other services including Gmail, Google News, Assistant, Contacts and Google TV. It does not apply to Google Shopping, Google Play, Google Maps, Google Search, YouTube, Google Android, Google Chrome and Googles online advertising services, all of which are subject to a new EU legislation called the Digital Markets Act which has similar obligations. The German competition authority has ramped up its scrutiny of Big Tech since it acquired sweeping powers called Section 19a GWB in 2021 which allows it to investigate and ban certain types of practices by companies considered to have to have paramount significance and cross-market power. That has triggered investigations into Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has assured that no decision pertaining to the restructuring of state banks has been made thus far. Speaking at a press conference held this afternoon (05 Oct.), Dr. Weerasinghe explained that the CBSL has not been informed of any such decision to restructure state banks. The Governor made these remarks in response to a question raised in this regard by a journalist, who claimed that six state banks were amongst a list of government institutions set to be divested, citing the State Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SRU). The question raised claimed that six state banks including the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) were amongst 31 state institutions which were listed, by the SRU, to be divested. As per this notice, these 31 state institutions will first be registered under the Companies Act, and then be put under the control of a holding company, the journalist claimed. Dr. Weerasinghe, however, asserted that the CBSL has not received any communications pertaining to such a matter, further emphasising that the SRU is unlikely to be involved with actions concerning state banks. The CBSL Governor explained that only the CBSL and the Ministry of Finance are involved in matters concerning state banks, with the former governing their regulations, and the latter bearing their ownership. Thus, Dr, Weerasinghe said, We have no knowledge of this, and we were not informed of any such matter, further highlighting that as per the usual procedures followed, the Banking Act must first be amended in order for any changes to be made within the state banking system.",

        "content": "Jon Fosse, a master of spare Nordic literature in a sprawling body of work ranging from plays to novels and childrens books, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday for works that give voice to the unsayable. Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel literature committee, said Fosses work is rooted in the language and nature of his Norwegian background. I am overwhelmed and grateful. I see this as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations, Fosse, 64, said in a statement released by his publishing house, Samlaget. One of his countrys most-performed dramatists, Fosse has written some 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, childrens books, poetry and essays. The Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, said it was for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable. Mats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win. He said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully. Fosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to get the Nobel. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson got it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928. His work A New Name: Septology VI-VII  described by Olsson as Fosses magnum opus  was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2022. The Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (1 million) from a bequest left by their creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December. Last year, French author Annie Ernaux won the prize for what the prize-giving Swedish Academy called the courage and clinical acuity of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France. Ernaux was just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated. In 2018, the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, which names the Nobel literature committee, and sparked an exodus of members. The academy revamped itself but faced more criticism for giving the 2019 award to Austrias Peter Handke, who has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes.

        "date": "October 5, 2023 05:30 pm",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of Ceylons (BOC) Long-Term Local-Currency Issue Default Rating (IDR) at CCC- and removed it from Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the National Long-Term Ratings of the following banks, removed them from RWN and assigned Stable Outlooks: - BOC at A(lka) - Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) at A(lka) - Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC at A(lka) - Hatton National Bank PLC at A(lka) - Sampath Bank PLC at A(lka) - National Development Bank PLC at A-(lka) - Seylan Bank PLC at A-(lka) - DFCC Bank PLC at A-(lka) - Nations Trust Bank PLC at A-(lka) - Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC at BBB-(lka) - Union Bank of Colombo PLC at BBB-(lka) - Amana Bank PLC at BB(lka) - Sanasa Development Bank PLC at BB(lka) - Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka at BB(lka) Fitch has also affirmed Cargills Bank Limiteds (CBL) National Long-Term Rating at A(lka) and removed it from RWN. Fitch has assigned a Negative Rating Outlook. The RWN on these banks senior and subordinated debt ratings, where assigned, has also been removed. BOCs Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR of CC, Short-Term IDR of C, Viability Rating of cc and Government Support Rating of ns were not considered in this review. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS Downside Risks to Banks Easing: The removal of the RWN on BOCs Long-Term Local-Currency IDR and the national ratings of all the above banks reflects our view that near-term downside risks have substantially reduced as reflected in the upgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CCC- from RD. Please see Fitch Upgrades Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CCC-, published 28 September 2023. The successful conclusion of the local-currency sovereign debt restructuring, including the exclusion of banks holdings of treasury securities from the domestic debt optimisation programme, has alleviated some of the pressure on the banks capital positions from weakening loan quality and rupee depreciation as well as any immediate funding and liquidity stresses. Manageable Risks from Foreign-Currency Bonds: The restructuring of Sri Lankas foreign-currency debt, including the defaulted sovereign bonds that banks hold, has not been completed, but we believe that incremental risks to banks capital from the restructuring are likely to be manageable, given their limited exposure to these bonds (3.6 of total assets at end-1H23) and high provision coverage. That said, access to foreign-currency wholesale funding remains challenged by the sovereigns weak credit profile, but the stress on banks foreign-currency liquidity has largely eased relative to the crisis period. Negative Outlook on CBL: The Negative Outlook on CBLs national rating reflects downside risks from its increasing size relative to that of its ultimate parent, CT Holdings PLC (CTH), which could constrain the parents ability to provide extraordinary support in times of need. At end-1H23, the banks assets accounted for 193 of group equity and 51 of group assets. The removal of parental support considerations due to rising relative size could result in a downgrade of CBLs rating to a level that reflects its standalone credit strength. Fitch views this to be significantly weaker than the support-driven rating of A(lka) due to its weak financial profile and small and developing franchise. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating ActionDowngrade BOCs Long-Term Local-Currency IDR Fitch would downgrade BOCs Long-Term Local-Currency IDR if we perceive there is an increased likelihood that the bank would default on or seek a restructuring of its local-currency denominated senior obligations to non-government creditors. National ratings of all banks, except CBL A deterioration in the banks key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers could trigger a downgrade on the banks ratings, which are driven by their intrinsic financial strength. National rating of CBL CBLs rating is sensitive to changes in CTHs credit profile as well as Fitchs opinion around the ability or propensity of CTH to extend timely extraordinary support. A continued increase in CBLs balance sheet relative to that of CTH that makes extraordinary support more onerous for the parent, could lead to a multiple-notch downgrade in CBLs national rating to reflect its standalone credit strength. Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating ActionUpgrade BOCs Long-Term Local-Currency IDR An upgrade of BOCs Long-Term Local-Currency IDR would most likely result from an improvement in Sri Lankas operating environment, which could occur after the successful completion of the restructuring of the remainder of the foreign-currency sovereign debt. National ratings of all banks, except CBL Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade in the banks ratings. A sustained improvement in the banks key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade of the banks ratings. National rating of CBL There is limited upside potential given the Negative Outlook on the banks national rating. BOC and PB have a 1.78 equity stake each in Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd. No shareholder other than Fitch, Inc. is involved in the day-to-day rating operations of, or credit reviews undertaken by, Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd. OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS RWN Removed on Senior Debt Ratings: Fitch has also taken corresponding rating action on the banks national scale senior debt ratings, where assigned. Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt, where applicable, is rated at the same level as the banks National Long-Term Ratings in accordance with Fitchs criteria. This is because the issues rank equally with the claims of the banks other senior unsecured creditors. SUBORDINATED DEBT The removal of the RWN on the banks outstanding and proposed subordinated debt, where applicable, corresponds to the action taken on these banks national ratings. Sri Lanka rupee-denominated subordinated debt, where applicable, is rated two notches below banks National Long-Term Ratings. This is in line with our baseline notching for loss severity for this type of debt and our expectations of poor recovery. OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES Senior and subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the National Long-Term Rating REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. PUBLIC RATINGS WITH CREDIT LINKAGE TO OTHER RATINGS CBLs National Long-Term Rating is driven by support from its ultimate parent, CTH. ESG CONSIDERATIONS BOC has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Governance Structure due to ownership concentration, with a 100 state shareholding and several related-party transactions with the state and state-owned entities, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. BOC has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Financial Transparency. It reflects our view that the recent regulatory forbearance measures announced by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka could distort the true solvency and liquidity position of the bank, thereby limiting financial transparency. This has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3. This means ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitchs ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision. --Fitch--",

Accordingly, the State Minister said that albeit the programme initially being launched in Mannar, it is poised for nationwide expansion in the future, as part of a series of programmes scheduled to be launched by the Ministry to bolster the rural economy and enhance the livelihoods of rural communities. The State Minister, speaking at a press conference held under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (05 Oct.), further said: Various initiatives have been undertaken, guided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to address the economic challenges facing the nation. These programs have contributed to the steady progress of the country, and owe the gratitude to the President for his leadership and vision. It is imperative to extend the full support to the projects that the President is spearheading. In alignment with this commitment, the State Ministry is actively implementing a range of programs to bolster the rural economy, with a special focus on enhancing the livelihoods of rural communities. It has taken significant steps to provide essential seeds to rural cultivators and facilitate market access for their produce. For instance, we have already procured approximately 950 metric tons of green beans from the Mannar district alone through this initiative, contributing to substantial foreign exchange savings on grain imports. We have implemented numerous programs designed to promote agriculture and increase the participation of rural populations in the countrys economic development. Our goal is to expand this program nationwide. Additionally, we are providing vital support for the establishment of goat farms, with the aim of transforming small-scale rural goat breeders into successful owners of large-scale goat farming enterprises within a span of 3-4 years. Moreover, through the Hada Bima authority, it has facilitating the distribution of seedlings and chicks to rural residents engaged in agriculture and poultry management, respectively. The Ministry is also actively involved in the establishment of youth farming villages in various regions, fostering economic self-sufficiency at the village level. Efforts are underway to establish economic centres in different provinces across the island, with a focus on expediting the opening of completed centres. President Wickremesinghe has also allocated funds for the renovation of lakes and canals in rural areas that support agricultural activities, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to safeguarding the interests of farmers and enhancing their livelihoods, even amid the economic challenges the nation faces. Additionally, this year, the National Milad Festival is being held in Mannar district, accompanied by various development projects that will benefit the entire community.",

Accordingly, Kuala Lumpur police chief Allaudeen Abdul Majid confirmed that the case has been solved and police have been instructed to charge four suspects with murder, Malaysian media reported. We can safely say it is about money debt, money, payment, and so on, Allaudeen said, adding that the bodies showed no signs of abuse or torture. They died from suffocation. We are still waiting for further reports from the relevant parties, he said. Meanwhile, Allaudeen said four people detained in Petaling Jaya  three Sri Lankan men and a Pakistani man  on suspicion of harbouring the two prime suspects had been released and could be witnesses in a potential trial. He said the five-room house was rented by a Sri Lankan couple in their 40s, their son who was in his 20s, and two other Sri Lankan nationals, aged between 20 and 30. Police have confirmed the three who died were the tenants and the son. The parents were not home at the time of the incident. Police believed there was a fight involving the two tenants. On Sept 22, the same day as the murder, police detained eight people to facilitate investigations into the killing. The group included the two prime suspects, as well as the parents. The father later died in custody on Sept 30. The investigation into the detainees death has also been handed over to the criminal investigation unit on deaths in custody under the Bukit Aman integrity and standards compliance department, Allaudeen said, adding that it would not affect the case because the investigation papers were almost completed. On Sept 22, sounds of screams, believed to be from a fight, led to the discovery of three bodies, belonging to Sri Lankan men, at the house. Their hands and feet were bound, with their heads covered in plastic. The bodies, found in the store room, were stacked on top of each other. One of the bodies was completely nude. Allaudeen was previously quoted as saying that police had received a phone call from members of the public, informing them of a commotion coming from a four-storey shop house, around 11pm. He said following the discovery of the bodies, police arrested the Sri Lankan couple, who had rented the house. - Agencies",

        "date": "October 6, 2023 11:47 am",
        "content": "A drone attack on a Syrian military academy in the city of Homs has killed at least 100 people and left dozens injured. The explosive-laden drones targeted a graduation ceremony attended by cadets families, and women and children were among the dead. The army blamed terrorist groups backed by known international forces. There was no immediate claim from the rebels and jihadists battling the government in the countrys civil war. The drone attack is believed to have been launched from opposition-held areas north-west of Homs. Later, first responders from the White Helmets reported that five civilians had been killed in intense government artillery and missile strikes on several cities, towns and villages in the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. Syrias state news agency, Sana, quoted a statement from the General Command of the Armed Forces as saying that several drones carrying explosives targeted the Homs military academy just after the afternoon graduation ceremony had ended. The statement said the armed forces considers this act an unprecedented criminal one, and affirms that it will respond with full force and determination to these terrorist groups wherever they are. In a later report the agency quoted Health Minister Hassan al-Gabbash saying the strike had injured more than 200 people and that six women and six children were among the dead. A man who had earlier helped set up decorations at the site said: After the ceremony, people went down to the courtyard and the explosives hit. We dont know where it came from, and corpses littered the ground. A graphic video of the aftermath of the attack showed dozens of casualties and their relatives screaming for help inside a large, walled parade ground. Gunfire can also be heard in the background. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrias defence minister attended the graduation ceremony but left minutes before the attack. More than half a million people have been killed by the civil war that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011. Some 6.8 million people are internally displaced, while another 6 million are refugees or asylum-seekers abroad. The UNs special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, described the attack on the academy as horrific and called on all parties to the conflict to exercise the utmost restraint. All sides must respect their obligations under international law and ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, he said Todays developments further highlight that the status quo in Syria is unsustainable and that, in the absence of a meaningful political path... I fear we will only see further deterioration, including in the security situation. In a separate development in Syria on Thursday, at least 10 people were reportedly killed in Turkish drone strikes in a Kurdish-controlled region of north-eastern Syria that were prompted by a bomb attack in Ankara claimed by Kurdish militants. The SOHR said 17 sites were targeted, including facilities affiliated with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed, Kurdish-led militia alliance, as well as a power station in Qamishli, a water station near Hassakeh and an oil field. The US military also shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops in Syria, a US official told Reuters. Source: BBC -Agencies",

She fights for women against systematic discrimination and oppression, said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who announced the prize in Oslo. Authorities arrested Mohammadi in November after she attended a memorial for a victim of violent 2019 protests. Mohammadi has a long history of imprisonment, harsh sentences and international calls for reviews of her case. Before being jailed, Mohammadi was vice president of the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. Mohammadi has been close to Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, who founded the center. Ebadi left Iran after the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 that touched off unprecedented protests and harsh crackdowns by authorities. In 2018, Mohammadi, an engineer, was awarded the 2018 Andrei Sakharov Prize. In 2022, Mohammadi was tried in five minutes and sentenced to eight years in prison and 70 lashes. The Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about 1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.

Nine pilot projects are being implemented by selecting nine government institutions including Divisional Secretariat Divisions, Pradeshiya Sabha, Municipal Councils and District Secretariat Offices, under the digitization of the public service., the State Minister said in this regard on a previous occasion at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC).",

        "title": "Israel announces state of war alert as Palestinian militants launch surprise attack",
        "date": "October 7, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "Israels military announced a state of war alert on Saturday after militants from Gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory in a major escalation of the long-running conflict between the two sides. The early morning rocket attack, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described as massive, left at least one person dead and multiple wounded. Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, claimed responsibility for the rocket attack and called for a general uprising against Israel. If you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it  get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts, Hamas military commander Muhammad Al-Deif said in a recorded message. Dubbing the operation Al-Aqsa Storm he said that the group had targeted the enemy positions, airports and military positions with 5,000 rockets and that the assault on Israel was a response to attacks on women, the desecration of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the ongoing siege of Gaza. The IDF warned Israelis who live near Gaza to stay in their homes or head to shelters. In the last hour, the Hamas terrorist organization had begun a massive shooting of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, and terrorists infiltrated into Israeli territory in a number of different locations, the IDF said in a statement Saturday morning. Sirens warning of incoming rockets continued for at least three hours after the initial barrage. The Hamas terrorist organization is the sovereign in the Gaza Strip and is responsible for this attack. It will face the consequences and responsibility for these events, it added. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Israel was facing a very difficult moment, writing in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. I wish to offer strength to the commanders and soldiers of the IDF, and to all the security forces and rescue services. I send my encouragement and strength to all the residents of Israel who are under attack, he added. CNN teams in Jerusalem heard rocket warning sirens and booms, likely the interceptions of incoming rockets, as sirens continued to sound around Israel. The first round of rockets was fired at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday morning local time (11:30 p.m. ET), when most Israelis are likely to have been asleep. It is rare for Palestinian militants to be able to make it into Israel from Gaza which is sealed off and heavily watched by Israels military. Israel television Channel 12 reported that the infiltrators from Gaza had entered Kibbutz Beeri, saying that residents were urging the IDF to rush to the kibbutz. Channel 12 also reported that infiltrators had taken hostages in Netiv HaAsara. Israeli authorities did not immediately confirm any details about those reports. Social media footage obtained by CNN showed multiple masked gunmen in a pickup truck driving down a street in the Israeli city of Sderot. Gunfire could also be heard in the video. One woman died and at least 15 people were wounded across southern and lowland regions of Israel in the militant attacks, Israels Magen David Adom rescue service said a mid-morning update on Saturday. MDA said the woman who was killed was in her 60s, revising her age down from 70s, which CNN had earlier reported. Two people are in critical condition, six in moderate condition and seven have minor injuries, MDA said in a statement. The MDA said teams respond to areas of reported missile falls and live firing incidents, and urged people to heed instruction from authorities and to carefully and promptly go to a protected area when an alarm sounds. MDA spokesperson Zaki Heller also urged people to donate blood and said a special blood donation drive is being organized in Tel Aviv for Saturday morning due to an urgent need. The rockets, which were witnessed by a CNN producer in Gaza, prompted sirens as far north as the Tel Aviv area, east to Beer Sheva, and many other locations in between. Social media footage obtained by CNN showed the aftermath of a rocket strike in the coastal city of Ashkelon where multiple cars could be seen burning next to an apartment complex, a thick plume of black smoke billowing into the air. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are conducting security assessments at Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv, Netanyahus office said. Gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world, an isolated coastal enclave of almost 2 million people crammed into 140 square miles. Governed by Hamas, the territory is largely cut off from the rest of the world by an Israeli blockade of Gazas land, air and sea dating back to 2007. Egypt controls Gazas southern border crossing, Rafah. Israel has placed heavy restrictions on the freedom of civilian movement and controls the importation of basic goods into the narrow coastal strip. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "The Presidents Media Division (PMD) says Sri Lanka cannot endorse the idea of international investigations into the islands internal matters. The Constitution of Sri Lanka and all other existing laws do not provide for conducting international investigations, the PMD said further, explaining that carrying out such investigations would be in violation of the law. These remarks were made in a statement on Friday (Oct. 06) in which the PMD raised concerns about the editorial published in the local Catholic newspaper Gnanartha Pradeepaya dated October 08 (Sunday), as well as the article titled An international investigation team is needed for an independent, transparent, and thorough investigation and monitoring. The PMD says Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, on April 20, 2023, had delivered 88 volumes and 48,909 pages of the presidential commission report on the Easter attack to Most Rev. Bishop Harold Anthony, following a request made by him. Additionally, during a recent telephone conversation with Minister Tiran Alles, the President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Bishop Harold Anthony had mentioned that he was personally reviewing the report. In light of this, the PMD said President Ranil Wickremesinghe is preparing to engage in discussions with representatives of the Bishops Conference. The statement read that the idea of international investigations into Sri Lankas internal matters cannot be endorsed, explaining that the Constitution of Sri Lanka and all other existing laws do not provide for conducting international investigations. The PMD said a committee, led by a retired Supreme Court judge, has been established to conduct an inquiry and produce a report regarding the Channel 4 television program. The government also intends to engage in further discussions on this issue once the Bishops Conference have thoroughly reviewed the report from the Presidential Commission.",

        "title": "Israel says its at war after 40 killed in attack from Gaza",
        "date": "October 7, 2023 06:58 pm",
        "content": "At least 40 people have been killed in Israel after a major surprise attack with militants crossing into Israel from Gaza during heavy rocket fire. Several Israelis have reportedly been taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel has responded with a wave of air strikes on targets in Gaza killing 161 people, Palestinian officials say. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is at war and vowed that Hamas, Gazas rulers, will pay a price it has never known. This morning Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the state of Israel and its citizens, he said in a video address. This is one of the most serious escalations in the Israel-Palestinian conflict in years. The attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas saw fighters cross the perimeter fence just after dawn. At the same time, barrages of rockets were launched from Gaza - some reaching as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. How the gunmen managed to penetrate one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world is unclear. The Israeli military has said that dozens of fighter jets are carrying out air strikes on Hamas sites in Gaza, and it has hit 17 Hamas military compounds. It also said it has mobilised tens of thousands of reservists. The Palestinian health ministry says 161 people have been killed in Israeli strikes. The rocket barrages from Gaza - the biggest attack by Hamas on Israel in years - began just after dawn on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and the day of the festival of Simchat Torah. As sirens sounded across Israel, the IDF announced that terrorists had infiltrated Israeli territory in a number of different locations. It told civilians in southern and central areas to stay next to shelters, and inside shelters in the area surrounding Gaza. Footage posted online appeared to show a group of heavily armed Palestinian militants dressed in black fatigues driving around Sderot in a pick-up truck. In one video, the same militants seemed to be exchanging fire with Israeli forces on the streets of the town, which is only 1.6km (1 mile) from Gaza. There are also unconfirmed reports in the Palestinian media that a number of Israelis have been taken hostage by militants. On its social media channels, Hamas released videos apparently showing Israelis captured by its fighters. In some videos, which cant be verified, civilians appear to have been taken as hostages to the Palestinian territory - an unprecedented development. Footage is also circulating of Palestinians in Gaza driving Israeli military vehicles. Some 545 Israelis have been wounded in the Hamas attacks, Israels health ministry says. For hours, Israeli television channels have carried live interviews with people trapped in their homes during chaotic scenes after Palestinian militants entered their towns and villages. Residents say they do not remember a situation like this for a long time, while streets in the capital Tel Aviv have been locked down and the streets are empty. Restaurants, cafes, everything is locked down and there is a heavy feeling of surprise, of shock and of fear from what is still expected to happen, English author and journalist Gideon Levy told the BBC. When the first rockets fell, I was still jogging in the park, the noise was terrible. The leader of one regional council in southern Israel, Ofir Liebstein, was killed in an exchange of fire with militants when he went to defend his community. The rocket barrages meanwhile continued throughout Saturday morning, with thousands of projectiles launched towards Israel. Hospitals in the southern city of Ashkelon and central city of Beer Sheva are treating casualties. Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war, Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a statement. I convened the heads of the security establishment and ordered - first of all - to clear out the communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists. This currently is being carried out. At the same time, I have ordered an extensive mobilization of reserves and that we return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known. A senior Hamas military commander announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight. This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth, Mohammed Deif said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -a political rival of Hamas- chaired an emergency meeting, and has defended the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terror of settlers and occupation troops. A major investigation has been launched as to how Israeli intelligence failed to see the well-coordinated Hamas attack coming, Israeli government officials have told the BBC. There has been strong international condemnation to the Hamas attacks, with UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying the UK unequivocally condemns the horrific attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians and the UK will always support Israels right to defend itself. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the attack as terrorism in its most despicable form while the United States condemned the violence and urged both sides to refrain from retaliating. Iran has backed the Palestinian attack, saying it congratulated the fighters, while Qatars foreign ministry said Israel alone was responsible for the ongoing escalation of violence.

        "content": "The death toll from a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in western Afghanistan on Saturday has risen to about 120, disaster relief authorities said, with more than 1,000 others being treated for injuries. The United States Geological Survey said the epicentre was 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of the regions largest city Herat, and was followed by eight aftershocks with magnitudes between 4.3 and 6.3. So far, more than 1,000 injured women, children, and old citizens have been included in our records, and about 120 people have lost their lives, Herat province disaster management head Mosa Ashari told AFP. Crowds of residents fled buildings in Herat at around 11:00 am (0630 GMT) as the quakes began. We were in our offices and suddenly the building started shaking, 45-year-old resident Bashir Ahmad told AFP. Wall plasters started to fall down and the walls got cracks, some walls and parts of the building collapsed, he said. I am not able to contact my family, network connections are disconnected. I am too worried and scared, it was horrifying. Men, women and children stood out in the wide streets, away from tall buildings, in the moments after the first quake and remained wary of returning to their homes as aftershocks rumbled for hours. The situation was very horrible, I have never experienced such a thing, said 21-year-old student Idrees Arsala, the last to safely evacuate his classroom as the quakes began. Buried under the rubble Early on Saturday evening, disaster management authority spokesman Mullah Jan Sayeq told AFP that the number of fatalities was expected to rise very high. There are some areas that are totally collapsed and all the houses are damaged, he said. People are still buried under the rubble. The aid agencies are trying to reach the area. Hundreds of fatalities were possible, according to a USGS preliminary estimate. Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response, it said. The USGS had earlier reported the first quakes magnitude as 6.2. It had a shallow depth of just 14 kilometres, it said. Herat -- 120 kilometres east of the border with Iran -- is considered the cultural capital of Afghanistan. It is the capital of Herat province, which is home to an estimated population of 1.9 million, according to 2019 World Bank data. Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. In June last year, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless after a 5.9-magnitude quake -- the deadliest in Afghanistan in nearly a quarter of a century -- struck the impoverished province of Paktika. In March of this year, 13 people were killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan by a magnitude 6.5 quake, which hit near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan. Afghanistan is already in the grip of a grinding humanitarian crisis, following the widespread withdrawal of foreign aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 8, 2023 08:20 am",
        "content": "Some 250 people have been killed in Israel as a result of multiple Hamas aggression, while retaliatory Israeli air strikes have claimed the lives of 232 people in Gaza, according to the latest data confirmed by medical sources on both sides. The number of wounded in Israel rose to 1,450, according to medical sources quoted by Hebrew media, while in the Strip they number 1,700, according to the Gaza Health Ministrys count, since Hamas launched a surprise offensive against Israel by land, sea and air this morning. The situation is very delicate and the Israeli Defense Ministry has declared a state of emergency throughout the country, while fighting continues in towns near the Strip, where Hamas militiamen are still holding Israeli hostages and confronting Israeli troops. As of this morning, Israeli air strikes continue in Gaza and more than 3,000 rockets have been fired by Palestinian militias into Israeli territory, where there are still hundreds of Gaza militia members fighting with Israeli forces at some twenty points in Israel, according to an army spokesman. The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting medical personnel and hospitals, killing three health workers, wounding three others and destroying five ambulances. According to Palestinian sources in the Strip, at least five buildings in Gaza have been destroyed by Israeli shelling and hospitals are in a state of emergency in response to the situation. In Gaza, thousands of Gazan civilians from towns in the north of the Strip such as Beit Hanoun, Jabalia or Beit Lahia were evacuated and fled to Gaza City to be accommodated in schools of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees due to the severity of the clashes. According to local estimates, the number of militiamen currently still in Israel is estimated to be much higher than the figure given by Israeli authorities and could be in the hundreds or even over a thousand members of the Al Qasam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, or the armed wing of the Islamist group Islamic Jihad. The militiamen killed Israeli soldiers, took hostage residents of Israeli towns near the Strip and kidnapped around fifty people, according to sources in Gaza and videos on social networks showing the capture of military personnel, civilians and also Asian immigrants. Israel cuts Gazas electricity in retaliation for Hamas multiple attacks Israeli Energy Minister Ysrael Katz today signed an order to disconnect the Gaza Strip from the Israeli power grid, in retaliation for Hamas multiple attack by land, sea and air that has sparked another war. Its not going to be like it was before, Katz said in a statement about this punishment of Gazas population. Gaza depends on Israel for its electricity supply, as well as for the import of fuel to power its only plant. With this measure, the Strip goes from having 12 hours a day of electricity supply, to only four, which is all the energy its plant can supply, as long as they have fuel. Biden warns that the U.S. will never stop supporting Israel U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday condemned terrorist attacks against Israel and warned that Washington will never stop backing the Israeli government. At this time of tragedy, I want to tell the world and the terrorists that the United States stands with Israel. We will never stop supporting them, the president said in an institutional statement from the White House, accompanied by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The large-scale Hamas attack against Israel on Saturday led to a new war in which more than 250 Israelis and at least 232 Palestinians have died in Gaza, according to the latest data confirmed by medical sources on both sides. The U.S. president described as appalling the images of thousands of rockets launched from the Gaza Strip against Israeli towns, killing not only Israeli soldiers but also innocent civilians. Biden explained that in a phone call he had with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he conveyed the United States strong and unwavering support for Israels security. Israel has the right to defend itself, period. There is no justification for terrorist attacks, he declared. He also warned Israels adversaries not to take advantage of the attack for profit as the world is watching you. In addition to Netanyahu, Biden spoke Saturday with Jordans King Abdullah and instructed his team to maintain contacts with the Palestinian National Authority, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and their European allies. The U.S. president said it is heartbreaking to see the lives of so many Israeli families shattered and assured that both he and First Lady Jill Biden are praying for them. Make no mistake, the United States supports the State of Israel. We have done so since we became the first nation to recognize Israel 75 years ago just 11 minutes after its founding, the president concluded without taking questions from the press. The U.S. government denied Saturday that Iranian funds it unfroze as part of a prisoner exchange with Tehran were used to finance the Hamas attack on Israel. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller denied the Republican Party, which in a statement linked the release of the funds to the attack, to criticize President Joe Biden. Lets be clear: the deal to bring Americans home from Iran has nothing to do with the horrific attack on Israel, Miller declared on social networks. The spokesman stressed that not a penny has been spent of those funds, which Iran will also only be able to use for humanitarian issues such as the purchase of food or medicine. Anything to the contrary is false, he said. Miller thus responded to the Republican National Committee (RNC), which blamed Bidens weakness and appeasement for having emboldened the enemies of the United States and Israel. Less than a month ago, Joe Biden unfroze 6 billion for Iran, the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism, and now Israel is once again under attack, he stressed. UN mission in Lebanon reinforces presence, works to prevent rockets against Israel The UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (UNIFIL) today reinforced its presence in the border area with Israel and carried out operations to prevent rocket fire from Lebanese territory, something that tends to occur during escalations such as the current one between the Jewish state and Palestinian factions in Gaza. UNIFIL is closely following the unfolding dramatic events in Israel. Blue Helmets are present along the Blue Line (de facto border between Lebanon and the Jewish State) to maintain stability and help prevent escalation, the mission stated on its X account, formerly Twitter. According to a terse statement released on the social network, the Blue Helmets have also adapted and intensified their presence throughout the missions area of operations, which roughly corresponds to the southern strip of Lebanon bordering Israel, from the Blue Line to the Litani River. The measures include operations against rocket fire, they added, without providing details. Coinciding with escalations such as the current one between Israel and Gaza Strip militias, Palestinian factions present in Lebanese territory have in the past launched projectiles across the divide, provoking Israeli responses with artillery or even shelling into Lebanon. However, on this occasion no such incidents have yet been recorded and since this morning the UNIFIL command has been in constant contact with both countries to ensure effective coordination and avoid misunderstandings, according to the note. The Jewish state declared a state of war today after the Islamist Hamas movement launched a surprise operation by air, sea and land, including the launching of thousands of rockets.

        "date": "October 8, 2023 12:40 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from strong earthquakes that shook western Afghanistan has risen to over 2,000, a Taliban government spokesman said Sunday. Its one of the deadliest earthquakes to strike the country in two decades. A powerful magnitude-6.3 earthquake followed by strong aftershocks killed dozens of people in western Afghanistan on Saturday, the countrys national disaster authority said. But Abdul Wahid Rayan, spokesman at the Ministry of Information and Culture, said the death toll from the earthquake in Herat is higher than originally reported. About six villages have been destroyed, and hundreds of civilians have been buried under the debris, he said while calling for urgent help. The United Nations late Saturday gave a preliminary figure of 320 dead, but later said the figure was still being verified. Local authorities gave an estimate of 100 people killed and 500 injured, according to the same update from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The update said 465 houses had been reported destroyed and a further 135 were damaged. Partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties to increase as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that some people may be trapped under collapsed buildings, the U.N. said. Disaster authority spokesperson Mohammad Abdullah Jan said four villages in the Zenda Jan district in Herat province bore the brunt of the quake and aftershocks. The United States Geological Survey said the quakes epicenter was about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Herat city. It was followed by three very strong aftershocks, measuring magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5, as well as lesser shocks. At least five strong tremors struck the city around noon, Herat city resident Abdul Shakor Samadi said. All people are out of their homes, Samadi said. Houses, offices and shops are all empty and there are fears of more earthquakes. My family and I were inside our home, I felt the quake. His family began shouting and ran outside, afraid to return indoors. The World Health Organization in Afghanistan said it dispatched 12 ambulance cars to Zenda Jan to evacuate casualties to hospitals. As deaths  casualties from the earthquake continue to be reported, teams are in hospitals assisting treatment of wounded  assessing additional needs, the U.N. agency said on X, formerly known as Twitter. WHO-supported ambulances are transporting those affected, most of them women and children. Telephone connections went down in Herat, making it hard to get details from affected areas. Videos on social media showed hundreds of people in the streets outside their homes and offices in Herat city. Herat province borders Iran. The quake also was felt in the nearby Afghan provinces of Farah and Badghis, according to local media reports. Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, expressed his condolences to the dead and injured in Herat and Badghis. The Taliban urged local organizations to reach earthquake-hit areas as soon as possible to help take the injured to hospital, provide shelter for the homeless, and deliver food to survivors. They said security agencies should use all their resources and facilities to rescue people trapped under debris. We ask our wealthy compatriots to give any possible cooperation and help to our afflicted brothers, the Taliban said on X. Japans ambassador to Afghanistan, Takashi Okada, expressed his condolences saying on the social media platform X, that he was deeply grieved and saddened to learn the news of earthquake in Herat province. In June 2022, a powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. The quake killed at least 1,000 people and injured about 1,500.

        "date": "October 8, 2023 01:10 pm",
        "content": "Head of the National Cancer Control Programme, community medicine specialist Dr. Hasareli Fernando highlighted the expansion of healthcare services across the island, including the establishment of 30 new breast clinics in government hospitals under the supervision of oncology surgeons. During a recent episode of the One-O-One Katha program produced by the Presidents Media Division (PMD), where the doctor discussed the significant advancements in healthcare in Sri Lanka, mentioned that these clinics, in addition to the existing Suvanari clinics and cancer early detection centres, are playing a crucial role in enhancing the early detection of breast cancer. Furthermore, Dr. Fernando emphasized that while breast cancer cannot be prevented, early detection holds the potential for complete cure. This development in healthcare infrastructure represents a significant step forward in ensuring better healthcare access and outcomes for the people of Sri Lanka. Expressing her views further Dr Hasareli Fernando noted; Breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent form of cancer among women both in our country and worldwide. Its important to note that men are not immune to breast cancer, although being female constitutes a significant risk factor. In fact, women face a risk that is 100 times greater than that of men in developing breast cancer. Additionally, over 80 of breast cancer cases are reported in individuals aged 50 and above. A family history of breast cancer and genetic mutations contribute to the risk, with a 15 likelihood of breast cancer due to genetic factors. Those who have previously battled breast cancer are also at a higher risk of recurrence, as are women who have never had children and those who had their first child after turning 30. Factors such entering puberty before the age of 11 and reaching menopause after 55 years of age also pose risks that are beyond our control. These risk factors are linked to estrogen and progesterone hormones in the body. Long-term use of hormonal birth control pills carries a slight risk of breast cancer, but this risk has been minimized through hormone combinations and pill formulations. While some of these risk factors are beyond our control, there are modifiable factors that we can focus on, such as managing weight, dietary choices, regular exercise and alcohol and tobacco consumption. The most effective method for early detection of breast cancer is through regular breast self-examinations, especially for women over the age of 20. It is recommended to perform these self-exams on a specific date each month. Health institutions consistently promote awareness about this practice. When conducting routine breast self-examinations, individuals should be vigilant for any new changes, such as the presence of a lump, whether painful or not, alterations in skin texture, changes in colour or shape, nipple discharge, or nipple inversion. If a new lump is detected not only in the breast but also in the armpit, it is essential to seek immediate consultation with a qualified doctor. Referring to the Suvanari Sayana program through Medical Officers of Health offices is an option. Moreover, the Ministry of Health has established five cancer screening centres in Narahenpita, Ratnapura, Matara, Batticaloa and Jaffna. Additionally, there are 30 new breast clinics operating under the supervision of specialist cancer surgeons in government hospitals across the island. Individuals can visit any of these facilities or hospitals promptly to undergo necessary tests and receive medical advice. While breast cancer cannot be prevented, early detection offers the possibility of complete cure. Cancer cases are on the rise in Sri Lanka and globally. In 2020, Sri Lanka saw over 37,000 new cancer diagnoses, with more than 20,000 affecting women. Among these cases, breast cancer is the most common, exceeding 5,000 diagnoses in 2020. Breast cancer accounts for 26 of womens cancer diagnoses. Worldwide, 2.2 million breast cancer cases were reported in 2020, with 685,000 deaths attributed to the disease. In 2019, Sri Lanka recorded 784 breast cancer-related deaths, including 18 among men. Many preventable cancers are linked to poor dietary choices. To mitigate these risks, it is advisable to minimize consumption of fast food and be mindful of weight gain, which can contribute to certain cancers. While bread flour itself is not a carcinogen, it is associated with weight gain and some types of cancer. For adults, it is recommended to engage in at least half an hour of exercise per day, five days a week, to the point of perspiration. It is also crucial to avoid both smoking and smokeless tobacco products, as they are carcinogenic and contribute to oral and lung cancers, particularly in men. --PMD--",

        "title": "Israels Security Council says country at war with Hamas and authorizes significant military steps",
        "date": "October 8, 2023 07:16 pm",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office says his Security Cabinet has declared the country at war following a deadly Hamas assault in southern Israel. The decision, announced on Sunday, formally authorizes the taking of significant military steps, it said it a statement. The war that was forced on the State of Israel in a murderous terrorist assault from the Gaza Strip began at 06:00 yesterday, it said. It gave no further details. But Netanyahu had previous declared the country at war, and the military has promised a harsh response in Gaza. Israeli media say at least 600 people have been killed in the surprise cross-border incursion by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of southern Israel on Sunday and launched retaliation strikes that leveled buildings in Gaza, while in northern Israel a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanons Hezbollah militant group raised fears of a broader conflict. There was still some fighting underway more than 24 hours after an unprecedented surprise attack from Gaza, in which Hamas militants, backed by a volley of thousands of rockets, broke through Israels security barrier and rampaged through nearby communities. At least 600 people have reportedly been killed in Israel  a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades  and more than 300 have been killed in Gaza. The militants also took captives back into the coastal Gaza enclave, including women, children and the elderly, who they will likely try to trade for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The high death toll, multiple captives and slow response to the onslaught pointed to a major intelligence failure and undermined the long-held perception that Israel has eyes and ears everywhere in the small, densely populated territory it has controlled for decades. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was at war and would exact a heavy price from its enemies. Hamas leaders said they were prepared for further escalation. A major question now was whether Israel will launch a ground assault into Gaza, a move that in the past has brought intensified casualties. Netanyahu vowed that Hamas will pay an unprecedented price. But, he warned, This war will take time. It will be difficult. Civilians paid a staggering cost for the violence on both sides. Several Israeli media outlets, citing rescue service officials, said at least 600 people were killed in Israel, including 44 soldiers, while officials in Gaza said 313 people had died in the territory. Some 2,000 people have been wounded on each side. An Israeli official said security forces have killed 400 militants and captured dozens more. Israeli TV news aired a stream of accounts from the relatives of captive or missing Israelis, who wailed and begged for assistance amid a fog of uncertainty surrounding the fate of their loved ones. In Gaza, residents fled homes near the border to escape Israeli strikes, fleeing deeper inside the territory after warnings in Arabic from the Israeli military. In neighboring Egypt, a policeman shot dead two Israeli tourists and an Egyptian at a tourist site in Alexandria, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt made peace with Israel decades ago, but anti-Israel sentiment runs high in the country, especially during bouts of Israeli-Palestinian violence. The flare-up on Israels northern border also threatened to draw into the battle Hezbollah, a fierce enemy of Israels which is backed by Iran and estimated to have tens of thousands of rockets at its disposal. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets and shells on Sunday at three Israeli positions in a disputed area along the border and Israels military fired back using armed drones. Two children were lightly wounded by broken glass on the Lebanese side, according to the nearby Marjayoun Hospital. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military official, told reporters the situation at the northern border was calm after the exchange. But he said fighting was still underway in the south and that there were still hostage situations there. He said troops had moved into every community near the Gaza frontier, where they planned to evacuate all civilians and scour the area for militants. We will go through every community until we kill every terrorist that is in Israeli territory, he said. In Gaza, every terrorist located in a house, all the commanders in houses, will be hit by Israeli fire. That will continue escalating in the coming hours. Hamas said that overnight it had continued to send forces and equipment into a number of locations inside our occupied territories, referring to Israel. Hamas-linked media reported that the son of Nizar Awadallah, a senior political official, was killed. The Islamic militant group has not reported any senior members being captured, killed or wounded. The surprise attack Saturday was the deadliest on Israel in decades. In an assault of startling breadth, Hamas gunmen used explosives to break through the border fence enclosing Gaza, then crossed with motorcycles, pickup trucks, paragliders and speed boats on the coast. They rolled into as many as 22 locations outside the Gaza Strip early Saturday morning, including towns and other communities as far as 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the Gaza border, while Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israeli cities. Israel is waking up this morning to a terrible morning, said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman. There are a lot of people killed ... children, grandmothers, families, bodies. Israeli media said at least 600 people were killed and 2,000 wounded in Saturdays attack. Hamas fighters took an unknown number of civilians and soldiers captive into Gaza, and a line of Israelis with missing relatives snaked outside a police station in central Israel to supply investigators with DNA samples and other means that could help identify their family members. Israel struck 426 targets in Gaza, its military said, flattening residential buildings in giant explosions. Among the 313 killed in Gaza were 20 children, and close to 2,000 people were wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinians, said more than 20,000 Palestinians left Gazas border region to head further inside the territory and take refuge in U.N. schools. In a televised address Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military will use all of its strength to destroy Hamas capabilities. Get out of there now, he told Gaza residents, who have no way to leave the tiny, overcrowded Mediterranean territory. Gazas 2.3 million people have endured a border blockade, enforced to varying degrees by Israel and Egypt, since Hamas militants seized control in 2007. In Gaza, much of the population was thrown into darkness Saturday night as Israel cut off electricity and said it would no longer supply power, fuel or other goods to the territory. Hamas said it had planned for a long fight. We are prepared for all options, including all-out war, the deputy head of the Hamas political bureau, Saleh al-Arouri, told Al-Jazeera TV. Israel has a history of making heavily lopsided exchanges to bring captive Israelis home. The military has confirmed that a substantial number of Israelis were abducted Saturday without giving an exact figure. An Egyptian official said Israel has sought help from Cairo to ensure the safety of the hostages, and that Egypts intelligence chief had contacted Hamas and the smaller but more radical Islamic Jihad group, which also took part in the incursion, to seek information. Egypt has often mediated between the two sides in the past. The official said Palestinian leaders claimed that they dont yet have a full picture of hostages, but said those who were brought into Gaza were taken to secure locations across the territory. Its clear that they have a big number  several dozens, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to brief media. Egypt also spoke with both sides about a potential cease-fire, but the official said Israel was not open to a truce at this stage. In Iran, which has long supported Hamas and other militant groups, senior officials have openly praised the incursion. President Ebrahim Raisi spoke by phone with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhalah, the state-run IRNA news agency reported Sunday. The shadowy leader of Hamas military wing, Mohammed Deif, said the assault, named Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, was in response to the 16-year blockade of Gaza, and a series of recent incidents that have brought Israeli-Palestinian tensions to a fever pitch. Over the past year, Israels far-right government has ramped up settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, Israeli settler violence has displaced hundreds of Palestinians there, and tensions have flared around the Al-Aqsa mosque, a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site. President Joe Biden said from the White House that the U.S. stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults, and said Israel has the right to defend itself.

        "title": "Need to enact new rules instead of relying on old regulations to get out of crisis - PM",
        "date": "October 8, 2023 10:11 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that the country needs to enact new rules instead of relying on old regulations to get out of the prevailing crisis. We must undergo such a change if we want to recover from the crisis. Its necessary to enact new rules instead of relying on old rules, he said. He expressed this view while addressing the Sankathana Mandapaya held at Temple Trees on Saturday (07) to mark the World Cotton Day, the Prime Ministers Office said in a statement. Speaking on this occasion The Prime Minister stated that; World Cotton Day is a special day declared by the United Nations. It is declared as a special day because it is useful for the people of the world. We dedicate ourselves to make this day meaningful for the cotton industry. In every district all over the country, we encounter with thousands of acres of uncultivated lands belonging to the government. There is a possibility of using these lands for a useful purpose like cotton cultivation. We are ready to extend our support and commitment in this regard. By expanding cotton cultivation through a continuous national program, the income of the rural people can be increased and foreign exchange of the country can be saved. I appreciate the attempts of the private sector for that. Farmers and entrepreneurs need confidence to engage in this kind of cultivation. It is necessary to cooperate with our universities and other research institutes to expand this industry. An innovative system should be introduced to cultivate cotton in small gardens as an additional income. It has been almost a hundred years have elapsed since we started creating agriculture colonies with the belief that we have the ability to raise our heads through agriculture. In those colonies, there is the possibility of cultivating on every piece of land. People need to be directed to that. We are ready to have discussions on this matter with relevant institutions. Imported weaving machinery was available in certain buildings. Some were gifted to our country. These resources should be given to universities or entrepreneurs to focus on achieving goals. We must undergo such a change if we want to recover from the crisis. Its necessary to enact new rules instead of relying on old rules. Countries such as the United Kingdom, U.S.A, India, China, and Egypt are still engaged in cotton production. We have to explain to the people about the production of seeds and the many benefits that can be achieved by seeds. By opening the doors of working generation of villages with universities, the children can be trained and those who leave the university will be benefited to the nation in the future. We also import pieces of gauze from abroad. Life index has decreased. But the prices of goods are not cheap. Even if the farmers produce surplus, the price is determined by the purchasing power of the people. Farmers need a satisfactory purchase price. An agreement should be existed between the private sector and the government sector on the prices. Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Program, said; Support of UNDP will be rendered to the governments efforts to develop cotton industry of Sri Lanka with the active participation of the private sector and farmers. This industry with a history of more than 2500 years can be used to boost the economy of rural farming families. In addition to the production of cotton cloth, there is the possibility of starting various industries related to the cotton industry, which generates valuable products such as cotton oil and animal feed. Especially this is a gateway to the world of fashion from the cotton industry and I call it Farm to Fashion. Perseverance of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardenas to uplift the rural people including small farm owners and small and medium scale entrepreneurs, especially women is highly appreciated. Minister Douglas Devananda, State Ministers Seeta Arambepola, Ashoka Priyantha, Vijitha Berugoda, Kader Mastan, MPs Jagath Samarawickrama, Yadamini Gunawardena, Secretaries to the Ministries, University Vice Chancellors, heads of government and non-government institutions, young entrepreneurs, farmers were present on this occasion, the statement added.",

        "title": "President unveils ten-year blueprint for comprehensive progress in Eastern Province",
        "date": "October 8, 2023 10:30 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled an ambitious 10-year initiative aimed at boosting agriculture and tourism in the Eastern Province, with a particular focus on the development of Trincomalee. He highlighted plans to harness the untapped potential of the Mahaweli A and B zones in the Batticaloa district, previously overlooked by Mahaweli projects. Additionally, a comprehensive tourism strategy spanning from Nilaweli to Panama is set to be implemented. The President made these announcements during his attendance at the 149th anniversary celebration of Chenkaladi Madhya Maha Vidyalaya in Batticaloa. Furthermore, efforts to enhance the colleges infrastructure were initiated in conjunction with its anniversary and President Ranil Wickremesinghe personally conferred certificates to students who successfully completed their advanced level studies at Chenkaladi Madhya Maha Vidyalaya, Batticaloa. Expressing his views further, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; Batticaloa is a district of great fortune, boasting two schools with a distinguished 150-year legacy. Just yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the momentous 150th anniversary celebration of St. Michaels College. Today, we are gathered here at Chenkaladi Madhya Maha Vidyalaya. Its worth noting that the late Minister Mr. K.W. Devanayagayan received his education at this very school and I had the honour of working alongside him during Mr. J.R. Jayawardenes cabinet. This institution has consistently provided high-quality education to the youth of Chenkaladi and Kalkuda areas. The proof lies in the remarkable number of students it has sent to Jayawardenepura University, as well as those pursuing various courses, including accounting. These students have also excelled in the field of technology, despite the schools lack of a proper technology lab. As a result, I am committed to establishing a state-of-the-art technology laboratory at the school to further enhance its educational offerings. While this school has undoubtedly achieved academic excellence, its talents extend beyond the classroom, notably in the field of dance. Today, the Chenkaladi area has seen significant development and its our duty to continue fostering progress in these regions, a shared aspiration of both Mr. Devanayagan and Mr. Rajadure, distinguished ministers from the Batticaloa district. Im pleased to report that we are actively working to fulfil their vision. Education has been the cornerstone of Batticaloas development, yet the economic foundation requires strengthening. Our 10-year plan for the Batticaloa district is poised to bolster its economic vitality. While President J.R. Jayawardene initially intended to leverage the Mahaweli initiative for regional development, the shadow of war prevented its realization. Today, a new vision emerges as we plan to transform Trincomalee into a thriving city, in collaboration with India, tapping into mineral resources and creating a bustling trade hub. In Katunayake, Biyagama, there exists a 400-acre investment zone, but Trincomalee has set its sights on establishing an expansive 1000-acre investment zone. A systematic development plan for the Trincomalee Port has been prepared by a Singaporean company Surbana Jurong and we are determined to see it through. This ambitious endeavour will transform Trincomalee into a major city and a robust economic hub. Concurrently, we recognize the importance of agricultural development. Plans are underway to harness the untapped potential of the Mahaweli A and B regions in the Batticaloa district, previously overlooked by Mahaweli projects. Our aim is to create a modern agricultural industry in this area. The province has achieved self-sufficiency in rice production and we are actively working to diversify our crop portfolio. Increasing liquid milk production through the introduction of new livestock management practices is also on the horizon. We are seeking support from local companies like Ambewela in Sri Lanka and international firms to achieve this goal. To bolster tourism in the Eastern Province, we are mapping out a tourist zone spanning from Nilaveli to Panama. Plans include the development of forest and lake areas to enhance the tourism experience. Over the next 10 years, our focus remains on the comprehensive development of Trincomalee city, revitalizing the Mahaweli A and B regions, modernizing agriculture and promoting tourism. These efforts are poised to usher in a new era of economic prosperity in these provinces. Additionally, addressing the concerns of dairy farmers is a top priority. The event witnessed the participation of esteemed individuals, including Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman, State Minister S. Vyalendran, Devadasan Kuhalasan, Principal of Chenkaladi Central College and a group of teachers and students. --PMD--",

Joining a press conference held in Colombo, President of the association Gemunu Wijeratne stated that this decision was arrived at in the absence of a practical program for emission testing, adding that steps will be taken to inform the transport authorities in writing in this regard within this week. There is a serious crisis pertaining to the emission tests in private buses. Therefore, we, the Private Bus Owners Association have taken a decision to refrain from these emission tests from January, as this is not being carried out practically. Furthermore, Wijeratne alleged that there is a serious issue with the quality of fuel provided for buses. We have continuously informed that the quality of diesel is in a serious crisis. There is a problem with the quality of diesel provided, he said. Meanwhile, the LPBOA president stressed that emission tests are neither being carried out for the buses attached to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) nor for any other government vehicles. Private buses also run at the same fare as the SLTB buses and provide the same service. So, no one can use the law in two different manners, he added. Therefore, we will provide a written notification to the Ministry of Transport next week that we will refrain from emission testing for our buses from January.",

        "date": "October 9, 2023 09:59 am",
        "content": "During the surprise assault on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas Saturday, gunmen opened fire on a crowd of young people during a dance music festival in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Reim near the Gaza Strip, multiple news agencies and Israeli media reported. Witnesses told the Times of Israel that rocket fire was followed by gunshots fired into the crowd as hundreds tried to flee. The Israeli rescue service Zaka said its paramedics removed about 260 bodies from the area where the music festival had been taking place, the Associated Press reported Sunday. The total figure is expected to be higher as other paramedic teams were working in the area. The music stopped and there was a rocket siren, a young woman called Ortal told Israels Channel 12, according to Reuters. Suddenly out of nowhere, they started shooting. Haaretz, one of Israels largest newspapers, described the scene as a massacre and a battlefield, and reported that terrorists on motorcycles drove into the crowd opening fire. Another party attendee, Esther Borochov, told Reuters that she had to play dead until she was rescued by Israeli soldiers. I couldnt move my legs, she told Reuters at a hospital. Soldiers came and took us away to the bushes. Videos showed Israelis racing across vast open fields and taking cover in orchards. The number of fatalities and injuries from the massacre is unclear. However, Channel 12 said the bodies of dozens of party-goers had been recovered. Hamas launched a highly-coordinated surprise attack on Israel Saturday from the Gaza Strip. Thousands of rockets were fired, and gunmen infiltrated border towns and bases. Israeli officials confirmed early Monday local time that over 700 Israelis had been killed since Hamas launched its attacks from Gaza early Saturday morning. Another 2,150 were wounded. The assault came on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll. The Gaza Ministry of Health said Sunday that 370 Palestinians have died and 2,200 were wounded in Israeli counterattacks. Source: CBS News --Agencies",
