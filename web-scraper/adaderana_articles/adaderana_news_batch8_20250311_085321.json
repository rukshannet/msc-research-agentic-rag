        "title": "Indonesias Ruang volcano erupts, more than 12,000 people evacuated",
        "date": "May 1, 2024 02:26 pm",
        "content": "Indonesias Ruang volcano erupted on Tuesday, spewing lava as lightning flashes lit up its crater, prompting authorities to raise the alert status and evacuate more than 12,000 people living on a nearby island. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) had warned the residents of Tagulandang island that a tsunami could be triggered by volcanic material collapsing into the ocean. The warning, issued on Tuesday morning, remained in placed as of the afternoon. The agency raised the alert status of Ruang to the highest level following the early morning eruption, urging residents not to go near the volcano. Indonesias disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said that all 843 residents living in Ruang island, where the volcano is located, have been moved to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province. Residents of Tagulandang island are being relocated to Siau island to the north. The eruption follows a series of eruptions earlier this month that forced hundreds to evacuate, and the airport in the provincial capital of Manado to close. That eruption also caused damage to some homes. At the time, the volcanology also issued a warning about the potential for a tsunami. Footage shared by Indonesias disaster agency showed strikes of lightning flashing above Ruangs crater, as fiery red clouds of lava and rocks were projected into the air and rained down around the island. The volcanology agency said the eruption column reached 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) high, and urged any remaining residents within a 7-km, previously 6-km, radius to immediately evacuate, warning of possible further explosive eruptions. Ruang island is about 100 km from Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province in the north-central region of the sprawling Indonesian archipelago. The eruption corresponded with a spike in seismic activity and deep volcanic earthquakes, the disaster agency said. Authorities closed Manados Sam Ratulangi airport again on Tuesday, citing the possible spread of volcanic ash, the airport operator said in an Instagram post. The airport will remain closed until noon on Wednesday, the transport ministry said. Authorities downgraded the status level to level 3 last week before bumping it up again to level 4 on Tuesday. Indonesia straddles the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity where multiple tectonic plates meet. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam and Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka, which resumed in October 2023 after almost 40 years only to be stopped days later, is set to recommence on May 13. Online ticket sale for the service, which will be handled by a new operator, will go live on Monday. On October 14 last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually flagged off the service between Nagapattinam and Kankesanthurai. The HSC Cheriyapani operated by the Shipping Corporation of India under KPVS Private Limited, however, stopped service after about a week allegedly due to monsoon. After a gap of six months, the service is set to resume. This time though, a Chennai-based travel operator, IndSri Ferry Services Private Limited, would handle the international service through the ship, Sivagangai. The service will be offered daily. Ticket sale is open from Monday through our website sailindsri.com for voyages between May 13 and November 15, said S Niranjan Nanthagopan, managing director of IndSri Ferry Services Private Limited. A ticket from Nagapattinam port to Kankesanthurai is currently priced at USD 50 plus taxes (about 4,920). The pricing is the same for the return service. Passengers are allowed to carry 60 kg of baggage on board without charges. Further, they are allowed to change their date of travel 72 hours before the scheduled trip.

        "title": "BBC ordered to pay compensation to Sri Lankan journalist",
        "date": "May 1, 2024 05:04 pm",
        "content": "Labour Tribunal of Kalutara, Sri Lanka has ruled that the British Broadcasting Corporations (BBC) decision to prematurely terminate the contract of top journalist Azzam Ameen was unreasonable and unjustifiable. Having delivered the Order on 26th April, 2024, the Labour Tribunal also found that the actions of the BBC, particularly of the BBCs representative Iain Haddow, were arbitrary and high-handed. Ruling against the BBC, the Labour tribunal also ordered the British media house to pay compensation to journalist Azzam Ameen, which amounts to the equivalent of 10 months of the salary drawn by the journalist at the time of his termination of contract. The ruling comes in connection to the case filed by Azzam Ameen on the BBCs decision to terminate his contract over a leaked, distorted voice recording, alleged to have been a phone call with politician Ranjan Ramanayake. The BBC had taken action to terminate the contract of Azzam Ameen based on the press statatments made by the Sinhale Movement and Viyathmaga organization, which had questioned the integrity and independence of the media corporation. Sri Lankan journalist Azzam Ameens lawyers argued in the Labour Tribunal that the BBCs decision to prematurely terminate his contract was unjustifiable. Delivering the Order, the Honourable President of the Labour Tribunal of Kalutara Mrs. Alanka D. Anthony had stated that the evidence placed before the Tribunal indicates that the journalist had an unblemished service record under the BBC for the last ten years, adding The Applicant has been terminated without being afforded an opportunity to show cause for the misconduct alleged. Concerning the incident involving politician Ranjan Ramanayake, pertaining to an allegedly distorted private conversation being publicized on social media, Azzam Ameens lawyers argued that the journalist had not carried out any news coverage violating the BBCs guidelines and he had also not conducted any interviews with the said politician during the relevant time. The Tribunal found that the BBC was well aware that the journalist was engaging in conversations with politicians and was doing so in performing his duties for the media corporation. The Applicant has testified that, as a journalist he had to hold discussion with various politicians to obtain sources of informations. Under cross examination, the Respondent admitted that the Applicant during his employment with the BBC had been covering political reporting and a political reporter would necessarily have to tap and draw from political sources in news reporting. It is therefore, very clear that the Applicant engaged in conversations of nature with politicians and the Respondent was very well aware that he was doing so in performing his duties under the Respondent Corporation, the President of the Labour Tribunal had pointed out. The Labour Tribunal was further informed that the journalist was targeted and his contract was terminated mainly due to the backlash the BBC faced over several media coverages, specifically on the 2019 Easter attacks and subsequent Presidential Election, which were news reports Azzam Ameen had no connection to. Notifying the court that these articles and some BBC World News coverage had come under scrutiny of the public at this period of time, the journalists lawyers pointed out that the articles had no connection to nor any input from Azzam Ameen. While giving evidence, BBCs representative Iain Haddow also acknowledged that Azzam Ameen had no relation to the news articles that had faced backlash and were questioned by the public, while also revealing that the articles had been authored by BBC London representatives. The Labour Tribunal was also satisfied with the evidence produced, that the journalist had been subjected to unfair treatment by the BBCs representative Iain Haddow, who had accepted his mistakes, such as intruding and changing the private social media handle of Azzam Ameen, which he was later compelled to restore to its original status after the BBCs higher authorities were informed in that regard. Although the journalist had also prayed for his reinstatement with back wages, the Honourable President of the Labour Tribunal of Kalutara was of the view that, as the Sinhala Sevaya of the BBC where the journalist was employed had been shut down, reinstatement was neither possible nor practical. However, the Honourable President of the Labour Tribunal of Kalutara ordered that compensation be awarded for the unjust termination of Azzam Ameens employment by the BBC for his service spanning between 10 years from 2010 to 2020. Azzam Ameen was represented by Jagath Wickramanayake, Presidents Counsel, along with Attorneys-at-Law Migara Doss and Harshana M. de Silva.",

At one point the Opposition Leader was attacked in the Galle Face Green and chased away during a rally. Today, we have given him the space at Chatham Street. Isnt this democracy? he inquired. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to every political party which supported in strengthening the countrys economy. I express my gratitude to each and every party who supported me in building up the country to this state again.

        "date": "May 1, 2024 07:30 pm",
        "content": "Eastern India experienced its hottest April on record as a heatwave scorched parts of the country amid a general election, killing at least nine people, and the weather office on Wednesday forecast above normal temperatures for May too. Searing heat has been cited by political analysts as one of the reasons for low voter turnout in the seven-phase parliamentary election that began on April 19, with results due on June 4. Heatwave conditions are, however, forecast to abate gradually in the coming days. The mean temperature in eastern India was 28.12 Celsius (82.61 Fahrenheit) in April, the warmest since records began in 1901, with experts blaming a combination of factors. In an El Nino year, you get more heating, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, chief of the India Meteorological Department, referring to a climate pattern that typically leads to hot and dry weather in Asia and heavier rains in parts of the Americas. He said fewer thunderstorms and an anti-cyclonic circulation near Indias southeastern coast were causing heatwaves. Wind blows from land towards the sea during an anti-cyclone ..., so land becomes warmer and temperature rises. In April, the eastern Indian state of West Bengal recorded the most number of heatwave days for the month in the last 15 years, followed by the neighbouring coastal state of Odisha where heat conditions were the worst in nine years. Authorities have also declared a rare heatwave in the southwestern coastal state of Kerala, where at least two deaths have been recorded due to soaring temperatures. Central and northwestern India, which includes major wheat producing states that typically witness heatwaves this time of the year, have been largely spared due to intermittent thundershowers last month, Mohapatra said. The weather office said rainfall in May is likely to be normal and that it expects more showers during the second half of the monsoon season in August and September as compared to June and July due to the La Nina climate pattern, which typically brings higher rainfall to India. Monsoon is the lifeblood of Indias economy, delivering 70 of the rain needed to water crops and recharge reservoirs, and the met department has predicted that India will receive above normal monsoon rainfall in 2024.

        "date": "May 2, 2024 09:33 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas gross official reserves (GOR) stood at USD 5 billion by the end of March 2024, recording a notable increase compared to USD 4.4 billion at the end of 2023. In its report on the External Sector Performance in the month of March, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) attributed the surge in GOR to its substantial net purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market. Net intervention in March was USD 715 million (based on trade date) and during the first quarter of 2024, the net purchases have amounted to USD 1.2 billion. Import coverage of GOR  including the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China equivalent to around USD 1.5 billion  remained above 3 months of imports since December 2023. The CBSL further states that the deficit in the merchandise trade account narrowed to USD 369 million in March 2024 from USD 412 million recorded in March 2023, primarily due to a higher increase in exports than the increase in imports. However, it widened compared to February 2024 (USD 319 million). Meanwhile, the cumulative deficit in the trade account from January to March 2024 was higher (USD 1,229 million) than the deficit recorded over the same period in 2023 (USD 896 million). Earnings from merchandise exports increased by 9.8 to USD 1,139 million in March 2024 compared to USD 1,037 million in March 2023, the CBSL said further, adding that there was an increase in earnings across all major categories of exports, where industrial exports increased the most. The increase in industrial goods exports in March 2024 (year-on-year) was mainly contributed by petroleum products due to the increase in volumes of bunkering and aviation fuel exports, while textiles and garments exports also recorded a notable improvement. Expenditure on merchandise imports recorded an increase of 4.0 to USD 1,508 million in March 2024 compared to USD 1,450 million in March 2023. Expenditure across all major import categories increased, although intermediate goods led by fuel imports increased the most. According to the CBSL, the increase in expenditure on consumer goods imports in March 2024 compared to a year ago was due to an increase in expenditure on food and beverages imports, although there was a decline in non-food consumer goods imports (led by lower medical and pharmaceuticals). Meanwhile, expenditure on intermediate goods imports increased primarily due to higher fuel imports compared to March 2023. However, expenditure on textiles and textile articles, wheat and fertiliser significantly decreased in March 2024. Expenditure on investment goods recorded a broad-based increase, driven primarily by higher imports of building materials and machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, expenditure on imports in March 2024 increased significantly compared to February 2024 primarily due to the normalisation of fuel expenditure. With respect to the tourism sector, the CBSL noted that tourism earnings in March 2024 were estimated at USD 338 million, in comparison to USD 346 million in February 2024 and USD 189 million in March 2023. Meanwhile, the workers remittances amounted to USD 572 million in March 2024, as opposed to USD 568 million in March 2023 and USD 476 million in February 2024.",

        "content": "(AP)  The death toll climbed to 48 on Thursday as search efforts continued in southeastern China after a highway section collapsed in a mountainous area, sending more than 20 cars down a steep slope. Officials in the city of Meizhou said three other people were unidentified, pending DNA testing. It wasnt immediately clear if they had died, which would bring the death toll to 51. Another 30 people had non-life-threatening injuries. The collapse happened about 2 a.m. on Wednesday after a month of heavy rains in a mountainous part of Guangdong province. Vehicles fell down the slope and sent up flames as they caught fire. The search was still ongoing, Meizhou city Mayor Wang Hui said at a late-afternoon news conference. No foreigners have been found among the victims, he said. Search work has been hampered by rain and land and gravel sliding down the slope. The disaster left a curving earth-colored gash in the otherwise verdant forest landscape. Because some of the vehicles involved caught fire, the difficulty of the rescue operation has increased, said Wen Yongdeng, the Communist Party secretary for the Meizhou emergency management bureau. Most of the vehicles were buried in soil during the collapse process, with a large volume of soil covering them, he said. He added that the prolonged heavy rainfall has saturated soil in the area, making it prone to secondary disasters during the rescue process. Source: AP --Agencies",

The state minister also noted that efforts to address issues concerning the lands owned by the Mahaweli Authority have been prioritized alongside the implementation of the Urumaya program. State Minister Ratwatte conveyed these views during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (02), under the theme Collective path to a stable country. The state minister further commented: Sri Lanka is primarily an agricultural country, and the Mahaweli Authority plays a significant role in contributing to the agricultural sector. Therefore, our ministry oversees agricultural products such as tea, rubber, coconut, and minor export crops. The Mahaweli Development Authority oversees 10 major dams in the country, which are instrumental in generating the electricity required for the nation. Therefore, if these two ministries are utilized effectively, it has the potential to make the country self-sufficient in agriculture. Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Ministries of Agriculture and Plantation Industries have been consolidated into a single entity. This consolidation streamlines the advancement of our nations agricultural sector. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the agricultural modernization program is already underway. There are also challenges concerning the land owned by the Mahaweli Development Authority. Efforts have been directed towards resolving these issues in tandem with the implementation of the Urumaya program. It is important to highlight that the Urumaya program, implemented under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, holds significant importance. This initiative aims to provide free land titles to individuals who do not possess them. Already, approximately 25,000 freehold deeds have been successfully issued under this program. Arrangements have been made to distribute freehold deeds to an additional 6,000 individuals in the Polonnaruwa district by the end of this week. Furthermore, it is imperative to emphasize that no illegal activities will be tolerated on lands owned by the Mahaweli Authority. --PMD",

        "title": "Turkey halts trade with Israel over humanitarian tragedy in Gaza",
        "date": "May 3, 2024 11:10 am",
        "content": "Turkey has suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the worsening humanitarian tragedy in the strip. The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an uninterrupted and sufficient flow of aid into Gaza. Trade between the two countries was worth almost 7bn (5.6bn) last year. Israels foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a dictator. Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements. He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. In a statement, Turkey said the trade suspension covered all products. Turkey will strictly and decisively implement these new measures until the Israeli government allows an uninterrupted and sufficient flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. But relations have worsened in recent decades. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israels maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. Relations were restored in 2016, but both countries expelled each others top diplomats two years later in a dispute over Israels killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border. Mr Erdogan has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October last year. In January, he said the military offensive that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched in response was not any less than what Hitler did. Mr Netanyahu responded: Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us. Israel has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May. On Thursday, the White House said a pier built by the US military to facilitate the flow of aid into the territory would be open within days. The US has published photos showing logistics vessels and personnel assembling the floating pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship. However, the UN says a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and that land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed. Earlier this week, Israel reopened the Erez Crossing into the northern Gaza strip for aid convoys, under pressure from its Western allies and following repeated appeals from international aid organisations. However, Jordan said some of its aid lorries were attacked by Israeli settlers before reaching the crossing. A recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine. The UNs most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, told the BBC that there was a plausible case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the groups attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that the time is now for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "May 3, 2024 01:10 pm",
        "content": "Universal Music and TikTok have ended a dispute over royalties after the label pulled millions of songs from the social media platform. The new licensing agreement means songs by some of the biggest artists in the world, including Drake, Adele and Billie Eilish will return to the site for use within the next two weeks. TikTok, a short video app, is a valuable marketing and promotional tool for music stars. But in January, Universal claimed it paid artists and songwriters a fraction of the rate offered by similar social media platforms, and announced it was pulling its catalogue. Universal is the biggest music label in the world and also looks after Taylor Swift - who allowed a selection of her songs to return to TikTok as she promoted her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, in April. Swift owns the copyrights to her recordings through her 2018 deal with Universal and can control where her songs are available, according to the Financial Times. The companies now say they have come to a new multi-dimensional licensing agreement that will deliver significant industry-leading benefits for Universals artists and labels. In a joint statement, TikTok said it would continue to invest resources into building artist-centric tools and work on strengthening online safety protections for artists and their fans. The AI issue The agreement means all videos that had been muted will be unmuted. It comes just over three months since Universal posted an open letter criticising TikTok, calling for higher payments for artists and songwriters, protection from the harmful effects of AI, and online safety. In their joint statement, the companies now say they will work together to ensure AI development across the industry will protect human artistry and the economics that flow to those artists and songwriters. They will also work to remove unauthorised AI-generated music from the platform, as well as on tools to improve artist and songwriter attribution, the statement says. Universal chairman and chief executive Sir Lucian Grainge said the new chapter focuses on the value of music, the primacy of human artistry and the welfare of the creative community, while TikTok chief executive Shou Chew added: Music is an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem, and we are pleased to have found a path forward with Universal Music Group. Concerns about AI have grown in the creative community. In April last year, a song featuring the cloned voices of Drake and The Weeknd was removed from streaming sites after going viral. On Tuesday, British singer-songwriter and producer FKA Twigs told a US Senate hearing how she had created her own digital clone - but condemned unauthorised use of her voice and image. On Wednesday, a poll by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Music found that 83 of UK adults agree that a music artists creative personality should be protected in law against AI copies and 77 believe it amounts to theft when generated music fails to acknowledge the creator of the original. In April, more than 200 artists signed an open letter objecting to the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists voices and likenesses. Source: Sky News --Agencies",

He had also expressed readiness to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. Sirisena soon received backlash with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people.

        "date": "May 3, 2024 09:43 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has dropped fifteen places and ranks 150th in the 2024 World Press Freedom Index, published annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Sri Lankas ranking was 135 out of 180 countries last year. Pakistan is ranked 152 while India is 159th this year. The index ranks 180 countries on the ability of journalists to work and report freely and independently. On Sri Lanka, the report states: Press freedom issues are closely tied to the civil war that ravaged the island until 2009, and to the still unpunished crimes of violence against many journalists when the Tamil rebellion was being crushed. With a media sector lacking diversity and highly dependent on major political clans, journalism is still in danger in this country of 22 million inhabitants. Sri Lankan law does not restrict freedom of expression, but nothing guarantees the protection of journalists, it said, adding that Parliament passed an internet regulation law in January 2024 creating the Online Safety Commission, whose members are appointed by the president. Under the guise of defending national security, it can censor the content and accounts of dissident voices on social media, and suspend the confidentiality of their sources. On the safety of journos, it said: Many media professionals were killed or disappeared during the past two decades, marked by the crushing of the separatist Tamil Tiger rebellion. No journalist has been killed since 2015, but the previous killings have gone completely unpunished. The tenth anniversary of the end of the civil war in 2019, was marked by a troubling increase in attacks on reporters based in the north and on the east coast, the traditional Tamil homeland. Journalists there are subjected to systematic surveillance and harassment by the police and army, and independent media are excluded from these areas.  In the Asia-Pacific region  the worlds second most difficult region for practising journalism  five countries are among the worlds ten most dangerous countries for media personnel: Myanmar (171st), China (172nd), North Korea (177th), Vietnam (174th) and Afghanistan (178th). In the Middle East and North Africa, the situation is very serious in nearly half of the countries. The United Arab Emirates joins the eight other countries in the red zone on the map: Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palestine, Iraq, Bahrain, Syria and Egypt. Palestine, occupied and under bombardment by the Israeli army, and the deadliest country for journalists, is also at the bottom of the Index. Qatar is now the regions only country where the situation is not classified either as difficult or very serious. The countries where press freedom is good are all in Europe, and more specifically within the European Union, which has adopted its first media freedom law (EMFA). Ireland has dropped out of the Indexs top three countries, replaced by Sweden, while Germany is now one of the top ten countries. Press freedom is nonetheless being put to the test in Hungary, Malta and Greece, the three lowest-ranked EU countries. The overall decline in the political indicator has also affected the trio at the top of the World Press Freedom Index. Norway, still in first place, has seen a fall in its political score, and Ireland (8th), where politicians have subjected media outlets to judicial intimidation, has ceded its leading position in the European Union to Denmark (2nd), followed by Sweden (3rd). --With Inputs From Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas rupee, which suffered severe depreciation because of the island nations unprecedented economic crisis since 2022, has started to make gains in comparison to other currencies, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said on Friday. He said during the first four months of the year, the Sri Lankan rupee had appreciated by 9.1 per cent against the US dollar, 12.7 per cent against the Euro, 10.8 per cent against the UK pound, 11.4 per cent against the Chinese Yuan, 21 per cent against the Yen, 9.5 per cent against the Indian rupee and 14.2 per cent against the Australian dollar. When the Sri Lankan economy slumped during the first quarter of 2022, which led to the announcement of its first-ever sovereign default, Sri Lanka was assisted by India for imports of essentials. The Sri Lankan rupee was boosted by the Reserve Bank of Indias extended currency swaps. The Indian assistance was worth over USD 4 billion which provided a lifeline to the ailing economy until the deal for an IMF bailout of USD 2.9 billion was sealed in March 2023. Siyambalapitiya on Thursday said the country has maintained strict financial discipline while taking unpopular decisions to facilitate economic recovery and continues to service its multilateral debt despite the default announced in 2022. He said USD 2.5 billion debt in 2022 and USD 2.6 billion debt in 2023 had been repaid to multilaterals such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Only the bilateral external debt payments had been suspended with the announcement of the debt default in mid-2022.

        "title": "China launches historic mission to retrieve samples from far side of the moon",
        "date": "May 4, 2024 03:24 pm",
        "content": "China on Friday launched an uncrewed spacecraft on a nearly two-month mission to retrieve rocks and soil from the far side of the moon, the first country to make such an ambitious attempt. The Long March-5, Chinas largest rocket, blasted off at 5:27 p.m. Beijing time (0927 GMT) from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan with the more than 8 metric ton Change-6 probe. Change-6 is tasked with landing in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon, which perpetually faces away from the Earth, after which it will retrieve and return samples. The launch marks another milestone in Chinas lunar and space exploration programme. It is a bit of a mystery to us how China has been able to develop such an ambitious and successful programme in such a short time, said Pierre-Yves Meslin, a French researcher working on one of the scientific objectives of the Change-6 mission. In 2018, Change-4 gave China its first unmanned moon landing, also on the far side. In 2020, Change-5 marked the first time humans retrieved lunar samples in 44 years, and Change-6 could make China the first country to retrieve samples from the moons hidden side. FOREIGN PAYLOADS The launch was attended by scientists, diplomats and space agency officials from France, Italy, Pakistan, and the European Space Agency, all of which have moon-studying payloads aboard Change-6. But no U.S. organisations applied to get a payload spot, according to Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administrations (CNSA) Lunar Exploration and Space Program. China is banned by U.S. law from any collaboration with the U.S. space agency, NASA. The far side of the moon has a mystique perhaps because we literally cant see it, we have never seen it apart from with robotic probes or the very few number of humans that have been around the other side, said Neil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at ESA working with Chinese researchers on one of the Change-6 payloads. After the probe separates from the rocket, it will take four to five days to reach the moons orbit. In early June a few weeks later, it will land. Once on the moon, the probe will spend two days digging up 2 kilogrammes (4.4 lb) of samples before returning to Earth, where it is expected to land in Inner Mongolia. The window for the probe to collect samples on the far side is 14 hours, compared to 21 hours for the near side. The samples brought back by Change-5 allowed Chinese scientists to uncover new details about the moon, including more accurately dating the timespan of volcanic activity on the moon, as well as a new mineral. Ge said the scientific value of Change-6 lay in the geological age of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, which his team estimated was about 4 billion years, much older than the samples previously brought back by the Soviet Union and the United States, which were about 3 billion years old, as well as the 2-billion-year-old samples from Change-5. LUNAR BASE Besides uncovering new information about the celestial body closest to Earth, Change-6 is part of a long-term project to build a permanent research station on the moon: the China and Russia-led International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The construction of such a station would provide an outpost for China and its partners to pursue deep space exploration. We know that the moon may have resources that could become useful in the future, so the European Space Agency, NASA, the Chinese agency and others around the world are going to the moon, said James Carpenter, head of the ESAs lunar science office. Part of the rationale is to understand those resources, Carpenter said. Wu Weiren, chief designer of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Project, speaking at the 2024 China Space Conference last month, said a basic model of the ILRS would be built by 2035.

        "date": "May 4, 2024 06:54 pm",
        "content": "Apple on Thursday posted first-quarter revenue of 90.8 billion, down 4 year over year, as the iPhone maker continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. The company also announced a 110 billion share buyback  the largest in the companys history  as iPhones sales declined 10. The drop suggests weak demand for Apples iPhone 15 lineup, which came out in September. The company reported 45.96 billion in iPhone sales for the three months ended March 31, slightly under projected estimates. Apples net income from the quarter slid to 23.6 billion, down slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The company also announced Mac sales increased 4 to 7.5 billion and a services revenue of 23.9 billion, beating analyst estimates. During an earnings call, CEO Tim Cook largely focused on the bright spots from the latest period and teased the company will be sharing more about its vision for generative AI in the weeks ahead. In addition, Apple reported iPad revenue of 5.6 billion, down 17 year over year. The news comes a few days before the company is set to host a press event where its largely expected to introduce updates to its iPad lineup and related accessories. However, the company said it expects it iPad business and services to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apples wearables, home and accessories category, which includes AirPods, the Apple Watch and Vision Pro, saw revenue of 7.91 billion, compared to an estimate of 8.28 billion, despite the launch of the Vision Pro. This marks the first earnings report since the launch of its biggest new product in years, its 3,499 mixed reality Vision Pro headset. Apple spent billions of dollars in research and development on the device, according to a recent analysis. Most recently, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted an updated forecast for the headset, stating production was being cut by several hundred thousand units. Cook said about 50 of Fortune 100 companies have purchased a Vision Pro headset to explore things not possible yet. Apple shares rose past 7 in after-hours trading following the report. Problems in China In particular, the company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have hurt Apple over the past several months. However, Cook said on the call iPhone sales are up in mainland China in the latest quarter. But Chinese manufacturers, including Huawei and Xiaomi, have also made notable gains as consumers who once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands in China. Market research firm IDC said Apples smartphone shipments tumbled a stunning 10 globally in the first quarter of this year. Its a steep drop for Apple, but if you think of where we have been in the past four years, Apple has probably been the most resilient brand, overcoming supply chain issues and macro challenges, more than other brands, said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC, told CNN at the time. However, Cook said on Thursday the company set revenue records in more than a dozen regions, including the Middle East, Canada, Spain and Turkey. The companys stock price has slumped more than 8 in 2024 to less than 170 a share after reaching nearly 200 per share at different points in the past year. The company has overcome hurdles and threats many times before to reach a market capitalization of 2.6 trillion, making it one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. All eyes on AI Cook also teased that generative-AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the near future, at a time when its currently behind competitors. We see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there, he said. Apple is largely expected to introduce AI-powered tools at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Its also reportedly in talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to power an iPhone chatbot. We will be talking about it more as we go through the weeks ahead, Cook added. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "Mexican authorities have located three bodies in the state of Baja California where one American and two Australian tourists were reported missing, the local prosecutors office said in a statement late on Friday. Australian brothers Callum, 33, and Jake Robinson, 30, and American Carter Rhoad, 30, were last seen on April 27, the Baja California state prosecutors office previously announced. It referred to the missing American as Jack Carter Rhoad. Forensic tests on the remains will be conducted by a state laboratory which will allow for positive identification of the bodies, the prosecutors office said in its statement. Investigators continue to search the rugged area where the bodies were found for additional evidence, the statement added. The three men were on vacation surfing near the popular tourist town of Ensenada, about 90 minutes south of the U.S.-Mexico border. On Thursday, state prosecutor Socorro Ibarra said that three people were being investigated in connection with the case. Her office noted on Friday that arrest warrants have been obtained for the crime of forced disappearance. Tents were found in the area where the missing men were last seen, said Ibarra, adding that they were formally reported missing days after their actual disappearance. A burnt white pickup truck was also found in the area, authorities said. Baja California is one of Mexicos most violent states, although the Ensenada area is considered safer. The U.S. State Department advises Americans to reconsider travel to the state due to crime and kidnapping. Asked about the discovery of the bodies, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said: We are aware of those reports and are closely monitoring the situation. A spokesperson for Australias foreign ministry said their embassy in Mexico was working closely with Mexican authorities and the Australian Federal Police. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recognises this is a very distressing time for the family and is in regular contact with them to provide support. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 5, 2024 01:03 pm",
        "content": "Panamanians are voting in a general election which has been overshadowed by the disqualification of the man who was leading in the polls. Ex-President Ricardo Martinelli was the favourite to win until he was banned from running after being found guilty of money laundering. His replacement on the ballot, José Raúl Mulino, is leading in the polls. Whoever wins most the votes in this round will be declared president and sworn in on 1 July. There are a total of eight candidates competing for the presidency, and voters will also choose members of Panamas national assembly. As presidents cannot serve two consecutive terms, the incumbent, Laurentino Nito Cortizo, will not stand for re-election. Opinion polls put Mr Mulino in the lead. The 64-year-old lawyer from the Realizando Metas (Achieving Goals) party was Mr Martinellis running mate. But after Mr Martinelli was sentenced to almost 11 years in prison for money laundering, Mr Mulino joined the race for president. However, Mr Mulinos candidacy has also faced legal challenges. Panamas top court was asked to decide whether the fact that Mr Mulino was not chosen by his party in the customary primary election invalidated his candidacy. On Friday, just two days before the election, the court finally ruled that his candidacy was constitutional. Mr Mulino has the backing of his former running mate, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been living in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama City since February, where he was granted political asylum. From a small room in the embassy, Martinelli has been publishing video messages in support of Mr Mulino, who served as his interior and security minister. Mr Mulino has said that if elected, he will close down the Darién Gap, the dangerous stretch of jungle on Panamas border with Colombia which hundreds of thousands of migrants cross every year on their journey north to the United States. He has not said how he would close the dangerous route but has made stopping migration an important part of his law and order proposals. A number of recent opinion polls have put Mr Mulino in the lead but with around a fifth of registered voters saying they were still undecided, his rivals are still very much in with a chance. Two of those hoping to beat Mr Mulino also are very well-known names in Panamanian politics. Martín Torrijos was president from 2004 to 2009 and is the son of Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977. The 60-year-old is campaigning under the slogan Safe Change. He has promised investment in the Panama Canal, one of the main drivers of Panamas economy. He is standing for the Peoples Party, which he joined last year after leading the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD). Rómulo Roux, 59, a former president of the Panama Canals board of directors is running for the national presidency for the second time, after losing to current President Laurentino Cortizo in 2019. The lawyer, who is standing for the Democratic Change party says that if he elected, he would implement an aggressive job creation scheme and improve public services. He has also said that he would not back the reopening of a controversial copper mine, even though he worked for the law firm which represented the mine. The closure of the mine was announced last year after mass protests shook the country. Another candidate who is trying to reach the presidency for a second time is Ricardo Lombana. The 49-year-old lawyer ran as an independent in 2019 and is standing for the Other Way Movement this time. Mr Lombana has dismissed Mr Mulinos promise to close the Darién Gap, telling Spanish news agency Efe that migration, ever since humankind exists, is not stopped by walls. He instead is proposing to improve security conditions for the migrants who cross Panama on their way north. Polls will open at 07:00 local time (12:00 GMT) and close nine hours later. Preliminary results are expected to come in soon after the polls close. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "May 5, 2024 05:46 pm",
        "content": "The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in India and Kankesanthurai (KKS) near Jaffna in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, which was launched in October 2023 by the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), will resume on May 13, 2024 tentatively, the Indian High Commission in Colombo announced. Issuing a statement, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka said the ferry service will be operated by a private operator, IndSri Ferry Services, selected by SCI in consultation with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). Meanwhile, in order to make the service affordable and attractive for passengers, the Government of India has decided to bear relevant charges and operating cost at Nagapattinam port to the tune of over LKR 25 million per month for a period of one year. Similarly, the Sri Lankan government has reduced the deviation tax currently charged to passengers leaving Sri Lanka by passenger vessels and ships, the statement added. It would be recalled that the Government of India has also extended a grant assistance of USD 63.65 million to GOSL for rehabilitation of the KKS Harbour, which was earlier envisaged to be undertaken under a Line of Credit. This is in keeping with Indias strong commitment to Sri Lankas economic recovery, and its march towards progress and prosperity, along with and in close collaboration with India, it mentioned. In addition, the Indian High Commission in Colombo stated that strengthening maritime connectivity between India and Sri Lanka was a vital component of the vision document for economic partnership jointly adopted during the visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in July 2023. The resumption of the ferry service is an affirmation of the people-centric policies of the Government of India. In his remarks during the launch of the service in October 2023, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had highlighted that connectivity is not only about bringing two cities closer but bringing countries and its people closer. He mentioned that the people of Sri Lanka will benefit from the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor launched during the G20 summit in India in September 2023, as multimodal connectivity between our two countries is strengthened, it added further. Additionally, the Indian High Commission in Colombo also communicated that in the future, connectivity with Sri Lanka will be further enhanced through electricity grid interconnection, two-way multipurpose pipeline and setting up a land connectivity economic corridor.",

        "date": "May 5, 2024 07:13 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus cabinet decided on Sunday to shut down Al Jazeeras operations in Israel for as long as the war in Gaza continues, on the grounds the Qatari television network threatens national security. Al Jazeera rejected accusations that it harmed Israels security as a dangerous and ridiculous lie that puts its journalists at risk and said that it reserved the right to pursue every legal step. The network is funded by the Qatari government and has been critical of Israels military operation in Gaza, from where it has reported around the clock throughout the war. The incitement channel Al Jazeera will be closed in Israel, Netanyahu posted on social media following the unanimous cabinet vote. A government statement said Israels communications minister signed orders to act immediately, but at least one lawmaker who supported the closure said Al Jazeera could still try to block it in court. The measure, the statement said, will include closing Al Jazeeras offices in Israel, confiscating broadcast equipment, cutting off the channel from cable and satellite companies and blocking its websites. It did not mention Al Jazeeras Gaza operations. Qatars international media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Al Jazeera previously called Israeli efforts to curtail its operations an escalation and said in a statement in early April that it comes as part of a series of systematic Israeli attacks to silence Al Jazeera. It said that Israeli authorities have deliberately targeted and killed several of its journalists including Samer Abu Daqqa and Hamza AlDahdooh, both killed in Gaza during the conflict. Israel has said it does not target journalists. Qatar established Al Jazeera in 1996 and views the network as a way to bolster its global profile. Israels parliament last month ratified a law allowing the temporary closure in Israel of foreign broadcasters considered to be a threat to national security. The background of this (shutdown) decision is not professional or journalistic ... its political, said Waleed Omari, bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The station was preparing a legal response, he said. The law allows Netanyahu and his security cabinet to shut the networks offices in Israel for 45 days, a period that can be renewed, so it could stay in force until the end of July or until the end of major military operations in Gaza. Qatar, where several Hamas political leaders are based, is trying to mediate a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could halt the Gaza war. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 6, 2024 07:55 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka have joined Scotland as the second qualifier for this years ICC Womens T20 World Cup which will be played in Bangladesh from 3 to 20 October. The experienced Sri Lanka side was given a run for their money by hosts, United Arab Emirates (UAE), in defence of their 149-run total in the do-or-die clash in the second semi-final of the ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. Sri Lanka will now play Scotland in the ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier final at the same venue on Tuesday, 7 May. Sri Lanka were put in to bat first at the toss and openers, Vishmi Gunaratne and captain, Chamari Athapaththu, delivered a sound start in the form of a 52-run partnership, brought up in 7.2 overs. Athapaththu (21) threatened to take the game away from the UAE with some big shots, including two consecutive sixes, but allowed the UAE to breathe a sigh of relief when she was dismissed by leg-spinner, Vaishnave Mahesh (233). Gunaratne then added 44 for the second wicket with Harshitha Madavi (24), the partnership was broken by Mahesh, who struck again in the 16th over. Gunaratne, who went past Kathryn Bryce as the tournaments leading run scorer during her 45-run innings (180 runs in five innings), was stumped off a wide ball by Esha Oza (227). The right-hander hit five fours in her 44-ball innings. After Gunaratnes departure, middle-order batters Hasini Perera (15), Kavisha Dilhari (17) and Nilakshi De Silva (18) hit eight boundaries between them in the death overs to take the team to a competitive, 149-run total. Oza then went on to produce one of the standout innings of the tournament as the UAE gave Sri Lanka a real fight with the bat. She lost her opening partner, Theertha Satish without scoring, in the first over of the chase. Oza then led the second-wicket partnership of 66 runs with Khushi Sharma (22). She added 37 for the third wicket with Kavisha Egodage (16) to keep her team in contention. Oza played some scintillating shots in her blazing 66 off 44, which included four big sixes as Sri Lankas bowlers searched for answers. The Islanders got the much-needed breakthrough when the right-hander was bowled out by Udeshika Prabodhani in the 16th over with the score at 108. During the course of her breathtaking innings, Oza went past Gunaratne as the tournaments highest run scorer to date, 189 runs at 47.25. The captains loss derailed the UAEs chase, the lower-order batters failing to get the required boundaries with Sri Lankas bowlers and fielders tightening the screws. The UAEs innings continued to stutter until the end of their allotted overs, where they managed 1347. Athapaththu was the best bowler of the night for Sri Lanka with two wickets for 28 in four overs. Sugandika Kumari, Inoshi Priyadharshani and Udeshika Prabodhani took a wicket each. Scores in brief: Second semi-final: Sri Lanka beat UAE by 15 runs Sri Lanka 149 for 6, 20 overs (Vishmi Gunaratne 45, Harshitha Madavi 24, Chamari Athapaththu 21; Esha Oza 2-27, Vaishnave Mahesh 2-33) UAE 134 for 7, 20 overs (Esha Oza 66, Khushi Sharma 22; Chamari Athapaththu 2-28)",

        "title": "Panamas Mulino wins presidency with support from convicted former leader",
        "date": "May 6, 2024 09:58 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Panamas former security minister Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday stormed to victory in a presidential poll dominated by his old boss, the popular ex-leader Ricardo Martinelli, who buttressed his campaign despite being holed up in Nicaraguas embassy. Mulino, 64, was one of the favorites for the presidency after he stepped in to replace Martinelli on the ballot when the former president was barred from running due to a money laundering conviction. Mission accomplished, damn it, Mulino told his supporters to loud cheers and applause. To Ricardo Martinelli, friend, mission accomplished as well. Mulino said his government would be pro-investment and pro-business and said the Central American country would honor its debts, but also vowed to not forget the poor. I promise to the country at this time to put together, to establish, a government of unity as soon as possible, Mulino told electoral officials earlier as they video called him to confirm he had won the presidency. In a strange election campaign, Martinelli played a key role drumming up support for Mulino from Nicaraguas embassy in Panamas capital, where he sought asylum. Many voters saw Mulino as a proxy for Martinelli, though opponents called him a puppet of the former president. Nicaragua granted Martinelli asylum but Panamanian authorities have blocked him from leaving the country. Mulino visited Martinelli at the embassy after casting his vote on Sunday. Mulino, a former lawyer, was declared winner having secured about 34 of the ballots tallied with over 90 of the total vote counted. Ricardo Lombana, who trailed in second place with about 25 of the vote, congratulated Mulino on his victory. DAUNTING TASK Mulino, a pro-business right-wing politician who served as interior and security minister during Martinellis administration from 2009 to 2014, faces a daunting task of mending social divisions and regaining the faith of an electorate fed up with political graft. Among his top priorities will be fixing Panamas pressing economic problems, tackling corruption, and restoring the countrys reputation as an investment haven. We know that now as president he can fix the country, said Hayde Gonzalez, 46, a medic who danced with her daughters in the center of the capital upon hearing Mulino was pulling ahead as votes were counted. There will be more security and the economy will recover, she added. Mulino has promised to usher in prosperity through ambitious infrastructure investment and a higher minimum wage, while suggesting he would keep Martinelli out of jail. Magali Rosa, 60, a retiree, said she voted for Mulino because she felt he could bring more jobs and improve security, and that during the Martinelli government there was a lot of money for everyone. Mulino will inherit the controversy surrounding a giant copper mine. The Cobre Panama mine, which accounted for about 1 of total copper supply, was ordered shut last year after a government contract with Canadian miner First Quantum was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Many Panamanians took to the streets to protest against the mine, which opponents argued lacked environmental guarantees and was riddled with corruption. Panamas next government will also have to contend with a troubled pension fund system, high levels of public debt and the loss in income from the closure of the mine, which accounted for about 5 of gross domestic product. Corruption has become a hot-button issue for voters. Local media has recently reported on generous student loans and scholarships granted to the children of politicians and wealthy, high-profile families. After a record 520,000 migrants last year crossed the treacherous jungle that connects Panama and Colombia, known as the Darien Gap, migration is also on voters minds. Some candidates have vowed to open up the path, which could increase migration flows into Panama, while others want to boost controls to shut it down completely. The next administration will also inherit problems faced by the Panama Canal, which saw revenues tumble after it was forced to cut ship crossings due to a prolonged drought. Mulino will take office on July 1 for a five-year term. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 6, 2024 12:55 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles says that action will be taken against the person who had caused a disturbance recently in the visa issuance section at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. The minister said that action will also be taken against the officers who had recorded the incident in question. Minister Alles revealed this during a special press conference held today (06) in relation to the recent controversial issue concerning the issuance of On-Arrival Visas at the BIA in Katunayake. The Minister explained that the proposal regarding the new visa system was unanimously passed in Parliament without a debate on November 23, 2023. He stated that the issue of visa fees was also part of the adopted proposal, and that even though it was passed in November, it was not possible to implement the change through the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system and therefore they had to wait until April 17 to implement it through the VFS system. The Minister further stated that due to the issues with ETA system, they had proceeded with changing the system. He further said: The talk was only about the USD 75, which means a 6-month visa, a double entry visa. But there was a small mistake on our end. Our 50-day visa was USD 30. Once we passed this, we couldnt include it in the system, and therefore we had to go back to the Parliament. We cannot publish a gazette without approving it in the parliament. Before leaving the country, I passed the 50-day visa along with the resident visa. It will be in the system from tomorrow onwards. For 30 days single entry visa is USD 50. We had received a proposal regarding the VFS. Everyone who travels overseas knows what VFS is. It is a company used by 67 governments, at around 3,300 centres in 151 countries. There is no one to compete with that service. They are the worlds number one in that. Every country in the world uses VFS. One accusation that was made is that this is an Indian company and that Indians were handling the visa counters. I looked into this. VFS is not an Indian company. Black Stone is their major shareholder. VFS will issue a statement today mentioning who they are and what they are doing in Sri Lanka. This issue started on May 01. On that day, only Sri Lankans were in the counter and there were no Indians. I have the list of names with me. Thirteen of them are Sri Lankans. The person who was shouting claims they are Indians. VFS cannot issue visas nor can they reject them. Only the Department of Immigration and Emigration can do that. What VFS does is only check the documents.",

        "content": "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila claims that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) had increased the salaries of its employees by the biggest margin in its history, despite having recorded losses of billions of rupees for two consecutive years. The net loss of Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2023 is Rs. 114 billion. In 2022, the net loss is Rs. 374 billion. If a certain institute incurs losses continuously, the privileges of the institution, bonuses and salary increments will be limited and suspended, he said, speaking to reports in Colombo today (06). However, the former minister charged that despite having continuously incurred great losses for several years, the Central Bank is giving its employees the highest salary hikes. Even if its profitable, its still public money. Gammanpila stated that one method that the Central Bank can make profit is by providing the government and banks with credit and collecting the interest. This is possible for the Central Bank because it has sole authority for printing money, he said. Meanwhile, the profit obtained from the management of governments official foreign exchange reserves is also a source of income for the Central Bank. That means the funds held by the Central Bank are public money, he asserted. Therefore, he called for the immediate resignation of the Governor of and the Governing Board of the Central Bank for deceiving the country and for claiming that the central bank is not maintained with the peoples money.",
