        "content": "(Reuters) - Japan, France and India will announce a new platform for creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Wednesday, adding it would be very nice if China were to join the effort. As chair of this years Group of Seven (G7) meeting, Japan has put efforts to address debt vulnerabilities of middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka as among priorities for debate. The announcement of the new platform, initiated by Japan, France and G20 chair India, will be made on Thursday, Suzuki said in a news conference after the G7 finance leaders meeting. The platform will likely consist of a series of meetings of the creditor nations to discuss the debt. We altogether made a great effort to set up the framework, Suzuki said. I hope many countries will participate. It will be very nice if China will join, Suzuki said. Sri Lanka last month secured a 2.9 billion programme from the International Monetary Fund to tackle its suffocating debt burden and its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades, which has disrupted imports of essentials from fuel to medicine and caused political turmoil.

        "title": "Horrific Myanmar junta airstrike kills over 100",
        "date": "April 13, 2023 09:41 am",
        "content": "Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in a military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after one of the deadliest attacks since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago. An eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike  of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground. At least 133 people, including women and children, were killed after Myanmars military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, the human rights minister of the ousted shadow National Unity Government Aung Myo Min told CNN. First responders and medical teams havent been able to return to the site of the attack because military planes have continued flying over the town, though there have been no further strikes, said Aung Myo Min. At least 20 children were killed in the strike and 50 people injured, according to the Kyunhla activist group, which was at the scene. About 300 people had gathered in Pazigyi Village early on Tuesday morning to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, an eyewitness told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. Families had traveled from nearby villages for the event, where tea and food was offered and which coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations. Like much of Sagaing, the area is not under the control of the military junta. The new town office was being opened under the authority of the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), for the people, as part of the anti-junta resistance. We didnt have any warning, the eyewitness said. Most of the villagers were inside the event, so they didnt notice the jet. Just before 8 a.m., a junta aircraft bombed the village where the ceremony was being held, the eyewitness and local media reported. An Mi35 helicopter then circled and fired on the village minutes later, the eyewitness told CNN. When I arrived at the scene we tried to search for people still alive, he said. Everything was terrible. People were dying (as they were being transported) on motorbikes. Children and women. Some lost their heads, limbs, hands. I saw flesh on the road. The eyewitness said he saw dozens of bodies after the attack, including children as young as five. He said he lost four family members in the strike, and a young child from his village was among the dead. I saw lots of people coming onto the scene to search for their kids, crying and screaming, he said. At around 5:30 p.m. the junta jets returned and shot the same place they had bombed that morning, he said. CNN cannot independently verify the incident but the eyewitnesss account matches reports in local media and from the NUG. Videos and images from the aftermath, shown to CNN from witnesses and a local activist group, also show bodies, some burned and in pieces, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris. Myanmars junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun confirmed the airstrike on Pazigyi Village and said if civilian casualties occurred it was because they were forced to help terrorists. The junta has designated the NUG and resistance groups known as the Peoples Defense Force in the country as terrorists. At 8 a.m. NUG (National Unity Government) and PDF (Peoples Defense Force) conducted an opening ceremony of the public administration office at Pazigyi village, Zaw Min Tun said on the militarys Myawaddy TV channel. We had launched the attack on them. We were informed that PDF were killed at that event under the attack. They are opposing our government. The strike was condemned internationally, with one top UN official saying global indifference to the situation in Myanmar contributed to the attack. The Myanmar militarys attacks against innocent people, including todays airstrike in Sagaing, is enabled by world indifference and those supplying them with weapons, said Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar. How many Myanmar children need to die before world leaders take strong, coordinated action to stop this carnage? The US Department of State said it was deeply concerned about the airstrikes and called on the regime to cease the horrific violence. These violent attacks further underscore the regimes disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup, it said, using an alternative name for Myanmar. Its been just over two years since the military seized power, ousting the democratically elected government and jailing its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In order to crush resistance, the junta regularly carries out airstrikes and ground attacks on what it calls terrorist targets. The attacks have killed civilians, including children, and targeted schools, clinics, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Whole villages have been burned by junta soldiers and thousands of people have been displaced in the attacks, according to local monitoring groups. Battles between the military and resistance groups unfold daily across Myanmar. These rebel groups, some of whom have aligned with some of the countrys long-established ethnic militias, effectively control parts of the country out of the juntas reach. Resistance groups and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly accused Myanmars military of carrying out mass killings, air strikes and war crimes against civilians in the regions where fighting has raged, charges the junta repeatedly denies  despite a growing body of evidence. Theyre losing control of the country. Theyre losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than theyve ever been, the UNs Andrews told CNN on Wednesday. As a result of that, theyre using air power more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed. On Monday, junta airstrikes hit a town in western Chin states Falam Township, killing nine people when bombs dropped on a school, according to local media Myanmar Now and The Irrawaddy. Last week, 8,000 refugees in southern Karen state fled across the border to Thailand, escaping fighting in Myawaddy township, according to a statement from Thailands Tak provincial office public relations department, posted to Facebook. In March, at least 22 people, including three monks, were killed at a monastery in southern Shan state. And a military airstrike on a school in Sagaing in September killed at least 13 people, including seven children. The eyewitness to Tuesdays attack said the situation in Myanmar is worse now. People are dying like dogs or cows. We dont have any weapons to compare with what the military has. We need the help of the international community, he said. Source  CNN - Agencies",

The prime minister said Bangladesh attaches high priority to its relations with its neighbours, particularly with Sri Lanka, which are based on historical bonds and a multitude of commonalities. She said Bangladesh emphasizes maintaining good relations with its neighbours, including Sri Lanka. Sheikh Hasina said 90 of the development programs of Bangladesh are funded by domestic resources. She mentioned that the development pace in the country was hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Bangladesh is working hard to recover from this setback, the spokesperson quoted the prime minister as saying.

        "date": "April 13, 2023 07:40 pm",
        "content": "Several environmental organizations and animal rights groups have raised deep concerns about the Sri Lankan governments decision to export up to 100,000 monkeys (Toque macaque) to China. Earlier this week, the Agriculture Ministry revealed that a Chinese delegation has made a request from the Sri Lankan government to provide toque macaques for zoos in China. The ministry said there is a high demand for toque macaques in China and that exporting the monkeys, which were recently removed from the list of protected species on the island, may help control the increasing monkey population. A special meeting was held on Wednesday to discuss exporting 100,000 toque macaques to China. The discussion was chaired by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, ministerial officials and the Department of National Zoological Gardens, and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. It was also decided to appoint a committee to look into the matter and study the related legal procedures. The toque macaque is endemic to Sri Lanka and common on the island but is classed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Sri Lanka removed several species including all three monkey species in the country  namely tufted gray langur, purple-faced leaf monkey and toque macaque  from the protected list, taking into account the fact that monkeys have become a menace as they constantly damage the crops and forage the villages for food. This allows farmers to kill the animals which are not listed as protected. However, conservationists took issue with the decision to export toque macaques, saying that they are sceptical that these animals are planned to be used for experiments in China as toque macaques show high genetic similarity to humans. Toque macaques are officially estimated to number between 2-3 million in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "The Government of Sri Lanka and a leading business enterprise in Japan, Pasona Group have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) pertaining to several factors, including employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in Japan. Accordingly, the MoU was signed between Sri Lankas Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment and the Pasona Group regarding job opportunities for Sri Lankan nationals in Japan, human resource development, bringing Japanese investments to Sri Lanka and promoting tourism. The MoU was signed at the Wave Riding Festival theater in Awaji Island during the official visit of Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara to Japan. According to this agreement, the Pasona Group will provide its support for the Japanese companies who wish to recruit Sri Lankan workers for employment opportunities. In addition, the Pasona Group will also provide the necessary support required for Sri Lankans seeking employment in Japan, and will hold investment conferences and investment consultations to attract Japanese investors to Sri Lanka. Programmes aimed to improve the skills and training of professionals employed in the tourism sector will also be implemented as part of the MoU, in a bid to promote Sri Lankas tourism industry. A programme targetted at attracting more Japanese tourists to Sri Lanka is also due to be implemented, as per a statement issued by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment. Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, who spoke at the signing of the MoU, said that Sri Lanka is facing the worst economic crisis since independence, and is currently working to build a stable country under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The minister stated that this crisis is a crucial turning point in the history of the country and necessary policy reforms are currently being carried out to prevent such crises from occurring again. In order to develop an efficient workforce, the minister said that by studying the best practices around the world including Japan, the workers will be given the opportunity to do flexible, part-time and multiple jobs. The Minister stated that joining forces with the Pasona Group, a leader in human resources in Japan, is a historic day for Sri Lanka and that this partnership will bring mutual benefits to both countries in various fields.

        "content": "Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Krishna Srinivasan has stated that the debt relief Sri Lanka currently awaits is expected to contribute USD 17 billion to close the Balance of Payments (BOP) financing gap from 2023  2027. Speaking at the World Bank Group and IMF Spring Meetings, Srinivasan stated the IMF aims to restore debt sustainability and the BOP pressures even after the programme ends. Thus, he explained that while the debt relief programme will cover nearly USD 17 billion of Sri Lankas USD 24 billion financing gap, the rest of the funds are expected to be covered by International Financial Institutions (IFIs). He noted, however, that the process according to which the restructuring will happen, or how the required relief will be provided, must be negotiated between Sri Lanka and its creditors, stating that the IMF does not get involved in this process. He explained that Sri Lanka will be required to negotiate the matter with its creditors, and the form in which the debt relief will be provided, including principle haircuts, extension of maturity and interest reductions. Sri Lanka is expected to outline a blueprint later this month, which will provide a basis for engaging with their creditors pertaining to the debt restructuring process.",

        "date": "April 14, 2023 05:03 am",
        "content": "Japan, India and France on Thursday announced a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt, a move they hope would serve as a model for solving the debt woes of middle-income economies. It remains uncertain, however, whether Sri Lankas biggest bilateral creditor  China  will join the initiative launched by Japan, this years G7 chair, with the aim of kicking off a series of meetings among Sri Lankas creditors. To be able to launch this negotiation process gathering such a broad-based group of creditors is a historical outcome, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told a briefing. This committee is open to all creditors, he said. He also said that Japan is searching for ways to resolve Sri Lankas debt problems and to support the proper implementation of the IMF program and reforms. Addressing the launch of the debt restructuring process on Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said it marks the beginning of the bilateral creditor nations to make swift progress in resolving Sri Lankas debt distress. He said Sri Lanka remains committed to continue to engage with all creditor nations and other stakeholders in a transparent manner based on the principles of comparable treatment. Wickremesinghe invited all of Sri Lankas creditors to join the creditors meeting led by Japan, India and France. Close coordination between Sri Lanka and all its creditors will be critical to expediting a debt treatment that will restore debt sustainability in Sri Lanka, Indias Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at the launch event. Deputy Managing Director of IMF Kenji Okamura says an expeditious debt resolution is needed for Sri Lanka to emerge as quickly as possible from its crisis and expressed hope all bilateral creditors would participate in negotiations and complete them before the first review. French Director General of the Treasury Emmanuel Moulin told the briefing that the group was ready to hold the first round of talks as soon as possible. Sri Lankas central bank governor had told Reuters earlier this week that having a single platform for talks would be a welcome move that would make it easier to discuss and share information. The island nation of 22 million people last month secured a 2.9 billion program from the International Monetary Fund to tackle its huge debt burden. But the middle-income economy could not apply for relief under the G20s common framework for debt treatments, which targets only low-income countries. That has put the onus on major economies to come up with an alternative scheme, leading to the creation of the new platform. Sri Lanka owes 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, according to official data from its government, with 3 billion owed to China, followed by 2.4 billion to the Paris Club and 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and 2.7 billion on other commercial loans. Sri Lanka kicked off talks to rework part of its domestic debt this month and aims to finalize the deal by May. --With Agencies Inputs Source: Reuters",

Recalling that Sri Lankans partook in the New Year rituals even amidst the unprecedented economic crisis, which exacerbated last year and disrupted the day-to-day lives of the people, the Head of State said he is gratified to have commenced this year with a salubrious environment. Wickremesinghe is confident that Sri Lanka is capable of achieving affluence and prosperity by moving forward as one nation. The President noted that a fresh beginning is imperative to create a brighter future for Sri Lanka despite the differences in political affiliation, ethnicity and religion. Read President Wickremesinghes full message for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year: The dawn of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year subsequent to the transition of the Sun from the house of Pisces to Aries, is considered an extremely momentous occasion by the Sinhala and Tamil communities in the country. On this propitious celebration, people traditionally engage in observing New Year customs at stipulated auspicious times, with the wish of securing abundant prosperity. Last year, amidst the unprecedented economic crisis which disrupted our daily lives, we partook in the New Year rituals with untold hardship and were confined to a struggle in alleviating this adversity. However, I am gratified that the commencement of this year has presented a salubrious environment for us all, and therefore we should strive to be more affluent and prosperous, than today. We can undoubtedly achieve this aspiration by unitedly moving forward as one Sri Lankan nation. Accordingly, despite differences in political affiliation, ethnicity and religion, a fresh beginning is imperative to create a brighter future for us and our nation, in this New Year.

        "title": "IMF urges Asia to keep monetary policy tighter for longer",
        "date": "April 14, 2023 09:25 am",
        "content": "Asian central banks may need to keep monetary policy tighter for longer to combat still substantial inflation risks, senior International Monetary Fund official Krishna Srinivasan said on Thursday. Some central banks in the region, such as Australia, have begun pausing interest rate hikes as they saw their economies and job growth moderate from the impact of global headwinds and past monetary tightening. Core inflation remains sticky and has become a more important driver of headline inflation recently, which may lead to more persistent inflation and wage pressure, said Srinivasan, director of the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department. Output gaps for Asian economies are either closing or already closed, and currency depreciation last year is still passing through to domestic prices. These factors suggest that the battle to contain inflation is not yet over, he said. While the global outlook remains somber, Chinas reopening will underpin Asias economy through an increase in trade and consumption, Srinivasan told a news conference on Thursday. The IMF expects growth in the Asia-Pacific regions economy at 4.6 this year, up 0.3 point from its October forecast and faster than a 3.8 rise in 2022. The latest forecast implies the region will contribute over 70 of global growth this year, Srinivasan said. The IMF expects Chinas economy to expand by 5.2 in 2023, higher than the previous years 3.0 growth. Chinas reopened economy is rebounding strongly, and this will generate positive spillovers to its trading partners, providing fresh momentum for Asias growth, he said. The U.S. and European banking-sector woes have added to uncertainty over the global economic outlook, drawing a warning from the IMF that lurking financial system vulnerabilities could erupt into a new crisis and slam global growth this year. The impact of the recent global banking stress on Asia has been limited so far, with direct exposures of Asian banks and investors to Silicon Valley Bank minimal, Srinivasan said. Unless strains increase and raise broad-based stability concerns, central banks should separate monetary policy objectives from financial stability goals, he said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "US National Guard airman arrested over leaked Pentagon documents",
        "date": "April 14, 2023 11:17 am",
        "content": "A member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard was arrested by the FBI on Thursday in connection with the leaking of classified documents that have been posted online, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Thursday. The arrest of Jack Teixeira, 21, comes following a fast-moving search by the US government for the identity of the leaker who posted classified documents to a social media platform popular with video gamers. Teixeira was arrested in Massachusetts without incident, Garland said, and will be arraigned in federal court there. This investigation is ongoing. We will share more information at the appropriate time, the attorney general said, declining to answer questions. Teixeira will first appear in court on Friday in Boston, according to the US attorneys office there. The FBI said in a statement that it took Teixeira into custody at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts, for his alleged involvement in leaking classified U.S. government and military documents. The FBI is continuing to conduct authorized law enforcement activity at the residence, the agency said. Since late last week the FBI has aggressively pursued investigative leads, and todays arrest exemplifies our continued commitment to identifying, pursuing, and holding accountable those who betray our countrys trust and put our national security at risk. The leaked documents posted to social media, some of which have been obtained by CNN, included detailed intelligence assessments of allies and adversaries alike, including on the state of the war in Ukraine and the challenges Kyiv and Moscow face as the war appears stuck in a stalemate. Multiple US officials told CNN that Teixeira is believed to be the leader of the group where a trove of classified documents had been posted. The search for the suspect began with thousands of people who had access to the documents, but investigators were able to quickly narrow the search to potential members of the chat group with evidence collected in the days immediately following the discovery of classified documents online by US officials. While theres a large number of people who had access to the documents, investigators were able to home in on a small number for closer scrutiny thanks to the forensic trail left by the person who posted the documents. Teixeira was under surveillance for at least a couple of days prior to his arrest by the FBI on Thursday, according to a US government source familiar with the case. Earlier Thursday, President Joe Biden appeared to suggest that the US government was close to identifying the leaker. Biden was then briefed on the arrest in between his speech to parliament and his departure for a banquet dinner in his honor at Dublin Castle, according to a US official. He was at the hotel for roughly 90 minutes in between the two events. Biden has been regularly briefed on the investigation, officials said, as well as the efforts by his top officials to engage with allies who have been identified within, or unsettled by, the content of the leaked information, according to one of the officials. Behind the scenes, it has been a reality that has loomed over a deeply personal and important foreign trip for Biden, one official acknowledged. Joined Air National Guard in 2019 The Air Force released service details for Teixeira, an Airman 1st Class. Teixeira is an enlisted airman at the Massachusetts Air National Guard, according to details from his service record released by the Air Force Thursday. He joined the service in September 2019 and his official job is Cyber Transport Systems journeyman. According to the Air Force, Cyber Transport Systems specialists are tasked with making sure the services vast, global communications network is operating properly. On Wednesday, The Washington Post first reported that the person behind the leak worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. The leaker was described in the Post story as a lonely young man and gun enthusiast who was part of a chatroom of about two dozen people on Discord  a social media platform popular with video gamers  that shared a love of guns and military gear, according to a friend of the alleged leaker the Post interviewed who was also part of the group. Several former high school classmates of Teixeiras told CNN Thursday that he had a fascination with the military, guns and war. He would sometimes wear camouflage to school, carried a dictionary-sized book on guns, and behaved in a way that made some fellow students feel uneasy. A lot of people were wary of him, said Brooke Cleathero, who attended middle school and high school with Teixeira. He was more of a loner, and having a fascination with war and guns made him off-putting to a lot of people. John Powell, who also attended middle school and high school with Teixeira, said he recalled him as a pleasant and quiet kid who was sometimes picked on. He didnt have many friends, he said. Teixeira grew up in the suburbs of Providence, Rhode Island, according to public records. He attended Dighton-Rehoboth High School where he graduated in 2020, according to the superintendent of the regional school district. Powell recalled Teixeira occasionally toting around a textbook on military vehicles  tanks, planes and submarines  and having a fascination with anything military related from an early age. He was dead set on joining some branch of the military, even as a kid, he said. Other students, who asked not to be identified, said they detected a more menacing vibe from Teixeira, who some recalled making comments they perceived as racist or mumbling derogatory things about people under his breath. One student recalled him showing up for school wearing a shirt with an AR-15 on it the day after a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017. Teixeira didnt behave in a manner that rose to the level where people felt the need to report him, another former classmate said, but he made me nervous. The same student said she took his fascination with the military as a form of American nationalism, and was therefore surprised by the allegations against him. I didnt think he would be capable of doing something like this, she said. On Thursday, Biden said he was concerned about the fact the leaks happened, but not necessarily about their content. Im not concerned about the leak. Im concerned that it happened, but theres nothing contemporaneous that Im aware of that is of any consequence. Pentagon tightening access to classified intelligence The Pentagon has begun to limit who across the government receives its highly classified daily intelligence briefs following the leak. Some US officials who used to receive the briefing materials daily have stopped receiving them in recent days, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, as the Pentagons Joint Staff continues to whittle down its distribution lists. The Joint Staff, which comprises the Defense Departments most senior uniformed leadership that advises the president, began examining its distribution lists immediately after learning of the trove of leaked classified documents  many of which had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staffs intelligence arm, known as the J2. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that he is directing the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to review intelligence access, following the arrest of the Air National Guardsman. As Secretary of Defense, I will also not hesitate to take any additional measures necessary to safeguard our nations secrets, Austin said. Accordingly, I am directing the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to conduct a review of our intelligence access, accountability and control procedures within the Department to inform our efforts to prevent this kind of incident from happening again. Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder confirmed Thursday that the Defense Department is taking steps to tighten the community of people who receive classified intelligence. Ryder said the Pentagon continues to review a variety of factors as it relates to safeguarding classified materials. This includes examining and updating distribution lists, assessing how and where intelligence products are shared, and a variety of other steps. Ryder also emphasized that there are already stringent guidelines in place to safeguard classified intelligence. This was a deliberate criminal act, he said, a violation of those guidelines. The criminal investigation is being led by the FBIs Washington field office, including a team of counterintelligence investigators experienced in hunting leaks. Those investigators are also working with Pentagon officials on the damage assessment, which would become part of the evidence to be used in any potential prosecution that results.

        "title": "North Korea says it tested most powerful missile to date",
        "date": "April 14, 2023 07:25 pm",
        "content": "North Korea says it tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile - its most powerful missile to date. State media hailed Thursdays launch, which led to a brief evacuation order in Japan, a miraculous success. Solid-fuel missiles can be fired more quickly than liquid-fuel ones, making them harder to intercept. But analysts say they are not without downsides. South Korea maintains that the North will need more time to develop a fully operational solid-fuel ICBM. This is the first time the North has test-fired a solid-fuel ICBM after years of testing solid-fuel short-range missiles. It has tested various ICBMs, but these were powered by liquid propellants, which must be fuelled directly ahead of launch - a process that can take hours. Experts describe this is a breakthrough in Pyongyangs weapons programme, as solid-fuel ICBMs come ready-fuelled, and would therefore enable North Korea to strike the US with far less warning. South Koreas Defence Ministry on Friday said the technology is not new, and described North Koreas test on Thursday as a middle step in developing a full-fledged solid-fuel ICBM system. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who supervised the test with his daughter, wife, and sister, reportedly said the test would make rivals suffer from extreme fear and anxiety. He also said the test-fired weapon, known as the Hwasong-18, supports the Norths aggressive military strategy. Thursday mornings launch was primarily aimed at confirming the performance of the high-thrust solid-propellant multistage motors, the stage separation technology and the reliability of various functional control systems, the states Korean Central News Agency said in its report on Friday. The launch sparked confusion in northern Japan, where an evacuation order was issued and then retracted within 30 minutes. Schools in Japans Hokkaido island delayed their start times and some train services were suspended. Authorities in Japan, South Korea and the US strongly condemned the move, which comes days after Mr Kim reportedly ordered his military to adopt a more practical and offensive manner in war deterrence. Analysts said the Norths launch of a new, more powerful weapon did not come as a surprise. Given that North Korea has been testing large diameter solid rocket motors for the Pukguksong-series (a range of medium-range missiles, including submarine-launched missiles) for several years, its been clear that since 2020, a test like this could have come at any time, says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies in California. Long-range solid fuel missiles may be operationally superior to their liquid counterparts, but are harder to maintain and store, says Ankit Panda, a nuclear weapons specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. They are more sensitive to humidity, temperature and physical stress, and may degrade over years in storage. This is an important week for North Korea as it celebrates Mr Kims 11th year in power - the country tends to mark these anniversaries with displays of military progress. North Korea has been working to increase its nuclear arsenal and build ever-more sophisticated weapons. It has also criticised joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, accusing them of escalating tensions. The latest missile launch also comes two days before the birthday of North Koreas founding leader Kim Il Sung - the biggest annual holiday on the countrys calendar. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "April 14, 2023 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Japanese officials have approved controversial plans to build the countrys first gambling resort. The complex will open in the western city of Osaka in 2029. Casinos have long been illegal in Japan. But a law was passed in 2018 providing exceptions to games, such as poker or baccarat, to create jobs and boost tourism. Public opinion has been split, with some concerned about a rise in crime and gambling addiction. Besides the casino, the 5.3 million square-foot (49ha) complex will include a hotel, conference centre, shopping mall and museum. We hope (the casino) will become a tourism base that promotes Japans charms to the world, according to Prime Minster Fumio Kishida. The project has an initial investment of 1.8tn yen (13.5bn, 10.7bn) with US-based casino operator MGM and Japans Orix Group each owning a 40 stake in the company. The other 20 will be owned by local companies such as West Japan Rail, Kansai Electric Power and Osaka-based Panasonic. Officials expect the resort to attract around 20 million visitors annually and bring in roughly 1tn yen in annual economic benefits to the region, according to a Japanese news service. The project was proposed years ago, but it was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a corruption scandal involving a ruling-party lawmaker who was accused of accepting bribes while in charge of casino policy. Japan is seen a promising market for gambling. It is the worlds third largest economy with a population of roughly 126 million. It also has close proximity to wealthy Asian gamblers, particularly from China. Macau is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal. A similar plan has been submitted by the Nagasaki prefecture to build a casino at Huis Ten Bosch, a Dutch-themed theme park. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 14, 2023 11:57 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans debt continues to be sustainable, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, after the government reiterated it had completed all requirements to receive a critical bailout from the IMF. Pakistan has less than a months worth of foreign exchange reserves and is awaiting a bailout package of 1.1 billion from the IMF that has been delayed since November over issues related to fiscal policy adjustments. The funds, which can only be released after signing a staff level agreement (SLA), are part of a 6.5 billion bailout package the IMF approved in 2019, which analysts say is critical for Pakistan to avert defaulting on external payment obligations. Pakistans finance ministry on Thursday said IMF deputy managing director Antoinette Moniso Sayeh was confident of signing the staff level agreement very soon. Asked what Pakistan needed to do to avoid reaching the unsustainable debt positions faced by countries like Sri Lanka, Georgieva said: We are not there yet, and it is better not to get there. She said the lender has been working very hard with the authorities in Pakistan within the context of the current programme to make sure the country has the policy framework in place to prevent reaching the point of unsustainable debt. My hope is that with the goodwill of everyone, and the implementation of what has been already agreed by the Pakistan authorities, we can complete our current programme successfully, Georgieva told reporters at a briefing in Washington. The fund is also in talks asking friendly countries of Pakistan to provide financial assurances so it can complete the programme, she said. Pakistan is required to give an assurance that its balance of payments deficit is fully financed for the fiscal year ending in June to unlock the next tranche of IMF funding. Pakistans government reiterated on Thursday it has completed all requirements to receive the critical bailout money from the fund following a meeting with Sayeh. The finance minister also shared that all the international obligations have been addressed in time, the finance ministry said in a news release. On Wednesday, Pakistans finance ministry release a statement following talks with the IMFs Middle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour. Mr. Jihad Azour expressed confidence that SLA expected to be signed soon which to be followed by the Boards approval for the 9th Review, the ministry said in a tweet. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The Sri Lankan citizen, who was travelling on a fake passport, and the German native exchanged their boarding passes in a toilet at the airport for travelling to London and Kathmandu. The matter came to light after an official of an airline company noticed that the departure stamp on the passport of the Sri Lankan citizen appeared to be forged.

A loud explosion was heard, but the premier took cover and was unharmed while police subdued a man at the scene, public broadcaster NHK said. There were no injuries, NHK said, citing police. Police are investigating the details of the loud explosive sound at the previous speech venue, Kishida said when he resumed his campaign speeches, in video broadcast by NHK. I am sorry for causing many people to be concerned. We are in the middle of an important election for our country. We must carry this on together. The incident echoed the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving leader of modern Japan, who was shot with a homemade gun last July while campaigning for a parliamentary election. Abes killing shocked the nation, where gun crimes are exceedingly rare, and prompted a review of security for politicians, who routinely press the flesh with the public. By-elections in various regions for the lower house of Japans parliament are to be held on April 23. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said police have been instructed to boost security, and that the government will do what is necessary to ensure security at the upcoming Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima. Matsuno said the government would wait for results from the police investigation before commenting on a potential motive from the suspect. The incident late on Saturday morning occurred at the Saikazaki fishing harbour in Wakayama prefecture, some 65 km (40 miles) southwest of Osaka city. PIPE THROWN Kishida was being served local speciality seafood just before the explosion, media reported. News video showed Kishida looking behind him in surprise as shouts filled the area. A man identified by the Asahi newspaper as a staffer of the fishery cooperative grabbed a young man in a headlock as police swarmed the suspect and dragged him to the ground. Moments later, an explosion and cloud of smoke could be seen near where Kishida had been standing. NHK footage showed crowds running away as several police officers appeared to pin a man to the ground before removing him from the scene. A 20-30 cm (7.8 to 11.8 inch) metal pipe was thrown and landed close to where Kishida was standing, NHK reported, citing an official at the scene. A representative of Wakayamas prefectural police headquarters told Reuters he could not answer questions about the incident. Police arrested a 24-year old male suspect from Kawanishi city with the family name of Kimura, who so far has remained silent, Kyodo said, citing investigators. A woman on the scene told NHK that she saw an object flying overhead and it gave me a bad feeling, so we ran away unbelievably fast. Then we heard a really loud noise. It made my daughter cry. Kishida is to host a G7 summit in Hiroshima next month. Japans foreign ministry said after the incident on Saturday, there would be no change to the security plan for a G7 foreign ministers meeting starting on Sunday in the resort city of Karuizawa.

On Thursday (April 13), Japan, India and France held a press briefing to announce a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to coordinate the restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. The three creditor countries have been working closely for a coordinated debt restructuring process for the island nation. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to its bilateral creditors out of which USD 3 billion owed to China  its biggest bilateral lender, USD 2.4 billion to the Paris Club and USD 1.6 billion to India.",

        "date": "April 15, 2023 06:54 pm",
        "content": "Thirteen persons, including at least five minors, were killed and 29 others injured after a bus carrying young male and female members of a traditional music troupe fell into a gorge on the old Mumbai-Pune highway in Raigad district of Maharashtra early on Saturday, police said. The private bus with 42 persons on board was going from Pune to Mumbai when it plunged into the 300-feet deep gorge in the Bor Ghat mountain pass section, better known as Khandala Ghat, around 4.50 am. The accident occurred near Khopoli town in the district, around 70 km from Mumbai, a senior police official said. According to police, the dead included a six-year-old boy and a girl aged 15, while of the total number of injured, at least six are minors. Most of the music troupe members were in their twenties or teenagers, who were heading back to Mumbai after taking part in an event in Pimpri Chinchwad near Pune city. Expressing grief over the incident, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced compensation of  five lakh to the relatives of each victim. He said the condition of five of the injured is critical. Union Home Minister Amit Shah expressed sorrow and spoke to CM Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis about the accident. The bus was carrying 42 members of Baji Prabhu Zanj Pathak based in Mumbais Goregaon. They were returning to Goregaon after taking part in an event in Pimpri Chinchwad area in Pune district. The bus, which had left the venue around 1 am on Saturday, fell into the gorge on the highway near Shingroba temple after its driver lost control, the police official said, adding that 13 of them died in the incident, which left 29 others injured. On learning about the incident, a team of the local police, volunteers of Yashwanti Hikers group from Khopoli and some personnel of IRB company rushed to the spot and launched a rescue operation, the police said. The injured were admitted to three different hospitals - the Mahatma Gandhi Mission (MGM) Hospital at Kamothe in Navi Mumbai, a government hospital in Khopoli and a private facility there, they said. The dead and the injured were from Goregaon and Sion in Mumbai and Virar in neighbouring Palghar district, Raigad Superintendent of Police (SP) Somnath Gharge said. In a tweet in Hindi, Union minister Shah said, The road accident in Raigad, Maharashtra is very sad. Talked to Chief Minister mieknathshinde and Deputy Chief Minister Dev_Fadnavis in this regard. The local administration is engaged in relief work. I express my condolences to the families of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery. CM Shinde visited the MGM Hospital in Navi Mumbai to enquire about the health of the injured. After that, he also visited the accident site. Of the total injured persons, the condition of five is critical. I have instructed the doctors to provide the best possible treatment to save their lives, he said. Deepak Sawant, who lost his 18-year-old daughter Jui, in the accident, said he had spoken to her when she reached Pune safely for the event. While leaving for Pune, Jui told me she will telephone me when she reaches the city, which she did. That was my last conversation with my daughter, said a distraught Mr Sawant, who is employed as a security guard. Jui had just appeared for her Class 11 examination, he said. Among the dead were brothers Satish and Swapnil Dhumal, who had left Mumbai on Friday to attend the event and boarded the bus in Pune in the early hours of the day. We were college students and associated with the troupe. I was asleep when we were informed about the accident. We immediately rushed to Khopoli and identified Swapnils body, said Ganesh Bhole, a friend and neighbour of the brothers. One of the rescuers at the scene, Khopoli-resident Dr Riyaz Pathan, said he received a phone call from a fellow medical practitioner about the accident. After reaching the spot, we managed to bring out 10 to 15 passengers, one of them dead, he said. He claimed there were no safety railings at the spot, adding that their presence may have averted the accident. Source  NDTV - Agencies",

        "date": "April 15, 2023 08:20 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is looking to enter new agreements with Oman to consolidate bilateral collaboration after a recent round of political consultations with the Gulf state. The foreign ministries of Sri Lanka and Oman held earlier this week the third session of their bilateral political consultations, which were first established in 2014 to strengthen ties between the two countries. The virtual meeting took place between Sri Lankas delegation led by Additional Secretary for Consular, Middle East and Africa Affairs U. L. M. Jauhar and Omans delegation headed by Department of International Cooperation Chief Sheikh Hamad bin Saif Al-Rawahi. Colombos Ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman Sabarullah Khan and senior officials from both sides also participated in the discussions, which the Sri Lankan foreign ministry said were focused on broadening the existing areas of cooperation and entering into new bilateral agreements. Several new initiatives in the spheres of agriculture, tourism, education, fisheries, trade, investment, employment promotion, vocational training, skills development and culture were discussed at the meeting, Jauhar told Arab News. With about 30,000 Sri Lankans living and working in Oman, he said the two countries enjoyed long-standing bilateral relations and excellent people-to-people contacts, as Sri Lankan nationals have been contributing to the development of Oman in multiple sectors. Sri Lanka and Oman established their diplomatic relations in 1981, but contacts between their peoples have a longer history. Sri Lanka-Oman relations go far back in history, and the two nations are bound by a vibrant tradition of people-to-people contacts. As countries sharing the Indian Ocean, they are well poised for greater cooperation to encompass many areas of mutual interest, Ameer Ajwad, Colombos former ambassador to Muscat, told Arab News. He said that Oman is an unexplored destination for Sri Lankans and there is a great potential for cooperation. Both countries have many potential commonalities that could be synergized for mutual benefits, Ajwad added. That is why it is important to have closer and more frequent interactions between the two countries to create greater awareness of the opportunities available to promote bilateral cooperation in the future.

        "date": "April 15, 2023 10:18 pm",
        "content": "Amnesty International (AI) has condemned Sri Lankas proposed Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), claiming that it categorically fails on every human rights benchmark. This observation about the proposed Act was made by AI Asia Advocacy Director Carolyn Nash, who called upon U.S. President Joe Biden to send a clear message to his Sri Lankan counterpart, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, that the legislature in question must be overhauled entirely or scrapped altogether if he, Joe Biden, valued the rights of the Sri Lankan people. She further raised concerns that in the event both the administration and Congress continue to remain silent as this draft law advances, they will allow the Sri Lankan government to further cement its ability to suppress dissent. The proposed legislation is an insult to civil society in Sri Lanka, who have advocated for decades for legal reforms to protect human rights. This is far from a good faith effort on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities to improve or replace a bad law  it is an effort to shore up the governments ability to target and silence their critics, she said. The government of Sri Lanka has been using the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain and torture critics and minorities for over four decades. International condemnation of the PTA led the government of Sri Lanka to commit to repealing the law. The ATA, published on 22 March, is the replacement legislation the government has proposed after another bill brought in 2018 was shelved after widespread condemnation. Meanwhile, AI South Asia Researcher Thyagi Ruwanpathirana also highlighted several discrepancies within the proposed law, saying; The drafters of the ATA have not taken into account the benchmarks laid out by UN experts in order to come up with a counter-terror law that would start to bring the legislation in line with international law. The offenses in the anti-terror bill remain broad, vague, and subjective. They are ripe for abuse. Even offenses under Sri Lankas ICCPR Act are now made terror offenses. Its clear after the mass protests last year, the state has become even more willing to misuse counter terrorism offenses in order to target activists. This is reflected in new offenses created that seek to classify acts of civil disobedience as terror offenses. This provision is dangerous and facilitates torture, especially in a context that is already rife with allegations of torture in custody. The ATA still retains certain PTA provisions to enable prolonged detention (up to one year without charge), which can be extended by the High Court on the request of the Attorney General. It also provides the police with access to those who are already indicted and in judicial remand and enables suspects to be removed from remand custody for the purpose of conducting further investigations under the authority of an order made by a Magistrate. The Bill empowers the military to carry out arrests without warrants,, and retains unchecked powers of the executive, including to proscribe persons and organizations without judicial oversight. Penalties include the death penalty, which Amnesty strongly opposes.",

        "date": "April 16, 2023 12:45 pm",
        "content": "In a bid to ensure Sri Lankas main political parties do not take numerical minorities for granted anymore, Opposition MP Mano Ganesan has recently mooted setting up a Tamil caucus in Parliament. The caucus, he said, would allow Tamil legislators to express the collective desire of the islands Tamil speaking peoples. Although Sri Lankas Tamils in the north and east, the Malaiyaha Tamils living across Central, Uva, Southern and Western Provinces, and the Tamil-speaking Muslims, may have different aspirations and political aims, their shared desire to live within an undivided Sri Lanka, sharing wealth and power as combined stake holders of national sovereignty must be collectively articulated, the leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) said. It the caucus will help us commence a collective dialogue with all the national political parties, and beyond politicians, reach out to the Sinhala community leaders and organisations; as well as the international community and development partners, and urge them to use their good offices to ensure Sri Lanka stands by its international commitments, Mr. Ganesan told The Hindu at his Colombo residence. So far, some parties have responded positively, he said. Currently part of the main Opposition alliance led by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB or United Peoples Force), the TPA, representing Malaiyaha Tamils, was among the few political groups to retain all of its six parliamentary seats in the last general election. Mr. Ganesans recent outreach comes amid speculation over national elections next year. Sri Lankas twice-postponed  owing to lack of funds  local government elections may not be held anytime soon, despite Sri Lankas Supreme Court restraining authorities from withholding funds, but all signs point to a presidential poll early next year, according to the legislator. Presidential poll I met President Ranil Wickremesinghe one-on-one recently. He told me that he would run for President, said Mr. Ganesan, who was a Cabinet minister in the former Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration. Six-time Prime Minister Mr. Wickremesinghe was elected President through an urgent parliamentary vote in in July 2022, after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was unceremoniously ousted by a peoples uprising at the height of Sri Lankas crisis. The countrys constitution bars a President elected by Parliament when the office falls vacant as it did last year, from calling for early elections. Such a move would require a constitutional amendment, and possibly a referendum. Mr. Ganesan said his efforts in uniting Mr. Wickremesinghes United National Party, diminished to a single parliamentary seat in the last election, and the breakaway SJB proved futile. Predicting a three-cornered contest in the next presidential election, Mr. Ganesan said Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa, and the Leader of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), were the other likely contenders to the countrys top office. It appears that Mr. Wickremesinghe hopes to be the common candidate in an entity that brings young members of both, the SLPP Rajapaksas ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna or Peoples Front, and the SJB, along with the minority parties together, the MP said, adding that the TPA would engage with all parties and decide closer to the elections. We will fit in with any government, he said, if it is receptive to the Malaiyaha Tamils demands. In Mr. Ganesans view, it is too early to comment on the Presidents efforts towards economic recovery, but the increase in tourist arrivals and worker remittances are positive signs, although much remains to be done. The Sri Lankan economy crashed due to three main reasons  corruption, mismanagement  wastage. I have not seen any serious efforts from the government other than the notice of the anti-corruption bill. Pity, President Wickremesinghe is living with the wolves. Making a case for closer trade ties with Sri Lankas international partners, the TPA Leader said greater access to the Indian market, with preferential trade terms, will help small and medium enterprises in Sri Lanka. India is booming as the worlds 5th largest economy. Look at booming Tamil Nadu, the closest Indian state to us...We must grab this opportunity and grow with India. Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modis first meeting with the TPA delegation in Colombo years ago, Mr. Ganesan said: He Mr. Modi told us Tamils should be united, but immediately qualified his statement saying that Tamil unity should strengthen Sri Lankan Unity. Whether it is the BJP or the Congress, Indian national policy is unity in diversity. They preach to us what they practice at home, he said, adding that India was Sri Lankas greatest security shield against any internal or external challenges. Sri Lanka should understand this basis and come over semi-hostile phobia. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka must stop playing India and China against each other, he contended. Mainstream Sinhalese politicians thought they were being clever in using India-China rivalries. But this foolishness has brought this country to this level, he said, adding: India is our greatest security shield against any internal or external challenges. Sri Lanka should understand this. 200th year Sri Lanka is marking the 200th year since the British brought down indentured labourers from south India to work in the islands plantations. The British government has a moral responsibility towards the community who developed the profitable tea export industry, the islands motor and railroad network, and the Colombo port in then Ceylon, he stressed. I have started a dialogue with the British establishment on this recently. The responsibility of Indian state is equal or even more. Our people were subjected to arbitrary and involuntary repatriation to India, notably by the Sirimavo-Shastri pact (1964)We were not consulted, but treated like cattle, he said. Indians thought keeping Colombo happy served its national interests. This greatly diminished the political status and socio-economic wellbeing of our community. If not for this repatriation pact, the current strength of our MPs in Parliament of Sri Lanka, which is nine today, would have reached not less than 25. The Indian government and policy makers have been briefed many times, Mr. Ganesan said, expressing disappointment over the execution on ongoing projects. India is helping build 14,000 houses for the families living in the plantations, but it is going on at a frighteningly sluggish pace. At this rate, it may take another 50 years to complete the project. Generous socio-cultural- economic development projects of India in Sri Lanka seldom reach our community, he said. Even in Tamil Nadu, most think that Sri Lankas Tamils live just in the north and east. Their awareness of the plight of Malaiyaha Tamils is very low, he said. Source  The Hindu -Agencies",

His brother, Ashraf Ahmed, was shot a split second later. In other footage, filmed by Reuters partner ANI, one gunman is seen firing repeatedly at brothers bodies as they lay on the ground. The two victims died within minutes, while police quickly detained three men suspected of carrying out the slaying. Media reports say the assailants had been posing as journalists. One surrendered immediately after the shooting, while officers subdued the other two suspects. They had been among a throng of journalists that had gathered as the two brothers, allegedly kingpins in a local criminal organisation, were being brought, handcuffed from a hospital Prayagraj city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday evening. After carrying out the slaying, the suspected gunmen shouted Hindu religious chants. One policeman was wounded during the attack. Fearing the possibility of violent unrest in the wake of the killings, the Uttar Pradesh government barred gatherings of more than four people across the entire state. The state government imposed restrictive orders after the killings of Atiq Ahmed and Ashraf Ahmed who were members of a large mafia involved in land grabbing and in murder cases, said a senior police official. We dont want any form of protest to gain momentum, the official said on conditions of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak with the press. The state government, controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modis Hindu nationalist party, has ordered a judicial probe into the killings. Last week police shot dead Atiq Ahmeds son in Jhansi city. He had been wanted in connection to a murder case that was being investigated as part of a wider crackdown into a land mafia operating in Uttar Pradesh. Police in Uttar Pradesh have killed more than 180 suspected criminals during encounters over past six years. The head of the opposition Samajwadi Party, said the slaying of his ex-party member while in police custody demonstrated the failure of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to bring law and order to Uttar Pradesh. When someone can be killed in firing openly amidst the security cordon of the police, then what about the safety of the general public, Samajwadis Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet. Before losing an election in 2014, Ahmed had been a lawmaker with Samajwadi, and later the regional Apna Dal party. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 16, 2023 05:45 pm",
        "content": "This years first solar eclipse will take place on April 20 from 7:04 a.m. to 12:29 p.m. IST, an event which is visible only to 8.77 of the worlds population, according to Prof. Chandana Jayaratne of the Colombo University. The rare solar eclipse is commonly known as a hybrid eclipse since it will shift from a total eclipse to an annular solar eclipse as the moons shadow moves over earth. For some locations in the solar eclipses path on the world, viewers will witness a total solar eclipse, whereas, in other parts, theyll witness a ring-like annular solar eclipse. In both cases, the moon will pass between the Earth and the sun, blocking out all or most of the suns light falling on the Earths surface, he said. The eclipse is visible only to 8.77 of the worlds population and it will not be directly visible in Sri Lanka as well as many other parts of the world, he added. Nevertheless, people can observe it live through several websites from other countries, said Prof. Chandana Jayaratne, the Director of the Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the Department of Physics, University of Colombo. However, the eclipse is visible for a few regions in Western Australia, East Timor, and the eastern Indonesian islands, and viewers in those counties can get ready to see the show of a lifetime. There are just two locations on Earth that will be able to witness the eclipse transition from annular to total before transitioning back to annular again, however, these locations are unfortunately in the middle of the ocean. Hybrid eclipses are very rare. Thus, the last hybrid eclipse has occurred nearly 10 years ago on November 03, 2013, while the next hybrid solar eclipse will occur in November 2031. Only one other solar eclipse will occur this year on October 14, following the upcoming solar event, he said.",

        "date": "April 16, 2023 08:29 pm",
        "content": "Bangladesh has extended the repayment period of Sri Lankas 200 million loan it had given by six more months. Earlier, the Sri Lankan central bank sought time from Bangladesh to make the first installment of the 200 million credit by March this year, hoping that it would be able to restructure its debt by then. However, the restructuring was not done. Now, Sri Lanka is seeking six more months and said it would make its first installment by August this year and another installment by September, said Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder while speaking to a group of journalists after a meeting with P Nandalal Weerasinghe, governor of the central bank of Sri Lanka, at the 2023 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington on Friday. The Sri Lankan governor confirmed that it would need no further extension, Talukder said. When a loan repayment period is extended, it is not free of cost. It adds more interest, he also said. Sri Lanka, facing its worst economic crisis in history, borrowed the fund in May 2021. Colombo could not start repaying the loan and announced its external debt default in April of 2022 amid a deepening crisis. The loan repayment period has been extended thrice. As per the agreement with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh was supposed to receive an interest payment of Libor plus 2 if the amount was returned in three months. The Libor, the acronym for London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, is a benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. The three-month Libor averaged around 0.53 in 2021. Last month, Sri Lanka secured a 2.9 billion programme from the IMF to tackle its huge debt burden. The country owes 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, with 3 billion owed to China, followed by 2.4 billion to the Paris Club, and 1.6 billion to India, said Reuters on Friday. The government also needs to renegotiate more than 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors, and 2.7 billion on other commercial loans. Source  Dhaka Tribune -Agencies",

        "content": "Fighting in Sudan raged for a second day Sunday in battles between rival generals who seized power in a 2021 coup, leaving over 50 civilians including three UN staff dead and sparking international alarm. Deafening explosions and intense gunfire rattled buildings in the capital Khartoums densely-populated northern and southern suburbs as tanks rumbled on the streets and fighter jets roared overhead, witnesses said. Violence erupted early Saturday after weeks of power struggles between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, commander of the heavily-armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), with each accusing the other of starting the fight. The gunfire and explosions are incessant, said 34-year-old Ahmed Hamid from a northern Khartoum suburb. The situation is very worrying and it doesnt seem like it will calm anytime soon, said Ahmed Seif, another Khartoum resident, who fears his building had been damaged by gunfire but said it was too dangerous to go outside to check. Both sides claim they control key sites, while state television broadcasted patriotic songs without commentary. Daglos RSF say they have seized the presidential palace, Khartoum airport and other strategic sites, but the army insist they are in charge. Footage obtained by AFP showed heavy smoke billowing from a building near the army headquarters in Khartoum, with the military saying a building had caught fire amid the clashes but that it had been contained. On Sunday, the stench of gunpowder wafted through Khartoums streets, deserted except by soldiers as frightened civilians sheltered inside their homes. Civilians not a target The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors said they had recorded 56 civilians killed as well as tens of deaths among security forces, and around 600 wounded. Fighting has also erupted outside Khartoum, including in the troubled western Darfur region and in the eastern border state of Kassala, where witness Hussein Saleh said the army had fired artillery at a paramilitary camp. The United Nations said three employees of its World Food Programme (WFP) had been killed in clashes in North Darfur. It was not immediately clear whether the three deaths on Saturday were included in the tally provided by the medics. UN Special Representative Volker Perthes condemned the killings in a statement, saying civilian and humanitarian aid workers are not a target. He said he was also appalled by reports of projectiles hitting UN and other humanitarian premises humanitarian premises in several locations in Darfur. WFP said an aircraft managed by the organisation was also significantly damaged at Khartoum airport. Medics on social media have continued to call for help, pleading for safe corridors for ambulances and a ceasefire to treat the victims, warning the streets were too dangerous to bring many casualties to hospitals. Created in 2013, the RSF emerged from the Janjaweed militia that then-president Omar al-Bashir unleashed against non-Arab ethnic minorities in the western Darfur region a decade earlier, drawing accusations of war crimes. The RSFs planned integration into the regular army was a key element of talks to finalise a deal that would return the country to civilian rule and end the political-economic crisis sparked by the militarys 2021 coup. No negotiations UN chief Antonio Guterres called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the fighting threatens the security and safety of Sudanese civilians. Similar appeals came from the African Union, Britain, China, the European Union and Russia, while Pope Francis said he was following the events with concern and urged dialogue. The AU is to hold an emergency meeting on Sunday, as is the Arab League, following a request by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. But the two generals appear in no mood for talks. In an interview with UAE-based Sky News Arabia, Daglo, also known as Hemeti, said, Burhan the criminal must surrender. The army declared Daglo a wanted criminal and the RSF a rebel militia, saying there will be no negotiations or talks until the dissolution of the group. The latest violence, during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, came after more than 120 civilians had already been killed in a crackdown on regular pro-democracy demonstrations over the past 18 months. The October 2021 coup triggered international aid cuts and sparked near-weekly protests, adding to the deepening troubles of one of the worlds poorest countries. Burhan, a career soldier from northern Sudan who rose through the ranks under the three-decade rule of now jailed Islamist general Bashir, has said the coup was necessary to include more factions into politics. Daglo later called the coup a mistake that failed to bring about change and reinvigorated remnants of Bashirs regime ousted by the army in 2019 following mass protests.

        "date": "April 17, 2023 07:56 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Alabama law enforcement officers Sunday were imploring people to come forward with information about a shooting that killed four people and injured 28 others during a teenagers birthday party. Among those killed was a high school senior who planned to play college football and was celebrating his sisters 16th birthday. The shooting erupted Saturday night at a dance studio in downtown Dadeville. During two news conferences Sunday, Sgt. Jeremy Burkett of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency did not take questions. He did not say if a suspect was in custody or if investigators knew about any motivation. He did not provide the names of those killed. Weve got to have information from the community, Burkett said during a Sunday evening news conference. Philstavious Phil Dowdell, a Dadeville High School senior who had committed to Jacksonville State University, was celebrating at his sister Alexis party before he was shot to death, his grandmother Annette Allen told the Montgomery Advertiser. He was a very, very humble child. Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face, Allen told the newspaper, calling it a million-dollar smile. Dowdells mother was among those hurt in the shooting. Everybodys grieving, Allen said. Burkett said the shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. There were four lives tragically lost in this incident, he said. The shootings rocked the city of 3,200 residents, which is about 57 miles (92 kilometers) northeast of Montgomery, Alabama. Keenan Cooper, the DJ at the party, told WBMA-TV that the party was stopped briefly when attendees heard someone had a gun. He said people with guns were asked to leave, but no one left. Cooper said when the shooting began an hour later, some people took shelter under a table where he was standing, and others ran out. Pastor Jason Whetstone, who leads the Christian Faith Fellowship, said the granddaughter of one of his church members was shot in the foot and underwent surgery Sunday. All of our hearts are hurting right now. Were just trying to pull together to find strength and comfort, Whetstone said before an interfaith vigil in the parking lot of First Baptist Church. We are a loving community, he said. Were pulling together in every aspect to comfort each and every one of these children, the teachers, all of the community. Dadevilles compact downtown is centered around a courthouse square with one- and two-story brick buildings. The towns busiest commercial district is a few blocks north of the square, off a bustling four-lane highway that runs between Birmingham and Auburn. Dadeville is close to Lake Martin, a popular recreational area. Investigators on Sunday continued filing in and out of the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, denoted by a banner hanging on the outside of a one-story brick building just off the square. At least five bullet holes were visible in the studios front windows. Less than a block away, the American and Alabama flags were lowered to half staff outside the Tallapoosa County Courthouse. Dadeville Mayor Frank Goodman said he was in bed asleep when a council member called him just before 11 p.m. Saturday. He said he went to Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville, where some of the people who had been shot were taken. It was chaotic, Goodman said. There were people running around. They were crying and screaming. There were police cars everywhere, there were ambulances everywhere. People were trying to find out about their loved ones. That was a scene, where we never had anything like this happen in our city before. Pastor Ben Hayes, who serves as chaplain for the Dadeville Police Department and for the local high school football team, said most of the victims are teenagers. Dowdell was within weeks of graduation and faced a bright future, Hayes told The Associated Press. He was a strong competitor on the field, Hayes said. You didnt want to try to tackle him or get tackled by him. But when he came off the field, he was one of the nicest young men that you could ever meet, very respectful and well-respected by his peers. Antojuan Woody, from the neighboring town of Camp Hill, was a senior and fellow wide receiver with Dowdell on a Dadeville Tigers football team that went undefeated before losing in the second round of the playoffs last year. He said he and Dowdell had been best friends for all of their lives. It hurts, Woody said as a steady stream of friends and teammates walked over to hug him during Sundays prayer vigil. Its unreal. I cant believe it. Woody said he and Dowdell had a special relationship on the football field. Us being friends forever like that, our chemistry was spot on. We always celebrated together on the field, he said. He described the victims as great people who didnt deserve what happened to them. Hayes, the pastor, said worried families swarmed the local hospital Saturday night trying to find the condition of their children. He said serious crime is rare in Dadeville, and the small city is sad, traumatized, in shock. Jacksonville State football coach Rich Rodriguez said in a statement Sunday: Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Philstavious Dowdell and the other victims of the senseless tragedy last night. He was a great young man with a bright future. Dowdell also recently won medals at a high school track meet at Troy University. Counseling will be available for students at Tallapoosa County schools Monday, said the school district superintendent, Raymond C. Porter. This morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians. Violent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said on social media. President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, the White House said, adding that it is closely monitoring the situation and has been in touch with local officials and law enforcement to offer support. What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? When parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park? Biden said in a statement Sunday. Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising  not declining. This is outrageous and unacceptable. Biden called on Congress to require safe storage of firearms, require background checks for all gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers immunity from liability, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The mayor said Dowdell was a great young man. He also said he is concerned about those wounded and psychologically traumatized by the shooting. We are praying for them, Goodman said. We ask God, if its his will, to bring them back to their parents safe, so they can mend. Goodman said guns and violence are not a frequent presence in Dadeville. He said trying to control guns would prove as futile as trying to control illegal drugs. Dadeville High School had 485 students in grades 6-12 in 2022, according to Alabama state data. It serves Dadeville and nearby parts of Tallapoosa County. Like the rest of Dadeville, its tucked away just out of view off a busy highway that runs from Birmingham to Auburn. Dadeville Highs head football coach Roger McDonald said he would try his best to support grieving students. Theres not a playbook for something like this, he said. So the best youve got to do is just love on your kids, let them all know how much you care about them, be there for them. McDonald said Dowdell had something special. He was a leader, and as far as his ability, an electrifying player, the coach said. Michael Taylor, an assistant coach, said he met Dowdell when the boy was 9 and coached him in youth football. Taylor said the team was invited to Atlanta to play in the stadium used by the NFLs Atlanta Falcons. He did some amazing things there, and he never stopped doing them since then, he said. He was the No. 1 athlete in the school. Taylor said he last heard from Dowdell on Friday, when Dowdell was seeking video of his athletic exploits. Taylor said he drove to the shooting scene Saturday night from his home in nearby Camp Hill. Man, I couldnt get close, Taylor said. So once I found out whats going on, I really I just had to leave because it was going to be all night. Taylor said he returned Sunday to see Dowdles body carried out from the dance studio. He said hes not sure what he will tell other athletes Monday. The first thing weve got to do is weve got to pray our way out of this, Taylor said Sunday. There aint no other way. And then I can tell you, theyre all real close like family at the high school. This is at least the second time in recent years that multiple people were shot in Dadeville. Five people were wounded in July 2016 during a shooting at an American Legion hall, and a man was later charged with five counts of attempted murder, news outlets reported. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 17, 2023 09:33 am",
        "content": "The 06 individuals who were arrested yesterday (April 16) on international waters off the southern coast of Sri Lanka with a drug haul and their multi-day fishing trawler have been brought to the Galle harbour this morning (April 17), the Navy Spokesman said. Over 175 kilograms of heroin valued at Rs. 3.5 billion which were seized while in their possession, have also been brought to the Galle Harbour along with the suspects, according to the SL Navy Spokesman. In a coordinated operation conducted out by the Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Coast Guard, based on information of the State Intelligence Service, a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying about 179 kg and 654g (including packages) of heroin was intercepted about 132 nautical miles (about 244km) off the Little Basses, Hambantota on 15th April 2023. The operation, carried out by the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Ship Samudraraksha, also resulted in the apprehension of six suspects. This morning (17), the consignment of narcotic drugs and the suspects were brought to the Galle harbour where Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera was present to inspect them. Based on information received from a combined intelligence operation led by the Naval Intelligence, the State Intelligence Service, and the Police Narcotic Bureau, the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Ship Samudraraksha was deployed for this special operation off the Little Basses, south of Sri Lanka. In this operation a local multi-day fishing trawler in the sea area, about 132 nautical miles (about 244km) off the Little Basses, was searched on suspicion and a consignment of heroin was recovered from the trawler. Accordingly, about 179kg and 654g (including packages) of heroin were found in 160 packs which were in 08 sacks. Thus, the consignment of drugs, the fishing trawler and 06 suspects who were onboard were taken into custody. The gross street value of the consignment of drugs seized during this operation is believed to be over Rs. 3,593 million, according to the Sri Lanka Navy. The suspects held in the operation have been identified as residents of Nakulugamuwa, Kudawella, Netolpitiya, and Trincomalee, who are from 25 to 32 years of age. They will be handed over to the Police Narcotic Bureau for onward legal action. Including the latest seizure, the Sri Lanka Navy has held drugs with a gross street value of over Rs. 4,908 million during operations mounted in 2023.",

        "title": "G-7 diplomats reject Chinese, N. Korean, Russian aggression",
        "date": "April 17, 2023 10:22 am",
        "content": "Top diplomats from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies are vowing a tough stance on Chinas increasing threats to Taiwan and on North Koreas unchecked tests of long-range missiles, while building momentum on ways to boost support for Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion. Russias war in Ukraine will consume much of the agenda Monday as the envoys gather in this Japanese hot spring resort town for Day Two of talks meant to pave the way for action by G-7 leaders when they meet next month in Hiroshima. The world is at turning point on the fighting in Ukraine and must firmly reject unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, and Russias aggression against Ukraine and its threats of the use of nuclear weapons, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told his colleagues, according to a Japanese summary. For the American delegation, the meeting comes at a crucial moment in the worlds response to Russias invasion of Ukraine and efforts to deal with China, two issues that G-7 ministers from Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and the European Union regard as potent challenges to the post-World War II rules-based international order. A senior U.S. official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the Biden administrations goal for the talks is to shore up support for Ukraine, including a major initiative on Ukraines energy infrastructure launched at last years G-7 gatherings in Germany, as well as to ensure the continued provision of military assistance to Kyiv. Ramping up punishment against Russia for the conflict, particularly through economic and financial sanctions that were first threatened by the G-7 in December 2021, before the invasion, will also be a priority, the official said. Ukraine faces an important moment in coming weeks with Russias current offensive largely stalled and Ukraine preparing a counter-offensive. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Blinkens priorities at the closed-door meetings, said there would be discussion about ways to deepen support for Ukraines long-term defense and deterrence capabilities. That might also improve Kyivs position for potential negotiations that could end the conflict on its terms. The role of Japan  the only Asian member of the G-7  as chairman of this years talks provides an opportunity to discuss coordinated action on China. Leaders and foreign ministers of G-7 countries, most recently France and Germany, have recently concluded visits to China, and the diplomats in Karuizawa are expected to discuss their impressions of where the Chinese stand on numerous issues, including the war in Ukraine, North Korea, and Taiwan, which is a particular sore point in U.S.-Chinese relations. At a private working dinner on Sunday night that was the diplomats first formal meeting, Hayashi urged continued dialogue with China on the many global challenges where participation from Beijing is seen as crucial. Among the Chinese interests that are intertwined with those of wealthy democracies are global trade, finance and climate efforts. But the diplomats are also looking to address Chinas more aggressive recent stance in Northeast Asia, where it has threatened Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own. Hayashi told ministers that outside nations must continue building a constructive and stable relationship, while also directly expressing our concerns and calling for China to act as a responsible member of the international community, according to a summary of the closed-door dinner. China recently sent planes and ships to simulate an encirclement of Taiwan. Beijing has also been rapidly adding nuclear warheads, taking a tougher line on its claim to the South China Sea and painting a scenario of impending confrontation. The worry in Japan can be seen it its efforts in recent years to make a major break from its self-defense-only post-WWII principles, working to acquire preemptive strike capabilities and cruise missiles to counter growing threats. Blinken, the top U.S. diplomat, had been due to visit Beijing in February, but the trip was postponed because of a Chinese spy balloon incident over U.S. airspace and has yet to be rescheduled. Blinken met briefly with Chinas top diplomat, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Forum, but high-level contacts between Washington and Beijing have become rare. Thus, Blinken will be seeking insight from his French and German counterparts on their interactions with the Chinese, the senior U.S. official said. Despite indications, notably comments from French President Emmanuel Macron, that the G-7 is split over China, the official said there is shared worry among G-7 nations over Chinas actions. The official added that the foreign ministers would be discussing how to continue a coordinated approach to China. North Korea is also a key area of worry for Japan and other neighbors in the region. Since last year, Pyongyang has test-fired around 100 missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that showed the potential of reaching the U.S. mainland and a variety of other shorter-range weapons that threaten South Korea and Japan. Hayashi expressed grave concern over North Koreas launch of ballistic missiles with an unprecedented frequency and in unprecedented manners, including the launch in the previous week, and the G-7 Foreign Ministers strongly condemned North Koreas repeated launches of ballistic missiles, according to the summary.

        "title": "Sri Lanka at 75 is a failed state, says former President Chandrika",
        "date": "April 17, 2023 11:21 am",
        "content": "Despite possessing enviable social indicators at the time of Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka, at 75, is a failed state, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said on Sunday. Seventy-five years is a long time for a nation to achieve considerable progress. Even after 450 years of destruction by colonial rulers, at Independence, Sri Lanka possessed some of the best socio-economic indicators. Today, at 75, Sri Lanka is a failed state, she said, delivering the UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Madanjeet Singh Memorial Lecture of 2023, in an online event, organised by the South Asia Foundation and the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai. We are incapable of managing the affairs of the state, said the 77-year-old former head of state, who hails from one of Sri Lankas most powerful political clans. The government has declared bankruptcy  a very rare situation for any country in the world; the economy is in tatters; peasant agriculture and small and medium industries are struggling to survive, or have already closed down; tourism sector is at an all-time low; large industries are retrenching employees and new jobs will be a long time coming, Ms. Kumaratunga said. The situation compelled Sri Lanka to seek an IMF facility coming with  very stringent conditions, she said. While President Kumaratunga has earlier blamed the Rajapaksas for the countrys economic collapse, she underscored corruption and Sri Lankas failure at essential nation building as key factors leading to the current crisis. Widespread corruption at every level, had become the gospel of Sri Lankan politics, and had seeped down the major pillars of democratic governance, including the judiciary, the police, and the public service. Further, independent Sri Lanka failed to weld together the diverse ethnic and religious communities to form a united pluralistic state, Ms. Kumaratunga said. Historically, the islands majority Sinhala-Buddhist community had felt discriminated against by the colonial rulers. Although Independence gave the majority community an opportunity to correct this, sadly that did not happen, she added. The solution they adopted was to arrogate all the privileges of economic and social development exclusively to themselves. The just resolution of the minorities question would have been to guarantee equal rights to all citizens and a system of political power-sharing with the minorities. We have failed to do this for 75 years, the two-time President said. Sri Lankas present Constitution, introduced by President J.R. Jayewardene in 1978, is not a democratic one, Ms. Kumaratunge contended, recalling how her own draft proposals for a new Constitution in 2000, widely considered progressive, could not be taken forward owing to lack of support. Outlining the root causes for Sri Lankas failures, she said that while the country functions as a modern, emerging economy financially, it is mired in the practices of a backward, semi-feudal society, in the social and cultural spheres. Eleven out of the 14 people that have governed Sri Lanka until now have hailed from five families, she said, in an apparently self-critical reference to the countrys famous ruling clans, including her own family. All main political parties invariably played the ethno-religious card in every election, she added. Referring to last years historic street protests, Ms. Kumaratunga said a cataclysmic socio-political upheaval shook the nation to its very core. An entire nation, young and old rose up, demanding radical changes in the existing system of governance, of the ethics and values of leaders. Citizens of all ethnic, religious communities, irrespective of political affiliations, came together spontaneously, without any known leaders to demand a new country, a better Sri Lanka, she said, calling for a total overhaul of governance, with new, principled leaders.

        "date": "April 17, 2023 01:57 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has requested Bangladesh to resume negotiations to sign a proposed preferential trade agreement (PTA) by April with an eye to boosting bilateral trade between the two friendly countries. As part of the move, the Lankan High Commission in Dhaka has proposed to hold a virtual meeting on April 24 to discuss the current status and way forward. The mission has also requested Dhaka to inform its concurrence on the proposed date soon. We have received a note verbale from the Sri Lankan High Commission in Dhaka. Were working on the issue, according to an official concerned. But we are not in favour of resuming negotiations on April 24 as proposed by Colombo. It is supposed to defer the date as its an Eid-ul-Fitr holiday. The PTA negotiations between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are expected to resume on April 27 or in the first week of May, stated the official. Earlier, primary negotiations on the proposed deal were postponed due to months of political turmoil there, according to him. Commerce ministry formed a high-powered trade negotiation committee (TNC) to take steps to this end. Additional secretary (FTA) of the ministry was named the chief negotiator of the committee. The 12-member committee is working in coordination with the Sri Lankan side to carry forward the negotiations. Under the proposed deal, both governments have already exchanged request lists of products as Bangladesh earlier sent a list of more than 100 products. On the other hand, Sri Lanka sent a list of 112 items, seeking duty-free access to Bangladesh market. Meanwhile, economists have advocated signing PTAs and FTAs (free trade agreements) with different countries to address the challenges when Bangladesh graduates to the next level. They said preferential trade deals would help Bangladesh boost exports significantly. Another commerce ministry high official said, We need to sign several PTAs and FTAs before (Bangladeshs) graduation to reap the benefits of the least-developed country category After its graduation, he added, Bangladesh would lose various tariff-related facilities that it now enjoys as a least-developed country (LDC). Earlier in 2017, both Dhaka and Colombo completed necessary preparations to sign an FTA, but the move did not see the light of day for internal issues. Were now trying to start talks with two dozen countries, including the US and Canada, for signing PTAs to help boost the countrys export earnings, said an FTA wing official of the ministry. Currently, priority is being given to sign PTAs, the official said, adding: (The signing of an) FTA deal is very difficult. Some issues, including revenue losses, have been involved with FTAs as all products of both the countries under FTAs enjoy duty-free facility. In March 2021, Bangladesh and Sri Lank signed 06 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to increase bilateral cooperation between the two nations. Bangladesh signed a PTA with Bhutan on 06 December 2020, the first of its kind since the countrys independence back in 1971. However, the country is a member of several multilateral trade blocs. The two multilateral FTAs that Bangladesh has so far signed are the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement and the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) FTA. On the other hand, three multilateral PTA deals that Bangladesh is a party to are the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), TPS-OIC (Trade Preferential Scheme-OIC) and D-8 (Developing-8) PTA.

It also said that the company has explored multiple AI tools. According to a report by The New York Times, Google has also explored multiple AI-powered tools that are in various stages of development. AI tools to search music, generate images Citing a Google director wrote in a document, the report said that efforts have been explored to let people use Google Earths mapping technology with help from AI and search for music through a conversation with a chatbot. Other product ideas include a tool called GIFI that would use AI to generate images in Google Image results. Microsoft recently announced that its AI image generator for Edge is now available for all users on desktop. It is powered by DALL-E deep learning models developed by ChatGPt creator OpenAI and creates realistic images from a description in natural language. There is a mention of Tivoli Tutor, an AI tool which would teach users a new language through open-ended AI text conversations. Google is said to be working on another product called Searchalong that would let users ask a chatbot questions while surfing the web through Google Chrome. People might ask the chatbot for activities near an Airbnb rental, for example, and the AI tool would scan the page and the rest of the internet for a response, the report mentioned. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said that the company has more powerful large language models that will improve the quality of results offered by its chatbot Bard. He said that the company has been cautious in its approach because AI is prone to generating false statements. Source - Times of India -Agencies",

        "date": "April 17, 2023 06:17 pm",
        "content": "A petition has been filed before the Supreme Court seeking to declare the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, tabled in the parliament by MP Premnath C. Dolawatte, is in violation of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The petition was filed by Retired Army Brigadier K. Athula H. de Silva, Shenali D. Waduge and Jehan Hameed, naming MP Dolawatte and the Attorney General as the respondents in the petition. The petitioners allege that the relevant Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, which was submitted to the parliament as a private members bill by MP Dolawatte, has attempted to interpret homosexual activity as a non-criminal offence, while promoting such activities. The petition also mentions that it is contrary to the expectations of the legislature regarding the penal code and thereby seriously violates the provisions of the constitution. Furthermore, the petitioners, who have pointed out that even homosexual activities have not been endorsed in accordance with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or Islamic religious beliefs, also mention that the provisions of the bill in question are against those religious beliefs. In addition, the matters expected in the bill are also contrary to the cultural and national identities of Sri Lanka, they claimed. Therefore, the petitioning party seeks an order that if the proposed Penal Code (Amendment) Bill is required to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament and also a referendum, since the provisions contained in the proposed bill violate the fundamental human rights mentioned in the Constitution.",

        "title": "Agriculture Minister clarifies decision to export monkeys to China",
        "date": "April 17, 2023 07:44 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera says that Sri Lanka will be able to provide toque macaque monkeys to China only if the committee appointed on the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers recommends in this regard. The Minister pointed out that a Chinese company which operates around 1,000 private zoos in China has requested Sri Lankan toque macaque monkeys for their zoos. However, Minister Amaraweera emphasized that although China has requested to provide monkeys from Sri Lanka, the government has not yet arrived at a final decision regarding the matter. Minister Amaraweera also stated that a committee consisting of representatives from the Department of Wildlife, the Department of National Zoological Gardens, the Attorney Generals Department, Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, will be appointed on the approval of the Cabinet in order to consider the legality related to these activities. I, as the Minister of Agriculture, am submitting a Cabinet paper for this purpose. The supply of monkeys to China is done only on the recommendation of the committee appointed by the Cabinet, he added. Amaraweera claimed if somehow the committee decides that the country is not able to export the monkeys, this matter will end there and therefore, there is no need to be falsely alarmed. Meanwhile the minister, who mentioned that the threat of damage occurred to crop cultivation by monkeys is not insignificant within the country, also claimed that 93 million coconuts have been destroyed by monkeys and giant squirrels in the first six months of the year 2022. The amount has exceeded 200 million coconuts at the end of 2022, he said. You can ask farmers on the damage caused to the crop cultivations by monkeys. This issue prevails for a long period of time with no any solution. Those who comment against exporting these animals to China do not provide any alternative solution for this issue. Thereby, he highlighted that this issue has become a matter that needs to be discussed with an open mind. However, Veterinarian Chamith Nanayakkara, who has contributed in preparing the Animal Welfare Bill, states that there are humane solutions for this real issue of monkeys causing damage to crop cultivations. He mentions that the alternative methods such as sterilization of female monkeys, vasectomy surgeries to male monkeys other ways of repelling animals from cultivation lands such as planting Monkey Puzzle Trees around the cultivation lands can be used in order to overcome these issues.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to make a fresh call for the formation of an all-party government when Parliament takes up the debate on the IMF bailout programme next week, a senior opposition party leader said on Monday. In March, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 3 billion bailout programme to help Sri Lanka overcome its economic crisis and catalyse financial support from other development partners, a move welcomed by Colombo as a historic milestone in the critical period. He (Wickremesinghe) will make an open invitation to all political parties to join the national government when the Parliament meets on April 25 to debate on the IMF bailout programme, Mano Ganesan, the leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance, told the media. President Wickremesinghe, also the countrys finance minister, is keen to win the approval of the 225-member assembly for the IMF bailout package, which is a timely antidote to Sri Lankas economic travails. In July last year, Wickremesinghe urged lawmakers from all political parties to put their differences aside and work towards lifting Sri Lanka out of the throes of the economic crisis. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party led by the powerful Rajapaksa family voted for Wickremesinghe, the leader of the United National Party (UNP), as the president in July last year. Wickremesinghe currently heads a cabinet of SLPP ministers. Sri Lanka is in the midst of its worst economic crisis since its independence from Great Britain in 1948, triggered by a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves. In April last year, Sri Lanka declared its international debt default due to the forex crisis. Earlier this month, Sri Lankas election commission said the local body polls, which were scheduled to be held on April 25, were postponed indefinitely due to an acute shortage of funds.

        "date": "April 18, 2023 12:28 am",
        "content": "LONDON (AP)  U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is under investigation over allegations he failed to disclose shares his wife owns in a child care business that stands to benefit from his governments budget, a parliamentary watchdog disclosed. Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Daniel Greenberg opened an inquiry last week for possible violations of the code of conduct that calls on members to be open and frank in declaring relevant financial interests, according to an update given to members of Parliament who returned Monday from Easter break. Parliament requires members to disclose financial interests within four weeks of something they said or actions they took that may have been influenced by a financial interest. A Sunak spokesperson says he did not make a declaration as a member of parliament but had recorded a ministerial interest, the equivalent disclosure for government ministers. The governments budget announced last month includes a massive expansion of free child care for working families with children from 9 months to 4 years old. The plan included financial incentives to people who joined the child care profession and doubled the incentive if it was done through a private agency. Sunaks wife, Akshata Murthy, has shares in Koru Kids, which is listed on a government website as one of six such agencies. The organization praised the new incentives in the budget as great. Sunak was asked to come clean about his familys financial interests last month after being grilled by members of Parliament over why the child care policy favored private agencies. When asked if he had any interests to declare, Sunak did not mention his wifes shares. No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way, he said. At the time, Sunaks press secretary said his interests would be included in an update of ministers interests in May. Earlier this month, Sunak wrote to the Parliamentary committee that questioned him to say he wanted to clarify that this interest has rightly been declared to the Cabinet Office. Sunak promised integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level when he took office in October. Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the failure to update ministers interests since last May had left a transparency black hole that enabled Sunak and his appointees to dodge proper scrutiny of their affairs.
