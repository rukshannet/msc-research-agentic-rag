        "content": "There are some disagreements over restructuring debt for distressed economies, the chief of the International Monetary Fund said on Saturday on the sidelines of a G20 meeting, adding that banning private cryptocurrencies should be an option. Indias G20 presidency comes at a time when its South Asian neighbours Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan are seeking urgent IMF funds due to an economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. China, the worlds largest bilateral creditor, urged G20 nations on Friday to conduct a fair, objective and in-depth analysis of the causes of global debt issues as clamour grows for lenders to take a large haircut, or accept losses, on loans. On debt restructuring, while there are still some disagreements, we now have the global sovereign debt roundtable with consideration of all public and private creditors, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters after the roundtable she co-chaired with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. We just finished a session in which it was clear that there is a commitment to bridge differences for the benefit of countries. Apart from restructuring debt, regulating cryptocurrencies is another priority area for India, which Georgieva agreed with. We have to differentiate between central bank digital currencies that are backed by the state and stable coins, and crypto assets that are privately issued, Georgieva said. There has to be very strong push for regulation... if regulation fails, if youre slow to do it, then we should not take off the table banning those assets, because they may create financial stability risk.

        "date": "February 25, 2023 02:18 pm",
        "content": "MP Mayantha Dissanayake of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has decided to step down as the chairman of Committee on Public Finance (COPF) in parliament, just two days after his appointment. The parliamentarian has informed his decision to SJBs General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara. Dissanayake was picked for the position by the parliaments Committee of Selection on Thursday (Feb 23), although fellow lawmaker Harsha de Silva had been nominated for COPF chairmanship by the SJB. The COPF also met the same day, under the chairmanship of MP Dissanayake. Nevertheless, there was a rift in the main opposition as MP de Silva later cried foul over the new appointment. Taking issue with MP Dissanayakes decision to accept the position, MP de Silva alleged that all government MPs in the Committee of Selection in the parliament endorsed this appointment, overruling his nomination. Actually, it was my name that was proposed by the opposition as the nominee from the opposition. It was approved two days ago. But today, the government abused their power and used Mayantha to get their way, the SJB lawmaker tweeted on Thursday. It was reported that MP Dissanayake had initially refused the request made by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa asking him to step down from the position. The issue also led to a heated debate in the parliament on Friday (Feb 24). Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader MP Rauff Hakeem, who is also a member of the Committee of Selection, stated that in terms of the Standing Orders, the selection committee should have accepted the name of the parliamentarian proposed by the opposition as the COPF chair. Pursuant to the Standing Orders of the parliament, a member of the opposition should be appointed for the COPF chairmanship. However, MPs in the ruling party insisted that the Committee of Selection had appointed MP Dissanayake as COPF chair, in compliance with the Standing Orders. After the third session of the ninth parliament was prorogued by President Wickremesinghe, three parliamentary watchdog committees, namely the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the COPF, were accordingly dissolved. Following the appointment of MP Dissanayake as the COPF chair, MP de Silva alleged that all government MPs in the Committee of Selection in the parliament endorsed this appointment, overruling his nomination.",

        "content": "The trade union collective of professionals says their demands were not met at the meeting held with President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (Feb. 25). Speaking to the media following the discussion, Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Dr. Haritha Aluthge pledged to continue their trade union action. Dr. Aluthge said, We informed the President that we cannot afford to pay the revised taxes. The President admitted that our proposals are fair. ... He invited us, as professionals, to join the talks with IMF representatives. We believe that we did not receive a positive response to call off the series of protests planned to be launched on March 01. According to the GMOA secretary, the President, during the discussion, has stressed that the country cannot ride out the economic crisis without the IMF bailout package. The President has also noted that revising the taxes again before reaching a final agreement with the IMF can have a negative impact, he added. But we do not accept the fact that this is the case. Speaking further, he vowed to continue the trade union action until their demands are met. A meeting between the trade union representatives and President Wickremesinghe commenced at 10.30 a.m. this morning at the Presidential Secretariat. The meeting was reportedly held in order to discuss the governments new tax policy. Representatives of 40 member trade unions of the professionals trade union collective have taken part in the discussion. Speaking to the media earlier, GMOA Secretary mentioned that they expect some positive response from the President following todays discussion. We hope to inform the Ministry of Finance including the President and the relevant parties about how this can be done without affecting the overall revenue of the government and how fair our demands are. We hope we will get some positive response from the President after todays discussion. The next few weeks are very crucial, he added. Dr. Aluthge further pointed out that all the professionals have lined up against this unfair tax policy so far. The government must find a permanent solution to stop the country from becoming dysfunctional, he stressed.",

        "date": "February 25, 2023 06:02 pm",
        "content": "The US is deeply concerned that the loans being given by China to Indias immediate neighbourhood  Pakistan and Sri Lanka  may be used for coercive leverage, a senior State Department official said on Friday. Concerning Chinese loans to countries in Indias immediate neighbourhood, we are deeply concerned that loans may be used for coercive leverage, Donald Lu, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, told reporters ahead of the India trip of Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The top American diplomat is travelling to New Delhi on a three-day official visit from March 01 to 03. Lu said that the US is talking to countries in the region comprising India to take their own decisions and not feel compelled by any outside partner. We are talking to India, talking to countries of the region about how we help countries to make their own decisions and not decisions that might be compelled by any outside partner, including China, Lu said. Earlier in the day, Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced that the Board of China Development Bank (CDB) has approved a USD 700 million credit facility to the country. Responding to a question Lu said that there has been a serious conversation between India and the US on the issue of China. We have had serious conversations about China, both before the latest scandal over this surveillance balloon but in the aftermath. So, I fully expect those conversations will continue, he said. Lu, in response to a question, insisted that Quad is not a military alliance. The Quad is not, in fact, an organisation that is against any single country or group of countries. The Quad stands for trying to promote activities and values that support the Indo-Pacific  free and open Indo-Pacific, but Indo-Pacific thats prosperous and supports the values that we as these four countries represent, he said. When asked about Indias military relationship with Russia, he said globally Russia is having a really difficult time fulfilling orders for military contracts. We see plenty of evidence of that around the world. And if you look at press reporting, I think you can see the Indians are also wondering whether Russia will be able to provide for its defenses, Lu said. Lu strongly refuted the allegations that India avoids the use of war when it comes to Russia. India uses the word war all the time, he asserted. You heard Prime Minister Modi say, in August, now is not the era for war. You heard External Affairs Minister Jaishankar say in September, at the UN, that we need this war to end through diplomatic means and along the principles of the UN Charter, reinforcing territorial integrity and sovereignty, he said. And then, in November you heard the Indian Defense Minister say the threat to use nuclear weapons by Russia is totally unacceptable and at odds with the basic tenets of humanity. So, I dont particularly see a reluctance to use the word war. I think they use it all the time, Lu said. Source: Press Trust of India (PTI) -Agencies",

        "date": "February 25, 2023 06:36 pm",
        "content": "The National Peoples Power (NPP)Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) are running neck-and-neck in General Election voting intentions amongst likely voters at 32 and 31 each, respectively, a latest survey results showed. This was revealed in the latest Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling from January 2023, conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP). The IHP is a Colombo-based independent, non-partisan research centre. The SLOTS lead investigator is Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya of IHP, trained in public opinion polling at Harvard University and has conducted numerous surveys over three decades. The report noted that both NPPJVP and the SJB are ahead of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), however, the difference between them is within the margin of error. IHP MRP analysis of likely voters indicates that since July 2022 when President Ranil Wickremesinghe took office, the SJB has gained a net three points, the NPPJVP one point, and the UNP five points. These gains have been largely at the expense of the SLPP whose support fell 11 points. Assuming general election voting intent transfers to voting in local government election which was initially due in March but later postponed, the SLOTS January polling suggest that on current trends, the SJB and the NPPJVP between them will win the plurality in most local authorities and wards. However, most local authorities are likely to end up with divided control, with no party winning an absolute majority, according to the analysis. The report mentions that the SJB and ITAK will lead the NPPJVP in the Northern and Eastern provinces, but the NPPJVP will likely lead the SJB in the Western, Southern, North-Central, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, and will do better in rural areas, whilst the SJB will do better in urban and municipal councils. Dr Rannan-Eliya commented that This will be a huge change from the 2018 local elections. The main drivers are a collapse in the SLPP vote, and the NPPJVP doing better than the SJB in winning defecting SLPP voters and in retaining their original 2020 General Election vote. According to IHP MRP analysis, the NPPJVP has a clearer lead over the SJB amongst registered voters, but SJB supporters are more likely to vote, reducing the margin between them in likely voters by 2.",

        "date": "February 25, 2023 08:41 pm",
        "content": "Scientists warn that the entire Himalayan region is highly vulnerable to tremors and the strong possibility of a major earthquake is always there. The massive earthquake that rattled Turkey and Syria has taken over 47,000 lives and left millions homeless. It is heart-wrenching to look at the visuals as people grieve over their lost family, friends and homes. Such major events often trigger the question if another earthquake awaits? Well, according experts Uttarakhand is prone to such major disaster anytime. Earths surface comprises various plates that are constantly in motion. The Indian plate is moving about 5 cm per year, leading to accumulation of stress along the Himalayas increasing the possibility of a greater earthquake, said Dr N Purnachandra Rao, Chief Scientist, NGRI speaking to news agency ANI. He further added, Weve a strong network of 18 seismograph stations in Uttarakhand. The region referred to as the seismic gap between Himachal  western part of Nepal incl Uttarakhand is prone to earthquakes that might occur at any time. Great earthquake in Uttarakhand Speaking to TOI, Rao said that a great earthquake is inevitable in the Uttarakhand region as a lot of stress is building up beneath the surface. However, one cannot predict the date or time of the earthquake, he further added. The magnitude of the disaster may depend on several factors like geographic area, population, construction quality and others. Rao also stated that an earthquake similar to magnitude of that like in Turkey is likely to occur but one cannot predict the exact date and time. Although the region falls over what is a called a seismic gap, the area under the earth is accumulating lot of tension and can only be released through an earthquake, reported TOI. Another earthquake in Himalaya? Last year, scientists said there is a strong possibility of a major earthquake in the Himalayan region. According to a report by news agency PTI, Senior Geophysicist of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Ajay Paul said the Himalayas have come into existence as a result of a collision between Indian and Eurasian plates. Due to constant pressure of the Eurasian plate on the Indian plate, strained energy accumulating under it keeps releasing itself from time to time in the form of earthquakes, Paul said. Occurrence of earthquakes due to accumulation of strained energy under the Himalayas is a normal and relentless process. The entire Himalayan region is highly vulnerable to tremors and the strong possibility of a major earthquake is always there, Paul said. Need to be earthquake ready In the wake of the recent earthquake, Paul also underlined the need for better preparation to minimise the damage to life and property. The constructions should be earthquake resistant, people should be made aware of what can be done by way of preparations before earthquakes, at the time of their occurrence and after they have happened, Paul said. Mock drills should be conducted at least once every year, he said, adding that if these things are done, the damages by an earthquake can be reduced by 99.99 per cent. Source  India.com -Agencies",

He also mentioned that the government had sent a group of military personnel to Nepal. They were sent at the times of natural disasters. But Im looking at the possibility of using our military medical personnel to send abroad when the people are faced with health disasters the President said. Health disasters take place more often than natural disasters and I would discuss this matter with the military to establish a unit in this regard. So thats a new chapter for military medicine, The President also said that under the Indian credit line the government is to get more medicine to address the shortage of medicine during this crisis situation.

He said further the medical corps of the Army, Navy and Air Force are really experienced in military medicine in a military crisis situation that is during the war in the North and East. While facing the war they also rendered a service during the Tsunami Catastrophe in 2004, during floods and during COVID 19. Hence they have the experience in both military and civilian fields.

        "date": "February 25, 2023 10:11 pm",
        "content": "A magnitude 5.3 earthquake has shaken the central Anatolian Turkish province of Nigde, the Kandilli earthquake monitoring centre said, just over two weeks after two devastating earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria. Saturdays earthquake had a depth of 7km (4.34 miles) and hit the Bor district at 1:27pm (10:27 GMT), the Turkish disaster management agency AFAD said. No casualties have been reported so far. Vice President Fuat Oktay said response teams are on the ground to assess any damage. There is no negative situation at the moment. May God protect our country and our nation from all kinds of disasters, he said on Twitter. Bor is located some 350km (218 miles) west of the quake-ravaged Turkish-Syrian border region. In the earthquakes that hit earlier this month, more than 44,000 people were killed in Turkey, where 11 provinces were affected, while the latest announced death toll in Syria was 5,914. The earthquakes were followed by more than 9,000 aftershocks, and in Turkey, damaged more than 173,000 buildings and left nearly two million residents homeless, according to government data. Nearly 240,000 rescue workers, including volunteers, continue to work in the 11 quake-hit provinces in Turkey. Some of the areas affected by the quakes were initially difficult to access but recovery efforts continue and casualty numbers are rising as they progress. There have been no reports of survivors being rescued in recent days. Fears of another major earthquake have been rekindled in highly populated Istanbul, but a prominent Turkish seismologist has reassured the risk hasnt increased. The risk hasnt increased because we are talking about completely different systems, Dogan Kalafat, the director of the Kandilli Observatorys Earthquake-Tsunami Monitoring Center in Istanbul, told AFP. Some 20 million people in Turkey have been affected by the quake, while the United Nations estimates 8.8 million people have been affected in Syria.

        "date": "February 26, 2023 07:50 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Saturday called for timely and orderly processes under common framework with regards to Sri Lankas debt resolution. The island nation faced severe economic crisis which resulted in high debt. In a statement issued after conclusion of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) meeting under Indias presidency, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva strongly endorsed efforts to strengthen the debt architecture and improve the speed and effectiveness of debt resolution, keeping in mind rising debt vulnerabilities in many countries. Sovereign debt vulnerabilities, which were already in an elevated state before the pandemic, have been exacerbated by the shocks stemming from Covid-19 and Russias war against Ukraine. This is particularly the case for developing and low-income countries with very limited policy space and huge development needs, she added. During 2020, in order to strengthen debt architecture, the G20 initiated Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and established the Common Framework (CF) for debt resolution. It is now critical to complete Zambias debt restructuring, establish a Creditor Committee for Ghana and advance work with Ethiopia. Nonetheless, more predictable, timely and orderly processes are needed both for countries under the CF and for those not covered by it, including Sri Lanka and Suriname, she said. Growth slowdown She reminded of global growth slowdown in 2023. She also recalled from her previous blog that too many people in too many countries are struggling to make ends meet. Keeping this in mind, the international community, has a responsibility to come together to find solutions for the most vulnerable members of global family. This calls for urgent action to strengthen the international financial architecture, especially in the area of debt resolution and strengthening the global financial safety net, she said. Quota review Considering the great uncertainty and repeated turbulence in the global economy, she emphasised on further bolstering the IMFs capacity to support its members. This applies most urgently to its concessional financing for low-income countries through and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGT). Demand for PRGT support has reached unprecedented levels and can only be met if matched by an increase in PRGT loan and subsidy resources. In addition, a successful quota review  which the IMFs membership has committed to complete by December 2023  is critical for a strong Global Financial Safety Net. The latter has always been important for global stability and is even more important in todays challenging global environment, especially for the most vulnerable countries and people. Our common interest is to secure a well-functioning and integrated global economy, for the sake of a more secure and prosperous world, she said. Source: The Hindu Business Line --Agencies",

        "date": "February 26, 2023 12:15 pm",
        "content": "In a bid to further facilitate investors through speedy approvals for investment projects, thereby easing the ease of doing business, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) will be granted more powers in future, Investment Promotion State Minister Dilum Amunugama stated. He stressed that the new powers would see investors being given more efficient clearance processes for relevant projects, offering investors additional certainty and clarity. The State Minister made these remarks during a discussion held with the BOI trade union representatives recently. It is evident that the modus operandi in obtaining necessary approvals for investment projects causes significant hindrances to investors, which has a considerable bearing on the willingness and confidence of the investors to continue their business. In fact, some projects require approvals from 70 institutions, Amunugama highlighted. In this context, attention has been drawn to leveraging a business model called the plug-and-play model where all clearances and other prerequisites will be in place before the project is awarded to any investor. Here, the business firms are not required to focus on the basic requirements for setting up a business as everything is arranged by the relevant authority, which would be the BOI, he explained. With the new powers in place, the BOI will be equipped to act more independently and effectively and thus, upbeat about wooing more investors to Sri Lana, Amunugama added. Moreover, the State Minister pointed out, In light of the present situation in the country, driving more investments and promoting tourism is the need of the hour. As such, the BOI needs to bend over backwards to make sure that investors feel comfortable and confident in doing business in Sri Lanka, Meanwhile, Convenor of the Joint Trade Union Alliance Mahesh Abegunawardana opined, The delays that are caused owing to the inefficiency of other institutions when granting approvals for projects, are often considered delays of BOI. This is evident with what transpired in the recently declared open Hanthana International Bird Park where BOI was blamed for not granting approvals on time causing a major impediment; however, there were no delays from our end. The BOI employees are always geared to perform their duties with utmost capacity and commitment for the betterment of the institution and the country at large, Mr. Abegunawardana added",

Opening batter Beth Mooney anchored the Australian innings, scoring an unbeaten 74 in a total of 156 for six, bagging the title of Player of the Match. South Africa were never up with the required run rate and were restricted to 137 for six despite opener Laura Wolvaardt hitting 61 off 48 balls. Wolvaardt and semi-final heroine Tazmin Brits struggled to find gaps in the field and scored only 17 runs before Brits was caught at mid-on off Darcie Brown off the last ball of the fifth over. Marizanne Kapp hit two boundaries but was out for 11 and South Africa captain Sune Luus was run out for two. At that stage the home side needed another 103 runs off 56 balls. Wolvaardt and the hard-hitting Chloe Tryon gave a near-capacity crowd of about 15,000 hope with an attacking fourth wicket partnership of 55 off 37 balls but the match was effectively over when Wolvaardt was leg before wicket to Megan Schutt in the 17th over. The left-handed Mooney played a measured innings, scoring her 74 runs off 53 balls while a succession of partners batted aggressively. Asleighh Gardner, who was bestowed Player of the Tournament, and Grace Harris both batted ahead of captain Meg Lanning and appeared to be under instructions to go for their shots. South Africas bowlers performed steadily and were backed up by enthusiastic fielding. Stalwarts Shabnim Ismail and Kapp both took two wickets each. But Australia showed their quality in defending their total with athleticism and commitment that put the South African batters under constant pressure. Brief scores: Australia 156-6 in 20 overs (B. Mooney 74 not out; S. Ismail 2-26, M. Kapp 2-35) v South Africa 137-6 in 20 overs (L. Wolvaardt 61) Result: Australia won by 19 runs Toss: Australia Source - France 24 - Agencies",

        "date": "February 27, 2023 12:37 am",
        "content": "At least 59 people died, including 12 children, when a wooden sailing boat carrying migrants to Europe crashed against rocks near the southern Italian coast early on Sunday, authorities said. The vessel, which sailed from Turkey and was carrying people from Afghanistan, Iran and several other countries, sank in rough sea conditions near Steccato di Cutro, a seaside resort on the eastern coast of Calabria. The incident reopened a debate on migration in Europe and Italy, where the recently-elected right-wing governments tough new laws for migrant rescue charities have drawn criticism from the United Nations and others. By Sunday afternoon the provisional death toll stood at 59 but was expected to rise, junior interior minister Wanda Ferro told reporters. Manuela Curra, a provincial government official, earlier told Reuters that 81 people had survived the shipwreck. Twenty of them were taken to hospital, including one person in intensive care. As emergency services searched the sea and the coastline in stormy weather, Curra said that survivors had said some 140 to 150 were on board - suggesting that some people were missing. The boat set sail from the western Turkish port of Izmir about four days ago and was spotted about 74 km (46 miles) off the coast late on Saturday by a plane operated by European Union border agency Frontex, Italian police said. Patrol boats were mobilised to intercept it, but severe weather forced them to return to port, police said, adding that authorities then mobilised search units along the coastline. A baby aged only a few months was among migrants first found washed up on the beach, according to ANSA news agency. Emergency doctor Laura De Paoli described finding another dead child, aged seven. When we got to the point of the shipwreck we saw corpses floating everywhere and we rescued two men who were holding up a child. Sadly, the little one was dead, she told ANSA. His voice cracking with emotion, Cutros mayor, Antonio Ceraso, told the SkyTG24 news channel that he had seen a spectacle that you would never want to see in your life ... a gruesome sight ... that stays with you for all your life. Wreckage from the wooden gulet, a Turkish sailing boat, was strewn across a large stretch of coast. One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, the Guardia di Finanza customs police said. FALSE PROSPECT OF SAFETY Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed deep sorrow for the deaths, and blamed human traffickers who profit while offering migrants the false prospect of a safe journey. The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so, first of all by calling for maximum cooperation from the countries of departure and of origin, she said. Melonis administration has said migrant rescue charities are encouraging migrants to make the dangerous sea journey to Italy, and sometimes work in partnership with traffickers. Charities strongly reject both accusations. Stopping, blocking and hindering the work of NGOs (non-governmental organisations) will have only one effect: the death of vulnerable people left without help, Spanish migrant rescue charity Open Arms tweeted in reaction to Sundays shipwreck. However, the coast off Calabria is not routinely patrolled by NGO ships, which operate in the waters south of Sicily. That suggests they would have been unlikely to intercept the shipwrecked migrants regardless of Melonis crackdown. The head of the Italian Catholic Church, Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, called for the resumption of an EU search and rescue mission in the Mediterranean, as part of a structural, shared and humanitarian response to the migration crisis. A spokesman for the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM), in the same vein, appealed on Twitter for the strengthening of rescue operations in the Mediterranean. Flavio Di Giacomo also called for the opening of more regular migration channels to Europe, and action to address what he said were the multiple causes pushing people to try the sea crossings. Earlier on Sunday, Pope Francis, the son of Italian migrants to Argentina and long a vocal advocate for migrants rights, said he was praying for the shipwrecks victims. Italy is one of the main landing points for migrants trying to enter Europe by sea, with many seeking to travel on to richer northern European nations. But do to so, they must brave the worlds most dangerous migration route. The United Nations Missing Migrants Project has registered more than 17,000 deaths and disappearances in the central Mediterranean since 2014. More than 220 have died or disappeared this year, it estimates. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "February 27, 2023 08:07 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas tea production is expected to fully recover next year after last years drop, the countrys Environment Minister Naseer Ahamed said. The tea industry, a key foreign exchange earner, saw its output decline by 16 per cent to 251.5 million kilogrammes in 2022. The production has dropped because of the fertilizer issue. It will recover by next year, Naseer told Bernama in New Delhi. He was in India to attend an environment summit organised by the Energy and Resources Institute, a not-for-profit organisation. The previous Sri Lankan government of Gotabaya Rajapaksa had banned the use of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides in its organic agriculture experiment in April 2021. It led to a significant drop in crop yields, forcing the government to revoke the move in November that year. Fuel, food and fertilizers were among the key essential goods that were in short supply as Sri Lanka was hit by its worst economic crisis in 2022. Naseer said the fertilizer issue is now permanently resolved as the country is again using agrochemicals. He said tea production will definitely reach its normal levels next year. Sri Lanka earned about US1.3 billion from 250.19 million kg tea exports last year, according to the Tea Exporters Association. The country also aims to grow its tea export competitiveness and earnings. We will have more value-added products. In another two years, the value of exports will be much more, Naseer said.

        "date": "February 27, 2023 11:19 am",
        "content": "The US Department of Energy has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic most likely came from a laboratory leak in China, according to a newly updated classified intelligence report. Two sources said that the Department of Energy assessed in the intelligence report that it had low confidence the Covid-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means that the information obtained is not reliable enough or is too fragmented to make a more definitive analytic judgment or that there is not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion. The latest assessment further adds to the divide in the US government over whether the Covid-19 pandemic began in China in 2019 as the result of a lab leak or whether it emerged naturally. The various intelligence agencies have been split on the matter for years. In 2021, the intelligence community declassified a report that showed four agencies in the intelligence community had assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident. Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, the report said. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the new assessment from the Department of Energy. A senior US intelligence official told the Journal that the update to the intelligence assessment was conducted in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and in consultation with experts outside government. A Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN in a statement: The Department of Energy continues to support the thorough, careful, and objective work of our intelligence professionals in investigating the origins of COVID-19, as the President directed. The Department of Energys Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is one of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, which are under the umbrella of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Not a definitive answer National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday that the intelligence community remains divided on the matter, while noting that President Joe Biden has put resources into getting to the bottom of the origin question. Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question, Sullivan told CNNs Dana Bash. Some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just dont have enough information to be sure. Sullivan said Biden had directed the national laboratories, which are part of the Department of Energy, to be brought into the assessment. In May 2020, researchers at the government-backed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory issued a classified report that found it was possible that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, which came at a time when that line of inquiry was considered taboo. The US began exploring the possibility that Covid-19 spread in a laboratory as early as April 2020, though the intelligence community has noted repeatedly that a lack of cooperation from Beijing has made it difficult to get to the bottom of the question. Republicans react The latest intelligence assessment was provided to Congress as Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pushing for further investigation into the lab leak theory, while accusing the Biden administration of playing down its possibility. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul said Sunday he was pleased that the Department of Energy has finally reached the same conclusion that I had already come to. I have requested a full and thorough briefing from the administration on this report and the evidence behind it, the Texas Republican said in a statement. McCaul in his statement referred to a 2021 report he had released as ranking member of the Foreign Affairs panel, which found a preponderance of the evidence proved that the pandemic originated with a leak from the Wuhan lab. The chairman called on the Biden administration to publicly concur with that conclusion. It is critical the administration also begin to work immediately with our partners and allies around the world to both hold the (Chinese Communist Party) accountable and to put in place updated international regulations to ensure something like this cannot happen again, McCaul said. Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska on Sunday called for public hearings following the disclosure of the Department of Energy assessment. We need to do extensive hearings. I hope our Democratic colleagues in the Congress can support that. I know the Republicans in the House are certainly supportive of that, the Senate Armed Services Committee member said on NBCs Meet the Press. Think about what just happened over the last three years, one of the biggest pandemics in a century. A lot of evidence that its coming from the Chinese, Sullivan said. A spokesperson for House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement that the committee was reviewing the classified information provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to a letter requesting information earlier this month. One of the sources said that the new assessment from the Department of Energy is similar to information from a House Republican Intelligence Committee report released last year on the origins of the virus.

        "title": "Despite crisis, its good time to invest in Sri Lanka, say Colombo-based Indian CEOs",
        "date": "February 27, 2023 01:08 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is reeling under last years crushing economic meltdown and consequent political turmoil, but it is still a good time to invest in the cash-strapped island nation, according to Indian business leaders in capital Colombo. While acknowledging the many challenges facing the business community in Sri Lanka, the CEOs of Indian companies point to enormous scope for foreign direct investment in a host of sectors, such as information technology, tourism, and renewable energy. Investor sentiment outside Sri Lanka was rather negative last year, mainly due to the kind of international media coverage of the crisis here, but there is a welcome, positive shift compared to June last year, when the crisis escalated, notes Ashish Chandra, CED and MD, Airtel Lanka. Essential supplies have been restored, there is no social unrest, the government has taken many important steps for economic recovery, he says. T.S. Prakash, Country Head of the Umesh Modi Group of Companies, highlights political stability and policy stability as the two main factors that businesses look for. We are confident that the Sri Lankan authorities are taking the rights steps to achieve both in the next few years, he says. Policy measures On the policy front, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently said his government has implemented 15 tasks  including a sharp hike in interest rates, and in fuel and energy pricing  set out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose 2.9 billion package Sri Lanka is desperately hoping for, to expedite its economic recovery. Politically, his government faces mounting criticism, over the rising cost of living, and more recently, on the postponement of the local government elections owing to the lack of adequate funds. However the Indian businessmens optimism, they say, stems from their experience of doing business in Sri Lanka for decades, in sectors spanning transportation, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and technology. We have seen ups and downs but where there is a problem, there is certainly an opportunity, says Mr. Prakash, who is also the President of the Indian CEO Forum that includes leaders of nearly 70 companies. Of those, 38 are Indian companies and the rest are multinational corporations led by Indians based in Sri Lanka. Representatives of this organised forum for Indian businesses in Sri Lanka periodically meet with the Sri Lankan authorities, at the highest levels. In the recent months, they have met the President more than once, apart from holding discussions with the Prime Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank. Resilient Indian investors The standard of living in Sri Lanka is very good. Citizens have an admirable civic sense, it is a very safe country, says Umesh Gautam, CEO, Lanka Ashok Leyland, one of the oldest Indian investments in Sri Lanka. Our main objective is to grow with Sri Lanka, we will continue to be here no matter what. Most mature Indian investments, especially from public listed companies, have rarely shown losses in Sri Lanka. They have been very resilient. According to Kishore D. Reddy, Managing Director, Platinum Realty Investments and President, Sri Lanka India Society, the nearly 70 companies in Sri Lanka that are part of the Indian CEO Forum employ about 20,000 Sri Lankans. Thats right from the junior level to very senior level management, offering good opportunities for training and skill development. There are only a handful of Indians. And importantly, there were no layoffs during the pandemic or the crisis in any of our companies, he says. It is not that business was smooth for the Indian companies during the crisis, that too with the government slapping import restrictions to save foreign exchange, and amid soaring production costs. The import restrictions and the rise in costs since certainly impacted production, but the Indian investments carried on, at times with support from their parent companies in India, but mainly with a resolve to continue operations. At the height of the crisis last year, the Life Insurance Corporation of India approved an investment of LKR 600 million (roughly 13.20 crore) in LIC Lanka. Further, the companies undertook many CSR initiatives at the community level, the CEOs note. Need for structural changes All the same, the business heads underscore the need for some structural changes in Sri Lanka to augment foreign investments, especially when the challenge of costs is so stark, following the drastic depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee, by nearly 45  against the US dollar in 2022. The ease of doing business must improve, they underscore, suggesting that a single window regulatory process be put in place to help save costs and time, and give incentive for new investors to come in. As someone engaged in businesses in Sri Lanka for decades now, I can tell you there is enormous potential for investments in the agriculture, tourism, information technology, renewable energy, and education sectors. These are low hanging fruits, Mr. Reddy notes, inviting Indian companies to explore the sectors. Investors must remember that Sri Lanka is a country of 22 million people and small and medium investments tend to do very well over time, especially if they are consumption-oriented, rather than export-driven, the CEOs point out.

Three private banks will receive the facility to fund about 30 of imports, including medicine, food and fertiliser, the IFC said in a statement on February 27. The funds will provide a much-needed foreign exchange cushion for Sri Lanka, which is grappling with its worst financial crisis in over seven decades partly triggered by a severe shortage of dollars. The island nations economy is estimated to have contracted by 9.2 in 2022 and is expected to shrink a further 4.2 in 2023, according to World Bank data. We expect this financing to boost confidence in the investor community, attract fresh capital inflows to support the Sri Lankan economy, said Joon Young Park, IFCs Portfolio Manager, Financial Institutions Group for South Asia. IFC is also working on further plans to support client banks with other long-term funding and advisory services in the future, the statement added. Sri Lanka signed a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 2.9 billion bailout last September but has to put its debt on a sustainable repayment track before the funds can be disbursed.

        "date": "February 27, 2023 03:29 pm",
        "content": "Nokia announced plans on Sunday to change its brand identity for the first time in nearly 60 years, complete with a new logo, as the telecom equipment maker focuses on aggressive growth. The new logo comprises five different shapes forming the word NOKIA. The iconic blue color of the old logo has been dropped for a range of colours depending on the use. There was the association to smartphones and nowadays we are a business technology company, Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark told Reuters in an interview. He was speaking ahead of a business update by the company on the eve of the annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) which opens in Barcelona on Monday and runs until March 2. After taking over the top job at the struggling Finnish company in 2020, Lundmark set out a strategy with three stages: reset, accelerate and scale. With the reset stage now complete, Lundmark said the second stage is beginning. While Nokia still aims to grow its service provider business, where it sells equipment to telecom companies, its main focus is now to sell gear to other businesses. We had very good 21 growth last year in enterprise, which is currently about 8 of our sales, (or) 2 billion euros (2.11 billion) roughly, Lundmark said. We want to take that to double digits as quickly as possible. Major technology firms have been partnering with telecom gear makers such as Nokia to sell private 5G networks and gears for automated factories to customers, mostly in the manufacturing sector. Nokia plans to review the growth path of its different businesses and consider alternatives, including divestment. The signal is very clear. We only want to be in businesses where we can see global leadership, Lundmark said. Nokias move toward factory automation and datacentres will also see them locking horns with big tech companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon. There will be multiple different types of cases, sometimes they will be our partners ... sometimes they can be our customers... and I am sure that there will also be situations where they will be competitors. The market to sell telecom gear is under pressure with macro environment denting demand from high-margin markets such as North America, being replaced by growth in low-margin India, pushing rival Ericsson to lay off 8,500 employees. India is our fastest growing market that has lower margins - this is a structural change, Lundmark said, adding that Nokia expects North America to be stronger in the second half of the year.

        "date": "February 27, 2023 03:58 pm",
        "content": "Absurdist sci-fi comedy Everything Everywhere All At Once continued its dominance of this years Hollywood award shows by earning top honors from the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday. The film about a Chinese-American family undergoing a tax audit who end up fighting a universe-hopping supervillain also won best actress for Michelle Yeoh, best supporting actor for Ke Huy Quan, and best supporting actress for Jamie Lee Curtis. The movies 94-year-old patriarch James Hong stole the show at Sundays gala, collecting the nights final prize of best cast in a motion picture -- the star-studded ceremonys equivalent of best film. Hong reflected on how Hollywood once cast white actors with their eyes taped up to play leading Asian roles because producers thought the Asians are not good enough and they are not box office. But look at us now, huh? he said, to a huge ovation. The SAG prizes from the actors union round out a month in which Everything Everywhere has won best film from directors and producers groups too, making it firm favorite for the Oscars next month. Voted on by more than 120,000 members of Hollywoods acting union, the SAG awards are an important precursor for the Academy Awards, whose largest voting bloc is also actors. The Oscars will take place this year on March 12. Other winners from the mainly Asian cast of Everything Everywhere also referred to Hollywoods long struggle with diversity. This isnt just for me, this is for every little girl who looks like me, said Yeoh. Quan, who after appearing as a child in 1984s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom took a long hiatus from acting because there were so few opportunities, noted he was the first Asian actor to win his category. When I heard this, I quickly realized that this moment no longer belongs to just me. It also belongs to everyone who has asked for change, he said. And Curtis addressed the recent nepo baby controversy, which has called out children of powerful industry figures and stars perceived to have received a leg up in their own careers. I know you look at me and think nepo baby, thats why shes there, and I totally get it, said the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. But the truth of the matter is Im 64 years old and this is just amazing, said Curtis, lifting her SAG statuette to loud applause. Brendan Fraser, who won best lead actor, was the only performer from a film other than Everything Everywhere to win a movie prize Sunday. Fraser, one of Hollywoods biggest stars in the late 1990s and early 2000s with hits like The Mummy, endured a long fallow period, before being cast as a morbidly obese teacher in The Whale. In the television sections, The White Lotus won the top drama prize, and Abbott Elementary was named best comedy ensemble. Source - AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "February 27, 2023 11:56 pm",
        "content": "LONDON (AP)  The U.K. and the European Union sealed a deal on Monday to resolve their thorny post-Brexit trade dispute over Northern Ireland, hailing the agreement as the start of a new chapter in their often fractious relationship. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the grandly titled Windsor Framework after agreeing to the final details in Windsor, near London. Von der Leyen told a news conference it was historic what we have achieved today. Sunak said there had been a decisive breakthrough. The agreement, which will allow goods to flow freely to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K., ends a dispute that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and shaken Northern Irelands decades-old peace process. Fixing it ends a long-running irritant for von der Leyen and is a big victory for Sunak  but not the end of his troubles. Selling the deal to his own Conservative Party and its Northern Irish allies may be a tougher struggle. Now Sunak awaits the judgment of Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party, which is boycotting the regions power-sharing government until the trade arrangements are changed to its satisfaction. Sunak is due to make a statement to the House of Commons later setting out details of the deal. Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Irelands peace process. Instead, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Irelands place in the United Kingdom. The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Irelands Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten. The partys leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said there had been significant progress but key issues of concern remained. He said the party would study the details before responding. The devil, as ever, will be in those details, and the two sides emphasized different elements of the deal. Sunak said the new rules removed any sense of a border in the Irish Sea by eliminating checks and paperwork for the vast majority of goods entering Northern Ireland. Only those destined to travel onward to EU member Ireland will be checked. He said Northern Irelands lawmakers would be able to block any changes to EU goods laws that applied to them by using an emergency mechanism labeled the Stormont Brake after the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Todays agreement delivers smooth-flowing trade within the whole United Kingdom, protects Northern Irelands place in our union and safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland, Sunak said. Von der Leyen stressed that the EUs borderless single market would be protected by safeguards including IT access, labels and enforcement procedures and said the European Court of Justice would remain the sole and ultimate arbiter of EU law. The role of the European court in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules has been the thorniest issue in the talks. The U.K. and the EU agreed in their Brexit divorce deal to give the European court that authority. But the DUP and Conservative Party euroskeptics insist the court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters. The British pound rose against the dollar after the deal was announced, and business groups welcomed the agreement. Tony Danker, who heads the Confederation of British Industry, said it would allow businesses and politicians to turn their attention to economic growth and delivering greater prosperity. Sunak will have to face down his Conservative critics  including former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who as leader at the time signed off on the trade rules that he now derides. Johnson was ousted by the Conservatives last year over ethics scandals, but is widely believed to hope for a comeback. In a boost for Sunaks chances of winning Conservative support, lawmaker Steve Baker  a self-styled Brexit hardman who helped topple Prime Minister Theresa May by opposing her Brexit deal in 2019  said he was delighted with the agreement. Sunak said lawmakers in Parliament would get a vote on the deal at the appropriate time, but not right away. Even if Sunak faces a rocky road at home, the deal likely marks a dramatic improvement in relations with the EU. They were severely tested during the long Brexit divorce and chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Under Johnson, the U.K. government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. Sunaks government said the bill would now be dropped. Von der Leyen said the deal was good news for scientists and researchers because it would allow the U.K. to be readmitted to the blocs Horizon science program. The EU had been blocking that until the trade dispute was fixed, to the chagrin of British scientists. After sealing the deal, Von der Leyen had tea with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of London. Buckingham Palace said the meeting was taking place on the governments advice, leading critics to accuse Sunak of dragging the monarch, who is supposed to remain neutral, into a political row. Sunaks spokesman, Max Blain, said the government would never embroil the king in politics. His Majesty has met with a number of foreign leaders recently, he said, including Polish President Andrzej Duda and Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is no different. ___ Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "February 28, 2023 08:25 am",
        "content": "At least half a million people in Sri Lanka lost their jobs in 2022, the majority of them being employed women and those in the industry and services sectors, the World Bank says. According to the Vice President for the South Asia Region of the World Bank Group, those already classified as poor in Sri Lanka have seen a 65 increase in their cost of living, while the increase was 57 for the non-poor, highlighting the significant loss of welfare for all Sri Lankans. In a piece of writing on the islands crisis situation, Raiser attributed Sri Lankas economic adversity to years of economic mismanagement, weak governance, poor policy choices and the impacts of external shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic and Russias invasion of Ukraine. Raiser noted that the depth of the crisis has made it clear that Sri Lanka needs a new development model. However, the road to recovery is challenging and the necessary fiscal adjustment measures can be painful, he added. According to Raiser, debt relief from Sri Lankas creditors and fresh financing from international financial institutions are thus urgent to ensure people dont lose patience with reforms and the opportunity for a change is not lost. Stating that the economic crisis has left deep scars, Raiser raised concerns about poverty in Sri Lanka, which nearly doubled in Sri Lanka between 2021 and 2022, climbing from 13 to a staggering 25 (using a poverty line of  3.65 per person per day), and is projected to increase by more than 2 percentage points in 2023. In the same timeframe, urban poverty tripled from 5 to 15. Sri Lankas people have been forced to quickly adapt to a new reality where prospects for a good job are limited, incomes are lowered and eroded by inflation, and opportunities for a better future are becoming increasingly rare. Raiser urged the international community to help Sri Lanka strike the right balance between pursuing critical reforms to get the economy back on track and ensuring that people have access to safety nets, better jobs, and economic opportunities. As Sri Lanka recovers, Raiser said it is essential not only to help people escape poverty and vulnerability, but also to strengthen their resilience to future shocks in an increasingly volatile world. Further, Raiser called this pivotal moment Sri Lanka is facing at present a chance to reset its development model towards green, resilient, and inclusive growth.",

        "date": "February 28, 2023 09:37 am",
        "content": "Canada on Monday announced a ban on Chinese-owned social media app TikTok from government-issued devices, saying it presents an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security, adding to the growing rift between the two countries. The move underscores the growing lobby against TikTok, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance Ltd, over concerns about its proximity to Beijing and hold over user data across the world. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that his government was looking carefully at how to ensure Canadians online safety. This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take, he said referring to the action against TikTok. As government bans TikTok on work phones, many Canadians, businesses and private individuals will reflect on the security of their own data and perhaps make choices in consequence, he said. TikTok initially said it was disappointed by the decision, but later issued another statement to note that it was curious that Canada moved to block the app only after similar bans in the European Union and the United States. The ban was issued without citing any specific security concern or contacting us with questions, a TikTok spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The European Commission imposed a similar ban last week, while the U.S. Senate in December passed a bill to bar federal employees from using the app on government-owned devices. India banned TikTok in 2020. TENSE RELATIONS Canadas action presents another potential thorn in Sino-Canadian relations which have been tense in recent years for various reasons, most recently over accusations by Ottawa that China has tried to influence its elections and that it has been running air and maritime surveillance activities. Beijing denies those allegations and has urged Ottawa to stop what it has described as unwarranted speculation and smearing. Ottawa has also previously excluded Chinese firms from Canadas critical minerals and telecommunication sectors, citing risks to its national security. In November, it ordered three Chinese companies divest their investments in Canadian critical minerals and before that it banned the use of 5G gear made by Huawei Technologies Co Ltds RIC:RIC:HWT.UL and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ). Last week, Canadas federal and three provincial privacy regulators said they were jointly investigating TikTok over concerns about the platforms collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The Treasury Board said in its statement that the decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice. The Communications Security Establishments Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) guidance strongly recommends that Canadians understand the risks and make an informed choice on their own before deciding what tools to use.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the nod to amend the Social Security Contribution Levy to exempt the purchasing of paddy, and the production and sale of rice from the tax. The proposal was tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policy. Rice manufacturers have complained that they have to incur additional costs for electricity, water and transportation during the production process in addition to the payment made to the farmers for paddy stocks purchased from them while Rs. 6 - Rs. 7 per 1 kilogram of rice is charged from them for the Social Security Contribution Levy. If the production cost is moderated, the rice manufacturers say they will be able to purchase paddy from the farmers at higher prices. Taking these matters into account, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to the proposal to amend the Social Security Contribution Levy Act to exempt the paddy purchase and rice production and sale from the tax. By freeing the paddy purchase, and the rice production and sale from the Social Security Contribution Levy, the government expects to enable the mill owners to purchase 1kg of Nadu for more than Rs. 100 from the farmers, while maintaining the maximum retail price of rice per kilogram at its current rates. The Cabinet of Ministers has also given the approval to provide rice free of charge for low-income families.",

        "date": "February 28, 2023 10:40 am",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to establish a National Contributory Pension Fund for new public service employees and those who have joined the public service after January 2016, with an 8 contribution from the employee and 12 from the employer. Joining the Cabinet press conference held this morning (Feb. 28), the Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Bandula Gunawardene stated that the government has recognized the fact it is desirable to establish a fund in order to provide a pension with certain benefits to the individuals who retire from the public service. It will also ensure that the pensioner would be able to live on their own without being a burden to the government post-retirement, he said. Accordingly, an independent body governed by a board of management will be set up to manage the proposed Contributory Pension Fund and a specially qualified fund manager will be in charge of the funds. The proposed National Contributory Pension scheme will be applicable to newly recruited government employees as well as employees recruited into the public service after January 2016 since their letters of appointment provide that they will be entitled to a pension scheme decided by the government. Thus, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal presented by the President to instruct the draftsman to prepare a bill to make necessary arrangements to establish the National Contributory Pension Fund.",

        "content": "The chairpersons of the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) both emphasized that their respective banks are ready to serve their customers tomorrow (March 01), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. They expressed their confidence that it is the responsibility of all public servants to support the governments program to build the countrys economy, and that bank employees will do the same. These issues were revealed at a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat today (Feb 28) regarding matters in the banking industry. The discussion was attended by the heads of state banks and trade union representatives, as well as the Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidents Staff, Sagala Ratnayake, and the Presidents Secretary, Saman Ekanayake. There was extensive discussion about how to keep the banking operations running so that government programs are not disrupted and customers are not inconvenienced. Mr. Sagala Ratnayake pointed out that it is not a good situation for the country to send the message to the international community that the banking system is inactive at a time when the government has taken extensive measures to create financial stability in the country. Although it is a common tradition to issue circulars containing arrangements such as handing over the keys on the day of the strike, handing over the keys to safes containing gold, etc., when bank employees take union action, this has not occurred in relation to the joint bank union action scheduled to take place tomorrow. This was revealed during the discussion. Accordingly, the Chairmen and the main management of the Banks agreed that the steps will be taken soon. Ronald Perera, Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon, added that the banking systems support is required for the governments economic development program, and he urges all bank employees not to neglect their responsibilities to the country. Sujeewa Rajapaksa, Chairman of the Peoples Bank, stated that steps have been taken and are currently being discussed to address issues with current tax collection. He also stated that it is everyones responsibility to help improve the countrys future by cooperating with understanding at this time when the entire country is experiencing economic difficulties. Commenting further Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon Ronald C. Perera said: This country is now in a very difficult economic situation. In this situation, several trade unions have announced a strike tomorrow. As Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon, I request that our employees return to work tomorrow because the Bank of Ceylon provides excellent service to its customers. If the bank is closed for even one day, the entire country will suffer greatly. Furthermore, trade unions demand that the government should make decisions on tax collection and tax rate reductions. As a result, we have discussed this matter with the government. These issues, we believe, will be resolved in the near future. I strongly urge the employees to report for duty on behalf of the bank and its customers. Peoples Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapaksa further said: Several trade unions have organized a strike for tomorrow. As Chairman of the Peoples Bank, I request that you report to work as Peoples Bank employees. Peoples Bank makes a significant contribution to the economy of this country. We serve a large number of people and customers, as well as economic operators. As a result, we ask that you report to duty as usual and complete the necessary tasks to keep the service running. At this time, we ask that you refrain from acting in a way that will harm the government, country, or economy. Presidents Economic Senior Advisor Dr R H S Samaratunga and Director General of Trade Unions Saman Rathnapriya were also present at the discussion.",

        "date": "March 1, 2023 12:00 am",
        "content": "Amnesty International says it is worrying that even after months of widespread protests in the country, Sri Lanka Police need to be constantly reminded of their duty to facilitate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and exercise restraint in the use of force while policing assemblies. The international rights organizations Regional Researcher for the Right to Protest, Harindrini Corea made this remark responding to the reports of the death of a protestor who was hospitalized after the police fired tear gas and used water cannons in Colombo on Sunday (Feb 26) to disperse a group of demonstrators of the National Peoples Power (NPP) demanding elections. The deceased was identified as a Local Government election candidate of the NPP who was vying for the Nivithigala Pradeshiya Sabha. The 61-year-old was admitted to the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo after sustaining an eye injury during the protest. Speaking further in this regard, Corea noted that less lethal weapons that have indiscriminate effects and a high potential for harm must not be used where there is no widespread violence against persons during a peaceful assembly, adding that videos from Sunday show that the protesters were in a confined space without the possibility for dispersal or escape and yet the police used water cannons and tear gas in violation of international human rights law and standards on the use of force. Corea went on to call for prompt independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of human rights violations, including the deaths reported in the context of the protests, so that all those found responsible are brought to justice in fair trials.",

        "date": "March 1, 2023 07:42 am",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka has ruled that the provisions of the Right to Information (RTI) Act are relevant to parliamentarians as well and that they are legally bound to declare their assets and liabilities. This ruling was delivered by an Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Sampath Abeykoon and P. Kumaran Ratnam, upholding a decree by the RTI Commission that had directed the Secretary General of Parliament to publicize a list of parliamentarians who have submitted declarations on their assets and liabilities. Stressing the fact that lawmakers are representatives appointed by the members of the public, Appeals Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon mentioned that the provisions of the RTI Act are applicable to them as well. The Appeals Court ruling notes that parliamentarians are legally bound to declare their assets and liabilities, as they are maintained by the public. Judge Abeykoon explained that failing to abide by this is an unlawful act, punishable by a prison sentence not exceeding one year, or a fine no less than Rs. 1,000, or both. On June 21, 2021, journalist Chamara Sampath, directing a letter to the Secretary General of Parliament, had sought a list of parliamentarians who have declared their assets and liabilities. He later filed a complaint with the RTI Commission after the Secretary General of Parliament rejected his request. After probing the matter, the RTI Commission had ordered the Information Officer of Parliament to provide the information requested by the said journalist. However, the Secretary General of Parliament filed a petition before the Appeals Court, challenging the RTI Commissions order. Following a lengthy trial, the Appeals Court judge bench ruled that the particulars mentioned on the petition are baseless. Accordingly, the judge bench, backing the order given by the RTI Commission on February 02, 2021, dismissed the petition put forward by the Secretary General of Parliament.",

The poison attacks at more than 30 schools in at least four cities started in November in Irans Shiite Muslim holy city of Qom, prompting some parents to take their children out of school, state media reported. Social media posts showed some hospitalised schoolgirls, who said they had felt nauseous and suffered heart palpitations.
