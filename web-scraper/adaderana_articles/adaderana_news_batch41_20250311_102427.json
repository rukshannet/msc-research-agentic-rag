        "content": "Requesting newly elected president of Sri Lanka, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, to make a fresh beginning by using his sovereign Presidential powers and order the release of all Indian fishermen languishing in Sri Lankan jails as a token of goodwill and love, Indias Congress MP, R Sudha, who was recently elected from Mayiladuthurai constituency, said such a gesture will add a lot of muscle to his avowed objective of giving Sri Lanka a new direction. In an open-hearted and open minded letter to Dissanayake, the Indian MP asked the Sri Lankan President to release the fishermen and return all their boats in good usable condition as early as possible as a token of goodwill and love and said that such a gesture would add a lot of muscle to his avowed objective of giving Sri Lanka a new direction. A good beginning could be made by releasing the 37 fishermen from Mayiladuthurai constituency, she said, adding that 80 other fishermen and 173 fishing boats were under the custody of Sri Lanka. India shares maritime boundaries with several nations, including such a belligerent neighbour like Pakistan. But, no country arrests, fines, damages and attacks fishermen from neighbouring countries so regularly as Sri Lanka does. The provocations come from the Sri Lankan side far too regularly, testing the patience and peace in the region. Fishermen cannot be treated like criminals for fishing in common waters like the Bay of Bengal, she said. But that was in the past, she said, adding: Now that you are at the helm, promising a fresh beginning, new outlook and prosperity for your nation, I request you to use your sovereign Presidential powers.

        "title": "Fitch affirms Sri Lanka at Restricted Default",
        "date": "September 25, 2024 06:21 pm",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at RD (Restricted Default) and Long-Term Local-Currency IDR at CCC-. Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks to issuers with a rating of CCC or below. The rating agency said sovereign remains in default on Sri Lankas foreign-currency obligations, while restructuring negotiations are ongoing with Sri Lankas private external creditors. The authorities recent announcement that a preliminary debt restructuring agreement has been reached, in principle, with members of the steering committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders (representing foreign holders of Sri Lankas international sovereign bonds) and China Development Bank (ANegative) suggests progress is being made. The agreement comes after the 12 April 2022 announcement suspending debt servicing on several categories of external debt, including bonds issued in international capital markets, foreign currency-denominated loans and credit facilities with commercial banks and institutional lenders. Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR has been on RD since May 2022, once the grace period expired. Fitch said it believes the result of Sri Lankas 2024 Presidential election add uncertainty to the countrys policy direction and could lead to a delay in the completion of the foreign-currency debt restructuring or renegotiation of the IMF programme. The upcoming 2025 budget, to be adopted by November 2024, could offer clarity on the new governments policies, the statement said. The statement by Fitch Ratings further stated: Policy Uncertainty Following Elections: Sri Lankas September 2024 Presidential election was won by one of the opposition leaders. Fitch believes the result add uncertainty to the countrys policy direction and could lead to a delay in the completion of the foreign-currency debt restructuring or renegotiation of the IMF programme. The upcoming 2025 budget, to be adopted by November 2024, could offer clarity on the new governments policies. Local-Currency Debt Exchange Complete: Sri Lanka completed the local-currency portion of its domestic debt optimisation in September 2023. This followed the exchange of the Central Bank of Sri Lankas treasury bills and provisional advance into new treasury bonds and bills. This led us to upgrade the Local-Currency IDR to CCC-. The rating is being affirmed at this level. Government Debt to Stay High: The IMF forecasts Sri Lankas gross general government debtGDP ratio to decline only gradually to about 103 of GDP by 2028, from about 116 in 2022. This forecast incorporates a local- and foreign-currency debt restructuring scenario. However, this level of debt would still be elevated, even after the restructuring. External Metrics Improving: Foreign-currency (FX) reserves have been improving, with gross FX reserves reaching around USD6.0 billion in August 2024, against USD4.4 billion at end-2023, partly due to the suspension of external debt service. Other supporting factors include an uptick in tourism and overseas worker remittances. The current account was in a surplus in 2023 and we expect a surplus in 2024. The sovereign, however, remains dependent on official financing sources without access to international capital markets. Stronger Revenue Generation: Weak IMF program implementation, in particular of fiscal measures, remains a risk to achieving debt sustainability. Sri Lanka has a weak longer-term revenue raising record, but the authorities have implemented several major tax measures since May 2022 to boost revenue collection and achieve debt sustainability. These included raising the corporate income tax rate, hikes to the value-added tax rate and raising fuel excise taxes. This saw revenue collection improve by 42 yoy in 1H24. Additional fiscal measures in the pipeline include an increase in the corporate income tax to 45, from 40, for certain types of economic activity, an additional value-added tax rate on the supply of digital services, further tax administration reforms as well as limiting tax exemptions and making them more transparent. Economy on a Recovering Trend: We expect economic growth to recover to 3.9 in 2024 and average at 3.6 over 2025-2026. Real GDP growth, in seasonally adjusted terms, recovered to about 5.0 yoy in 1H24 after contracting by 7.0 during 1H23, driven by a pick-up in industrial growth to 11.3 after a contraction of about 18.0 in 1H23. Services also recovered by about 2.7 during the same period after a contraction in 1H23. Inflation in Check: We expect further easing of monetary policy over 2024-2026, after the Central Bank of Sri Lanka reduced the standing deposit facility rate by a cumulative 725bp since June 2023, as underlying inflationary pressure remains muted. Inflation was about 0.6 in August 2024, in seasonally adjusted terms, and has been in the single digits for over a year. A surge in inflation, peaking in September 2022 at around 67, was successfully curtailed by the central bank. Banking Sector Stabilising: The banking sectors non-performing loans remain high, partly owing to the economic stress associated with the sovereign default. However, the domestic bank operating environment continues to show signs of stabilisation, in line with improved economic indicators. This supports the recovery in banks operational flexibility. The completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lankas domestic debt optimisation was a major step towards reducing the impact of the sovereigns debt restructuring on the banking sector. ESG - Governance: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Political Stability and Rights as well as for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption. These scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model (SRM). Sri Lanka has a medium WBGI ranking in the 36th percentile, reflecting a recent record of peaceful political transitions, a moderate level of rights for participation in the political process, moderate institutional capacity, established rule of law and a moderate level of corruption. ESG - Creditor Rights: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Creditor Rights, as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. The affirmation of Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at RD reflects a default event.",

Before implementing long-term and medium-term plans for that purpose, we will work to create a short-term stability through the immediate economic measures that are required, he said, delivering his inaugural address to the nation on Wednesday (25). President Dissanayake says all steps needed for the expected change depend on building stability and trust in the economy. Therefore, discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will resume soon and the process of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) will be advanced, he said. The change we seek involves many steps that will take time. However, achieving stability and confidence in the current economy is crucial. We plan to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund immediately and proceed with activities related to the extended credit facility, Dissanayake said. He further said that the debt restructuring process will continue, and steps will be taken to bring about debt relief as soon as possible through discussions with relevant parties. Additionally, to advance our debt restructuring program, we are negotiating with relevant creditors to expedite the process and secure necessary debt relief. We are confident that we can gain the support of both the people of this country and the international community, and we believe that through this collective support, we can achieve success.

Read the full speech below President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes inaugural address to the nation Esteemed Maha Sangha and Religious Leaders, Parents, Brothers, Sisters and Children; I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the people of this country who have listened to our voices over the decades and breathed life into the programs we proposed. We believe that the victory you have given us will be even more strengthened if it brings joy to those who may not have agreed with our vision. Therefore, I want to dedicate this victory to all citizens of our nation. We honour and remember the courageous men and women of previous generations who made sacrifices, some with their lives, for this victory. I see this victory and the prosperous nation we aim to build as a tribute to their legacy. We believe that all people, including those who trusted us despite slander, falsehoods, and misinformation, and elected our political movement with great determination have the strength to shoulder the responsibility of building this nation together. We are capable of fulfilling this role as a united team, and we have a talented team dedicated to this mission. Our determination is unwavering. The change we seek involves many steps that will take time. However, achieving stability and confidence in the current economy is crucial. We plan to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund immediately and proceed with activities related to the extended credit facility. Additionally, to advance our debt restructuring program, we are negotiating with relevant creditors to expedite the process and secure necessary debt relief. We are confident that we can gain the support of both the people of this country and the international community, and we believe that through this collective support, we can achieve success. A key concept that resonates with the public is our commitment to making a difference. One of the primary changes citizens expect is to eliminate the negative traits in our political culture. Our track record thus far supports this commitment. Notably, we succeeded in making the presidential election the only one in Sri Lanka without reports of post-election violence, which reflects the trust the people have placed in us. Our aim is to confirm and stabilize this positive situation. At this moment, I want to highlight the importance of engaging in politics with a collective focus on building our country. We are committed to providing that leadership. Regardless of whether one identifies as Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, or Malay, our nation will not thrive until we create a practical environment where everyone can proudly say, We are Sri Lankan citizens. We will not hesitate to implement the necessary constitutional, economic, and political reforms. We are launching a permanent program to build a unified Sri Lankan nation that respects diversity, fully ending the era of division based on race, religion, class, and caste. We have already taken significant steps to appoint efficient and honest officials to oversee these initiatives. We are advancing steadily toward the desired changes, ensuring that public service remains intact and citizens are not adversely affected. We are committed to creating a law-abiding nation and fostering a disciplined society while ensuring the social security of all citizens. This revives the principle that everyone is equal before the law. We believe that public service plays a crucial role in nation-building. To that end, we will establish a public service that instills pride in the community and aligns with the governments goals. Our commitment is to create an efficient, honest, and people-focused public service. Our goal is to improve the standard of living for the people of this country. We are implementing practical programs to alleviate the heavy burdens faced by our citizens. No parent in this country should have to worry about their childs future. Every parent deserves the right to provide their child with access to quality schools and education. We are fully committed to securing the future of the next generation by ensuring excellent education for all children. By fostering knowledge, attitudes, and skills, we are building a promising future for the young generation of our country. When we visit a country, the airport often offers a first impression, reflecting its order, the behaviour of its people, their work ethic, and cultural practices. It also reveals the countrys cleanliness, how vehicles are driven, how the elderly are treated, the hospitality shown, and even how animals are cared for. We have developed clear plans to enhance Sri Lankas image in these areas, with short-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives already underway. Our goal is to create a nation where the world respects our passport, and where every citizen can proudly say, I am a Sri Lankan. We aim to build a country where citizenship is a source of pride for all. Achieving this vision will require the collective effort of every citizen. We are committed to creating a system that upholds social justice for all, and we will do so with the highest sense of responsibility. We are building a secure future for our children and youth through a program that promotes knowledge, skills, education, and entrepreneurship. The women in our community, who make up over 52 of our population, play a vital role in both the economy and the social fabric of our country. We are actively working to enhance womens representation across all institutions. As a testament to our commitment, we have already appointed a woman as Prime Minister. A significant portion of our population consists of individuals with disabilities who require special social protection. To support this group, we have proposed a robust social safety net and are implementing short-term measures to address their needs. We ensure that no group within our society is overlooked on our journey forward. By respecting each others identities and harnessing them positively for the countrys progress, we make our collective contribution. We hold a strong belief in the sovereignty of the people and are committed to safeguarding their democratic rights. I understand that some may feel uncertain due to doubts about us, but I am determined to earn your trust through my actions. I welcome your constructive criticism and encourage you to join us in building the future together. If we can set aside our differences, I believe you will see that we share the same goals. Together, we can confront the challenges facing our country and develop the necessary strategies to move forward. Our doors are open to all who are genuinely and positively committed to the progress of our nation. We require a Parliament that accurately reflects the will of the people. The existing Parliament does not represent that will. Therefore, I took the step yesterday to dissolve it. A cabinet was appointed in line with our parliamentary representation to guide the country in accordance with the constitution. There is one dream our people see every new day the sun rises. That is tomorrow will be better than today! However, You and I both learn for many years, this has remained merely a dream. Opportunism, the greed of power, and authoritarianism has hindered our countrys progress. But now we have our final opportunity which cannot be missed. Let us unite to create a thriving and beautiful country that embraces diversity.",

        "content": "Pledges by Sri Lankas new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to cut taxes and make changes to the countrys International Monetary Fund bailout could keep the countrys credit risks elevated for some time, rating agency Moodys has said. We do not expect significant disruption to the countrys reform agenda or macroeconomic policies, which include the ongoing debt restructuring and structural adjustments under its programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Moodys said, However, some policies are likely to be reprioritised amid challenges in maintaining fiscal consolidation that could keep credit risks elevated for some time. Since its default in 2022, Sri Lanka has implemented various steps to restore fiscal sustainability, such as raising VAT and corporate tax rates and lowering personal tax-free allowances. Moodys, which rates Sri Lanka just above default at Ca, said the measures helped lift government revenues to just over 11 of GDP in 2023 from 8.3 in 2021 and narrowed its fiscal deficit to 8.3 of GDP from 11.7. That is still an gaping deficit and debt affordability is expected to remain weak too with its interest payments alone likely to soak up 40-50 of revenues over the next two to three years. That is still among the weakest across sovereigns we rate, albeit an improvement from more than 70 in 2021, Moodys said. Source: Reuters --Agencies Click to Read Full Statement...",

        "title": "US and allies call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah",
        "date": "September 26, 2024 09:10 am",
        "content": "The U.S., France and other allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy, the statement said. We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately. There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli or Lebanese governments or Hezbollah but senior U.S. officials said all parties were aware of the call for a cease-fire. Earlier, representatives for Israel and Lebanon reiterated their support for a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group. The U.S. hopes the new deal could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes, and escalated attacks over the past week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East. The U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group. They said they expected Israel to welcome the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday. While the deal applies only to the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. officials said they were looking to use a three-week pause in fighting to restart stalled negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, after nearly a year of war in Gaza. The nations calling for a halt to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Work on the proposal came together quickly this week with President Joe Bidens national security team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meeting with world leaders in New York and lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations. Blinken first raised the proposal with the French foreign minister Monday and then broadened his outreach that evening at a dinner with the foreign ministers of all the Group of Seven industrialized democracies. During a meeting Wednesday morning with Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers, Blinken approached Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask their approval and got it. Blinken and senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who signed off on the deal. Sullivan, Hochstein and senior adviser Brett McGurk were also in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White Houses chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza. The officials said the deal crystallized by late Wednesday afternoon during a conversation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron. Blinken expects to meet Netanyahus top strategic adviser in New York on Thursday ahead of the prime ministers arrival. An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a special meeting that we are counting on both parties to accept it without delay and added that war is not unavoidable. At the meeting, Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, publicly threw his support behind the French-U.S. plan that enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war. He called on the Security Council to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis. Israels U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, told journalists that Israel would like to see a cease-fire and the return of people to their homes near the border: It will happen, either after a war or before a war. We hope it will be before. Addressing the Security Council later, he made no mention of a temporary cease-fire but said Israel does not seek a full-scale war. Both Danon and Mikati reaffirmed their governments commitment to a Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. Never fully implemented, it called for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers, and the disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah. Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABCs The View that an all-out war is possible but said he thinks the opportunity also exists to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region. Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking hostages. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count. Its possible and Im using every bit of energy I have with my team  to get this done, Biden said. Theres a desire to see change in the region. The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Irans Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah.

It is reported that the discussions will cover how to contest the upcoming parliamentary elections, including the symbol under which they will contest. If an alliance is formed, the essential groundwork required will also be discussed. Additionally, a meeting is scheduled for today at 4:00 p.m. between former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the group that supported him in the last presidential election, representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). It is expected that a final agreement will be reached regarding the manner of contesting the parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, it is also reported that the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna, which was recently formed by a group of MPs who supported Ranil Wickremesinghe from the SLPP, has not yet received approval from the Election Commission. In order to contest under the symbol of the trophy, the relevant alliance must obtain approval from the Election Commission, and it is reported that approval has not yet been granted. As a result, they are considering contesting the next election under the chair symbol with the Podujana Eksath Peramuna.

        "date": "September 26, 2024 11:35 am",
        "content": "India does not seek to control every political move of neighbours, and does not expect that the political dynamics within neighbouring countries will adhere to what India may think is desirable, but Delhi is confident that fundamental realities of interdependence will ensure that relationships with neighbours remains constructive and positive, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said. At a time when a regime change in Bangladesh through street protests and a government change in Sri Lanka through electoral route has generated questions about Dhaka and Colombos ties with Delhi, Jaishankar also made it clear that India remains focused on building economic regionalism in South Asia. During a conversation at Asia Society in New York, the minister was asked about Indias non-reciprocal approach to neighbours hasnt yielded benefits with the rise of potentially governments, and about Indias role regarding the treatment of minorities in Bangladesh. Jaishankar said that India stepped forward in the case of Sri Lanka at a time when others didnt in a timely manner and on scale and that helped stabilised the island states economy. When we did it, we did not have a political conditionality that accompanied it. We were doing it as a good neighbour that did not want to see an economic meltdown at the doorstep. What happens politically in Sri Lanka is for their politics to work out. At the end of the day, each one of our neighbours will have their own dynamics. It is not our intention to suggest that their dynamics must necessarily adhere to what we might consider being better for us. He added that this was a real world, everyone made their choices and countries then found a way to adjust and work together. Over the weekend, elections in Sri Lanka saw the victory of Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janata Vimukhti Peramuna (JVP), an old Marxist party, as a part of wider coalition. While India has engaged with Dissanayake both before and after the election his past critical positions on elements of Indian policy and economic interests, at a time of Chinas continued engagement, have given rise to apprehensions about Colombos approach to India under a new dispensation. In the case of Bangladesh, which he acknowledged as being a different situation, the ministers traced back the progress of the past decade. What we have done is to do projects that have been good for both of us. Economic activity has overall picked up. Logistics of that region has improved. I would urge you not to be deterministic about it. It is not as if India is seeking to control every political move of every neighbour. Thats not how it works. It doesnt work for us and it doesnt work for anyone else. In Bangladesh, student protests and a brutal state response morphed into a mass upsurge against the Sheikh Hasina-led government that was widely seen as authoritarian and corrupt and having presided over unfair elections. Hasina had to flee to India, which had traditionally supported her party, the Awami League. This, in turn, has made India an object of suspicion in Bangladeshs new political configuration. For its part, Delhi has been deeply concerned about the manner of regime change in the country, the rise of Islamist forces as a part of the new political dispensation, the possibility of state sipport to radicalisation, the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, the political instability in the country, and the potential security consequences for India especially in the Northeast. Jaishankar met Bangladeshs new foreign advisor in the interim government, Touhid Hossain, on Monday in New York. Jaishankar said that in foreign policy, all that a country could do was read, anticipate and respond to those dynamics. He then projected a more confident outlook for the future. The realities of interdependence, mutual benefit and our ability to get along will serve both our interests will reassert themselves. That has been the history, he said. Look back at the last few years. Something happens and people suggest it is an irretrievable situation. Then you see the correctives manifest itself. I am quite confident that in both these cases, our relationship will remain positive and constructive. Source: Hindustan Times --Agencies",

However, he clarified that individuals whose postal vote applications were rejected in the previous election must resolve the issue that caused the rejection and reapply for postal voting. Those applicants will need to submit a new application. Ratnayake further stated that individuals who did not submit postal vote applications for the last presidential election but belong to service categories expected to be employed for election duties will also have the opportunity to submit postal vote applications for this election. He also made a specific request to Certifying Officers, urging them to inform officers in writing about the transfer, retirement, or death of certified voters under their supervision. The Assistant Returning Officers in each district will collect the relevant information regarding new eligible voters. With the commencement of the parliamentary elections, the same rules and procedures followed during the last presidential election will remain in effect.

        "date": "September 26, 2024 02:48 pm",
        "content": "An 88-year-old man who is the worlds longest-serving death row inmate has been acquitted by a Japanese court, after it found that evidence used against him was fabricated. Iwao Hakamada, who has been on death row for more than half a century, was found guilty in 1968 of killing his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children. He was recently granted a retrial amid suspicions that investigators may have planted evidence that led to his conviction for quadruple murder. More than half a century spent on death row has taken a heavy toll on Hakamadas mental health, though, meaning he was unfit to attend the hearing where his acquittal was finally handed down. Hakamadas case is one of Japans longest and most famous legal sagas, and has attracted widespread public interest, with some 500 people lining up for seats in the courtroom in Shizuoka on Thursday. As the verdict was handed down, Hakamadas supporters outside the court cheered banzai - a Japanese exclamation that means hurray. Hakamada, who was exempted from all hearings due to his deteriorated mental state, has been living under the care of his 91-year-old sister Hideko since 2014, when he was freed from jail and granted a retrial. He previously told the AFP news agency that his battle for justice was like fighting a bout every day. Once you think you cant win, there is no path to victory, he said. Bloodstained clothes in a tank of miso A former professional boxer, Hakamada was working at a miso processing plant in 1966 when the bodies of his employer, the mans wife and two children were recovered from a fire at their home in Shizuoka, west of Tokyo. All four had been stabbed to death. Authorities accused Hakamada of murdering the family, setting fire to their home and stealing 200,000 yen in cash. Hakamada initially denied having robbed and murdered the victims, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day. In 1968 he was convicted of murder and arson, and sentenced to death. The decades-long legal saga ultimately turned on some clothes found in a tank of miso a year after Hakamadas arrest. Those clothes, purportedly bloodstained, were used to incriminate him. For years, however, Hakamadas lawyers argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his, raising the possibility that the items belonged to someone else. The lawyers further suggested that police could have fabricated the evidence. Their argument was enough to persuade Judge Hiroaki Murayama, who in 2014 noted that the clothes were not those of the defendant. It is unjust to detain the defendant further, as the possibility of his innocence has become clear to a respectable degree, Murayama said at the time. Hakamada was then released from jail and granted a retrial. Prolonged legal proceedings meant that it took until last year for that retrial to begin - and until Thursday morning for the court to declare the verdict. While the DNA argument was quashed, the judge found another argument by defence lawyers credible - that the red stains found on the clothes could not have been blood, as blood would not remain red on clothing immersed in miso for a year. Thursdays ruling found that investigators tampered with clothes by getting blood on them which they then hid in the tank of miso, according to AFP. Hakamada was declared innocent.

The President stressed the importance of maintaining these reserves to ensure uninterrupted fuel availability for the public and urged officials to efficiently plan for fuel procurement for the upcoming year. The President further assured his full support in facilitating these efforts, the statement said. During the meeting held today (26) with Ministry officials, President Dissanayake directed them to devise a plan for distributing solar panels, received through Indian aid, to 800 Piriven. He emphasized the need for a clear roadmap from the Ministry to ensure smooth implementation of this initiative. The President also highlighted the importance of expediting projects financed by the Asian Development Bank and other foreign loans. He announced plans to establish a committee tasked with approving foreign-aid projects within three months, with the aim of accelerating their execution. Through this process, he noted, projects supported by foreign aid can be implemented more efficiently.

        "date": "September 26, 2024 05:51 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed the Treasury to provide a fertilizer subsidy of Rs. 25,000 per hectare to paddy farmers for the Maha season of 202425, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. According to this initiative, the fertilizer subsidy, which was previously set at Rs. 15,000 per hectare, will be increased to Rs. 25,000. This enhanced subsidy will take effect starting October 01. To ensure efficient delivery of the subsidy to farmers, the funds will be directly transferred to their bank accounts. This approach aims to streamline the process and provide timely support to those in the agricultural sector, the PMD said. The new governments policy statement emphasizes the importance of effectively managing agricultural inputs. It outlines a commitment to providing fertilizer and other agricultural inputs at reasonable prices, along with subsidies for both chemical and organic fertilizer, all in line with good agricultural practices. This step has been implemented to support sustainable farming. In addition, the President has directed the Treasury to implement a fuel subsidy for the fishing community, effective from October 01. This measure is intended to boost the fishing industry and lower production costs for fishermen. The fuel subsidy will be available on a monthly basis for both multi-day and one-day fishing vessels. Similar to the agricultural subsidy, this funding will also be directly deposited into the fishermens bank accounts. The governments policy statement underscores the goal of developing and managing the fishing industry in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. This approach aims to enhance fish production, making it more accessible to consumers at fair prices, while also improving the quality of life for those involved in the industry. Furthermore, efforts will be made to provide financial and technical support for the recovery of marine fisheries, which are currently facing significant challenges, the statement said.",

        "date": "September 26, 2024 06:31 pm",
        "content": "In a remarkable achievement, Kamindu Mendis has become the first-ever player to slam fifty-plus scores in eight consecutive Test matches. The stylish southpaw attained the phenomenal batting feat during Sri Lankas ongoing Test match against New Zealand at Galle International Stadium. Coming at number five, Kamindu Mendis showcased exemplary skills to notch up his fourth half-century in Test cricket. After Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bowl, the hosts had a disastrous start to their first innings, losing Pathum Nissanka cheaply. However, former skipper Dimuth Karunaratne and ace batter Dinesh Chandimal helped them recover from the early setback. The duo stitched a valuable stand of 122 runs for the second wicket before Karunaratnes run out brought the Kiwis back into the game. Although Chandimal departed soon after completing his century, Kamindu Mendis joined forces with Angelo Mathews, keeping Sri Lanka ahead of their counterparts on day 1. The in-form batter brought up a sublime half-century, with the hosts finishing on 306 for three at stumps on day 1. Since making his Test comeback, Kamindu Mendis has been a force to reckon with the bat for Sri Lanka. In the recently concluded England series, the left-handed batter oozed his class, playing a pivotal role in the visitors impressive performance. His recent performance in the second Test match against New Zealand has made him the first player in over 147 years of Test history to score more than fifty runs in each of his first eight Test matches. This impressive feat brings a fresh perspective to Mendis career and highlights his potential as a significant player in the sport. Prior to this match, he had already set the bar high, succeeding in scoring more than fifty runs in each of his previous seven matches. Mendis surpassed the previous record held by Pakistani batsman Saud Shakeel, who managed to achieve this in seven consecutive Tests. Mendis made his Test debut against Australia in Galle in 2022, where he impressed everyone with a solid score of 61 runs. Despite not being included in the Test squad for some time following his debut, he made a significant comeback this year during the Sylhet Test against Bangladesh, where he achieved a remarkable feat of scoring centuries in both innings. He continued to showcase his talent by scoring 92 runs in the Chittagong Test, followed by an impressive 113 runs during the Manchester Test against England. Further solidifying his place, he scored 74 runs at Lords and 64 runs in the Oval Test. --Agencies",

Wijepala expressed regret over the misuse of public funds and emphasized that a full review will be conducted, with the public being informed of future actions. He made these remarks while speaking to the reporters today (26) at the Galle Face Grounds in Colombo, where updates on actions taken regarding the parked vehicles were shared, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. He further explained that the public money wasted by previous governments is symbolically represented by these vehicles parked there, noting that the current parking spaces at the Presidential Secretariat are insufficient to accommodate the vehicles. A total of 107 vehicles are parked at Galle Face and other locations, which were provided to associates of past governments under various positions. Wijepala highlighted the unfortunate reality that over the past 76 years, successive governments have continued to waste public wealth while citizens struggled to meet basic needs. He also revealed that while there is a shortage of ambulances for the healthcare sector and vehicles for public officials to perform their duties, vehicles worth millions of rupees were imported and distributed to political allies. Wijepala reiterated the responsibility to safeguard public funds and assured that a comprehensive review of misused vehicles will be conducted. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed that these vehicles be reassigned to essential services to ensure efficient use. He further disclosed that 59 vehicles obtained from various institutions had been distributed through the Presidential Secretariat to political allies, and despite the vehicle importation ban, 16 vehicles had been bought in for the Presidential Secretariat, the PMD reported. Additionally, Wijepala mentioned that among the 833 vehicles currently owned by the Presidential Secretariat, 29 vehicles are missing. He further stated that the President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed a systematic investigation into this matter through the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). --PMD--",

        "date": "September 27, 2024 10:12 am",
        "content": "U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, capping an investigation that has sent the largest U.S. citys government into turmoil. In a 57-page indictment, prosecutors laid out an alleged scheme stretching back to 2014 that helped to underwrite Adams 2021 mayoral campaign and showered him with free rooms at opulent hotels and meals at high-end restaurants. In return, Adams pressured city officials to allow the countrys new 36-story consulate to open despite safety concerns, prosecutors said. The Democrat faces five criminal charges and could face decades in prison if found guilty. Adams, 64, denied wrongdoing and said he would fight the charges in court. He said he would not step down. I will continue to do my job as mayor, he said at a news conference, where some onlookers called on him to resign. He is due to appear in court on Friday at noon Eastern Time (1600 GMT). Turkeys foreign ministry and presidents office and its embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier on Thursday, federal agents searched the mayors Gracie Mansion home on Manhattans Upper East Side, according to a Reuters witness. Around a dozen people in business attire were seen walking on the mansions grounds with briefcases and duffel bags. Adams, a former police officer who rose to the rank of captain, is the first of the citys 110 mayors to be criminally charged while in office. He could be removed from office by Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul but the process is complicated, said Pace University Law School professor Bennett Gershman. Hochul issued a statement saying she would review my options and obligations as the Governor of New York. I expect the Mayor to take the next few days to review the situation and find an appropriate path forward to ensure the people of New York City are being well-served by their leaders, Hochul said. A TRUE FRIEND OF TURKEY According to the indictment, Adams accepted free travel from a Turkish airline worth tens of thousands of dollars while serving as Brooklyn borough president and paid 600 to stay two nights at a luxury suite in the St. Regis hotel in Istanbul, well below the actual cost of 7,000. Prosecutors said Adams would fly on the Turkish airline even when it was inconvenient. You know first stop is always Istanbul, he wrote in a 2017 text message when his partner expressed surprise that they were flying from New York to Paris through Istanbul. For his 2021 mayoral campaign, Adams disguised campaign contributions from Turkish sources by funneling them through U.S. citizens, the indictment said. Those funds allowed Adams to qualify for an additional 10 million in public financing. This was a multiyear scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise, Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said at a news conference. Prosecutors say Adams responded to Turkish concerns. Acting on a request by a Turkish diplomat, Adams pressured city safety inspectors to allow the countrys new 36-story consulate to open in time for a September 2021 visit by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan even though it would have failed a fire inspection, the indictment said. After repeated messages about the building from Adams, a senior Fire Department official allegedly told a subordinate he would lose his job if he did not allow the consulate to open. Adams notified the diplomat when the Fire Department approved the building to open later in the day, the indictment said. You are a true friend of Turkey, the diplomat allegedly responded. Adams performed other favors as well, the indictment said. Before serving as mayor, Adams allegedly cut ties with a community center in Brooklyn that the diplomat said was affiliated with a hostile political movement, according to the indictment. Shortly after he was inaugurated in 2022, an Adams staffer assured the diplomat that the new mayor would not make a statement on 1915 massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire that Washington has called a genocide. Adams said he was aiming for a public trial to clear his name. If its foreign donors, I know I dont take money from foreign donors, he said. TOP CITY OFFICIALS RESIGN The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025, as other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge him. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents portions of the city, called on Adams to step down. But two powerful lawmakers from Brooklyn, U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, stopped short of doing so. New York has been in a state of political upheaval for the past month. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on Sept. 12, a week after FBI agents seized his phone. Days later, Adams chief legal adviser resigned. On Wednesday, the citys public schools chief David Banks said he would retire at the end of the year, after the New York Times reported his phones were seized by federal agents.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court has ordered him to appear before the court on October 07. On January 12, 2023, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. As a result, they were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered former President Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the former SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and former National Intelligence Director Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. In addition, the judgment also stated that the government should pay Rs. 01 million in compensation to the victims. The order was issued by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, delivering its decision with regard to the 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by the defendants negligence and failure to prevent the terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. The 12 petitions were filed by a group of individuals including Nandana Sirimanna, whose two children were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks, tourism entrepreneur Janath Vidanage, three Catholic Fathers including Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda and Attorney-at-Law Moditha Ekanayake, who was injured in the bombings at the Shangri-La Hotel. The deadline to complete the relevant compensation payments was initially set for July 12, 2023. On September 09, former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara had completed the payment of Rs. 75 million in compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks, as ordered by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, former President Maithripala Sirisena on August 16 had also completed the payments of compensation of Rs. 100 million to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks as ordered by the Supreme Court.",

        "title": "X requests it be reinstated in Brazil after complying with judges orders",
        "date": "September 27, 2024 03:45 pm",
        "content": "In the high-stakes showdown between the worlds richest man and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, Elon Musk blinked. Musks social media site X has complied with Alexandre de Moraes orders and requested its service be reestablished in the country, two sources said Thursday. X complied with orders to block certain accounts from the platform, name an official legal representative in Brazil, and pay fines imposed for not complying with earlier court orders, his lawyers said in a petition filed Thursday, according to the sources, who are familiar with the document. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. On Saturday, de Moraes ordered the platform to submit additional documentation about its legal representative for court review, which the sources said has been done. X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people, where it was one of Xs biggest markets, with more than 20 million users. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after sparring with Musk for months over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. The company said at the time that de Moraes efforts to block certain accounts were illegal moves to censor political opponents and that it would not comply. Musk called the judge an enemy of free speech and a criminal. But de Moraes decisions have been repeatedly upheld by his peers including his nationwide block of X. In a twist, Xs new representative is the same person who held the position before X shuttered its office in Brazil, according to the companys public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry. That happened after de Moraes threatened to arrest the person, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. In an apparent effort to avoid her getting blamed for potential violations of Brazilian law and risk arrest a clause has been written into the representation agreement that any action on the part of X that will result in obligations for her requires prior instruction in writing from the company, according to the companys filing at the registry. Associated Press emails and calls to her office were not returned. The Supreme Courts press office has not confirmed receipt of Xs documents, and X did not immediately respond to a request from the AP. An encouraging sign, perhaps motivated by business sense Its still early to know whether the feud between X and Brazils top court is over, said Bruna Santos, a lawyer and global campaigns manager at nonprofit Digital Action. However, the platforms decision to appoint a representative indicates the company has entered a state of good-faith cooperation with Brazilian authorities. And the fact that Brazilian users migrated in droves to rival platforms BlueSky and Threads may have played into Xs backstep, Santos added. There must be a genuine concern on the platform that they are losing users, the core users from the early Twitter days, or the loyal ones, who stick around for good, she said. At a university in Rio de Janeiro, some students told the AP they were heartened by the news. I used it a lot as a way to search for information and news, and I missed it, said João Maurício Almeida Raposo, a 19-year-old economics student. He started using Threads, but doesnt like it. Brazil is not the first country to ban X far from it but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan, for instance. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. Xs dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the companys dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for 44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Metas Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the governments requests to take down posts related to farmers protests that rocked the country. Speech is more limited in Brazil than in the US Unlike in the U.S., where free speech is baked into the constitution, in Brazil speech is more limited, with restrictions on homophobia and racism, for example, and judges can order sites to remove content. Many of de Moraes decisions are sealed from the public and neither he nor X has disclosed the full list of accounts he has ordered blocked, but prominent supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro and far-right activists were among those that X earlier removed from the platform. Some belonged to a network known in Brazil as digital militias. They were targeted by a yearslong investigation overseen by de Moraes, initially for allegedly spreading defamatory fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, and then after Bolsonaros 2022 election loss for inciting demonstrations across the country that were seeking to overturn President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvas victory. In April, de Moraes included Musk as a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news and opened a separate investigation into the U.S. business executive for alleged obstruction. In that decision, de Moraes noted that Musk began waging a public disinformation campaign regarding the top courts actions, and that Musk continued the following day most notably with comments that his social media company X would cease to comply with the courts orders to block certain accounts. Musk, meanwhile, accused de Moraes of suppressing free speech and violating Brazils constitution, and noted on X that users could seek to bypass any shutdown of the social media platform by using VPNs. In an unusual move for a democratic country, de Moraes also set exorbitant daily fines for anyone using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access the platform. Xs defiant stance appears to have softened following the shutdown. On Sept. 18, after X became accessible to some users in Brazil despite the ban, the Government Affairs account posted that this was due to a change in network providers and was inadvertent and temporary. But, it added, we continue efforts to work with the Brazilian government to return very soon for the people of Brazil. The score is 1-0, but the game isnt necessarily over, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. The first round ends with a victory for de Moraes, who adopted drastic measures, but which wound up producing the effect of making X do a reversal and comply with orders, Affonso Souza said.

The 25-year-old achieved this feat by hitting a six off Rachin Ravindra. He goes level with Australia great Don Bradmans record of 13 innings. Earlier today, Mendis brought up his fifth Test century which made him the fastest Asian batter to do so. He is now joint-fourth fastest in the all-time list of fastest batters to five Test centuries. On Thursday, Mendis created a world record for the most successive fifty-plus scores since debut, scoring eight half-centuries after his first match against Australia two years ago. Mendis scored a huge hundred (182 not out in 250 deliveries). During his knock, the 25-year-old completed 1,000 runs in Tests. The left-handed batsman has gone past the 1000-run mark in Tests in only 13 innings. By taking only 13 innings to cross 1,000 runs in Tests, Mendis has now become the third fastest batter in Test history to go past the milestone. Mendis has levellled with Australian legend Sir Don Bradman in the list of the batters fastest (in terms of innings) to 1000 runs in the format. As things stand Mendis and Bradman are only behind Herbert Sutcliffe, Sir Everton Weekes. Mendis, who made is Test debut against Australia in 2022, is currently leading the chart of the batters with most Test hundreds in 2024. He has hit five centuries this year and is ahead of former England captain Joe Root by one hundred. Mendis monumental hundred along with centuries from Dinesh Chandimal (116 in 208 balls) and Kusal Mendis (106 n.o, in 149 balls) helped Sri Lanka to a huge total of 6025 declared.

        "date": "September 27, 2024 07:37 pm",
        "content": "LONDON (AP)  Maggie Smith, the masterful, scene-stealing actor who won an Oscar for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in 1969 and gained new fans in the 21st century as the dowager Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey and Professor Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter films, died Friday. She was 89. Smiths sons, Chris Larkin and Toby Stephens, said in a statement that Smith died early Friday in a London hospital. She leaves two sons and five loving grandchildren who are devastated by the loss of their extraordinary mother and grandmother, they said in a statement issued through publicist Clair Dobbs. Smith was frequently rated the preeminent British female performer of a generation that included Vanessa Redgrave and Judi Dench, with a clutch of Academy Award nominations and a shelf full of acting trophies. She remained in demand even in her later years, despite her lament that when you get into the granny era, youre lucky to get anything. Smith drily summarized her later roles as a gallery of grotesques, including Professor McGonagall. Asked why she took the role, she quipped: Harry Potter is my pension. Richard Eyre, who directed Smith in a television production of Suddenly Last Summer, said she was intellectually the smartest actress Ive ever worked with. You have to get up very, very early in the morning to outwit Maggie Smith. Jean Brodie, in which she played a dangerously charismatic Edinburgh schoolteacher, brought her the Academy Award for best actress, and the British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) as well in 1969. Smith added a supporting actress Oscar for California Suite in 1978, Golden Globes for California Suite and Room with a View, and BAFTAs for lead actress in A Private Function in 1984, A Room with a View in 1986, and The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne in 1988. She also received Academy Award nominations as a supporting actress in Othello, Travels with My Aunt, Room with a View and Gosford Park, and a BAFTA award for supporting actress in Tea with Mussolini. On stage, she won a Tony in 1990 for Lettice and Lovage. Her work in 2012 netted three Golden Globe nominations for the globally successful Downton Abbey TV series and the films The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Quartet. Smith had a reputation for being difficult, and sometimes upstaging others. Richard Burton remarked that Smith didnt just take over a scene in The VIPs with him: She commits grand larceny. However, the director Peter Hall found that Smith wasnt remotely difficult unless shes among idiots. Shes very hard on herself, and I dont think she sees any reason why she shouldnt be hard on other people, too. Smith conceded that she could be impatient at times. Its true I dont tolerate fools, but then they dont tolerate me, so I am spiky, Smith said. Maybe thats why Im quite good at playing spiky elderly ladies. Critic Frank Rich, in a New York Times review of Lettice and Lovage, praised Smith as the stylized classicist who can italicize a line as prosaic as Have you no marmalade? until it sounds like a freshly minted epigram by Coward or Wilde. Smith famously drew laughs from a prosaic line  This haddock is disgusting  in a 1964 revival of Noel Cowards Hay Fever. But unfortunately the critics mentioned it, and after that it never got a laugh, she recalled. The moment you say something is funny its gossamer. Its gone, really. Margaret Natalie Smith was born in Ilford, on the eastern edge of London, on Dec. 28, 1934. She summed up her life briefly: One went to school, one wanted to act, one started to act, ones still acting. Her father was assigned in 1939 to wartime duty in Oxford, where her theater studies at the Oxford Playhouse School led to a busy apprenticeship. I did so many things, you know, round the universities there. ... If you were kind of clever enough and I suppose quick enough, you could almost do weekly rep because all the colleges were doing different productions at different times, she said in a BBC interview. She took Maggie as her stage name because another Margaret Smith was active in the theater. Laurence Olivier spotted her talent, invited her to be part of his original National Theatre company and cast her as his co-star in a 1965 film adaptation of Othello. Smith said two directors, Ingmar Bergman and William Gaskill, both in National Theatre productions, were important influences. Alan Bennett, preparing to film the monologue A Bed Among the Lentils, said he was wary of Smiths reputation for becoming bored. As the actor Jeremy Brett put it, she starts divinely and then goes off, rather like a cheese. So the fact that we only just had enough time to do it was an absolute blessing really because she was so fresh and just so into it, said Bennett, who also wrote a starring role for Smith in The Lady in the Van. However extravagant she may have been on stage or before the cameras, Smith was known to be intensely private. Simon Callow, who acted with her in A Room with a View, said he ruined their first meeting by spouting compliments. I blurted out various kinds of rubbish about her and she kind of withdrew. She doesnt like that sort of thing very much at all, Callow said in a film portrait of the actress. She never wanted to talk about acting. Acting was something she was terrified to talk about because if she did, it would disappear. Smith was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire, the equivalent of a knight, in 1990. She married fellow actor Robert Stephens in 1967. They had two sons, Christopher and Toby, and divorced in 1975. The same year she married the writer Beverley Cross, who died in 1998. ___ Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "September 28, 2024 09:11 am",
        "content": "The U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government Friday to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year, with U.S. troops departing some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. But the Biden administration refused to provide details on how many of the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq will remain there or acknowledge it will mark a full withdrawal from the country. I think its fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday without providing specifics. The announcement comes at a particularly contentious time for the Middle East, with escalating conflict between Israel and two Iranian-backed militant groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza threatening a broader regional war. Bases housing U.S. forces and contractors have been regularly targeted by Iran-backed militias over the last several years, and those attacks intensified late last year and early this spring after the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly a year ago. For years, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, and formal talks to wind down the U.S. presence in the country have been going on for months. U.S. officials who briefed reporters Friday said the agreement will bring about a two-phase transition in the troops assigned to Iraq that began this month. In the first phase, which runs through September 2025, the coalition mission against ISIS will end and forces will leave some longstanding bases. Following the November election, American forces will start departing from Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and from Baghdad International Airport, according to Iraqi government officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Those forces will be moved to Hareer base in Erbil, in northern Iraqs Kurdistan region. In the second phase, the U.S. will continue to operate in some fashion from Iraq through 2026 to support counter-ISIS operations in Syria, a senior Biden administration official and a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to provide details ahead of the announcement. Ultimately, the U.S. military mission would transition to a bilateral security relationship, the U.S. officials said, but they did not indicate what that might mean for the number of American troops who remain in Iraq in the future. The Iraqi officials said some American troops may stay at Hareer base after 2026 because the Kurdistan regional government would like them to stay. We have taken an important step in resolving the issue of the international coalition to fight ISIS, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said in a speech this month. He noted the governments belief in the capabilities of our security forces that defeated the remnants of ISIS. The continued presence of U.S. troops has been a political vulnerability for Sudani, whose government is under increased influence from Iran. Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the U.S. and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government but regional archenemies. We thank the government for its position to expel the international coalition forces, Qais Khazali, founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq an Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia that has conducted attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq said last week. But critics caution that this years surge of ISIS attacks in Syria across the desert border from Iraq suggest the drawdown in Iraq is a really significant cause for concern, said Charles Lister, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute research center in Washington. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq isnt because ISIS has disappeared, Lister said. The withdrawal is because theres a significant proportion of the policy-making community in Baghdad that doesnt want American troops on Iraqi soil. The agreement marks the third time in the last two decades that the U.S. has announced a formal transition of the militarys role there. The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 in what it called a massive shock and awe bombing campaign that lit up the skies, laid waste to large sections of the country and paved the way for American ground troops to converge on Baghdad. The invasion was based on what turned out to be faulty claims that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized. The U.S. presence grew to more than 170,000 troops at the peak of counterinsurgency operations in 2007. The Obama administration negotiated the drawdown of forces, and in December 2011, the final combat troops departed, leaving only a small number of military personnel behind to staff an office of security assistance and a detachment of Marines to guard the embassy compound. In 2014, the rise of the Islamic State group and its rapid capture of a wide swath across Iraq and Syria brought U.S. and partner nation forces back at the invitation of the Iraqi government to help rebuild and retrain police and military units that had fallen apart and fled. After ISIS lost its hold on the territory it once claimed, coalition military operations ended in 2021. An enduring U.S. presence of about 2,500 troops stayed in Iraq to maintain training and conduct partnered counter-ISIS operations with Iraqs military. In the years since, the U.S. has maintained that presence to pressure Iranian-backed militias active in Iraq and Syria. The presence of American forces in Iraq also makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons across Iraq and Syria into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya has called for an immediate audit of the Ministry of Sports financial allocations, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability. Although expenditure statistics are available, there has been no evaluation of the actual progress achieved through these funds. The Prime Minister advised that an internal audit be conducted as soon as possible, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Speaking at a meeting with heads of institutions under the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs yesterday (27)), Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya outlined her priorities across various ministries under her supervision, highlighting several concerns related to the Ministry of Sports. As Prime Minister, I am prioritizing key issues that have been overlooked in ministries under my charge. The Ministry of Sports, in particular, has raised several critical concerns. The government is highly mindful of the wastage and misuse of public funds, and we are taking steps to curb unnecessary expenditures. I have instructed the Ministry to reduce spending on festivals and celebrations that do not provide value for public funds. Although the Ministry possesses data on the funds allocated and spent, there has been no assessment of the outcomes linked to this spending. Therefore, I have called for a swift internal audit to review how the money has been used and what progress has been made. Additionally, institutional committees have not yet been formed to investigate the fraud and corruption that have occurred in government bodies. The government has developed a structured program to address this. Another major issue highlighted during the discussion was the absence of a dedicated program within the Ministry of Sports to prevent and respond to abuse and violence within the sports sector. As such, I have directed the Ministry to create a comprehensive plan aimed at investigating these issues and raising awareness, said Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya. The meeting was attended by Prime Ministers Secretary Mr. Pradeep Saputantri, the Secretary of the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, Mr. K. Maheshan, and other senior officials from the Ministry.",

        "title": "Israel strikes Beirut in a huge blast targeting Hezbollahs leader",
        "date": "September 28, 2024 01:23 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollahs headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings. At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanons health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report. The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast. After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israels intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue  further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing. Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings. The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beiruts Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanons national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut. Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district. Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made Bunker Buster guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets. Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb. Israels air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles. Israels military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south. To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollahs senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah  successful or not  would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes. Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations. The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollahs main headquarters, though it is located in the groups security quarters, a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals. Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians. The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds. Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said. The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people. The scope of Israels operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation. At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to continue degrading Hezbollah until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border. An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the militarys goals are much narrower. In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border not a high bar like Gaza in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines. In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women  35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike. Thats Sabah, these are her clothes, my love, one man cried out as her body emerged. Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollahs weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israels military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah. But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown. Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beiruts suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the groups drone unit, Mohammed Surour. People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, We will never accept humiliation, as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the groups yellow flag. Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollahs top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza. We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza, Fadlallah said. There is no place for neutrality in this battle. Source: AP --Agencies",

The Israeli military said it was mobilizing additional reserve soldiers as tensions escalate with Lebanon. The military said Saturday morning it was activating three battalions of reserve soldiers, after earlier sending two brigades to northern Israel earlier in the week to train for a possible ground invasion. Rumors swirled after Israel claimed it struck Hezbollahs headquarters in Beirut on Friday. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. On Saturday morning, the Israeli military carried out several strikes in southern Beirut and eastern Lebanons Bekaa Valley. Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles across northern and central Israel and the Israel-occupied West Bank. In Beiruts southern suburbs, smoke rose and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Shelters set up in the city center for displaced people were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry.

        "date": "September 28, 2024 10:13 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya says that education is a key area which the new government will give the highest priority to and that they firmly believe reestablishing the trust in the countrys education system is critical. Addressing a workshop held for school principals at the Ananda College in Colombo today (28), she pointed out that there are several issues in the current education system and that one of the main problems is that the trust in the education system has broken. As in many other areas of our society, people no longer trust that this system will work for them. Dr. Amarasuriya, who is also the Education Minister, said children no longer believe in the importance of education nor do they feel as committed to the education system as perhaps a generation ago. We need to change this. We need to establish the trust in the system again. We need to make sure that children feel excited about their education. That parents are able to handover their children to the education system and have the faith that the education system will deliver. So, for all these reasons we believe establishing that trust in the education system is critical. We also know that there are huge disparities, inequalities in the education system, she added. Addressing the school principals present, she said they belong to a particularly privileged section within the countrys school system - the elite schools. But in our thinking, there shouldnt be a division within the school system where some children go to good schools or popular schools as they are generally known and then there cant be another category that is known as unpopular schools, the PM said Thats not an acceptable situation. So, our intention is to make sure that all schools deliver the best for all children. And we really hope that all of you would be able to be a part of this journey and work with us in making sure that the education system in Sri Lanka recovers its lost glory. She further said: Our education system was something that was regarded as an example by the rest of the world. We have delivered on our education system previously, but sadly in the last several decades we have not fulfilled that promise of our education system. We need to recover it and we need to improve on what we have. We recognize that this problem has not been created by you or by anyone else. The responsibility lies with firmly with successive political leaderships. But in the coming years we hope to continue to have this discussion with you about the policy directions and reforms that we have planned for education and I invite you all to work with us to bring our country and our education system to the place that it really deserves.",

        "date": "September 29, 2024 09:43 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced today that interim head coach of the Sri Lanka mens cricket team, Sanath Jayasuriyas term has been extended for another year. Jayasuriya is poised to have his contract as the head coach of the Sri Lanka mens cricket team extended for another year, following a successful interim period marked by notable victories. Since taking over in early July, Jayasuriya has led the team to a series win against India in ODIs, a Test victory at The Oval, and another Test win in Galle against New Zealand. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) had advertised for a permanent head coach following Chris Silverwoods departure in late June. However, with the significant improvements observed under Jayasuriyas leadership, the board is now moving towards securing him on a long-term basis. On July 07, 2024, former Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya was temporarily appointed as the Head Coach of the mens national team by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). Jayasuriya served as the interim head coach for the home series against India and the Test tour to England. This decision came as SLC continued its search for a permanent replacement for former head coach Chris Silverwood. The interim appointment followed the resignations of head coach Chris Silverwood and consultant coach Mahela Jayawardene after Sri Lankas underwhelming performance in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies. Under the leadership of Wanindu Hasaranga, the team failed to advance to the Super 8 round, prompting a need for significant changes in the coaching staff.",

        "content": "Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday (Sep 28) that the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah would be avenged and other militants would continue his path in fighting Israel. (Nasrallah) was not an individual. He was a path and a school of thought and the path will be continued, Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement read on state television in which he announced five days of mourning in Iran. The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged, he said. Khamenei, in an earlier statement issued after the Israeli army said it had killed Nasrallah, said: The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront, state media reported. After Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallahs death, Iranian media reported that General Abbas Nilforoushan, a deputy commander of Irans Revolutionary Guards, had died next to Nasrallah in the Israeli strikes on south Beirut on Friday. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed Nasrallahs killing partly on the United States, which has long supplied Israel with advanced weapons. The Americans cannot deny their complicity with the Zionists, Pezeshkian said in a statement carried by state media. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani vowed in a post on X that Nasrallahs path will be continued and his holy goal will be realised in the liberation of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, two regional officials briefed by Tehran told Reuters that Khamenei had been transferred to a secure location inside the country with heightened security measures in place. The sources said Iran was in constant contact with Lebanons Hezbollah and other regional proxy groups to determine the next step after the killing of Nasrallah. Source: Reutersfs --Agencies",

        "date": "September 29, 2024 09:36 pm",
        "content": "Nepal has shut schools for three days after landslides and floods triggered by two days of heavy rain across the Himalayan nation killed 151 people, with 56 missing, officials said on Sunday. The floods brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill in the Kathmandu valley, where 37 deaths were recorded in a region home to 4 million people and the capital. Authorities said students and their parents faced difficulties as university and school buildings damaged by the rains needed repair. We have urged the concerned authorities to close schools in the affected areas for three days, Lakshmi Bhattarai, a spokesperson for the education ministry, told Reuters. Some parts of the capital reported rain of up to 322.2 mm (12.7 inches), pushing the level of its main Bagmati river up 2.2 m (7 ft) past the danger mark, experts said. But there were some signs of respite on Sunday morning, with the rains easing in many places, said Govinda Jha, a weather forecaster in the capital. There may be some isolated showers, but heavy rains are unlikely, he said. Television images showed police rescuers in knee-high rubber boots using picks and shovels to clear away mud and retrieve 16 bodies of passengers from two buses swept away by a massive landslide at a site on the key route into Kathmandu. Weather officials in the capital blamed the rainstorms on a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal extending over parts of neighbouring India close to Nepal. Haphazard development amplifies climate change risks in Nepal, say climate scientists at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Ive never before seen flooding on this scale in Kathmandu, said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, an environmental risk official at the centre. In a statement, it urged the government and city planners to urgently step up investment in, and plans for, infrastructure, such as underground stormwater and sewage systems, both of the grey, or engineered kind, and green, or nature-based type. The impact of the rains was aggravated by poor drainage due to unplanned settlement and urbanisation efforts, construction on floodplains, lack of areas for water retention, and encroachment on the Bagmati river, it added. The level in the Koshi river in Nepals southeast has started to fall, however, said Ram Chandra Tiwari, the regions top bureaucrat. The river, which brings deadly floods to Indias eastern state of Bihar nearly every year, had been running above the danger mark at a level nearly three times normal, he said. (Reuters) --Agencies",

        "date": "September 29, 2024 10:28 pm",
        "content": "A stunning 2-0 series win over New Zealand following a massive win by an innings and 154 runs in the second Test at Galle has pushed Sri Lanka up to number three in the ICC World Championship (WTC) 2023-25 standings. Now, Sri Lanka has five wins and four losses in nine Tests. They have a point percentage (PCT) of 55.56 percent, which is not very far from Australia, which sits at second place with a PCT of 62.50 after eight wins, three losses, and a draw in 12 Tests. India is at the top with seven wins, two losses, and a draw with a PCT of 71.67. New Zealand has slipped to seventh place with three wins and five losses in eight Tests, with a PCT of 37.50. Sri Lanka has four Tests left, two against South Africa away from home in November-December this year and two home Tests against Australia in January-February next year, as per Wisden. To make it to the top two, Sri Lanka must finish with a PCT higher than either India or Australia. Overtaking Australia would be much easier since they are below India in the table and them playing Tests against Sri Lanka would help the island nation a lot in impact the point percentage if they win the series. Coming to the match, Sri Lanka opted to bat first. Centuries came from Dinesh Chandimal (116 in 208 balls, with 15 fours), Kamindu Mendis (182 in 250 balls, with 16 fours and four sixes) and Kusal Mendis (106 in 49 balls, with six fours and three sixes). It pushed SL to 6025 declared in the first innings, batting for almost two days. Glenn Phillips (3141) was the pick of the bowlers for NZ. If Sri Lanka had pulled off a batting marathon, New Zealand batters struggled on a spin-friendly surface. Catches to skipper Dhananjaya de Silva came in plenty as deliveries edged the bat of Kiwi players consistently and beat them consistently. Mitchell Santner (29 in 51 balls, with four boundaries and a six) was the top-scorer as NZ was bundled out for just 88 runs in 39.5 overs. Only two players could cross the 10-run mark. Spinner Prabath Jayasuriya continued his love affair with Galle, taking 642 and his eighth five-wicket haul at the venue. Nishan Peiris, another spinner in the squad, picked up 333 in his debut Test. Sri Lanka led by 514 runs, the fifth-highest ever first-inning lead in Test cricket history. In their second innings, the Kiwis fared slightly better. Devon Conway (61 in 62 balls, with 10 fours and a six) made a return-to-form fifty, and Kane Williamson (46 in 58 balls, with four boundaries), Tom Blundell (47), were among the runs, finishing day three at 1995, trailed by 315 runs. On the fourth day, half-centuries did come from Blundell (60 in 64 balls, with six fours and two sixes), Glenn Phillips (78 in 99 balls, with six fours and three sixes) and Mitchell Santner (67 in 115 balls, with six fours and three sixes). Phillips-Santner and Santner-Ajaz Patel (22) did put half-century stands but it just delayed the inevitable, a defeat. SL bundled out the Kiwis for 360 and won the match by an innings and 154 runs. In the second innings, Peiris took a six-wicket haul, getting his six scalps for 170 runs in 33.4 overs. Prabath got three wickets. Skipper Dhananjaya also chipped in with a wicket. Kamindu was given the Player of the Match for his performance. Prabath took home the Player of the Series honour for taking 18 wickets in the series. Source: Zee News --Agencies",

        "date": "September 30, 2024 08:54 am",
        "content": "Israels continuing air strikes may have already forced as many as one million people from their homes across Lebanon, the countrys prime minister has said. It is the largest displacement movement that may have happened, Najib Mikati said. Lebanons health ministry reported more than 50 people killed in Sundays strikes - two days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel. In a separate development, Israel said it had carried out large-scale air strikes on military targets of the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen. Hezbollah confirmed on Sunday that top military commander Ali Karaki and a senior cleric, Sheikh Nabil Qaouk, had also been killed in the Israeli air strikes. We need to keep hitting Hezbollah hard, Israels military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said. Another Israeli strike in the central Beirut neighbourhood of Kola early on Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group said in a statement. The PFLP is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, a coalition recognised at the UN as the official representative of the Palestinians. The group is also considered a terrorist organisation by both the US and EU. The statement named those killed as military security chief Mohammad Abdel-Aal, military commander Imad Odeh, and fighter Abdel Rahman Abdel-Aal. Lebanons Prime Minister Mikati said the wave of air strikes had forced people to flee from Beirut and other parts of the country, including the southern border areas. The local authorities are struggling to assist everyone in need, with shelters and hospitals under growing pressure, BBC correspondents in Lebanon report. Aya Ayoub, aged 25, told the BBC she had to flee her house in Beiruts southern Tahweetet al-Ghadir suburb with her family of six as it was too dangerous to stay. Around her house, she said, all the buildings are completely destroyed, and she was currently staying with another 16 people in a house in Beirut. We left on Friday and had no place to go. We stayed until 02:00 in the streets until a group of people helped us get into a residential building that was under construction. We are living on candles at night, and have to get water and food from outside. Sara Tohmaz, a 34-year-old journalist, told the BBC she had left her house near Beirut with her mother and two siblings last Friday. It took them almost 10 hours to reach Jordan through Syria by car, she said. I think we are lucky enough to have a place to stay in Jordan, where my mothers relatives are based. We dont know what will happen next, and dont know when we will be back, Tohmaz added. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then hundreds of people, including many Hezbollah fighters, have been killed, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Also on Sunday, Israel said it carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, striking power plants and a port in Ras Isa and Hudaydah. Footage later emerged showing a huge explosion at the port. Israel says it targeted the sites in response to recent missile attacks from the Houthis, as well as to destroy facilities being used to transport Iranian weapons. The Houthis, a Shia group controlling large areas of Yemen, condemned the Israeli strikes as a brutal aggression. They said four people were killed and 33 injured, vowing revenge. There are mounting international fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Washington warned Israel against an all-out war with Hezbollah or Iran, saying a major conflict would leave Israelis unable to return to their homes in the north. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Hamas says its leader in Lebanon was killed in Israeli strike",
        "date": "September 30, 2024 11:29 am",
        "content": "Palestinian militant group Hamas said on Monday that its leader in Lebanon Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin was killed along with some of his family members in an Israeli strike in the south of the country. As Israel escalates hostilities against Irans allies in the region, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said three of its leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beiruts Kola district. The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from Israels military. Israels increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israels main ally. The PFLP is another militant group taking part in the fight against Israel. Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemens port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday. Lebanons Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people  a fifth of the population  have fled their homes. The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks. Israeli drones hovered over Beirut for much of Sunday, with the loud blasts of new airstrikes echoing around the Lebanese capital. Displaced families spent the night on benches at Zaitunay Bay, a string of restaurants and cafes on Beiruts waterfront. Many of Israels attacks have been carried out in the south of Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has most of its operations, or Beiruts southern suburbs. Mondays attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beiruts city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said. The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorised its military to reinforce in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden, asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, said It has to be. He said he will be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
