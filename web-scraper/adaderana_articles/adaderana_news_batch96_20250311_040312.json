        "date": "March 5, 2024 09:33 pm",
        "content": "Meta-owned social media platforms Facebook and Instagram were down for hundreds of thousands of users on Tuesday in a global outage that has been going on for more than an hour. The disruptions started around 10:00 am ET (1500 GMT), with many users saying on rival social media platform X they had been booted out of Facebook and Instagram and were unable to log in. There were more than 300,000 reports of outages for Facebook and 40,000 reports for Instagram on tracking website Downdetector.com. Were aware people are having trouble accessing our services. We are working on this now, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X. The social media giant, shares of which were down 1.5 in late morning trade, has about 3.19 billion daily active users across its family of apps, which also include WhatsApp and Threads. Metas status dashboard showed the application programming interface for WhatsApp Business was also facing issues. Though the outage for WhatsApp and Threads was much smaller, with under 200 incident reports each on Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including users. Several employees of Meta said on anonymous messaging app Blind that they were unable to log in to their internal work systems, which left them wondering if they were laid off, according to posts seen by Reuters. The outage was among the top trending topics on X, formerly Twitter, with the platforms owner Elon Musk taking a shot at Meta with a post that said: If youre reading this post, its because our servers are working. X itself has faced several disruptions to its service after Musks 44 billion purchase of the social media platform in October 2022, with an outage in December causing issues for more than 77,000 users in countries from the U.S. to France.

        "title": "Sri Lanka, India working to link power grids via 1.2bn undersea transmission line",
        "date": "March 5, 2024 09:51 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka and India are working on an estimated USD 1.2 billion undersea transmission line that will link the island nations power grind with that of India to provide energy security to this country, a top Sri Lankan official said on Tuesday. The proposal is to link Sri Lankas north central town of Anuradhapura and Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state in India through a direct power line. After a 130km overland transmission line in India, an undersea line (via a submarine cable) will emerge at Thiruketheeswaram in Mannar in northeast Sri Lanka. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy said, This will raise our hopes on energy security. He said this days after the fifth meeting of the India-Sri Lanka joint working group (JWG) for cooperation in the power sector was held on February 28 here. The High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha also attended the meeting. The proposal for the power grid interconnection was discussed at this meeting, Jayawardena said. The 4th meeting of the JWG was held in June 2019 in India. This was the 5th meeting of the JWG. A statement from the Indian High Commission said that during the meeting, discussions were held on the power grid interconnection between India and Sri Lanka and the Sampur Solar Power project, to be built by India in Sri Lankas eastern Trincomalee district. On March 1, India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement for the development of a hybrid renewable energy system for the Delft, Analativu and Nainativu islands of the northern Jaffna peninsula. The project, to be carried out under grant assistance from the Government of India, will comprise a 530 kW of wind power, 1,700 kW of solar power, 2,400 kWh of battery power and a 2,500 kW diesel power system for the three islands, which are not connected to Sri Lankas national grid. The proposal to link Sri Lanka with the Indian power grid was proposed more than a decade ago, but it has made little progress till now. In 2023, Sri Lanka said it had hoped to get the transmission line in place within two to three years so that renewable power produced on the islands can be sold to India. After the February 28 meeting, Pankaj Agarwal, Secretary, Indias Ministry of Power, highlighted the benefits that could be accrued by Sri Lanka in the power sector integration with India. It would cause significant cost reductions with Sri Lanka gaining capacity to export to India once the offshore wind capacity in Sri Lanka is harnessed. (It will) also encourage private sector investment in Sri Lankas power sector, he said, according to a statement from the Indian mission in Colombo. However, there is no formal agreement in place as yet. Jayawardena told a local news channel that earlier there was an MoU signed between the two countries to conduct necessary technical assessment. That is the only agreement. However, it was proposed (at the meeting) that the project should be implemented within a legal framework, he said. Jayawardena on Tuesday said the project, which is expected to cost USD 1.2 billion, would require the establishment of a new institution where Sri Lanka would have a 50 per cent representation. However, the proposal needs further discussions as Sri Lanka would need to source funding for it, he added. The statement from the Indian High Commission also noted that substantial progress had been made on the Sampur Solar Power project, especially after the visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in July 2023, during which an energy permit for 50 MW power plant was granted to the implementing agency, Trincomalee Power Corporation Limited (TPCL). The TPCL is a joint venture between the Indian entity NTPC Ltd and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The Indian side also agreed to extend technical assistance to CEB in areas to be identified by the Sri Lankan side, it said. After the March 1 agreement, local media reports have highlighted how the energy sector was identified as a priority area in the India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision document, which was adopted during the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India in July 2023. Several landmark initiatives such as the power grid connectivity, and multi-product two-way oil pipeline are currently under discussion between India and Sri Lanka in the energy sphere. Indias overall development partnership portfolio stands at USD 5 billion with almost USD 600 million being in grants alone. Source: PTI -Agencies",

        "date": "March 5, 2024 11:25 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations has found reasonable grounds to conclude that Hamas committed sexual violence during its Oct. 7 attack in Israel, and said there are indications such violence continues to be carried out against those being held hostage by the group. A UN team that investigated the allegations against Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, received what it called clear and convincing information that women and children held in captivity were subjected to rape, torture and inhumane treatment. The team reviewed more than 5,000 photos and 50 hours of footage of the attacks, as well as conducting interviews with dozens of Israeli officials. It said the true prevalence of sexual violence during the attack and afterward may take months or years to emerge and may never be fully known. Across the various locations of the 7 October attacks, the mission team found that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered  mostly women  with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head, according to the report Monday led by Pramila Patten, the UNs special representative on sexual violence in conflict. Although circumstantial, such a pattern of undressing and restraining of victims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence. Regarding hostages, the mission team said it found clear and convincing information that some have been subjected to various forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and sexualized torture. It also has reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing. Negotiations for a cease-fire in exchange for the release of some of the hostages have bogged down, putting a damper on hopes for an imminent deal. The war erupted when Hamas, an Iran-backed group, rampaged through southern Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 and capturing 250. More than 30,000 have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israels retaliatory air and ground assault, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Patten and her team of technical experts visited Israel and the West Bank for two weeks starting Jan. 29. The UN mission didnt request to visit the Gaza Strip, where several other UN entities operate but did receive information alleging forms of sexual violence against Palestinians by Israel in detention settings, during house raids and at checkpoints, according to the report. It said it hasnt verified those claims. A separate report by the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel found last month that the sexual violence committed by Hamas was systematic and deliberate, and not a malfunction or an isolated incident. Hamas practices were designed to destroy and inflict sadistic terror, author Carmit Klar-Chalamish wrote in the report. The manner in which these assaults were carried out aimed to reinforce their impact on the victims and their communities. Source: Bloomberg -Agencies",

The country craft was heading toward Sri Lanka, and it was intercepted after a hot pursuit by the joint team of officials from the DRI, Chennai zonal unit, and ICG Mandapam. Following a tip-off that narcotics substances were being smuggled from India to Sri Lanka via the coastal route near the Mandapam Sea coast, the officials took up surveillance over the Gulf of Mannar through a Coast Guard ship on the intervening night of March 4 and 5. During the surveillance in the deep sea, officers of DRI and the Coast Guard identified a country boat sailing towards Sri Lanka and intercepted the same after a brief hot pursuit, an official release here said. On interception, officers rummaged the boat and found five sacks concealed inside it. The country boat along with the contraband and three persons on board were brought to Coast Guard Station Mandapam this morning for further investigation. During interrogation, they admitted that the bags were packed with narcotic substances and that they received the bags from a person in the Pamban coastal area and acted upon his instructions to carry the same to be delivered to an unknown person from Sri Lanka in the deep sea, the release said. Following this, the DRI apprehended the said person from his house and upon questioning it was found that this man was the kingpin who organised the smuggling of narcotics substances from India to Sri Lanka via the coastal route. Preliminary investigation reveals that the seized drugs were transported from different parts of the country for further transportation to Sri Lanka by country boats, the release stated. A total of 111 packets of hashish weighing 99 kgs valued at  108 crore in the international market was seized under the NDPS Act. All four persons were apprehended for further investigation, the release said. This is a major haul of narcotic substances initiated by Indias DRI as part of its sustained efforts to combat drug trafficking. On March 1, the DRI officials seized  180 crore worth of narcotic drug methamphetamine meant to be transported to Sri Lanka from a rail passenger in Madurai and a dumpyard in Chennai. They also detained the man and his wife in connection with the seizure. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 09:39 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe arrived at the parliament this morning (March 06) to deliver a special statement on the progress of Sri Lankas economic recovery process. The parliamentary proceedings, presided over by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, commenced around 9.30 a.m. Addressing the Chamber, the Head of State said the citizens are now benefitting from the strenuous efforts taken by the government to revive the economy. We made an economic plan with the IMF. As a result of implementing this plan, the country returned to normalcy day by day. This reduced the pressure on the people and alleviated the hardships. Wickremesinghe further mentioned that the countrys economy, which contracted for six consecutive quarters, began to revive in the Q3 of 2023, while adding that international financial institutions have forecast a potential economic growth for Sri Lanka, ranging from 2 - 3 for the year 2024. Speaking further, the President revealed that state revenue witnessed a significant growth of more than 50 in 2023 as opposed to 2022. A surplus was achieved in the primary account last year. As a result, the government was able to settle all outstanding payments owed to contractors who had rendered services to the government for the past 3-4 years, he added. Meanwhile, inflation has plummeted from 70 in September 2022 to a mere 5.9 in February 2024, the President mentioned, attributing it to the coordinated macroeconomic demand management endeavours by both the Central Bank and the government. Inflation dipping to 5.9 offered respite to small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) and consumers, he explained. He also announced that the usable foreign exchange reserves, which stood at less than USD 20 million in mid-April 2022, have now soared past USD 3 billion. Further, import restrictions, except for private motor vehicles, have also been lifted now, he continued. With regard to debt restructuring negotiations, the President said the successful outcome of these discussions will diminish annual external debt payment from 9.5 to 4  of GDP. Additionally, the government revenue can be maintained at a substantial level if the current trend of economic growth experienced in 2022 and 2023 persists, Wickremesinghe added, emphasizing that under these circumstances, servicing the debt will not impose a burden on the country. Our goal is to obtain temporary relief from debt defaults from 2023 to 2027. Subsequently, we plan to diligently work towards repaying the loans in the period from 2027 to 2042. Deeming the implementation of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) a bitter and challenging decision, the President said this move, however, helped boost state revenue to nearly 11 of the GDP. We must endure this temporary pain for the greater good. The President opined that if the current trajectory is continued with the same vigour, the countrys economy would be in significantly better shape by the end of this year. Additionally, weve ceased the practice of using taxpayers money to cover the losses of government institutions. Instead, were restructuring these institutions and transferring them to investors. Meanwhile, the government is actively pursuing essential legal reforms to strengthen and modernize the legal framework, systems, and processes, which he said aim to improve public financial and economic management for the benefit of all. In a ground-breaking move for South Asia, the Governance Diagnostic Report has been released, and on-going efforts are underway to enhance governance and mitigate corruption risks. Were also attracting investments and establishing a new institution for this purpose. He revealed that efforts are underway to modernize the islands agriculture sector, with several foreign countries expressing interest in starting large-scale farms under food security initiatives. Were gradually unlocking foreign markets for exports, focusing on non-traditional export items. The goal of the government is to transform Sri Lanka into a green and digital economy and establish it as a regional economic and service hub, with plans to make the Port City an international financial hub, he continued. The measures implemented by the government thus far have allowed for the provision of numerous facilities and concessions to the majority of citizens, the President emphasized. Adding to this, he said, Under the Urumaya program, two million families will acquire land ownership, reclaiming inherited land lost over generations. Weve tripled social security spending to protect the poor and vulnerable from the economic crisis, benefiting 2.4 million low-income families with Aswesuma. Around 4.5 million schoolchildren are now covered by the Suraksha insurance scheme. Every school teaching information technology now has smart classrooms, and 100,000 school children have received scholarships through the Presidents Fund. The funds allocated to patients from the Presidents Fund have been doubled. Development initiatives have begun in numerous villages across 89 Divisional Secretariat divisions as part of the Kandukara Dashakaya, with each regional secretariat allocated Rs.100 million for this purpose. Development activities in constituencies are underway through the decentralized budget, and agricultural modernization initiatives have been launched across 25 Divisional Secretariats. Tourism is on the rise, benefiting many individuals, and were working to further enhance its development. The economy, which had contracted, is now gradually recovering, leading to relief for the people. Weve suspended the Parate law for business establishments and offered relief on electricity bills this week. Additionally, we aim to exempt items such as books, school equipment, health equipment, and medicine from the VAT list to continue reducing the VAT rate. The President asserted that the government is diligently strengthening the economy day by day, striving tirelessly to improve the lives of the people and fortify the economy. Our actions are guided by a strategic plan, ensuring a systematic and methodical approach. Wickremesinghe reiterated that his actions are not driven by personal popularity or power but by a dedication to the future of the country. While certain segments of society have faced hardships due to our current practices, the government is striving to uplift the entire society and establish a sustainable economy where growth benefits all.",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 10:29 am",
        "content": "The United States on Tuesday revised language in a draft United Nations Security Council resolution to back an immediate ceasefire of roughly six weeks in Gaza together with the release of all hostages, according to the text seen by Reuters. The third revision of the text - first proposed by the U.S. two weeks ago - now reflects blunt remarks by Vice President Kamala Harris. The initial U.S. draft had shown support for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. wants any Security Council support for a ceasefire to be linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Washington had been averse to the word ceasefire. It has vetoed three draft council resolutions - two of which would have demanded an immediate ceasefire - during the five-month-long war. Most recently, the U.S. justified its veto by saying that such council action could jeopardize efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday it was in the hands of Hamas whether to accept a deal for a ceasefire as delegations held a third day of talks with no sign of a breakthrough. The U.S. traditionally shields Israel at the United Nations, but it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions that aimed to boost aid to Gaza and called for extended pauses in fighting. In retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Israel launched a military assault on Hamas in Gaza that health authorities say has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians with thousands more bodies feared lost amid the ruins. Washington has been stepping up pressure on its ally Israel to do more to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the U.N. has warned that a quarter of the 2.3 million people in the enclave are on the brink of famine. The United States has said it plans to allow time for negotiations on its draft and will not rush to a vote. To pass, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., France, Britain, Russia or China. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

As such, school exercise books, stationery items, medicines and medical equipment are planned to be exempted from the VAT, he added. Wickremesinghe arrived at the parliament complex on Wednesday morning to brief the House on the progress of Sri Lankas economic recovery process. Addressing the parliamentary proceedings, the Head of State acknowledged that imposing the VAT was undoubtedly a bitter and challenging decision, adding that this helped boost state revenue to nearly 11 of the GDP. We made the decision to implement such a tax with great reluctance. However, considering the economic ailment we face, there are no other viable options. He explained that the growth in state revenue gave assurances to the international community of the island nations capacity to repay its outstanding debts. Increased state revenue has gradually strengthened the rupee, which ultimately resulted in the reduction of prices on imported goods including fuel, Wickremesinghe continued. As a result, all VAT-paying companies are now reaping the benefits of the stronger rupee, which extends to the entire country. Furthermore, we anticipate additional benefits in the future. Speaking further, the Head of State revealed the governments intentions to expand the tax net further. Owing to the measures taken to widen the tax base, Sri Lanka has seen a rapid growth in taxpayer registration, he said, adding that the total number of tax files stood over 1 million by the end of 2023. He emphasized that if Sri Lanka continued its current trajectory with the same vigour, its economy would be in significantly better shape by the end of this year.

This may also be because of our increased elderly population, the Health Secretary explained, emphasising the importance of going for regular eye check-ups, and making use of the programmes in place within the countrys health system to detect eye illnesses early.",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 12:52 pm",
        "content": "A 62-year-old man from Germany has, against medical advice, been vaccinated 217 times against Covid, doctors report. The bizarre case is documented in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. The shots were bought and given privately within the space of 29 months. The man appears to have suffered no ill effects, researchers from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg say. Very interested We learned about his case via newspaper articles, Dr Kilian Schober, from the universitys microbiology department, said. We then contacted him and invited him to undergo various tests in Erlangen. He was very interested in doing so. The man provided fresh blood and saliva samples. The researchers also tested some frozen blood samples of his that had been stored in recent years. Dr Schober said: We were able to take blood samples ourselves when the man received a further vaccination during the study at his own insistence. We were able to use these samples to determine exactly how the immune system reacts to the vaccination. Evidence for 130 of the jabs was collected by the public prosecutor of the city of Magdeburg, who opened an investigation with the allegation of fraud, but no criminal charges were brought. Covid vaccines cannot cause infection but can teach the body how to fight the disease. Immune system Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines work by showing the bodys cells a bit of genetic code from the virus. The immune system should then recognise and know how to fight Covid should they encounter it for real. Dr Schober worried hyper-stimulating the immune system with repeated doses might have fatigued certain cells. But the researchers found no evidence of this in the 62-year-old. And there was no sign that he had ever been infected with Covid. Favoured approach The researchers said: Importantly, we do not endorse hyper-vaccination as a strategy to enhance adaptive immunity. And the results of their tests on the 62-year-old were insufficient for making far-reaching conclusions, let alone recommendations for the general public. Current research indicates that a three-dose vaccination, coupled with regular top-up vaccines for vulnerable groups, remains the favoured approach, they say on the universitys website. There is no indication that more vaccines are required. The NHS says Covid vaccines are normally given seasonally but some people with a severely weakened immune system may need additional protection at other times - and it will contact those whose NHS record suggests may be eligible. Covid vaccines can have side effects. A common one is a sore arm from the injection. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 01:31 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena detailed the recent salary hikes of those employed at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Responding to a question raised by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S. M. Marikkar in Parliament this morning (06 March), the Premier provided a detailed explanation of the amounts and percentages by which the salaries were increased by for each position within the CBSL, emphasisng that these facts were made easily accessible to the public. Recent media reports revealed that the CBSL had increased the salaries of its employees by 70 and the move was heavily criticized by parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition, following which the CBSL officials were summoned before the Cabinet, party leaders meeting and the Committee on Public Finance (COPF). On 25 February, the CBSL requested the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, for an opportunity to apprise the Members of Parliament, through an appropriate Parliamentary Committee, of the recent salary increment which came under fire. The request was made in writing by CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. Issuing a release in this regard, the CBSL had explained that the latest revision of remuneration of its employees had been approved by the Governing Board under the triennial Collective Agreement entered into with the Trade Unions covering the period 2024 - 2026. When summoned before the meeting of party leaders and Committee on Public Finance (COPF) held 05 March, CBSL governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe defended the move, saying that the salaries need to be increased as the country recovers from the economic crisis. Drawing criticism from the MPs about the unethical aspect and the insensitivity of the move, the CBSL governor said the expenses for the salary increase would be drawn from the central bank fund, not from the consolidated fund. However, the MPs pointed out that the approval of the parliament which is responsible for public finances is required for such salary hikes, adding that an additional Rs. 232 million will have to be spent monthly on this. The central bank officials were thus urged to revise the move.",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 01:51 pm",
        "content": "Seven men are now in custody in India for the alleged gang-rape of a tourist and assault on her husband, authorities said, in a case that has shone a new spotlight on the endemic problem of sexual violence against women in the country. On Saturday, police announced that three men had been arrested in connection with the incident and that they were seeking four more. Dumka Deputy Commissioner Anjaneyulu Dodde confirmed to CNN Tuesday that four further suspects had now been detained. The couple, who had been traveling by motorcycle from the state of West Bengal to neighboring Nepal, were found late Friday by police officers on patrol, said Pitambar Singh Kherwar, superintendent of Dumka district police in Jharkhand state. They were taken to the hospital, where the woman told the doctor she had been raped, he said. Police have formed a special investigative team, Kherwar said. It is unclear whether the suspects have legal representation. CNN is not naming the female victim, in accordance with Indian law that prevents the naming of victims of sexual violence. Police have not disclosed the names or nationalities of the couple. The arrests come after a travel vlogger couple on Saturday posted on their Instagram account that they had knives (held) to our throats, during an attack in India. The woman had been raped and brought to the hospital for DNA testing, they said. The couple posts in Spanish, and the woman says on her Instagram page that she is Brazilian. On their Instagram story, the woman showed bruises on her face, saying, This is what my face looks like, but it isnt what hurts the most. I thought I was going to die. In a follow-up post Sunday, the couple thanked their followers for their support, saying they are doing well and that the police is doing everything possible to catch the remaining suspects. Indias National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the alleged attack. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has spoken to the victim and extended all required assistance, the organization posted on social platform X on Saturday. Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur called the alleged assault a condemnable incident. If a crime has been committed, the culprits will not be spared, he said on Saturday. India has struggled for years to tackle high rates of violence against women, with a number of high-profile rape cases involving foreign visitors drawing international attention to the issue. In 2018, A British woman was allegedly raped while walking to her hotel in the western state of Goa, a popular tourist destination; two years earlier, an American woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a group of men in her five-star hotel room in New Delhi. And in 2013, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape of a Swiss tourist. According to Indias National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 31,516 rape cases were recorded in 2022, an average of 86 cases per day. And experts warn that the number of cases recorded are just a small fraction of what may be the real number, in a deeply patriarchal country where shame and stigma surround rape victims and their families.

        "date": "March 6, 2024 04:23 pm",
        "content": "The UNs food agency on Tuesday said that its aid convoy had been turned away by Israeli forces at a checkpoint to northern Gaza, after which it was looted by desperate people. The World Food Programme said the 14-truck food convoy waited at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint, inside southeast Gaza, for three hours before being turned away by the Israeli army. It was the first convoy attempted since the agency halted deliveries to the north of Gaza on February 20, after its convoy of trucks faced gunfire and looting. At the time, the agency described the situation in northern Gaza as complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order. In Tuesdays incident, after the trucks were rerouted they were stopped by a large crowd of desperate people who looted the food, taking about 200 tons, the WFP said in a statement. The agency said that it was exploring all ways to bring food to northern Gaza, but that roads were the only way to transport large quantities of food needed to avert famine. An airdrop earlier on Tuesday, in conjunction with Jordans air force, dropped six tons of food, enough for 20,000 people, it said. Airdrops are a last resort and will not avert famine. We need entry points to northern Gaza that will allow us to deliver enough food for half a million people in desperate need, the agencys deputy executive director Carl Skau said. Skau told the UN Security Council last week that a famine was imminent in northern Gaza if conditions remain unchanged. The UN estimates that 2.2 million people -- most of Gazas population -- are on the brink of famine, particularly in the north where Israeli forces block aid from entering. On Tuesday, the WFP said hunger had reached catastrophic levels in the north. Children are dying of hunger-related diseases and suffering severe levels of malnutrition, it said, calling for more entry points into Gaza, including the north. It said a ceasefire was urgently needed. Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza has been plunged into a food crisis, with outside aid severely restricted. Source  AFP - Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 06:56 pm",
        "content": "Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in Novembers election. Haley will give a speech at 10 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time. She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added. Haleys decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday, opens new tab, when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests. Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the partys base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments. The rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters. The election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarization. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020. Haley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip. She ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trumps dominance. But her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trumps scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election. On March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9 of the vote, versus 33.2 for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state. Biden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February ReutersIpsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history. About half of respondents said the same about Trump. KEY ISSUES As in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November. The central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Bidens economic performance. Bidens other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trumps hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016. Voters expect Trump would do a better job on both the economy and immigration, according to opinion polls. Republican lawmakers, egged on by Trump, rejected a bipartisan immigration enforcement bill in February, giving Biden an opportunity to argue that Republicans are more interested in preserving the southern border as a problem rather than finding a solution. Democrats are also optimistic that voter sentiment on the economy will shift in Bidens favor if economic trends go on rising throughout 2024. Trump may be dogged by his myriad criminal charges throughout the year, though the schedule of his trials remains unclear. The federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, perhaps the weightiest he faces, has been paused while Trump pursues a long-shot argument that he is immune from prosecution. While most Republicans view his indictments as politically motivated, according to ReutersIpsos polling, about a quarter of Republicans and half of independents say they wont support him if he is convicted of a crime before the election. Biden has argued that Trump poses a threat to democracy, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to reverse Bidens 2020 victory. Abortion, too, will play a crucial role after the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, buoyed by three Trump appointees, eliminated a nationwide right to terminate pregnancies in 2022. The subject has become a political liability for Republicans, helping Democrats over-perform expectations in the 2022 midterm elections. Abortion rights advocates have launched efforts to put the issue before voters in several states, including the battleground of Arizona. HALEY THWARTED Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been among the first Republican contenders to enter the race in February 2023, but she was largely an afterthought until garnering attention for her standout debate performances later in the year. She put her foreign policy expertise at the center of her campaign, adopting hawkish stances toward China and Russia and forcefully advocating for continued aid to Ukraine, a stance that put her at odds with the more isolationist Trump. But she was reluctant to completely disavow her former boss - she served as Trumps U.N. ambassador - despite his four indictments and two impeachments. Trump showed no such reticence, frequently insulting her intelligence and Indian heritage. Only in the last months of her campaign did Haley begin to forcefully hit back at Trump, questioning his mental acuity, calling him a liar and saying he was too afraid to debate her. In the final weeks of the campaign, she became the standard-bearer for the anti-Trump wing of the party, a dramatic evolution for someone who just months earlier praised the former president in her stump speeches. Still, she said she would pardon Trump if he were convicted in any of the criminal cases he faces, a position she has never abandoned. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2024 07:42 pm",
        "content": "In January, Experience Travel Group published an open letter with 35 signatories calling for FCDO advice on Sri Lanka to be amended. It criticised mentions of fuel and food shortages in the country dating back to the 2022 political unrest and continued references to the 2019 terrorist attacks. The letter, signed by tourism providers in the UK and Sri Lanka, labelled current advice overly harsh and said the UK the government was systematically undermining the travel industry in Sri Lanka. The letter came to the attention of Conservative peer Lord Naseby, who told the House of Lords the FCDO comments currently cause me concern because they refer to the fact that protests are going on when they are not. He added: They say that there is a fuel shortage, but there is not and has not been for 18 months. They also say that there are other difficulties of a terrorist nature, which we have not had for five years. Naseby urged foreign secretary David Cameron to re-examine the guidance. He continued: Perhaps I could bring a couple of people from the newly set-up Experience Travel Group to perhaps talk to a junior minister about amending that. Experience Travel Group managing director Sam Clark called the mention a pivotal moment in our campaign. We are very appreciative of Lord Naseby calling for a meeting with foreign secretary Lord Cameron, he said. I am hopeful that this will progress our discussions on the best way forward to accurately represent Sri Lanka in our governments travel guidance in a way that does cause unjust harm to Sri Lankas economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism. The FCDO advice is stuck in the past and it is vital that the Foreign Office updates the system across the board so travellers can once again place their trust in its accuracy.

He also highlighted the growing interest from India, China, and several Western nations in investing in the country. State Minister Fernando made these statements at a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (06), under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further he said; In response to the economic crisis that halted development projects last season, the government has taken action as the economy shows signs of improvement. Necessary development work is now underway to address the countrys pressing needs and stimulate growth. Plans have been set to commence 2000 houses project in Colombo and its suburbs, with support from Chinese aid. Additionally, initiatives are in place to issue deeds to all residents residing in flats, ensuring proper documentation and ownership rights. Furthermore, progress has been made on the Kandukara Dashakaya Development Project, marking a significant step forward in rural development efforts. Coastal development and low-lying land development activities have commenced, paving the way for a series of regional-level development projects across the island. The government, in line with its policy of divesting from business activities, has readied the Colombo Hilton Hotel for private sector investment. Already, four businessmen have expressed interest in investing in the property. However, the government emphasizes the necessity of securing the expected financial investment for the projects success. Additionally, progress on the Hyatt Hotel, which falls under our ministry, has reached the halfway mark, with efforts underway to seek an investor for its completion. Furthermore, theres a proposal to attract investors for the development of both sides of DR Wijewardene Mawatha, stretching from Lotus Tower to Lakehouse Roundabout. The preliminary groundwork for the Japanese project aimed at cleaning the Beira Lake in Colombo has been successfully concluded. This sets the stage for the project to commence as early as next month, marking a significant step toward enhancing the environmental quality of the area. In response to the recurring issue of floods plaguing Colombo city, particularly during minor rainfall, our ministry has devised a comprehensive program for flood control. Despite awaiting the necessary financial allocation, preparations for future initiatives are underway. Once funding is secured, our team is poised to swiftly implement measures to mitigate flooding and safeguard the citys infrastructure. Furthermore, notable interest from prominent nations such as India, China, and various Western countries underscores the growing confidence in investing in Sri Lanka. With the countrys economy showing signs of improvement, its inevitable that more investors will be drawn to opportunities here, bolstering economic growth and development efforts.",

The IMF had previously said the second review of Sri Lankas 2.9 billion bailout could be completed in the first half of 2024, provided it manages to meet debt restructuring and revenue targets set under the programme. The IMF executive board cleared the first review of Sri Lankas bailout package in December 2023, providing approximately USD 337 million in funds as the second tranche to help tackle the fallout from the countrys worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lanka received the first tranche of the loan in March 2023 after the executive board approved the 48-month EFF program.",

        "title": "Three crew members killed in Houthi missile attack on cargo ship",
        "date": "March 7, 2024 08:39 am",
        "content": "A missile attack by Yemens Houthi rebels on a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday killed three of its crew members and forced survivors to abandon the vessel, the U.S. military said. It was the first fatal strike in a campaign of assaults by the Iranian-backed group over Israels war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The attack on the Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier True Confidence further escalates the conflict on a crucial maritime route linking Asia and the Middle East to Europe that has disrupted global shipping. The Houthis have launched attacks since November, and the U.S. began an airstrike campaign in January that so far hasnt halted their attacks. Meanwhile, Iran announced Wednesday that it would confiscate a 50 million cargo of Kuwaiti crude oil for American energy firm Chevron Corp. aboard a tanker it seized nearly a year earlier. It is the latest twist in a yearslong shadow war playing out in the Middle Easts waterways even before the Houthi attacks began. The U.S. militarys Central Command said an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from a Houthi-controlled area in Yemen struck the True Confidence, causing significant damage to the ship. In addition to the three deaths, at least four crew members were wounded, with three in critical condition. Two aerial photos released by the U.S. military showed the the ships bridge and cargo on board ablaze. These reckless attacks by the Houthis have disrupted global trade and taken the lives of international seafarers simply doing their jobs, which are some of the hardest jobs in the world, and the ones relied on by the global public for sustainment of supply chains, Central Command said. The attack came after the ship had been hailed over radio by men claiming to be the Yemeni military, officials said. The Houthis have been hailing ships over the radio in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since beginning their attacks, with analysts suspecting the rebels want to seize the vessels. After the missile hit, the crew abandoned the ship and deployed lifeboats. A U.S. warship and the Indian navy were on the scene, trying to assist in rescue efforts. The ships managers and owners said the ships crew of 20 included one Indian, 15 Filipinos and four Vietnamese. Three armed guards, two from Sri Lanka and one from Nepal, also were on board. The ship had been carrying steel from China to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The United Nations called on the Houthis to cease all attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, expressing serious concern about the continuing attacks, including the latest incident where the status of the crew is unknown. Dujarric said the attacks are causing risks to property, to life, to ecology in the area. At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Matthew Miller condemned the attack. We continue to watch these reckless attacks with no regard for the well being of innocent civilians who are transiting through the Red Sea. And now they have, unfortunately and tragically, killed innocent civilians, he told reporters. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre separately warned: The U.S. obviously is going to continue to take action. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded message, saying its missile fire set the vessel ablaze. He said the rebels attacks would only stop when the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza is lifted. The rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war, but up to Wednesday hadnt killed any crew members. The vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory. Despite more than a month and a half of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels have remained capable of launching significant attacks. They include the attack last month on a cargo ship carrying fertilizer, the Rubymar, which sank on Saturday after drifting for several days, and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. It was unclear why the Houthis targeted the True Confidence. However, it had previously been owned by Oaktree Capital Management, a Los Angeles-based fund that finances vessels on installments. Oaktree declined to comment. Meanwhile, a separate Houthi assault Tuesday apparently targeted the USS Carney, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer that has been involved in the American campaign against the rebels. The Carney shot down bomb-carrying drones and one anti-ship ballistic missile, Central Command said. Saree acknowledged that attack as well. The U.S. later launched an airstrike destroying three anti-ship missiles and three bomb-carrying drone boats, Central Command said. The Houthis havent offered any assessment of the damage theyve suffered in the American-led strikes that began in January, though theyve said at least 22 of their fighters have been killed. One civilian has reportedly been killed. The U.S. Treasury separately announced new sanctions targeting a Houthi financier and the expeditionary Quds Force of Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which arms the rebels. The Houthis have held Yemens capital, Sanaa, since 2014. Theyve battled a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a long-stalemated war there. Meanwhile, the Indian navy released a video of its sailors from the INS Kolkata fighting a fire aboard the MSC Sky II, which had been targeted by the Houthis in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. The Mediterranean Shipping Co., a Switzerland-based company, said the missile struck the ship as it was traveling from Singapore to Djibouti. No one was injured. Iran separately announced the seizure of the crude oil aboard the Advantage Sweet through an announcement carried by the judiciarys state-run Mizan news agency. At the time, Iran alleged that the Advantage Sweet collided with another ship, without offering any evidence. The court order for the seizure offered an entirely different reason for the confiscation. Mizan said it was part of a court order over U.S. sanctions it alleged barred the importation of a Swedish medicine used to treat patients suffering from epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic condition that causes blisters all over the body and eyes. It didnt reconcile the different reasons for the seizure. The Advantage Sweet had been in the Persian Gulf in late April, but its track showed no unusual behavior as it transited through the Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of all traded oil passes. Iran has made allegations in other seizures that later fell apart as it became clear that Tehran was trying to leverage the capture as a bargaining chip to negotiate with foreign nations. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Wednesday that the Advantage Sweet had been seized under false pretenses and that the company has not had any direct communication with Iran over the seizure of the vessel. Chevron has not been permitted access to the vessel and considers the cargo a total loss due to Irans illegal actions, Chevron said in a statement. We now consider the cargo the responsibility of the Iranian government. Ship seizures and explosions have roiled the region since 2019. The incidents began after then President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Irans nuclear deal with world powers. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 09:00 am",
        "content": "A police officer has been arrested on charges of being complicit the foiled attempt by the notorious underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata to escape custody. The apprehended officer was identified as a Police Sergeant attached to the Matara Divisional Crimes Investigation Division. The Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) had arrested the 36-year-old on Wednesday (March 06) for aiding and abetting the infamous criminal gang leader and covering up information vital to the ongoing investigations. According to the police media division, the suspect was also involved with Jayasekara Withanage Ruwan Chamara alias Midigama Ruwan who operates from overseas and orchestrated Harak Katas escape bid at the CID. Investigating officers have uncovered a WhatsApp messages exchanged between the arrested police sergeant and Midigama Ruwan. Moreover, it was uncovered that the suspected police officer had been involved with a man known by his alias Sudda, who is said to have helped bring in a motorcycle and a helmet to the CID premises to help Harak Katas escape attempt last year. The TID is conducting further investigations into the suspect under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Harak Kata was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu on March 01, 2023, in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry on March 08, 2023, of the arrest of eight suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking. While in custody, Harak Kata attempted a failed escape bid at the CID premises in September 2023, with the help of several police officers. One such Constable remains at large after fleeing the CID premises and now the police have offered a cash reward of Rs. 2.5 million for a tip-off about the said officer named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the aforementioned constable had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date while certain reports have claimed that he is presumed to have fled the country. A police constable, a former army sniper and several others are currently in custody in connection with the incident.",

Mr. Chanaka Udayakumara Amarasinghe, the NCPA chairman, explained that these convicts are most likely to repeat the offences once they are released from custody after serving their prison sentences, adding that this leaves children at risk of falling prey to molesters. Joining a media briefing held at the Health Promotion Bureau, Mr. Amarasinghe said the NCPA is in the process of preparing a list of convicted child molesters to make their information available to the concerned parties. Additionally, the NCPA is discussing whether legal provisions can be introduced to either prevent or restrict the ex-convicts from entering the premises frequented by children, after being released from prison. According to Mr. Amarasinghe, the country has witnessed a disturbing increase in the number of cases of child sexual abuse in 2023. Last year, Sri Lanka had recorded as many as 1,639 cases of rape on female children as opposed to the 1,618 reported in 2022. Meanwhile, incidents of sexual assaults reported in 2022 stood at 1,232, and this soared to 1,497 last year, the NCPA chairman added.",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 12:56 pm",
        "content": "An Indian painter who had lost both his hands in an accident has received a new set of limbs after a donation by a woman who had pledged her organs to be used following her death and as doctors at Delhis Sir Ganga Ram Hospital performed a complex surgery. In October 2020, Raj Kumar, now 45, was crossing the railway tracks in Nangloi on his bicycle when he lost control and was run over by the train losing both his hands. Kumar had been using prosthetics but his prosthetic trial was unsuccessful. His only hope was a hand transplant. And, a pledge by Meena Mehta, former administrative head of a South Delhi school who was declared brain-dead, came to his help. Kumar underwent a bilateral hand transplant under the team of Dr Mahesh Mangal, Chairman, Department of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, and Dr Swaroop Singh Gambhir, Senior Consultant, Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Keeping transplant protocols in mind, after detailed examination and necessary investigations, a team of 11 doctors executed the intricate 12-hour procedure, delicately reattaching various components, including bones, arteries, veins, tendons, muscles, nerves, and skin. Speaking with The Indian Express, Dr Gambhir said they selected Kumar as he was a bilateral amputee and took the hands from Mehta, who was a multi-organ donor. Once we selected the patient, and did the blood match we got to know he was the fit candidate for the patient. We took the hands and we fixed the bones first with plates and screws and we fixed the muscles and then artery and the nerve, said Dr Gambhir. Dr Gambhir said precision and expertise were the keys to ensuring the seamless integration of the transplanted hands into Kumars body. Raj Kumar recovered in six weeks after the surgery and Dr Gambhir said Kumar is doing fine now and will be discharged later on Wednesday. One of Mehtas kidneys was sent to Fortis Gurgaon, offering a new lease of life to a patient. Simultaneously, her hands, liver, and corneas became instruments of transformation at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, opening up new possibilities for the recipients. In February 2023, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital became the first hospital in North India to receive permission to perform hand transplant surgeries. Source: The Indian Express",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Indian Navy swiftly responded to a distress call from the Gulf of Aden where a merchant vessel caught fire after being hit by a missile, and rescued 21 crew members, including one Indian national. The Indian Navy informed in a statement on Thursday that its naval warship, INS Kolkata swiftly acted against Wednesdays maritime incident and all the crew members were safely evacuated to Djibouti. As per the Navy, Barbados Flagged Bulk Carrier MV True Confidence was reportedly hit by a drone missile, approximately 55 nm South West of Aden, on Wednesday, resulting in a fire onboard and critical injuries to some of the crew members forcing the crew to abandon the ship. INS Kolkata, deployed for Maritime Security Operations arrived at the scene of action at 1645 hours and rescued 21 crew members, including one Indian national, from the life raft using its integral helicopter and boats. Critical medical aid was also provided to the injured crew by the ships medical team. The rescued crew, including the critically injured personnel, were evacuated to Djibouti on March 6 by INS Kolkata. Earlier on Wednesday, INS Kolkata responded to another distress call from a Liberian-flagged container vessel, MSC Sky II which was reportedly attacked by a drone or missile in the southeast of Aden. In a swift action after the distress call at 7:00 pm, the INS Kolkata mission deployed was immediately diverted to render necessary assistance and reached near the attacked ship at 10:30 pm, an official statement said. Additionally, based on the request of the master, the Merchant vessel (MV) was escorted from the scene of the incident to the territorial waters of Djibouti by the Indian Navy ship. According to the statement, the crew of 23 personnel, including 13 Indian nationals are safe and the vessel is proceeding to her next destination. Earlier on Tuesday, a 12-member specialist firefighting team, ex-Kolkata, embarked on the MV and provided assistance in extinguishing the residual fire and smoke. Additionally, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team also embarked on the MV for residual risk assessment. Last month, responding to the distress call from the Fishing Vessel, an Indian Naval ship, mission deployed in the North Arabian Sea for maritime security operations, provided damage control assistance and undertook strengthening of the hull, rendering the boat safe for further transit. Medical aid was also extended to three injured crew members. The relentless and persistent efforts of the Indian Navy reaffirm its resolve towards the safety of all vessels and seafarers transiting in the region, the statement added. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "title": "Rust film set shooting: Armourer found guilty of involuntary manslaughter",
        "date": "March 7, 2024 05:02 pm",
        "content": "A movie set weapons handler who loaded a gun for actor Alec Baldwin before it fired and killed a cinematographer has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was found not guilty of a second charge - tampering with evidence over the 2021 shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust. The 26-year-old faces up to 18 months in jail. She will be sentenced later. Mr Baldwin, 65, also faces a manslaughter trial in July. Ms Hutchins, 42, was killed after a gun Mr Baldwin used in a rehearsal fired a live round on the set of the Western in New Mexico. A lawyer for Mr Baldwin said Gutierrez-Reeds sentencing was very positive for her clients upcoming case. He could not have foreseen that there was a live round on set because the safety, maintenance and care of the firearm and the ammunition was the responsibility of the armourer, Misty Marris told CNN. Jurors deliberated for three hours before returning Wednesdays verdict. Gutierrez-Reed remained expressionless as she learned her fate. As she was led away by two officers she told her weeping mother, Itll be OK, according to Reuters. Ms Hutchins parents and her sister said they were satisfied with the verdict. Their statement added: We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halynas death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions. It means that someone has been held legally criminally culpable for the death of Halyna Hutchins, Misty Marris told CNN. She said Mr Baldwin would argue that it was not foreseeable that there was a real bullet in that gun. Prosecutors said Gutierrez-Reed had failed to ensure the weapon was only loaded with dummy rounds - fake bullets used to look and sound like real ones. This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being, prosecutor Kari T Morrissey said during closing arguments on Wednesday. Gutierrez-Reed was negligent, careless and thoughtless when she failed to notice that live bullets had mixed with dummy rounds in a box of ammunition on set, Ms Morrissey told the jurors. One of those bullets was in the firearm that was used by Mr Baldwin, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Gutierrez-Reed had brought a box of live bullets to the New Mexico film set from her California home. They said these live rounds slowly spread throughout the set over the course of 12 days. Ms Morrissey said she believed the armourer did not intend to bring live rounds to the set, but rather that Ms Hutchins death was a case of tragic negligence. The prosecutor added that Gutierrez-Reed was more worried about her career and less about the victims in the aftermath of the shooting. Gutierrez-Reed did not testify in the two-week trial, but her lawyer said in closing arguments that prosecutors had failed to prove his client was the sole person responsible for the fatal shooting. The ammunition boxes dont matter, because we dont know what was in them three or four days before, her lawyer, Jason Bowles told the jury, arguing his client did not know that there were real bullets on set. Mr Bowles also blamed Mr Baldwin, arguing that he had gone off-script when he pointed the gun at film crew. It was not in the script for Mr Baldwin to point the weapon, he said. She didnt know that Mr Baldwin was going to do what he did. He vowed to file an appeal. Trial witnesses included the films director, Joel Souza, who was also shot in the incident but survived. Mr Souza said he remembered looking up at Gutierrez-Reed after he was shot, and hearing her repeatedly say: Im sorry, Joel. The jury was also shown emotional and distressing footage of the aftermath of the shooting, when the Colt .45 revolver held by Mr Baldwin went off. It included a video that appeared to show Ms Hutchins final moments, with paramedics frantically trying to save her life. Gutierrez-Reed was also found not guilty of evidence tampering stemming from accusations that she attempted to dispose of a small bag of narcotics after the shooting. Last year, the movies cast and crew finished filming in tribute to Ms Hutchins, with her husband serving as an executive producer. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 06:49 pm",
        "content": "Two Sri Lankans are among the 21 crew members rescued by the Indian warship INS Kolkata from the cargo ship True Confidence which was attacked by a missile by Houthi rebels in the Gulf of Aden, according to the Sri Lanka Navy. The navy spokesman Gayan Wickremasuriya further confirmed that one of the rescued Sri Lankan nationals had sustained injuries in the attack. Indias navy evacuated all 20 crew from a stricken vessel in the Red Sea on March 7, after a Houthi attack killed three seafarers in the first civilian fatalities from the Yemeni groups campaign against the key shipping route. The Iran-aligned militants fired a missile at the Barbados-flagged, Greek-operated True Confidence on Wednesday about 50 nautical miles off the port of Aden, setting it ablaze. In a statement, the owners and manager said all 20 crew and three armed guards on board were taken to hospital in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa by an Indian warship. Two of the dead were Filipino nationals, while the third was Vietnamese, the owners and managers said, expressing condolences to families. Two other Filipinos were also severely injured. Images released by the Indian Navy showed a helicopter winching crew members from a small life raft in choppy seas and taking them to a naval ship. Some wounded were shown lying in the bottom of a navy lifeboat sent to assist. They were carried on stretchers onto the ship and were shown later with heavily bandaged limbs as they were evacuated to the Djibouti hospital. The vessel is drifting well away from land and salvage arrangements are being made, the companies said in the statement. The Houthis have kept up a relentless campaign of attacks on vessels in one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes since November, in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians during Israels war with Hamas in Gaza. The loss of life and injuries to civilian seafarers is completely unacceptable, leading global shipping associations said on March 7. The frequency of attacks on merchant shipping highlights the urgent need for all stakeholders to take decisive action to safeguard the lives of innocent civilian seafarers and put an end to such threats. The Houthis have used an array of sophisticated weapons, including ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones, despite retaliatory US and UK-led strikes on their bases in Yemen aimed at crippling their ability to attack. Mr Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), the leading seafarers union, also called for better protection. No delivery window is worth the loss of seafarers lives, he said. We call on the industry to divert ships around the Cape of Good Hope until safe transit through the Red Sea can be guaranteed. Around 23,000 ships a year pass through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to the Suez Canal, accounting for around 12 per cent of global trade. Taking the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa adds about 10 days to the journey, delaying supply chains and pushing up costs. For those still risking the shorter seven-day route via the Red Sea, the cost of insuring a vessel has risen by hundreds of thousands of dollars since the attacks began. The True Confidence was sailing from China to Jeddah and Aqaba with a cargo of steel products and trucks. The vessel is owned by Liberia-registered True Confidence Shipping SA and operated by Greece-based Third January Maritime. There is no current connection with any US entity, the companies said. --With Inputs from Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 09:33 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Sweden is expected to formally join NATO in Washington on Thursday, two years after Russias invasion of Ukraine forced a complete rethink of its national security policy and the realisation the alliance offered the best guarantee of safety. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is in Washington to hand over the final documentation, with the White House saying in a statement ahead of President Joe Bidens State of the Union Address that Sweden would join on Thursday. Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the United States and our Allies even safer, the statement said. Kristersson said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had informed him that Sweden had been formally invited to join after all member states accepted the countrys accession protocol. Sweden will soon be NATOs 32nd member, he said on X. The Swedish government said separately it would take the formal decision for the country to join NATO on Thursday. For NATO, the accession of Sweden and Finland - which shares a 1,340 km border with Russia - is the most significant expansion for decades. It is also a blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has sought prevent any further strengthening of the alliance. Sweden will benefit from the alliances common defence guarantee under which an attack on one member is regarded as an attack on all. We have to face the world as it is not how we sometimes wish it were, Kristersson said after Hungary became the last NATO member to ratify Swedens accession last week. Sweden adds cutting-edge submarines and a sizable fleet of domestically produced Gripen fighter jets to NATO forces and would be a crucial link between the Atlantic and Baltic. Russia has threatened to take unspecified political and military-technical counter-measures in response to Swedens move. While Stockholm has been drawing ever closer to NATO over the last two decades, membership marks a clear break with the past, when for more than 200 years, Sweden avoided military alliances and adopted a neutral stance in times of war. After World War Two, it built an international reputation as a champion of human rights, and when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, successive governments have pared back military spending. As recently as 2021, its defence minister had rejected NATO membership, only for the then-Social Democrat government to apply, alongside neighbour Finland, just a few months later. While Finland joined last year, Sweden was kept waiting as Turkey and Hungary, which both maintain cordial relations with Russia, delayed ratifying Swedens accession. Turkey approved Swedens application in January. Hungary delayed its move until Kristersson made a goodwill visit to Budapest on Feb. 23, where the two countries agreed a fighter jet deal.

        "content": "(AP)  Police in Ottawa on Thursday were investigating a suspected multiple homicide following the deaths of two adults and four children at a house in the southern part of the Canadian capital. A seventh person was in hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening, injuries. It was not immediately announced how the victims died Wednesday, but the Ottawa mayor referred to the case as a multiple homicide, and police said a suspect had been arrested. Sri Lankas high commission in Ottawa said the victims were a family of Sri Lankan nationals who were not Canadian citizens. The high commission said the father survived but his wife and children died, adding that it is in touch with relatives in the countrys capital of Colombo. Canadian authorities have not confirmed the identities of the deceased, their ages or the identity of the person in hospital. Police were called to the home in the Barrhaven area at around 11 p.m. Wednesday night. A suspect was arrested quickly after that, and police said there was not continuing threat to public safety. Ottawa Police Chief Eric Stubbs told local radio stations that police do not believe the deaths were the result of domestic or intimate partner violence, but that theyre also still trying to determine the relationship between the suspect and the victims. Stubbs said it was a very tragic scene. Don Perera, a neighbor, said he met the family that lived in the home last fall at a Halloween party at the nearby Catholic elementary school. He said the father was from Sri Lanka. Shanti Ramesh, who lives across the street, was alerted to a commotion late Wednesday. From her balcony, she saw a man sitting on the driveway of the home and yelling before two police officers arrived and carried him away. On Thursday morning, five marked police cars were parked on the street and in driveways near the home, which is a middle unit of a row of brick townhouses. Several people in white jumpsuits were going in and out of the home throughout the early morning, while parents and kids walked and biked by on their way to a nearby elementary school. Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe called the news distressing for all the citys residents. I was devastated to learn of the multiple homicide in Barrhaven, one of the most shocking incidents of violence in our citys history, Sutcliffe said in a post on X. Police said a media update would be provided later Thursday. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "March 7, 2024 11:26 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera, announced that the revised Electricity Act has been sent to the Legal Draftsmans Department for review. He anticipates presenting it to Parliament for approval in April following Cabinet endorsement. Additionally, the minister expressed readiness to engage stakeholders to discuss reducing fuel prices further through a transparent pricing formula. These remarks were made during his participation in a press conference titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held today (07) at the Presidential Media Centre. Addressing the media briefing Minister Wijesekera further said; Effective from midnight on March 5, 2024, electricity charges saw a significant reduction of 21.9. Notably, consumers using less than 30 units will experience a remarkable 33 decrease in unit price, while those in the 31-60 unit category will witness a reduction of 28. Moreover, bills for consumers utilizing 60-90 units will decrease by 30, and for those consuming between 90 and 180 units, bills were lowered by 24. Domestic consumers exceeding 180 units experienced an 18 reduction in fees, while religious establishments benefited from a 33 decrease. Similarly, hotels and industrial sectors saw an 18 reduction, with a 23 decrease in public works and 22 for the public sector. Street lights also experienced a 20 reduction in charges. However, concerns remain regarding whether restaurant prices have correspondingly decreased and the need for substantial relief in public service categories. These issues extend beyond the scope of the Electricity Board or the Ministry. Additionally, recent heavy rainfall alleviated power generation challenges, partially offsetting the 2022 loss of over Rs. 270 billion. The strengthening rupee, amidst economic stabilization, significantly reduced electricity generation costs, further aided by a decrease in interest rates. Efforts to mitigate electricity bills continue, including utilizing the first instalment of the 100 million Indian loan to provide solar panels for public spaces like schools, defence camps, universities, and religious sites. Emphasis is on adopting cost-effective methods to supplement existing power plants and reduce excessive electricity purchases, ensuring sustainable electricity affordability. Our upcoming endeavour aims to integrate the Siambalanduwa Power Generation Project into the national grid by the latter half of 2025. This initiative will provide the Electricity Board with a capacity of one hundred megawatts at a cost of Rs. 25 or 26 per unit. Concurrently, we are exploring several similar large-scale projects, with significant support from numerous stakeholders. Additionally, we have unveiled ten wind and solar projects to attract both local and foreign investors. Plans are underway to release a tender notice next week for the establishment of a 50 MW wind farm in the Mannar area. Efforts to further alleviate fuel prices are underway, with discussions planned with stakeholders to review the fuel pricing formula. Moreover, the gazette pertaining to the restructuring of the Electricity Board was published last December. Following feedback from stakeholders, political parties, and trade unions regarding the proposed amendments, 46 revisions have been forwarded to the Legal Draftsmans Department for clearance. Upon cabinet approval, we aim to present the revised bill to parliament in April for enactment into law. --PMD",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 06:10 am",
        "content": "Six people including a mother, her four young children and a family acquaintance were killed inside a townhouse in the south Ottawa suburb of Barrhaven late Wednesday night. During a media briefing Thursday afternoon, Ottawa police Chief Eric Stubbs said there were initially two calls to 911 around 10:52 p.m. Wednesday. He said first responders arrived within minutes to the home on Berrigan Drive near Palmadeo Drive, a residential area close to two schools. Police have identified five of the victims as a family of newcomers to Canada from Sri Lanka. They are:  Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake (35-year-old mother)  Inuka Wickramasinghe (7-year-old son)  Ashwini Wickramasinghe (4-year-old daughter)  Rinyana Wickramasinghe (2-year-old daughter)  Kelly Wickramasinghe (2-month-old daughter) Police said Ekanayakes husband was injured and is currently in hospital in stable condition. Hes since been identified as Dhanushka Wickramasinghe. Another man, 40-year-old Amarakoonmubiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, was also killed. Febrio De-Zoysa, 19, is charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. Police said he is a Sri Lankan national who is believed to be in Canada as a student. On Thursday evening, Algonquin College president Claude Brulé released a statement confirming De-Zoysa was a student at the college and that it appears his last semester of attendance was Winter 2023. He made his first court appearance late Thursday afternoon. De-Zoysa spoke little, stating his name and birthdate before sitting down. He was ordered not to contact five people, one of whom is Dhanushka Wickramasinghe. De-Zoysas next court appearance is scheduled for March 14. Police said De-Zoysa is also an acquaintance of the family and was living in the home at the time of the killings. He was arrested at the scene about 15 kilometres south of Ottawas downtown core. Stubbs said the familys youngest daughter was born in Canada, and suggested the family members had arrived at different times. He said Ottawa police had never dealt with either the suspect or the family, and had never been called to that address before Wednesday night. Unimaginable loss During Thursdays update, Stubbs called the killings a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people. He offered his condolences to the victims loved ones for this unimaginable loss. This homicide will undoubtedly weigh on the hearts of everyone for a very long time, he said. A memorial has been set up at nearby Palmadeo Park as police continue to ask people to avoid the scene of the crime. Ottawa police said there is no ongoing risk to public safety. In a letter to parents sent out Thursday afternoon, the Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) confirmed the two eldest children were students in Grade 2 and junior kindergarten at Monsignor Paul Baxter School. Our deepest sympathies and sincerest condolences go to the families and loved ones of the victims during this incredibly challenging time. We cannot imagine the pain and sorrow they must be experiencing, wrote the schools principal Vincenza Nicoletti. The school said grief counselling and crisis support would be available for both students and staff, but said they werent providing much more information to students given the sensitivity surrounding the event. Shanti Ramesh, who lives across the street from the scene, told CBC she was watching TV late Wednesday night when she saw the flashing lights of emergency vehicles. When she went outside, she saw a man screaming. I saw a guy was sitting on the driveway and yelling, so the police came and then they took him away, she said. Police later identified the man as the father of the family. Ramesh said she didnt realize until the following morning that a major tragedy had occurred, and said shes been feeling numb ever since. Its horrible, she told CBC. Police confirmed Wednesdays homicides are considered the worst mass killing in the citys recent history. Knife-like edged weapon used Stubbs told reporters on Thursday afternoon that an edged knife-like weapon was used in the homicides. In an earlier interview on CBC News Network, he had initially called the incident a mass shooting, but it was not. While police did not speculate on a motive for the killings, Stubbs earlier told CBC investigators do not believe it to be a case of intimate partner violence. This is a tragic file  and it will greatly impact the city of Ottawa, let alone the immediate neighbourhood in Barrhaven. So obviously we encourage everybody to reach out and get help to help manage themselves through this traumatic event, he said. I cant believe it After hearing the news early Thursday, Barrhaven resident David Brose came to the scene. Im obviously in shock ... its tough, he said, his voice breaking. Im just in awe. I cant believe it. Asked about the incident Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his sadness. Obviously our first reactions are all one of shock and horror at this terrible violence, he said. We are expecting that the community reaches out to support family and friends, as Canadians always do. On social media, Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe called it one of the most shocking incidents of violence in our citys history. In a later interview on CBC News Network, he said people in the community have been stunned by the news. In particular I know people are just devastated to hear that children are involved, Sutcliffe said. I think thats whats most heartbreaking to me and to my family and to all Ottawa residents, is to hear of violence on this scale and to know that children were victims ... its just really incomprehensible and unimaginable and absolutely devastating. Nepean MPP Lisa MacLeod, whose riding includes this part of Barrhaven, said the community woke up to shock and grief. There are no words for the heartbreak me and my neighbours feel for the surviving family, friends and playmates of the deceased, she said. Councillor Wilson Lo, who represents the area, said on social media that he was saddened to learn of the tragic loss of six Barrhaven neighbours, and that his thoughts are with their loved ones and people close by.

        "title": "Gaza ceasefire talks show no sign of progress, US says onus on Hamas",
        "date": "March 8, 2024 09:31 am",
        "content": "Hamas on Thursday left Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo where there was no sign of progress just days before the start of Ramadan, while the U.S. said the onus was on the Palestinian militant group to strike a deal on Israeli hostages. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the lack of agreement after four days of talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt about a 40-day ceasefire amid fears violence could escalate during the Muslim fasting month. Egyptian security sources said talks, taking place without an Israeli delegation in Cairo, would resume on Sunday, the expected start of Ramadan. Senior U.S. administration officials said the onus was on Hamas to complete a hostage deal and attributed the delay to what they described as Hamas so far not agreeing to release sick and elderly hostages. A Hamas official told Reuters the United States was in partnership with Israel and that such comments were misleading. Hamas has insisted that a ceasefire deal include a process toward ending the war altogether. Hamas said earlier in a statement the delegation left Cairo to speak to the movements leaders, with negotiations and efforts continuing to stop the aggression, return the displaced and bring in relief aid to our people. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters Israel had been thwarting efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his intention on Thursday of pressing on with the military campaign in Gaza, launched after Hamas Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which Israel said 1,200 people were killed and 253 abducted. Israel has previously said its aim is to destroy Hamas and that any ceasefire must be temporary. It has also pressed for a list of hostages still alive and held by Hamas in Gaza. Needless to say, Israel will do whatever it takes to release our hostages... unfortunately, it is Hamas who is the stumbling block right now by not telling us who is alive and who they have in their custody, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said. The deal presented to Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza would require it to free some of the hostages it still holds. Palestinian prisoners held in Israel would also be released. DESPAIR Hamas officials have said a ceasefire must be in place before the hostages are freed, Israeli forces must leave Gaza and all Gazans must be able to return to homes they have fled. Hamas has said it cant provide a list of the hostages who are still alive without a ceasefire as the hostages are scattered across the war zone. News that the Hamas delegation had left Cairo without an accord was met with despair in Gaza, which is in the grip of a deep humanitarian crisis after five months of war. I feel great disappointment and despair, fear too, said Abir, who along with her 12-member family has taken refuge in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where more than half of the enclaves 2.3 million people are now sheltering. Hamas media said one Palestinian was killed and several wounded on Thursday by Israeli gunfire as people waited for aid trucks at the Al-Nabulsi roundabout in western Gaza City. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry reported that Israeli fire killed 118 people last week at the same site when desperate civilians swarmed an aid convoy. Israel said most of those killed were trampled or run over. U.S. officials said President Joe Biden would announce that the U.S. military will construct a port on Gazas Mediterranean coast to receive humanitarian assistance by sea. While it would take weeks to set up, the port will make it possible to bring in the equivalent of hundreds of truckloads of aid, a White House official said. The U.S. Central Command and Royal Jordanian Air Force continued on Thursday with airdrops of food and other aid in the north of the enclave, where UN aid agencies say a large proportion of the population is on the brink of famine. Netanyahu vowed to press on with Israels offensive, including into Rafah. Whoever tells us not to act in Rafah is telling us to lose the war and that will not happen, he said. HAMAS CALLS FOR VISITS TO MOSQUE Health officials in Gaza said the number of people confirmed killed in Israels offensive had now passed 30,800. It reported 83 deaths in the past 24 hours and witnesses said the Israeli bombardments continued in Khan Younis, Rafah and areas in central Gaza. Hamas reiterated a call on Thursday for Palestinians in the West Bank, Jerusalem and inside Israel to step up visits to the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan to increase pressure on Israel to agree to demands for a ceasefire. Negotiators are pushing for an accord ahead of Ramadan partly due to concerns that the mosque complex in Jerusalem, the third holiest shrine in Islam, might become a flashpoint for violence during the fasting month. Israel has said it will allow a similar level of access to the site as in previous years, without providing figures. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 11:01 am",
        "content": "V Sriharan alias Murugan, key convict in former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case who was freed in 2022, has moved Indias Madras high court for permission to attend visa interview for travel to the United Kingdom, and also to visit Sri Lanka consulate in Chennai to process his travel documents. A division bench of justice M S Ramesh and Justice Sunder Mohan, before which the petition filed by S Nalini on behalf of her husband Sriharan came up for hearing on Thursday, however, told her counsel S Duraiswamy and V Elangovan that the bench could not hear the case as Justice Sunder Mohan had appeared for CBI in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The bench said it would refer the case to the chief justice, to be posted before another bench. In the petition, Nalini said Sriharan had come to Chennai in 1996 for his studies, and that after his conviction in the assassination case, he had completed 24 post-graduate, diploma and certificate courses, including MCA, in which he had scored 87 marks. Recalling the history of the assassination trial, conviction and release, Nalini said she was two months pregnant at the time of her arrest on June 14, 1991, three weeks after Rajiv Gandhis assassination, and that she gave birth to her daughter S Mehara in jail. The child lived with her for two years before being allowed to join Sriharans family in the UK in 2006. Noting that they spent 32 years in jail before their release in 2022, Nalini said it is 16 years since they last saw their daughter. Mehara completed her medical physics degree in the UK and has been working since 2019. Now the parents want to seek asylum in the UK and join their daughter there. In this regard, Nalini said families of at least three sisters and two brothers of Sriharan have got asylum in the UK and have been living there for decades. Now we want to live peacefully with our daughter, Nalini said. Nalini said she and Sriharan had applied for UK visa. Though she was able to attend the visa interview on Jan 30, 2024, Sriharan could not as state govt authorities and the Trichy collector as well as camp incharge of Foreigners Detention Centre in Trichy didnt allow him to travel outside the camp. When Nalini went to the Sri Lankan deputy high commission in Chennai with her counsel E Durai Vaiyapuri to get all-country passport for her husband, she was informed that Sri Lankan nationals could visit the office on any working day and that there was no separate of providing specific appointments. Yet, when Nalini requested the state authorities to allow Murugan to visit the Sri Lankan deputy high commission office with escort, there was no response. Refusal to allow Sriharan to visit the deputy high commission office amounts to illegal detention, Nalini said, adding that in the case of a released co-convict Robert Payas, the deputy high commission also e-mailed a response to Trichy collector on Feb 22, 2024, stating that any Sri Lankan can visit the office any time. She has now requested the court to direct the authorities concerned to enable Sriharan to appear before the Sri Lankan deputy commission in Chennai on any working day between 9.30am and 3.30pm with the required escort, to obtain an all-country passport, which will enable him to attend the visa interview for the UK visit. Ever since his premature release on Nov 11, 2022, after the Supreme Court order, Sriharan and three other Sri Lankans have been living in a special campus on the campus of the Trichy central prison. Of the four, only Santhan wanted to be sent back to Sri Lanka. He, however, fell ill and died on Feb 28. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 11:01 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has convened a meeting on Monday (March 11) with the leaders of accepted opposition parties in parliament and the visiting high-level delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). During the meeting, the opposition party leaders will be offered the chance to discuss the IMFs proposals with the delegates. In a proactive move, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, leader of the National Peoples Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader S. Sridharan have been invited to participate in these deliberations. The meeting is slated to be held at the Presidential Secretariat, with an open invitation extended to interested individuals to join alongside the invited leaders. The initiative stems from a recent request made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva in Parliament, prompting the President to extend a warm invitation to all recognized opposition parties to collaborate with the government in navigating the challenges posed by the IMF program. President Wickremesinghe has underscored the importance of successfully advancing the IMF program for the countrys reconstruction. To this end, he emphasized the necessity of collective accountability from all parties involved. Key figures set to participate in the discussions include Finance State Ministers Shehan Semasinghe and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Treasury Secretary and Finance Ministrys Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena and Presidents Senior Advisor on Economic Affairs Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga. A team led by IMFs Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer, is in Sri Lanka for the second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for the island nation. The review process kicked off on Thursday (March 07) with an opening meeting with President Wickremesinghe during which Mr. Breuer said the IMF program is exhibiting promising signs of efficacy, translating into tangible outcomes owing to the Sri Lankan authorities commitment to the program and its implementation. He further expressed his satisfaction at witnessing the economy starting to turn around, underscoring the significance of this progress. In response, President Wickremesinghe reiterated his governments steadfast commitment to sustaining the momentum and advancing the nations economic agenda. Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe told Ada Derana that the government aims to conclude a successful review by June and reach a staff-level agreement which will help unlock the third tranche of the global lenders bailout package of USD 2.9 billion. The IMF had previously said the second review of Sri Lankas bailout could be completed in the first half of 2024, provided it manages to meet debt restructuring and revenue targets set under the program. The IMF executive board cleared the first review of Sri Lankas bailout package in December 2023, providing approximately USD 337 million in funds as the second tranche to help tackle the fallout from the countrys worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lanka received the first tranche of the loan in March 2023 after the executive board approved the 48-month EFF program.",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 12:45 pm",
        "content": "The creator of Dragon Ball, one of the most influential and best-selling Japanese comics of all time, has died at 68. Akira Toriyama suffered an acute subdural hematoma, a type of bleeding near the brain, his studio said Friday. Dragon Ball is hugely popular around the world and the comic series has also spawned cartoon and film versions. Fans have paid tribute to Mr Toriyama for creating characters that have become a part of their childhood. The Dragon Ball comic series debuted in 1984. It follows a boy named Son Goku in his quest to collect magical dragon balls to defend Earth against alien humanoids called Saiyans. Mr Toriyama had uncompleted works at the time of his death. He died on 1 March and only his family and very few friends attended his funeral, according to a statement from the Dragon Ball website. He would have many more things to achieve. However, he has left many manga titles and works of art to this world, his studio said. We hope that Akira Toriyamas unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come, it added. Fans offered their sympathies on social media. Thank you for creating a manga that represents my youth. Rest in peace, thank you for your hard work, read a post on X, which instantly got 500 likes. Its too soon, its too sad, another Japanese X user wrote. His legacy will live on forever. Thank you for creating the most iconic anime character of all time Akira, another user wrote. Born in Nagoya, Japan in 1955, Mr Toriyama broke into the comic book world in the early 1980s with Dr. Slump, which tells the story of a little girl robot Arale and her scientist creator. But Dragon Ball was his most famous work. To many fans, Son Gokus journey from a kid who fumbles his martial arts training to a high-flying hero who can shoot bolts of electricity from his hands mirrors their own struggles against self-doubt as they grew into adulthood. Dragon Ball inspired fan fiction writers and cosplayers who style their hair like the characters sharp and pointed locks. The cartoon version has been dubbed in numerous languages and Dragon Ball action figures are a staple in toy stores from Japan to China and Southeast Asia. In a 2013 interview with a Japanese newspaper Asahi, Mr Toriyama said he had no idea how Dragon Ball became so popular around the world. He described the series as a miracle, given how it helped someone like me who has twisted, difficult personalities do a decent job and get accepted by society. When I was drawing the series, all I ever wanted to achieve was to please boys in Japan, he said, according to news agency AFP. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 01:20 pm",
        "content": "A former Google software engineer has been charged by the US with stealing trade secrets about artificial intelligence (AI) while secretly working for two Chinese companies. Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted in California on four charges and arrested on Wednesday. The Chinese national allegedly stole more than 500 confidential files. If convicted he faces up to 10 years in prison and 250,000 in fines on each count. A lawyer for Mr Ding could not be identified to comment on the case, local media reported. The information he is accused of taking relates to the infrastructure of Googles supercomputing data centres, which are used to host and train large AI models. According to the indictment, Mr Ding was hired by Google in 2019 and his responsibilities included developing this software. He allegedly began uploading information stored in Googles network to a personal Google account in May 2022. These uploads continued periodically for a year, the indictment reads. Meanwhile, he is said to have spent several months in China working for Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology - a start-up tech company that approached him. The indictment says he was offered 14,800 (11,620) per month to be the companys Chief Technology Officer. He is also alleged to have started his own tech firm, Shanghai Zhisuan Technology, which had a focus on AI and machine learning, and made himself the CEO. The BBC has contacted Rongshu, while Zhisuan could not be immediately reached for comment. Prosecutors allege Mr Ding never told Google about his work for either company. The indictment states that he applied to a China-based organisation to help develop this business and presented it at an investor conference in China in November 2023. The following month, he was flagged by Google trying to upload more files to his personal computer while in China, but Mr Ding told Googles investigator it was to provide proof that he worked for the tech giant. When he returned to the US and without Googles knowledge, Mr Ding is said to have booked a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Beijing, before resigning on 26 December. Days later, Google once again became suspicious after learning about his actions at the conference and suspended his access - searching his activity history to reveal the unauthorised uploads. Google spokesman José Castañeda said the company has strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets, adding that the company quickly alerted the authorities when it found evidence of alleged wrongdoing. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Wednesday that Linwei Ding was seeking to enrich himself by covertly working for companies that were seeking an edge in the AI technology race. The Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk, Mr Garland said. FBI Director Christopher Wray said Mr Dings alleged actions are the latest illustration of the lengths companies in China will go to, to steal American innovation. The US and China have been engaged in a bitter trade battle in recent years, with both sides attempting to gain a competitive edge over the other. The dispute has seen both countries impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of one anothers goods. Trade relations have worsened under the Biden administration, with the two sides imposing new barriers on trade, including restrictions on computer chip exports. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "US to set up temporary port on Gaza coast for aid delivery",
        "date": "March 8, 2024 02:47 pm",
        "content": "The US military will construct a port in Gaza to get more humanitarian aid into the territory by sea, President Joe Biden has announced. The temporary port will increase the amount of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians by hundreds of additional truckloads per day, officials say. However, Mr Biden said the initiative will not include US troops on the ground in Gaza. The UN warns that a quarter of the population is on the brink of famine. The president made the official announcement during his State of the Union address on Thursday. He said the port, which will be built by the US military, will involve a temporary pier to transport supplies from ships at sea to the shore. It is not clear who will build the causeway or secure the aid on land, meaning crucial questions about whether the operation can succeed remain unanswered. The port will take a number of weeks to set up, officials have said, and will be able to receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. Initial shipments will arrive via Cyprus, where Israeli security inspections will take place. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day, President Biden said. He added that Israel must do its part by allowing more aid to enter into the territory and to ensure that humanitarian workers arent caught in the crossfire. Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Israels military launched an air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamass attacks on Israel on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 30,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territorys Hamas-run health ministry says. The conflict has created a growing humanitarian crisis. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that children were dying of starvation in northern Gaza, where an estimated 300,000 Palestinians are living with little food or clean water. Gaza has no deep water port and so the US has for weeks been looking at ways to get shiploads of aid in urgently, while the administration has publicly ramped up its pressure and increasingly shown in public its impatience with Israel over the desperate situation on the ground. US officials told the BBCs US partner, CBS, that there are plans for the pier to be installed by an army unit called the 7th Transportation Brigade, based at Fort Story, Virginia. The brigade is designed for rapid deployment, but the military ships have not yet left the US, the officials said. Vice Adm Kevin Donegan, who was formerly Commander of the US Navys Fifth Fleet - the most senior US naval commander in the Middle East - told BBC Radio 4s World Tonight programme that the port plan was absolutely executable. However, he said delivering aid by land was still the most effective way, in terms of being able to get as many goods in as possible. Vice Adm Donegan also cautioned that having security and a good distribution network would be critical for the safe delivery of aid from the port, referencing the more than 100 people who were killed trying to reach an aid convoy. last week, amid the growing desperation. Palestinians said most were shot by Israeli troops. The Israeli military, which was overseeing the private aid deliveries, said most were killed in a stampede. Aid lorries have been entering the south of Gaza through the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing and the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom. But the north, which was the focus of the first phase of the Israeli ground offensive, has been largely cut off from assistance in recent months. On 20 February, the World Food Programme (WFP) said it was suspending food deliveries to northern Gaza because its first aid convoys in three weeks had endured complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order, including violent looting. The US and other nations have resorted to dropping aid in by air - but humanitarian organisations say that method is a last resort and cant meet the soaring need. An independent UN expert on Thursday accused Israel of mounting a starvation campaign against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The images of starvation in Gaza are unbearable and you are doing nothing, Michael Fakhri, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, said in a speech to the UN Human Rights Council. Yeela Cytrin, a legal adviser at the Israeli mission to the UN, said Israel utterly rejects allegations that it is using starvation as a tool of war, before walking out in protest. During his State of the Union address, President Biden also said that he was working nonstop to achieve an immediate six-week ceasefire - a deal he said would get the hostages home and ease the intolerable humanitarian crisis, and build toward something more enduring. A Hamas delegation left talks in Cairo without a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza, but the armed group says indirect negotiations with Israel are not over. It had been hoped that a 40-day truce could be in place for the start of the Islamic month of Ramadan next week. But Egyptian and Qatari mediators have struggled to seal a deal that would see Hamas free Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Gold prices hit record highs for a fourth consecutive session on Friday on growing speculations over June interest rate cuts ahead of key U.S. jobs data due later in the day. Spot gold rose 0.4 to 2,168.28 per ounce as of 1057 GMT, while U.S. gold futures added 0.5 to 2,175.50. Gold reached a new all-time high of 2,170.99 earlier in the session and has gained more than 4.1 so far this week, setting it on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October. I think a lot of the demand that weve seen coming from is really in the paper market. Its just speculative demand, said Michael Widmer, Bank of Americas head of Metals Research. You always had good support from Chinese buying and central bank buying. But that was never enough to take prices high. Gold first surpassed its December peak on Tuesday, primarily aided by growing indications of cooling price pressures and bullions traditional safe-haven cachet. The focus today is on the critical U.S. non-farm payroll data set to release at 1330 GMT, which will guide market direction in the near term. Low interest rates are gold supportive as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding bullion. The surge in gold prices could dampen consumption during the wedding season in India, but top buyer China will see robust safe-haven demand this year, analysts and traders said. I think an important metric for gold is the retail demand. Retail investors are waiting for the first rate cut to come to then take exposure of the market. If that happens, ETF demand will show up, said Widmer, adding that he targets 2,400 per ounce for gold this year. Spot silver rose 0.9 to 24.53, while platinum was up 0.1 to 920.25 per ounce, and palladium gained 1.5 to 1,048.76. All were set for weekly gains. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 08:10 pm",
        "content": "Canadas Barrhaven residents and members of Ottawas Sri Lankan community say they are struggling to process the horrific mass killing of four young children, their mother and a family acquaintance. Their bodies were found in their home in Barrhaven, about 15 kilometres south of Ottawas downtown core, on Wednesday night. Only the childrens father survived. He was injured in the attack with an edged weapon and was taken to hospital. We are all shocked, no doubt about that, said Bhante Suneetha, who met the family at a local Buddhist monastery, and described them as sweet and kind. In my life, I havent heard of such a tragic moment in our community. Into the night, dozens of residents moved by what happened streamed silently into a dark tree-lined park two blocks away from the townhouse. They lit candles and dropped off flowers and stuffed animals at a makeshift memorial. On Thursday, police said the family were newcomers to Canada from Sri Lanka. Dhanushka Wickramasinghe is the injured father. His wife, 35-year-old Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake, was killed along with the couples four young children  daughters Kelly, who was two months old; Rinyana, 2; and Ashwini, 4  and son Inuka, 7. Accused was living with family The body of another man, 40-year-old Gamini Amarakoon, was also found at the scene. Both he and the accused were living with the family, police said. Febrio De-Zoysa, 19, is now facing six first-degree murder charges and one count of attempted murder. He was arrested at the home. Nixsala Antony, who attended the informal memorial at the park near the crime scene, is from Sri Lanka but doesnt know the family. She said she was startled when she heard the news and still feels discomfort. They probably had a lot of hopes and dreams, Antony said. Its really sad. Family described as kind, innocent Suneetha, a resident monk and director of the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery on Heron Road, said the family came to his temple for events and helped out. They are innocent and also very helpful people. It doesnt matter who would ask for help from them. He visited the father, Dhanushka, at the hospital on Thursday morning. Part of one of Dhanushkas fingers was cut off and another finger was repaired with surgery, Suneetha said. He also has cuts on his face, chest and back. I cannot say hes doing well, but hes a little bit stronger than we thought, Suneetha said. Mentally, hes in great shock. Dhanushkas family had only been in Canada for about a year, according to Suneetha. Dhanushka arrived first in 2020 after completing his education and getting a work permit. Last year, Suneetha said, Ekanayake and their three children joined him. She was pregnant. A representative of Uber confirmed Dhanushka was a driver for them. Suneetha said Dhanushka had also opened a cleaning business. Hilal Ahmed, an accountant, said he was contacted by Dhanushka last month for bookkeeping services. Ahmed found Dhanushka to be very polite and accommodating. He called the situation tragic. What we know about the suspect De-Zoysa came to Canada from Sri Lanka as an international student, police said. On Thursday evening, Algonquin College president Claude Brulé confirmed De-Zoysa had been a student there. The teens last semester of attendance was the winter of 2023, Brulés statement said. Ottawa police chief Eric Stubbs said Thursday that an edged weapon was used in the homicides. De-Zoysa made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon. Hes due back in court on March 14. Vigil planned for Saturday morning Little kids  they didnt do anything for this, said Shanti Ramesh, who lives across the street from the townhouse where the killings happened. They come into the world to give something back and this happens? Its horrible. Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery said its raising donations for the victims families. A candlelight vigil is scheduled Saturday at 11 a.m. in Palmadeo Park, the same park where Thursdays makeshift memorial was set up. Funerals will be planned at a later date. It will take time for us to digest all this, Ramesh said. It will be there forever, actually. Source: CBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 10:40 pm",
        "content": "The Presidential Scholarship program proposed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe holds immense potential to provide crucial assistance to economically disadvantaged students, says State Minister for Education Aravindh Kumar. This initiative is geared towards supporting 100,000 students during the 20242025 academic year, he added. The state minister expressed confidence that this program would play a pivotal role in facilitating the successful completion of education for these students. Moreover, Kumar emphasized plans to establish 20 Zonal Education Offices as part of ongoing education reforms. These offices are envisioned to play a pivotal role in implementing future educational initiatives and ensuring the efficient administration of educational policies. He shared these views during the media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today. He also unveiled the governments intentions to implement a cluster education system by amalgamating multiple schools in a bid to further boost the quality of school education. Additionally, recruitment drives will be initiated to fill teacher and principal vacancies, ensuring adequate staffing and effective administration in schools. State Minister for Education Arvindh Kumar further commented: The Presidential Scholarship program proposed for 20242025 is a commendable initiative aimed at providing crucial support to economically disadvantaged school children to ensure the successful completion of their education. Spearheaded by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, this program underscores our governments commitment to addressing the economic challenges facing families and safeguarding childrens educational opportunities. We firmly believe that financial constraints should not hinder talented students from pursuing their education. Therefore, this scholarship program seeks to alleviate financial burdens and enable deserving students to continue their academic pursuits. In addition to addressing financial barriers, the government is dedicated to implementing comprehensive education reforms. One significant reform entails advancing the General Certificate of Education Advanced Level exam to Grade 12, preceding Grade 13, and advancing the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level exam, currently held in Grade 11, to Grade 10. This strategic move aims to expedite university entrance for students, enabling them to enter the workforce at a younger age upon graduation. Furthermore, we are poised to introduce a Pre-Grade program before Grade One, recognizing the cognitive abilities of todays children and their rapid learning potential. Moreover, as part of enhancing the education sector, we plan to increase the number of zonal education offices from around 100 to 120, facilitating better governance and oversight. To further elevate the quality of school education, we intend to implement a cluster education system by amalgamating multiple schools. Additionally, recruitment drives will be initiated to fill teacher and principal vacancies, ensuring adequate staffing and effective administration in schools. These comprehensive reforms underscore our unwavering commitment to nurturing a robust education system that empowers every child to realize their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society. --PMD",

        "date": "March 8, 2024 11:11 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (March 08) unveiled plans to introduce two significant bills aimed at advancing gender equality and women empowerment, with both slated for presentation to Parliament in May. Addressing the National Celebration of International Womens Day at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla, the President outlined the key provisions of these legislative initiatives. Under the proposed Womens Empowerment Act, the establishment of a separate commission is envisaged, he said further, adding that this commissions primary objective will be to facilitate the advancement and empowerment of women by implementing mechanisms to protect their rights, all by constitutional provisions. President Wickremesinghe noted that the draft of this bill was published in the Gazette on Thursday (March 07), marking a significant step towards its realization. He announced that a drafted bill focusing on gender equality, aimed at securing womens rights, would be published in the gazette in the upcoming week. This bill seeks to establish principles of gender equality across various sectors, including social, political, economic, cultural and technical policies, while also providing the necessary infrastructure to support these principles. He emphasized that these arrangements will be made through the proposed Act. Furthermore, the President pledged to establish a council on gender and social equality, vested with ministerial powers, to address issues related to gender and social equality effectively. Additionally, plans are underway to establish a centre at the ministerial level dedicated to resolving womens issues. To ensure comprehensive consultation and collaboration, President Wickremesinghe announced the assignment of the Womens MP caucus of Parliament to engage with various groups regarding these bills and to propose any necessary amendments. Highlighting the significance of these bills, President Wickremesinghe noted that they mark a historic milestone for the South Asian region. He also expressed his intent to implement gender budgeting in the future, further advancing gender equality and womens empowerment initiatives. The President expressed the governments commitment to implementing gender-based budgeting in the future and establishing women and children affairs units in every police station, with corresponding officer training. President Wickremesinghe stressed that womens rights should not be limited to rhetoric but should be supported by concrete laws and ordinances. He called for nationwide awareness on womens issues, stating that legislative efforts alone are insufficient without societal engagement. The theme of the 2024 International Womens Day celebration was Empowered Women- Prosperous Nation, with participation from womens organizations across the island. Minister of State for Women and Childrens Affairs Geetha Kumarasinghe presented guidelines for temporary womens care centres and the constitution of womens work organizations and womens power boards to the President. Symbolic donations were made to these centres, including three-wheelers, computers, printers, and scholarships for beauty courses. Additionally, the symbolic launch of loans under the Liya Saviya loan program, aimed at providing relief from microfinance loan burdens, took place. Certificates were also awarded to young women who completed the NVQ 3 Level caregiving service professional training course conducted by the Bolawalana Good Shepherd Convent under the Ministry of Women, Childrens Affairs, and Social Empowerment. Addressing the gathering President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented: In celebrating International Womens Day, the usual practice in our country is to hold a ceremony, discuss womens rights and return home. This routine occurs every year. However, this time, we have decided to implement concrete actions to amplify womens voices. Last year, during my meeting with the Womens Caucus in Parliament, I urged them to draft essential bills for womens rights. Among these initiatives, two significant bills have been prepared. The first is the Womens Empowerment Act, which aims to establish a separate commission dedicated to womens upliftment and empowerment, ensuring the protection of their rights in accordance with the Constitution. The responsibility of formulating a national policy will be entrusted to this commission by the relevant minister. The draft of this bill was published in the Gazette yesterday. Additionally, another critical bill, the Gender and Equality Bill, will be published in the Gazette next week. This legislation seeks to safeguard womens rights and promote gender equality across various sectors, including social, political, economic, cultural, and technical domains, while providing necessary support for their advancement. Plans are also underway to establish a Gender Equality Council with ministerial powers and to set up a gender centre, equipped to address issues at the ministerial level. With the implementation of these initiatives, we will establish two robust institutions dedicated to advancing womens rights. It is imperative that womens rights go beyond mere rhetoric; therefore, it is crucial to enact appropriate legislation, a task that has been neglected for far too long. Today, we are taking significant strides in this regard. I entrust the Womens Caucus in Parliament to engage in discussions with other stakeholders and propose any necessary amendments. Amendments must be notified following the new year period in April, and the bills are expected to be submitted to Parliament in May. Our efforts do not stop here. These bills mark a historic first in our region, setting a precedent for South Asia. Furthermore, we aim to introduce gender budgeting, a groundbreaking initiative that has only been implemented in a handful of countries, including Canada. We have already prepared the groundwork and intend to present the draft in consultation with the Secretary to the Treasury, an unprecedented move in Asia. During my tenure as Leader of the Opposition, I drafted a report on preventing violence against women. Although our plans to implement these measures in 2018 were disrupted by the short-lived government and the tragic Easter Sunday attacks, we remain committed to this cause. I will convene the Womens Caucus in Parliament to review these initiatives and address any necessary amendments. This marks the first step towards meaningful change for women in our country. Additionally, today, we are unveiling national guidelines for temporary womens care centres, further demonstrating our commitment to safeguarding womens rights and well-being. --PMD",

        "content": "At least 287 school children, some as young as eight years old, are being held by gunmen who raided their school in Nigerias northwestern Kaduna State early Thursday, a police spokesperson told CNN Friday. More than 300 students were taken early Thursday by the armed bandits on motorcycles who stormed the LEA Primary and Secondary School in the Kuriga village of Kadunas Chikun district, the states police spokesman Mansur Hassan said. Some of the students were rescued but 287 of them remain with the kidnappers, Hassan said. Students were kidnapped from the school premises on Thursday morning around 8:00 am (local time). About 287 students are still in the hands of the bandits, 100 from the primary side and 187 from the secondary school, Hassan said, adding that over 300 students were initially kidnapped, but some were rescued. Earlier, Reuters reported that 227 children were kidnapped, citing a teacher, local councilor, and parents of the missing children. Several other reports including the Washington Post and a local outlet report 287, citing the schools headteacher. CNN cannot independently verify these figures. Governor of Kaduna state, Uba Sani said in a statement Thursday that his government was doing everything possible to ensure the safe return of the pupils and students kidnapped. Sani also said a member of the community who confronted the abductors during the attack was killed, adding that the President of Nigeria and the National Security Adviser were aware of the situation, and a Security Committee and a military base will be established in Kuriga to strengthen security in the area. Kaduna state, which borders the Nigerian capital Abuja to the southwest, has grappled with recurring incidents of kidnappings for ransom by bandits and has witnessed several mass abductions in recent years, including in the district where LEA Primary and Secondary School is located. In 2021, at least at least 140 students were kidnapped by armed men from a private secondary school. The incident came just months after around 20 students from a private university in Chikuns Kasarami village were abducted by gunmen, five of whom were killed after a ransom deadline was not met, family members told CNN at the time. Amnesty Internationals Nigeria office condemned the kidnapping while urging authorities to take immediate measures to prevent attacks on schools, to protect childrens lives and their right to education.

Three crew members  two Filipino nationals and one Vietnamese  were killed in the missile attack on the Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier about 50 nautical miles off the port of Aden, setting it ablaze. These were the first civilian fatalities from the Yemeni groups campaign against the key shipping route. Reports confirmed that one of the rescued Sri Lankans had sustained injuries in the attack. Later, 20 crew members and the three armed guards who were aboard the attacked vessel were rescued by the Indian Navy and taken to a hospital in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa via an Indian warship. Images released by the Indian Navy showed a helicopter winching crew members from a small life raft in choppy seas and taking them to a naval ship. Some wounded were shown lying in the bottom of a navy lifeboat sent to assist. They were carried on stretchers onto the ship and were shown later with heavily bandaged limbs as they were evacuated to the Djibouti hospital.

        "title": "Details emerge on victims in Canada mass killing",
        "date": "March 9, 2024 11:31 am",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan father who survived the mass murder of his family in Canada said he returned home from work on Wednesday to find his wife and four young children had been killed. Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, 34, was also attacked but managed to subdue the suspect. He is now recovering in hospital from a slash to the eye and one of his hands. A 19-year-old Sri Lankan student who was living with the family was charged with the deaths. The new details of the night the Wickramasinghe family was killed emerged from a series of media interviews with Bhante Suneetha, the resident monk at a local Buddhist monastery in Ottawa that the family attended. Mr Suneetha, who visited the father in hospital on Thursday, said he is in great shock over what happened. Police in Ottawa discovered the slain family at their townhouse in the Barrhaven suburb after responding to emergency calls placed at around 22:52 local time (03:52 GMT) on Wednesday. Chief Eric Stubbs with the Ottawa Police Service said the calls came after a man, later determined to be Mr Wickramasinghe, yelled for neighbours to call for help. Responding officers then found the bodies of Mr Wickramasinghes wife, 35-year-old Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake, and their four young children: seven-year-old Inuka Wickramasinghe, four-year-old Ashwini Wickramasinghe, three-year-old Ranaya Wickramasinghe, and two-month-old Kelly Wickramasinghe. Police also found the body of 40-year-old Amarakoonmudiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, an acquaintance who was living with the family. The Wickramasinghe family were newcomers to Canada. Naradha Kodituwakku, the former president of the Sri Lanka Canada Association in Ottawa, told reporters that they had arrived last year. In an interview with CBC, Mr Suneetha described them as kind people who often lent a helping hand at the local temple. They are innocent and also very helpful people. It doesnt matter who would ask for help from them, he said. Febrio De-Zoysa, an international student from Sri Lanka, was arrested at the home without incident and has been charged in connection to the murders, which police said were carried out using a knife-like object. Algonquin College in Ottawa released a statement to the media on Thursday confirming that Mr De-Zoysa was enrolled at their college, and that his last semester of attendance was winter 2023. In a statement published on Facebook, the General Consulate of Sri Lanka in Toronto expressed its condolences to the family and friends of the victims. It also alerted parents of those who are studying abroad from Sri Lanka to pay more attention to their children during their transition and integration into a foreign country like Canada. Police did not specify a motive for the crime, saying the family were innocent victims, and that their investigation is ongoing. Mr De-Zoysa made his first court appearance in Ottawa on Thursday, where he was formally charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. A vigil will be held for the family on Saturday, and a GoFundMe launched for Mr Wickramasinghe by the Buddhist Congress of Canada has raised more than C53,000 (39,300; 30,500) as of Friday afternoon.

        "title": "Australias Great Barrier Reef hit by mass coral bleaching",
        "date": "March 9, 2024 01:20 pm",
        "content": "Australias Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a major coral bleaching event likely caused by heat stress built up over the summer at the biologically diverse site, a government agency has said. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), which monitors the reefs health, said on Friday that the damage was widespread in at least two-thirds of the areas surveyed at the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The reef, a living organism, stretches some 2,300km (1,429 miles) off the northeastern coast of Australia and is considered one of the most species-rich habitats on earth. It is home to hundreds of coral, 1,500 fish species and 4,000 different molluscs. Coral reefs are an important part of marine life as they house more than a quarter of all sea life on Earth, provide protection for coastal communities, and are natural carbon sinks. Climate change is the biggest threat to their survival because of their sensitivity to heat. Bleaching causes corals to lose the colourful algae living in their tissues, turning them white. Corals can survive a bleaching event although it can stunt their growth and affect reproduction. Prolonged, or intense heat could cause coral deaths. The results are consistent with what we have seen with above average sea surface temperatures across the Marine Park for an extended period of time, Roger Beeden, chief scientist at GBRMPA, said in a statement. While the areas aerial surveys are showing that the coral bleaching is extensive in the shallow water areas, we will need in-water surveys to confirm the severity of the coral bleaching and also what the depth range is. We know the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide is climate change. The Great Barrier Reef is no exception, environment minister Tanya Plibersek said in a statement. We need to act on climate change. We need to protect our special places and the plants and animals that call them home. The bleaching event is similar to reports on reefs around the world due to elevated sea surface temperatures primarily driven by climate change but amplified by the effects of the El Nino phenomenon, which usually results in warmer ocean waters, the agency added. Earlier this week, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the world was on the verge of a fourth mass coral bleaching event which could see wide swaths of tropical reefs die, including parts of the Great Barrier Reef. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said in a statement that the bleaching event, which is one of several in recent years, proved climate change was putting the reef under tremendous pressure. WWF is very concerned that this bleaching event is unfolding in an area where corals have not been previously exposed to these extreme temperatures. Unless we see a significant drop off in temperatures in the next few weeks, the risk of significant coral mortality is high, said Richard Leck, WWF-Australias head of oceans. The Great Barrier Reef saw mass bleaching events in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The United Nations cultural and scientific agency (UNESCO) has proposed to put the Great Barrier Reef on an endangered list but Australia has lobbied intensively to block that move for years. The reef is a major tourist attraction for the country, contributing about 6 billion Australian dollars (US4bn) to the economy, and providing 64,000 jobs. A UNESCO endangered listing could mean it loses this heritage status, and could make it less attractive to tourists. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

        "title": "War crime: UN deplores Israels settlement expansion in occupied Palestine territory",
        "date": "March 9, 2024 04:19 pm",
        "content": "UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk on Friday deplored Israels latest actions regarding the occupied West Bank, saying the drastic acceleration in settlement building is exacerbating long-standing patterns of oppression, violence and discrimination against Palestinians. Reports this week that Israel plans to build a further 3,476 settler homes in Maale Adumim, Efrat and Kedar fly in the face of international law, Türk said. In a report to the Human Rights Council, Türk said that the establishment and continuing expansion of settlements amount to the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into the territories that it occupies, which amounts to a war crime under international law. The size of existing Israeli settlements has expanded markedly, says the report which covers the period from 1 November 2022 to 31 October 2023. About 24,300 housing units within existing Israeli settlements in the West Bank were advanced during this period, the highest on record since monitoring began in 2017. This included approximately 9,670 units in East Jerusalem. The report finds that the policies of the current Israeli Government appear aligned, to an unprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate this occupied territory into the State of Israel. They also run counter to the views of a broad range of States laid out during hearings just two weeks ago at the International Court of Justice, the High Commissioner said, referring to the hearings examining the legal consequences of Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The establishment and continuing expansion of illegal Israeli settlements are occurring alongside the displacement of Palestinians through Israeli settler and state violence, as well as through forced evictions, non-issuance of building permits, home demolitions and movement restrictions for Palestinians. The West Bank is already in crisis. Yet, settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian State, Türk said. The report highlights the dramatic increase in the intensity, severity and regularity of Israeli settler and state violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, particularly since 7 October, 2023, which is accelerating Palestinians displacement from their land. Latest UN figures show that, since 7 October, there have been 603 settler attacks against Palestinians. A total of 1,222 Palestinians from 19 herding communities have been displaced as a direct result of settler violence. Since 7 October, the UN Human Rights Office has documented nine Palestinians killed by settlers using firearms. A further 396 have been killed by Israeli security forces, and two killed by either Israeli security forces or settlers. Since 7 October, 592 people, including 282 children, have been displaced in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, after their homes were demolished due to the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain. The report says that since 7 October, the UN Human Rights Office has documented dozens of cases of settlers wearing full or partial Israeli army uniforms and carrying army rifles, and harassing and attacking Palestinians. These developments have also further blurred the line between settler violence and state violence, including violence with the declared intent to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their land, it states. Israels actions against the Palestinian population must cease immediately. The only way forward is to find a viable political solution that finally ends the occupation, establishes an independent Palestinian state and guarantees the realization of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, said Türk. --OHCHR",

        "date": "March 9, 2024 05:57 pm",
        "content": "The total tax burden on sanitary napkins in Sri Lanka currently sits at 47.1, which is a significantly higher rate compared to the tax levied on selected non-essential items, gold jewellery, raw silk, golf clubs and golf balls and military artillery weapons, the PublicFinance.lk revealed. PublicFinance.lk, run by Verité Research, an independent think tank that provides strategic analysis for Asia in the areas of economics, politics, law, and media. Citing figures from Sri Lanka Customs, the PublicFinance.lk revealed that sanitary napkins are subjected to unreasonably high taxes in Sri Lanka, which amounts to 47.1 as opposed to 30.6 on gold jewellery, 22.3 raw silk, and 22.3 golf clubs, golf balls and military artillery weapons. Meanwhile, a recent survey has made an alarming revelation about period poverty in Sri Lanka. As per the study, 40 of menstruating women and girls in Sri Lanka have stopped using menstrual products against the backdrop of the ongoing economic crisis. Accordingly, in 2019, as many as 2.1 million Sri Lankan women aged between 15 and 47 years had not used menstrual products due to high prices. The study showed that this figure will likely see a sharp rise as the cost of living continues to soar due to the economic crisis.",

        "date": "March 9, 2024 06:28 pm",
        "content": "A sensational hat-trick by pace bowler Nuwan Thushara rattled Bangladesh top order as the hosts were handed a defeat of 28 runs by Sri Lanka in the third and decisive match of the three-match T20 series in Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Chasing a target of 175, Bangladesh found themselves reeling at 24 for 5 inside fourth over, courtesy of a fiery hat-trick by pacer Nuwan Thushara who was only playing his eight T20 match. If not for a spectacular rearguard charge by Rishad Hossain and Taskin Ahmed, Bangladeshs defeat was bound to be a massive one. Thushara sent shockwaves through the Bangladeshi camp as he rattled the stumps of both Najmul Hossain Shanto and Tawhid Hridoy in fourth over and his first. He then dismissed the seasoned Mahmudullah plumb in front of the wicket, leaving Bangladesh in complete disarray, and picking up his hat-trick as the fifth Sri Lankan bowler in the T20 format. Before Thushara came to the scene, Dhananjaya de Silva gave Sri Lanka the first breakthrough picking up opener Liton Das in the third over. Bangladesh lost the first wicket at 13 and soon became 15 for 4. Thushara, who got chance by the happenstance in the match due to Matheesha Pathiranas injury, continued his onslaught in the next over uprooting stumps of southpaw Soumya Sarkar who struck two boundaries off Binura Fernandos previous over. Bangladesh lost half the side at 24 and were staring at a massive defeat within powerplay. Failing to recover from the early blows, Bangladesh lost sixth wicket for 32 as Hasaranga got last matchs hero Jaker Ali for a struggling 13-ball 4. Rishad Hossain and Mahedi Hasan gave some solace to the home crowd adding 44 runs in the seventh wicket partnership but chasing the massive target had became too an uphill task by then. Rishad hit back to back sixes in the 11th over bowled by Hasaranga and again in the next over bowled by Maheesh Theekshana. Mahedi Hasan fell to a tossed up delivery of Hasaranga leaving Bangaldesh 76 for 7 in the fourteenth over. Mahedis departure could not deter Rishad as hit three massive sixes over cow corner in the fifteenth over bowled by Theekshana and brought 100 for Bangladesh. Rishad brought his fifty by hitting another massive six over deep square leg in sixteenth over bowled by Fernando. Rishads sensational cameo of 30-ball 53 came to an end in seventeenth over by Theekshana that left Bangladesh 117 for eight. Rishad hit 7 sixes, the most by any Bangladeshi batter in a T20 match. Taskin also played a cameo of 21-ball 31 before being out in the last over. In a day meek surrender by top order batters, the late order batters Rishad and Taskin showed some mettle to decrease the margin of defeat of Bangladesh. Earlier, Sri Lanka posted 174 for 7 as opener Kusal Mendis played a brilliant knock of 86. Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto won the toss for the third time on the trot and asked the visitors to bat. Taskin Ahmed give Bangladesh the first breakthrough in fourth over when Sri Lanka was in 18. Dhananjaya de Silva holed out in midwicket to Soumya Sarkar scoring 12-ball 8. Sri Lanka scored 41 for 1 in the powerplay. Kamindu Mendis top edged as Rishad Hossain deliveray as Shoriful took a nice catch in the long on in the eighth over leaving Sri Lanka at 54 for 2. Wanindu Hasaranga joined Kusal Mendis in third wicket. Mendis picked his second fifth in the series in balls but get dropped in backward point immediately afterwards. Mahmdullah Riyad dropped the a tough catch from a delivery by Soumya Sarker. Mustafiz, who conceded 18 runs in the tenth over, broke the third wicket partnership removing Hasaranga. This partnership brought 59 runs off 31 balls. Shoriful got Asalanka but Mendis was still dealing with flurry of boundaries threatening the hosts to post a challenging total on the board. As Bangladesh were desperately trying to get rid of Kusal Mendis with death over approaching, Taskin was the man to bring it again. Kusal Mendis holed out a bouncer and Soumya took an easy catch in midwicket. Kusal Mendis departed only after scoring 86 off 55 balls with the help of 6 boundaries and equal number of over boundaries. In the next over, Rishad Hossain removed experienced campaigner Angelo Mathews after he played 7-ball 10. Dasun Shanaka and Sadeera Samarawickrama added 22 runs from 13 balls in the seventh wicket partnership to take their team to 174 in 20 over. Shanaka was run out in the ball after 8-ball 18, thanks to an excellent behind-the-back flick from wicketkeeper Liton Das. --Agencies",

        "date": "March 9, 2024 07:32 pm",
        "content": "The man who died alongside five members of a family in a mass killing in Ottawas Barrhaven neighbourhood on Wednesday is said to have been supporting his own family in Sri Lanka. Gamini Amarakoon, an acquaintance of the Wickramasinghe family, was living with them when he, along with the mother of the family and her four children, were killed. Their bodies were found by police inside a townhouse the family was renting on Berrigan Drive near Palmadeo Drive in the capitals southern suburbs, after the police received 911 calls to the home late on Wednesday night. Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, the father of the family, was the sole survivor of the attack. The family were newcomers from Sri Lanka, from which Amarakoon had arrived even more recently, according to Anzul Jhan, the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commissioner. Jhan said Amarakoon was the only member of his family in Canada, on a work permit, and that he was supporting his wife, two children, mother and a sister who are still living in Sri Lanka. So that is very tragic news for them, Jhan told CBC News. Naradha Kodituwakku, a community leader at the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery, where the Wickramasinghe family were members, said he believed Amarakoon had moved to Canada two months ago. Obviously there is a family that is torn there too, he said. He said the temple and High Commission are both working to support Amarakoons family in Sri Lanka. The familys father, Dhanushka Wickramasing, moved to Canada in 2020 after completing his education and getting a work permit, according to Bhante Suneetha, a resident monk and director of the monastery. Suneetha said the mother, 35-year-old Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake, and three of the children, moved to Canada last year while she was pregnant with her fourth child. She and the children  daughters Kelly, who was two months old; Ranaya, 3; and Ashwini, 4, and son Inuka, 7  were all killed on Wednesday. Suneetha said the family came to his temple for events and helped out. They are innocent and also very helpful people. It doesnt matter who would ask for help from them. Jhan said the High Commission has been working with leaders from the temple to contact family members of the victims. This is something we never expected as a community to happen. It was so sudden, Jhan said. Within moments, one persons whole family was gone. Jhan said the family of the suspect, Febrio De-Zoysa, had not yet come forward, but that she hopes they will get in touch so the High Commission can offer proper consular services. De-Zoysa, 19, came to Canada from Sri Lanka as an international student, according to police. He was arrested at the scene and is facing six first-degree murder charges and one count of attempted murder. He was also living in the home. Algonquin College president Claude Brulé said Thursday De-Zoysa had been a student there, and that he was last enrolled at the school in the winter semester of 2023. Harpreet Chhabra, the owner of the home the Wickramasinghe family was renting, told CBC News they had moved in in June or July 2023. Chhabra said he was at the Montreal airport on his way to Mexico for a family vacation when he got a call from the police early Thursday morning informing him of the tragedy. I was shocked. I dont know how to put this in words, Chhabra told CBC News. Youre never prepared for these kinds of calls. Chhabra said he met the father once, when there was an issue with the house, but had never met the mother or children. He added that, until Thursday, he was unaware that other people were also living in the house. Although his contact with the family was minimal, he spoke highly of the fathers character, describing him as soft-spoken and respectful. He was a great father. Thats my personal perception. A candlelight vigil was scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m. in Barrhavens Palmadeo Park. Source: CBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Irish voters reject constitutional amendment about womens role in home",
        "date": "March 9, 2024 10:26 pm",
        "content": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded defeat Saturday as two constitutional amendments he supported that would have broadened the definition of family and removed language about a womans role at home were headed toward rejection in early vote tallies. Varadkar, who pushed the vote to enshrine gender equality in the constitution by removing very old-fashioned language and trying to recognize the realities of modern family life, said it was clear the amendments were defeated comprehensively on a respectable turnout. It was our responsibility to convince the majority of people to vote yes and we clearly failed to do so, Varadkar said. Opponents argued that the wording of the changes was poorly thought out  an argument that appeared to have gained traction in the final days of the campaign. Voters said they were confused by the questions and others said they feared changes would lead to unintended consequences. The election was viewed as part of Irelands evolution from a conservative, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country in which divorce and abortion were illegal, to an increasingly diverse and socially liberal society. The proportion of residents who are Catholic fell from 94.9 in 1961 to 69 in 2022, according to the Central Statistics Office. The social transformation has been reflected in a series of changes to Irelands Constitution, which dates from 1937, though the country was not formally known as the Republic of Ireland until 1949. Irish voters legalized divorce in a 1995 referendum, backed same-sex marriage in a 2015 vote and repealed a ban on abortions in 2018. The first question dealt with a part of the constitution that pledges to protect the family as the primary unit of society. Voters were asked to remove a reference to marriage as the basis on which the family is founded and replace it with a clause that said families can be founded on marriage or on other durable relationships. If passed, it would have been the constitutions 39th amendment. A proposed 40th amendment would have removed a reference that a womans place in the home offered a common good that could not be provided by the state and delete a statement that said mothers shouldnt be obligated to work out of economic necessity if it would neglect their duties at home. It would have added a clause saying the state will strive to support the provision of care by members of a family to one another. The debate was less charged than the arguments over abortion and gay marriage. Irelands main political parties all supported the changes, including centrist government coalition partners Fianna Fail and Fine Gael and the biggest opposition party, Sinn Fein. One political party that called for no votes was Aontú, a traditionalist group that split from Sinn Fein over the larger partys backing for legal abortion. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said the governments wording was so vague it will lead to legal wrangles and most people do not know what the meaning of a durable relationship is. The Free Legal Advice Centers, a legal charity, expressed concern the change to the section on care contained harmful stereotypes such as the concept that the provision of care  is the private responsibility of unpaid family members without any guarantee of state support. Some disability rights campaigners argued the emphasis on care treats disabled people as a burden, rather than as individuals with rights that should be guaranteed by the state. Opinion polls had suggested support for the yes side on both votes, but many voters remained undecided as Fridays polling  held on International Womens Day  neared and some said they found the issue too confusing or too hurried to change the constitution. I thought it was too rushed, said Una Ui Dhuinn, a nurse in Dublin. I felt we didnt get enough time to think about it and read up on it. So I felt, to be on the safe side, no, no  no change. Caoimhe Doyle, a doctoral student, said she voted yes to changing the definition of family but no to the care amendment because I dont think it was explained very well. Theres a worry there that theyre removing the burden on the state to take care of families, she said. Source: AP --Agencies",

Mourners gathered under rainy skies in Palmadeo Park in Barrhaven, the suburb where a young mother, her four children and a family friend all died on Wednesday night. A 19-year-old Sri Lankan national who was living with the victims at the time is facing murder charges in their deaths. Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe, Police Chief Eric Stubbs and the Sri Lankan High Commissioner were among the dozens of people who attended the sombre gathering, which included a presentation of flowers and prayers. Those in misery, be free from misery, said Bhante Suneetha, a resident monk at Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery where the family worshipped. Flowers, toys, notes and candles piled up in a gazebo over which six balloons flew bearing the victims names: 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake, her seven-year-old son Inuka Wickramasinghe, her daughters four-year-old Ashwini, three-year-old Ranyana and two-and-a-half-month-old Kelly, and family friend Ge Gamini Amarakoon, 40. Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, the childrens father, was the sole survivor and is in hospital recovering from injuries allegedly sustained in a struggle with the suspect, who came to Canada as an international student and was living with the family at the time of the killings. Community leaders at Sundays vigil said members of the Sri Lankan diaspora have been grieving the tragedy across the country, noting how unusual it is for something like this to occur in their community. Naradha Kodithuwakku, director of the Buddhist Congress of Canada who spoke on behalf of the community, thanked first responders, elected officials and other organizations that have reached out in support of the family. He said Dhanushka Wickramasinghe was still in shock during a hospital visit on Friday. But the bereaved father is drawing strength from the outpouring of support, Kodithuwakku said. He sees that people are behind him. And just so I think, a gathering like this only (makes) him stronger, Kodithuwakku said. He said Wickramasinghe authorized the local temple to arrange a funeral after autopsies on the victims are completed. Anzul Jhan, deputy high commissioner at the Sri Lanka High Commission in Ottawa, says family members are expected to fly in from Sri Lanka for the funeral. Amarakoons relatives have asked for his body to be sent back to Sri Lanka. Chandra Hapuarachchi, who works for the Buddhist Congress of Canada and helped organize Sundays gathering, expressed her appreciation for the support coming from people outside of the Sri Lankan community. It didnt just affect just Sri Lankans, she said. Source: The Canadian Press --Agencies",

        "date": "March 10, 2024 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and a landslide on Indonesias Sumatra island, killing at least 19 people and leaving seven others missing, officials said Sunday. Tons of mud, rocks and uprooted trees rolled down a mountain late Friday, reaching a river that burst its banks and tore through mountainside villages in Pesisir Selatan district of West Sumatra province, said Doni Yusrizal, who heads the local disaster management agency. Rescuers by Saturday pulled out seven bodies in the worst-hit village of Koto XI Tarusan, and recovered three others in two neighboring villages, Yusrizal said. Rescuers retrieved six bodies in Pesisir Selatan and three more in the neighboring district of Padang Pariaman, bringing the death toll to 19, the National Disaster Management Agency said on Sunday. The agency in a statement said at least two villagers were injured by the flash flood and rescuers are searching for seven people who are reportedly still missing. It said more than 80,000 people had fled to temporary government shelters after the flood and landslide buried 14 houses, while 20,000 houses were flooded up to the roof in nine districts and cities in West Sumatra province. Relief efforts for the dead and missing were hampered by power outages, blocked roads covered in thick mud and debris, Yusrizal said. Heavy rains cause frequent landslides and flash floods in Indonesia, where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near floodplains. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "title": "New Secured Transactions Registry established to help expand financing for SMEs",
        "date": "March 10, 2024 02:49 pm",
        "content": "A new Secured Transactions Registry (STR) has been established to facilitate the use of moveable assets as collateral for loans for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka while ensuring financial stability and fostering economic growth in the country. The STR was established by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), together with the Finance Ministry and the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) and with technical assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Accordingly, the new Secured Transactions Registry Act aims to address legal and operational challenges in the existing law. SMEs comprise more than 75 of enterprises while accounting for 45 of employment and 52 of the countrys GDP. Yet, they cite access to finance as one of the key obstacles, hindering their growth potential. Against this backdrop, a robust legal framework to register security interests over movables assets will help unlock the full potential of small businesses in Sri Lanka through easier access to loans. The enactment of the new law and consequential amendments to 7 related laws is a critical step in developing a fully-fledged secured transaction framework to mortgage moveable assets in Sri Lanka that protects the rights of all types of regulated financial institutions, encouraging them to provide financing secured by moveable collateral, said Pushpike Jayasundera, DirectorGeneral Manager of CRIB. Globally, businesses are restricted from using movable collateral such as machinery, inventory, accounts receivables, crops, and equipment to obtain financing because many countries do not have functioning laws and registries to govern secured transactions. However, STRs can also encourage women to start or expand a business, as they are more likely to have movable assets to pledge. An effective credit infrastructure is key to strengthening Sri Lankas financial sector. IFC assisted CRIB in drafting the new law, which incorporated several rounds of consultations and expert input, thus ensuring that small businesses and entrepreneurs with few fixed assets can obtain the financing they need to thrive. We greatly appreciate the perseverance and commitment of all the stakeholders to see this legislation come to fruition, said Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa, IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives. IFCs efforts to improve access to finance and foster inclusion in Sri Lanka span across several initiatives. Apart from supporting secured transactions regimes, the IFC helped the Central Bank of Sri Lanka launch the countrys first national financial inclusion strategy and develop a financial literacy roadmap, strengthening financial consumer protection and increasing the uptake of digital finance. The IFC, a member of the World Bank, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. They work in over 100 countries, using their capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. For the 2023 fiscal year, the IFC committed a record USD 43.7 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of global compounding crises.",

        "date": "March 10, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Eight persons have been arrested for acting against a judgment delivered by the Vavuniya Magistrates Court by trespassing into the Vedukkunarimalai archaeological site in Nedunkerny. Accordingly, 8 persons, including the chief priest of the Hindu temple at the archaeological site in question were arrested for allegedly conducting a religious ritual for Mahashivarathri on 08 March, despite a court order being issued previously rejecting a request to do so. On 04 March, the Vavuniya Magistrates Court delivered a judgment stating that permission cannot be granted to conduct a special religious ceremony, despite a group of people, including the arrested chief priest, having filed a motion requesting to do so for a special Mahashivarathri ritual. Subsequently, upon consideration of a request made by the Acting Director of Archaeology from the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) in charge of the Northern Province, a team of police officers were deployed to the Vedukkunarimalai archaeological site on 08 March. Despite these measures, however, police stated that nearly 500 people had visited the site and performed religious ceremonies during the daytime on 08 March, while a group of 40 persons, including the chief priest, had arrived later that night and taken steps to conduct a special Mahashivarathri ritual, and had set up bonfire and improvised hearths. Police stated that despite being informed by the police officers on duty not to do so, the eight arrestees had proceeded without taking heed of such instructions. The suspects, aged 24, 29, 30, 34, 37, and 54, and identified as residents of Nedunkerny, Pulyankulam, Kanagarayankulam and Mamaduwa, were subsequently arrested for violating a court order, and for proceeding with their rituals without the permission of either the Archaeology Department or the Forest Department. Police also stated that the group had not considered the possibility of causing great damage to the forest as a result of the fires that could have spread across the forest reserve during the prevailing dry weather conditions. As such, further investigations are being carried out by Nedunkerny Police.",
